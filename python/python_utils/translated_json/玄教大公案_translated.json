  "full_translation": "**The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings**\n*Scripture Title:* The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings\nCompiled by Miao Shanshi (courtesy name Taisu) of the Yuan Dynasty, edited by his disciple Wang Zhidao. Two fascicles.\n*Source Text:* Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Four Prefaces to The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings**\n\nThe transmission of the Daoist lineage extends far into antiquity. At the beginning, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Chaos, through the subtleties of the Image-Prior, forcibly named it the *Dao/Way* and established teachings to assist it with *virtue/power*, as recorded in the Five Thousand Words. Yet the essence beyond words—subtle, wondrous, and profoundly interconnected—remains inexpressible, unfathomable, and can only be forcibly described.\n\nFrom the *Virtue/Power* received by Guan Yinzi, his ten disciples each grasped its mysteries. Thinkers like Liezi and Zhuangzi, along with immortals such as Anqisheng, Li Xianqing, and Master Ge the Immortal, transmitted it in succession, each with their own scriptures. Though branches diverged and schools flourished, generations of adepts never lacked in grotto-heavens and blessed lands.\n\nSince the Zhou and Han dynasties, only Yinzi inherited the ancestral seat. The Golden Portal Emperor then succeeded the lineage, transmitting it to the Eastern Florescence Emperor, who passed it to Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang. Zhongli transmitted it to Immortal Lü of Pure Yang, who passed it to Immortal Liu Haichan. Liu transmitted it southward to Zhang Ziyang. The Five Ancestors—Ziyang in the north—transmitted it to Wang Chongyang and the Seven Perfected, splitting the lineage into two streams.\n\nOnly Master Li Qing’an, receiving transmission from Wang Jinchan, disciple of the White Immortal Yu Chan, became a patriarch of the Mysterious Gate, inheriting the orthodox transmission of the lineage to illuminate truth. Many of his collected works circulate in the world.\n\nMaster Miao Taisu studied under him, imprinting the essentials upon his heart—truly, the indigo blue surpasses the plant. Embracing this Dao, he modeled his teachings on the mind-methods of the ancestral lineage, distilling the pivotal mysteries from various scriptures. Ascending the hall and entering the chamber, he extracted their essentials, adding a turn of phrase to the ancestral words and composing verses on them. Arranged by the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, with three additional cases for the Three Ultimates, his disciples, led by Wang Cheng’an, compiled and titled it *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.\n\nEvery word clarifies the root; every sentence returns to the source. Essence and function unite in the One Real; the Three Teachings merge in perfect harmony. It enables one to roam freely beyond Fuxi’s trigrams, to swim in the realm of the Mysterious Sage and the Image-Prior—how sublime!\n\nThe Recluse of Huayang, Tang Gong, donated funds to carve the woodblocks and disseminate it widely. His intent is truly magnanimous.\n\nIf there are resolute seekers who, beyond these *Great Cases*, possess the eye of the Infinite, piercing through every barrier to achieve sudden clarity and sixfold penetration, then the Daoist lineage will shine brightly, transmitted without end—would this not be splendid?\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Ke Daochong, the Profoundly Silent Daoist of Jinling.\n\n---\n\nThe Heart of the Infinite Heaven embraces all methods; the wisdom-eye of the Image-Prior illumines boundlessly. When nature is utterly empty, the six penetrations and eight directions open; when the mind’s clouds obscure, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions arise. Thus, to open the eye beyond heaven, one must first clarify the mind of the world.\n\nIn my youth, I studied Confucian learning; in adulthood, I admired the Mysterious Wind. I delved into the origin of principle and investigated the wonders of the heavenly Dao, seeking ever farther and probing ever deeper—yet truly, it seemed unattainable.\n\nBy what fortune in a past life did I arrive at the Central Harmony and, in due time, receive the teachings of Master Taisu? His instructions dissolved my burdens, purifying my mind to return to the origin and restore the root. My spirit congealed, my *qi* settled, and I found peace in destiny and joy in heaven. His guidance was earnest and multifaceted, his transformation gentle and thorough.\n\nOne day, the foremost disciple of the Central Harmony presented me with the Master’s teachings—ascending the hall and entering the chamber, expounding the treasures of the Dharma-sea, and the poetic verses of the mind-methods of the Daoist lineage—entitled *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.\n\nIn quiet contemplation, I savored its words and saw how it dissects the One Origin and severs the myriad methods, shaking out the marrow of the host of immortals and threading through the hearts of the ancestral lineage. It sharpens the sword of wisdom, hones the blade of spirit, slays the Three Corpses, executes the Six Thieves, unbinds fetters, shatters shackles, tears through the net of doubt, and severs the hindrance of afflictions. It revives the dead, saves the living, guides the enlightened, and penetrates the great function and great mechanism, reaching the ultimate subtlety and supreme mystery—roaming in the unbegun, delighting in the birthless.\n\nIts wonders of principle and heavenly Dao, its mechanisms of illuminating the mind and seeing nature, are perfectly merged within, each made clear. Having attained such thorough comprehension, how could it remain unheard?\n\nYet this is but the residue of the Master’s teachings. Having tasted its benefits, I joyfully commissioned artisans to carve the woodblocks, that all men of fortune and wisdom in the world might, through this text, gain a single eye, force open the barriers, shatter the Great Void, return to the original wholeness, revert to pure simplicity, and wander boundlessly in the Infinite, whistling and carefree in the Prior Heaven. This is my sincere wish.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Tang Daolin, the Recluse of Nine Bends of Green Creek in Jinling.\n\n---\n\nThe sagely immortal Dao embodies the Mystery of the Prior Heaven, its function wondrously manifesting in the myriad methods. Through sincerity and quiescence, it secretly secures the root; through humility, reverence, harmony, and compliance, it beautifully benefits the world.\n\nMaster Taisu’s *Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings* fully reveals essence and function, perfects cultivation and practice, merges the One Real into the wondrous, and unites the myriad principles in returning to the origin. It enables one to nurture primordial *qi*, fuse with the harmonious wisdom-life, still the root-nature, and pacify the mind of the Dao—how magnificent!\n\nHow could it be compared to those who fret over silent emptiness, lacking the blade’s edge, or merely chant a tune of heterodox teachings?\n\nI once heard that the Master supplemented the *Yichuan’s Commentary on the Book of Changes*, completing its three unfinished parts. Silently astonished, I exclaimed: Master Yichuan was one of the Six Masters of the former lineage—yet even he left things unfinished. Now Master Taisu has supplemented them. What manner of man is he? I regretted not being able to meet him at once.\n\nBy chance, I was appointed to a post at the Southern Terrace. In my leisure, I visited the Central Harmony with three or five colleagues.\n\nUpon first meeting the Master, I found him serene, tranquil, and as unperturbed as still water. When I respectfully sought his instruction, his bearing was gracious and expansive—each question met with an answer precise, lucid, and illuminating, leaving one’s mind suddenly clear and unbounded. I was further granted the privilege of examining his supplementary annotations to the unfinished portions of the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, as well as his *Net of Changes for Resolving Doubts*. Truly, his words were concise yet principle ran through them like a thread; pure, refined, and luminous, they dissolved in an instant the doubts that had accumulated over years of study. Take, for instance, the very first case of *The Great Public Cases*: it dissects with perfect clarity the subtle pivots of the Three Teachings, the central and upright essence and function, and the partial, obstinate views—all laid bare. He cites the classics throughout, each matter and principle, each mystery and wonder, as if gazing into a mirror where coarse and fine are reflected in perfect roundness. He speaks of the three bodies merging at the ultimate, the six desires sinking into emptiness, the return to the origin through extreme stillness, and the embodiment of the Dao in movement and repose. He teaches that one nurtures one’s heavenly nature with boundless compassion, the mind of the Dao with frugality and restraint, and profound virtue with humility and yielding. He expounds on the five poisonous *qi* in daily sounds and the ten forms of steadfast illness. He lifts the *Gen* trigram of Mount Jian to illuminate the true work of stillness, and inscribes the *Li* trigram of the setting sun to reveal the illusory nature of life and death. The marvels drawn before the hexagrams, the profound mysteries beyond the images, wielding the sacred sword of Fuxi, he cleaves open the mysterious gates of the sages, manifesting the primordial pearl of Yuanshi to illuminate the celestial valleys of the immortals. Such insights were never before articulated by the Daoist and Confucian masters of past generations. Indeed, his wisdom transcends ancient and modern, merging beginning and end in the profound—who but one of the highest primordial clarity could achieve this? As the Sage declared: *\"He who acts before Heaven does not contravene it.\"* How true!\n\nHow could I not pay him the reverence due a teacher? Here, I briefly recount the Master’s virtue and its manifestations, his deeds and principles—his marvelous teachings that precede even the words of the primordial. The full embodiment of this lies in the subtle, unbroken practice of those whose wisdom and resolve are aligned.\n\nFrom the Acting Surveillance Commissioner of the Branch Secretariat, Wang Zhujing, with bowed head, this preface.\n\nTrue gold fears not the fire; the more it is tempered, the brighter it shines. Flawless jade, free of the slightest blemish, becomes a treasure through careful polishing. But rotten wood and weary iron—even the hands of a master craftsman cannot shape them. Thus, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* said: *\"One with the talent of a sage who receives the Dao of a sage finds it easy. But how many are those who are born knowing?\"* Yet even those with innate roots of wisdom, whose understanding pierces all and fuses ten thousand things, still depend on the guidance of an enlightened teacher to ascend directly to the highest realm.\n\nWe, however, are of shallow fortune and dull roots, our karmic force ever overpowering our Dao-force. To claim we might leap directly to sudden enlightenment would be self-deception. But if we submit to the Master’s forging and polishing, proceeding from sincerity to clarity, from emptiness to penetration, from discipline to wisdom—step by step treading solid ground, heart by heart embodying the great void—then over time, the turbid will settle undisturbed, and what is fragile will not shatter. Naturally, we will become pure, firm, and unyielding. Is this not the greatest beauty?\n\nOur Master, Shifan the Immortal Boat of the True Hermitage, stands lofty in the realm beyond form, his teachings flourishing at the center of all things. He elucidates the profound mysteries of the Supreme’s heart, dissects the marrow of Fuxi’s legacy, overturns the Three Teachings to fuse them into one origin, sweeps away heterodox sects, and opens wide the true Dao. He carves and refines later students, establishing the great foundation of the lineage, refining the exalted and luminous to reach the primordial境. Thus, good friends and radiant companions gather like clouds, while enlightened lords and worthy ministers follow like the wind. Those who come in emptiness depart in fullness—truly, his silence is more trustworthy than speech. Those near are delighted; those afar come—all accomplish without striving.\n\nWe now see that words never spoken expand the myriad wonders beyond the reach of thought and discourse. The *\"Dao that can be spoken\"* is not the eternal Dao; it encompasses all virtues and stands alone before the throne of the Emperor of Images. Who but one of the utmost clarity, penetrating the ultimate transformation, could partake in this?\n\nDaily, I attend the Hall of the Profound, fortunate to be moistened by the rain of his dharma. I have collected the pearls and jades of his ascending the hall, the treasures of his entering the chamber. Yet though the teachings branch in many directions, their principles converge at one ultimate point. The unresolved cases left by the sages and immortals of past ages—our Master has decisively and clearly settled them all. He has titled this work *The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching*, arranging it into sixty-four cases to correspond with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*. The three cases for entering the chamber mirror the Three Ultimates. Truly, for those of resolute spirit who directly undertake the forging and refining, who inwardly comprehend and diligently practice—dissolving the allure of sound and form, deepening insight into emotion, polishing the heavenly heart, and opening the eye of the Dao—they will suddenly transcend birth and death, illuminating past and present. The great function and the great mechanism are both fully present here. What boundless joy could surpass this?\n\nIf one can truly be thus, one will not have failed the Master’s earnest teachings, nor squandered this once-in-a-millennium encounter. Though I am but one man steering the ferryboat of this transmission...\n\nIn the year *Taiding Jiazi*, his disciple, Cheng’an Wang Zhidao, with bowed head, respectfully writes this preface.\n\n**The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching, Volume One**\nBy Master Golden Lotus of the Dao, Shian the True Hermitage (Miao Taisu)\nCompiled by his disciple Cheng’an Wang Zhidao\n\n**Ascending the Hall to Illuminate the Ancient: Sixty-Four Cases**\n**First Case**\n\nThe *Supreme Dao and Its Virtue in the True Classic* states: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\" These two lines alone sweep away all dharmas of the Three Teachings—being and non-being, sound and form—enabling the seeker to silently and inwardly grasp them beyond movement and stillness, speech and silence.\n\nThus, the Dao is neither form nor appearance, neither color nor emptiness; it fully manifests in all things, inherently possessed by all people. It is the great image before heaven and earth began, the supreme spirit before father and mother were born—unattainable by thought, ungraspable by words. For it has no fixed form to discard, and the mind’s wonder has no direction. Only the Dao that cannot be spoken is the true and constant wondrous Dao; only the name that cannot be named is the original, forced designation.\n\nIf one clings to what can be named, one falls into external paths; if one clings to what can be spoken, one strays into heterodoxy. Disciples, since the Dao cannot be named or attained, how then is it to be realized? Truly, truly.\n\n*Verse:*\nForced to name it \"Dao,\" like chewing rice to feed a child.\nClinging to words or thoughts, groping walls for fences.\nSinking into emptiness or stagnating in stillness, straying into side paths.\nBending or stretching with intent, clinging to dharmas and rules.\nSpeaking ceaselessly or sitting in silence, ever-watchful yet deluded.\nObserving the mind to turn things—self-obstructed, dull and foolish.\nIndulging in \"nothingness,\" drifting in boundless ignorance.\nAbandoning knowledge and inner awareness, dragging through mud and water.\nSwift with wit, brandishing the whisk or striking the gavel.\nSilent or shouting, winking or raising brows.\nPreaching as emotions arise, doubting as events unfold.\nSpirit and soul in turmoil, consciousness playing tricks.\nBoasting grand words, the root and branches scattered.\nTo call such learning \"Dao\" is to fall, unwitting, into fox-like delusion.\nBetter to be pure and simple, sincere and still, subtle and quiet.\nIn the vastness of the indistinct, the body is one—\nthe original face before birth, majestic and towering.\nTruly realizing the meaning of \"not-spiritual\" as spiritual,\none overturns the gates of all wonders, delighting in the mysterious and unseen.\n\n**Second Case**\n\nThe Supreme Lord says: \"The sage engages in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\" It also says: \"Act through non-action.\" And further: \"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone.\" Profound indeed! With spiritual insight and intuitive understanding, the Way is present at a glance. Towering beyond the realm of images and emperors, transcending the bounds of form and body—this is the subtlety of the wordless.\n\nWhat is called \"non-action\" is not a wooden or clay dummy, which, when pushed, does not move; when called, does not come; when pressed, remains inert—a mere lump of matter. Rather, it treasures that single spark of numinous clarity, perfectly round and undifferentiated, lively and free. Without intention, it acts; now still, now moving, aiding the spontaneity of the myriad things. Thus it is said: \"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone.\"\n\nYet who is it that acts through non-action? Ah!\n\nIn verse:\nThe subtlety of the wordless,\nthe benefit of non-action.\nSilent yet potent in influence,\nnone under heaven can match.\nIt penetrates the myriad principles,\nmerging into the Great One.\nWhere does the One return?\nTo the undifferentiated and boundless.\nWithin the boundless, the sovereign abides,\nceaselessly generating and transforming.\nGeneration without generation,\ncontinuous and unbroken.\nIn the motionless, the alchemy of purple gold refines;\nin the realm of non-action, jade disks are forged.\nAlas! Beware of misapprehension.\n\n**Third Case**\n\nThe Supreme Lord says:\n\"The Valley Spirit never dies—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gateway of the Mysterious Female\nis called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle, it seems to endure;\ndrawn upon, it is never exhausted.\"\n\nThis passage fully reveals the wondrous existence of the Dao-heart,\nthe fundamental truth of the wisdom-life’s true emptiness.\nEmpty yet without thing, void yet spiritually efficacious—\nthe real image of the imageless,\nthe primordial spirit of the non-spiritual—\nthis is called the Valley Spirit.\nSpiritually efficacious yet undimmed:\nthis is the Valley Spirit’s immortality.\nUndimmed spiritual efficacy:\nprovisionally named the Mysterious Female.\nIts pivot and mechanism perfectly free,\nthus it is called the gateway of the Mysterious Female.\nThis is the supreme mystery’s pivotal aperture,\nthe wondrous opening of the void—\nthe root of Heaven and Earth,\nthe wellspring of nature and life.\nIt opens and closes the primordial qi,\nrising and descending naturally.\nAll disciples, turn the mystery’s pivot with utmost subtlety,\nand the imperial ultimate of the prior heavens shall be revealed.\n\nIn verse:\nThe Valley Spirit undimmed, nature’s clarity perfect,\nthe Mysterious Female’s opening and closing revolve creation.\nThe lion’s eyes shine bright and clear,\nthe elephant-king’s nostrils breathe softly and endlessly.\nAmid a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, subtly continuous,\nthe one merges the Three Primes in natural embodiment.\nHeart and breath interdependent, without interruption,\nsuddenly—before father and mother were born.\n\n**Fourth Case**\n\nThe Supreme Lord says:\n\"Vague, ah! Elusive—\nwithin it, there is something.\nElusive, ah! Vague—\nwithin it, there is an image.\nDim, ah! Obscure—\nwithin it, there is essence.\"\n\nBut what are this thing and this image?\nAh!\nThese three are neither non-existent nor existent,\nneither yin nor yang,\nbeyond the reach of the Five Phases,\nbefore the arising of the Seven Emotions.\nThey are my original true image,\nthe ultimate reality of the boundless,\nthe primordial ancestral qi of the prior heavens,\nthe primordial essence of kalpas untold.\nThe three are fundamentally one,\none body with three aspects—\nthis is called the Pure Dharma Body,\nthis is called the Wondrous Existence of the Empty Body,\nthis is called the True Dao Body of Non-being.\n\nIf one can secure the primordial essence,\ndrying the sea of desire,\nthen the Pure Dharma Body becomes complete.\nIf the true breath is harmonized,\nextinguishing the fires of karma,\nthen the Wondrous Existence of the Empty Body grows robust.\nIf the primordial spirit congeals,\nkilling the deluded heart,\nthen the True Dao Body of Non-being manifests.\nThe three bodies merge as one,\nfusing within the ten thousand dharmas.\nRadiant through the cosmos,\nvirtue perfected in the vast primeval chaos.\n\nDisciples, how then shall this be accomplished?\n○ Cease this very breath—\nstrive with all your might, strive with all your might.\n\n**Verse:**\nNeither mind nor nature nor immortal—\none body, three forms, merged within.\nSilent, still, the spirit congeals in profound secrecy,\nthe breath flows ceaselessly, nurturing the Mystery upon Mystery.\nThe wind of wisdom sweeps clean the mountain’s snow,\nthe kalpa-fire burns dry the springs beneath the sea.\nThis is the supreme vehicle’s wonder beyond the wondrous—\nonly the virtuous, those of kindred spirit, may grasp its heart-transmission.\n\n**Fifth Passage**\nThe Most High said: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Silent, vast, it stands alone and unchanging, circulating without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nIn days past, my ancestor, the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang, spoke this passage to Master Yan of South Cliff, together guiding Master He of Hunan to the fruition of the Dao. To this day, the three perfected ones share a single lineage, their incense and lamp never extinguished.\n\nLater, the Master composed a verse on this meaning:\n*There is a thing born before heaven and earth,*\n*formless, originally silent and vast.*\n*Embracing the ten thousand images in its body,*\n*it does not wither with the four seasons.*\n\nDisciples, what is this one thing?\n\nThe Master remained silent for a long while, then said:\nIt does not consort with the ten thousand dharmas, thus it stands alone and unchanging;\nits great perfection is without interruption or extinction, thus it circulates without cease.\nThose who attain this Dao can transform without being transformed, give life without being born—\ntherefore it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nMother is the Dao.\n\nAh! Sincerity, sincerity, sincerity.\n\n**Verse:**\n\n\"Sincerity, sincerity, sincerity—profound silence at its utmost;\na single mysterious pearl shines in the vastness of the great void.\nSilent and all-pervading, without trace,\nvast and solitary, without peer.\n\nBeyond the heavens of prior heaven, primordial qi congeals;\nwithin the boundless, the ancestral wind stirs.\nThe great mechanism of essence and function is luminously clear—\nendless transformations, wondrous and inexhaustible.\"\n\n**Sixth Passage**\nThe Most High said:\n*\"Carrying the po and embracing the One—can you never part from it?\nConcentrating qi to attain suppleness, like an infant;\ncleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror—can you leave no blemish?\nUnderstanding the four directions—can you remain without knowledge?\nOpening and closing the Gate of Heaven—can you do so without passivity?\nLoving the people and governing the state—can you do so without action?\"*\n\nThis passage fully reveals the wonder of mind illuminating mind,\nthe subtlety of seeing nature and nurturing nature.\nThe work of nurturing vastness, the wondrous function of the golden elixir—\nall are contained within this chapter.\n\nFor example:\n*\"Embracing the One and concentrating qi\"*—this is absolute continuity without interruption.\n*\"Cleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror\"*—this is the radiant clarity of the celestial heart.\n*\"Leaving no blemish in the heart\"*—this is purity and luminous brightness.\n*\"Understanding the four directions\"*—this is seeing nature without obstruction.\n*\"Remaining without knowledge\"*—this is containing light and deep nurturance.\n*\"Opening and closing the Gate of Heaven\"*—this is true breath, continuous and unbroken.\nThe body is the state; qi is the people.\nWhen qi flows smoothly, the body is at peace—\nacting without action.\n\nTruly understanding this chapter, the Dao of the golden elixir is complete.\nIf this is not yet so, carefully consider the following verse.\n\n**Verse:**\n\nThe yin po swarms and disturbs,\nThe yang hun cannot find peace.\nEmbracing the One to harmonize primordial qi,\nThoroughly penetrating the Mysterious Upper Pass.\nThe heart-heaven is pure as jade,\nThe nature-moon reflects the cold pool.\nThe golden elixir body of the infant,\nThe baby’s face restored to flawless purity.\nThe lord enjoys the joy of a peaceful state,\nThe people know no mountain of self and others.\nThe hun is clear, the po is numinous and sacred,\nGreat wisdom delights in tranquil ease.\n\n**Seventh Principle**\nThe Most High said: *\"Thirty spokes share one hub—\nwhere it is empty, lies the cart’s use.\"*\nThis chapter teaches one to perceive the root through things,\nto forget illusion and preserve the true.\nThe hub becomes a wheel through the spokes,\nthe cart becomes useful through the axle.\nOriginally, there was nothing—\nonly by cutting wood into vessels\ndoes one provisionally call it a \"cart,\"\nthus completing the cart’s function.\nOur body is like this:\nfrom Mud Pill Palace above to Bubbling Spring below,\nwithin the five viscera, without the four limbs,\na provisional assembly of illusory form.\nOriginally, there was nothing—\nonly with this illusory form\ndoes one forcibly name it \"human,\"\nthus completing the human’s function.\nThat which is above form is called the Dao,\nthat which is below form is called the vessel.\nThus, the formed relies on the formless for ease,\nwhile the formless within employs the formed for function—\nvessel and chamber share the same principle.\nNow, how does one awaken\nto the formless master within?\n*Rise.*\n\n**Verse:**\n\nThe spokes gather at the hub, and the cart fulfills its use;\nThought returns to the center, and the great Dao flows freely.\nThe cart moves, the vessel takes form—who exerts the force?\nNow, who is the true master within?\n\n**Eighth Passage**\nThe Most High said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, maintain profound stillness.\nThe myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.\"*\nThis chapter reveals the great samadhi of entering the chamber,\nthe return to life’s root, true emptiness and ultimate reality—\nthe most essential and genuine practice.\nEmptying all illusory existence, unstained by even a speck of dust, is called \"emptiness.\"\nAmid the tumult of the ten thousand dharmas, this heart remains unshaken—this is called \"stillness.\"\nWhen effort reaches its utmost, the six pulses become clear,\nthe one true nature shines in stillness, returning to its original state.\nAt this point, the whole body becomes a mouth, yet no word can be uttered.\nIf I were to reveal it, and your practice suddenly reached this stage,\nyou would surely scold me for being garrulous.\nIf I do not explain, I fear you might stray into error here.\nAs it is said: *\"Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune.\"*\nIn the end, what is it?\n**Verse:**\nEmpty, ever more empty; still, ever more still.\nBody and mind both forgotten, qi harmonizes and spirit settles.\nA single expanse of jade-like emptiness, the heart of heaven shines bright.\nBefore birth’s arising—who is mortal, who is sage?\nNeither true nor immortal, neither mind nor nature.\nNo words can describe it, nor can it be proven.\nUtterly still, utterly sincere—\nthe secret seal of the center within the center.\n\n**Ninth Passage**\nThe Most High said: *\"That which cannot be seen is called ‘subtle,’\nthat which cannot be heard is called ‘rare,’\nthat which cannot be grasped is called ‘elusive.’\nThese three cannot be further questioned.\"*\nTrue emptiness has no form, so it cannot be seen;\nthe great sound is soundless, so it cannot be heard.\nThis is the wondrous—like clouds emerging from peaks,\nlike the moon reflected in a pool—\ndifficult to grasp, impossible to transmit.\nBeyond the reach of ears and eyes, untouchable,\nyet it cannot be spoken of as unattainable.\nIf asked, what is it in the end?\nAh! This is the Dao—\nradiant above yet not dazzling,\nhidden below yet not obscure.\nThus, the higher one looks, the loftier it becomes;\nthe more one releases it, the more it fills the six directions.\nThe deeper one delves, the more impenetrable it grows;\nwhen gathered, no trace remains.\nApproach it, and its beginning cannot be seen;\nfollow it, and its end cannot be found.\nShining through past and present, without beginning or end.\nNow, who is the master here? Who guides the Dao’s coming?\n**Verse:**\nFormless, traceless, silent, soundless—\nilluminating past and present, called the Crimson Scripture.\nWondrous being, like the moon at the pool’s bottom;\ntrue non-being, like clouds atop the ridge.\nEncountering conditions, it silently radiates;\nfacing the mirror, cease the burning of karmic fire.\nHarmonizing the Three Origins, returning to the One Ultimate—\nthe master remains drunk in bliss all day.\n\n**Tenth Passage**\nThe Most High said: *\"Good conduct leaves no tracks,\ngood words bear no flaws,\ngood planning requires no schemes,\ngood closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened,\ngood binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\"*\nThis is beyond the reckoning of spirits and immortals,\nbeyond the knowledge of alchemists.\nThus, the sage’s great mechanism and great function\nhave no gate to enter, no measure to fathom—\nall arises naturally, without affirmation or denial.\nMaster Nanhua said: *\"The sage walks all day yet never walks;\nspeaks all day yet never speaks.\"*\nThus, though never not walking, the walk is always in the Dao;\nthough never not speaking, the words always hit the mark.\nEvery utterance strikes true—what need is there for schemes?\nAccomplishing without action—what need is there for cords?\nTherefore, the sage’s Dao is unified and all-pervading,\nnaturally balanced, upright, and just;\nbenefiting all under heaven, naturally orderly and magnanimous.\nThus, they are ever good at saving people, ever good at saving things,\nserving as ruler, serving as teacher,\nwithout self-cherishing or self-aggrandizement.\nThough possessing great wisdom, they are like the profoundly foolish.\nAlas! Our conduct does not follow the Dao,\nour words do not accord with principle.\nWorse still, we scheme and calculate,\nscrutinize and guard,\nflaunt our spirits,\naspire to be teachers,\nself-righteous and self-regarding—\nself-inflicting calamity and misfortune,\nfar removed from the Dao.\nIf we do not immediately repent and renew ourselves,\ncultivate virtue and nurture power,\nhow can we inherit the true illumination of the Most High,\nilluminate the world, and benefit all beings?\nIf this is not yet so, listen to my verse:\n**Verse:**\nWalking the world without resentment,\nspeaking the world without fault.\nUpside-down, wielding the sword of wisdom against the void—\nall dharmas crumble at its edge.\nWhen walking, walk; when sitting, sit.\nHungry, nourish; sleepy, do not lie down.\nSilently, silently, inheriting the luminous lord—\nwithin, a cosmos vast as a gourd.\n\nThe Most High says: The Dao is eternally nameless. Though the Uncarved Block is small, all under heaven dare not treat it as a subject.\n\nThe heart is originally traceless; the Dao is eternally nameless. Though the Uncarved Block is as minute as a speck of dust, its spiritual function knows no bounds. It contains the germ of creation and abides before all phenomena—thus all under heaven dare not treat it as a subject. Those who attain this Dao instantly transcend the realm of things. Their nature mirrors the great void, circulating through the six directions without hindrance, moving and resting unimpeded.\n\nTherefore, the Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas—flowing freely, it may turn left or right. Subtle, it may take on color or sound. Gazing, it is before you; suddenly, it is behind. Though this be so, only when all entanglements cease at once and the single thought returns to the center does one realize the primordial Dao has always been self-existent, needing no external source.\n\nDoes the assembly understand?\n\n**Verse:**\nHeart is Dao, Dao is heart—\nno need to ponder or seek apart.\nFame and profit melt like snow, the spirit-terrace gleams bright;\nlove and attachment thaw like ice, the sea of wisdom runs deep.\nWind sweeps dust clean, the golden tiger crouches low;\nclouds disperse, mist clears, the jade dragon sings.\nThe sky is clear, the sun’s light full and radiant—\nall sounds hush, the great tone ceases.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High says: Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao.\n\nWhen thoughts lean askew, they are corrected by reversion. When the heart harbors delusion, it is restored by awakening. This righting and awakening is itself the movement of the Dao. The sage’s heart is like the great void—pure, still, and natural, without the slightest bias or delusion, embodying the Middle Way. In such rightness and awakening, what need is there for cultivation?\n\nThus it is said: Abandon learning and have no cares. Purity is the rectitude of all under heaven. Treading humility, dwelling in harmony, blending with softness and weakness—this is propriety, and also the function of the Dao. All things under heaven arise through birth; without birth, there would be nothing.\n\nAssembly, righting corrects the crooked; awakening illumines delusion—these are the movement and function of the Dao. But if one is self-important and self-righteous, refusing to revert or weaken, then the Dao is lost.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe world is originally without affairs,\nyet the human heart stirs itself to fevered busyness.\n\nThe rain ceases, and the mountains gleam emerald;\nThe clouds disperse, and the moon’s full light shines.\nEmbodying the Dao, the spirit is serene and at peace;\nAbiding in constancy, virtue and righteousness exude fragrance.\nSincerity within turns madness into sageliness;\nBias and delusion turn sageliness into madness.\nOriginal nature is without deceit or obscurity—\nNo need for further inquiry or scrutiny.\n\n**Thirteenth Principle**\nThe Most High said:\nWithout stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven;\nWithout gazing through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus the sage arrives without traveling, names without seeing,\nand accomplishes without action.\n\nAll under heaven is like a single body;\nThe Way of Heaven is the original heart-mind.\nWhen the heart-mind is empty and luminous, heavenly principle shines forth.\nWhen the body is upright, all under heaven is at peace.\nThus we know the Dao lies within oneself—\nSeeking it externally only leads one farther astray.\nIllumination resides in the original heart-mind—\nGazing outward only brings obscurity.\n\nTherefore, the sage turns inward in sincerity and arrives home;\nReflecting upon the hidden and subtle, bright virtue manifests.\nWithout movement, transformation occurs—yet without proper principle, it is amiss.\n\nAssembly, how effortless this is, and how it spares the heart-mind—\nDo you yet comprehend?\n\nRest, rest.\n\n**Hymn:**\nNo journey’s path need one traverse to arrive home,\nWhy strain to plant roots in苦境’s barren loam?\nThe autumn sky, serene and clear, bathes each house in moonlight’s glow,\nSpring’s warmth and harmony make flowers bloom wherever winds may blow.\nWhen *qi* flows in harmony, pour the Queen Mother’s wine with ease,\nWhen the heart is pure, why seek Zhao Zhou’s tea to please?\nAt peace, at leisure, free from care—no tasks remain,\nWhy then murmur on, filling five carts with vain scrolls’ weight again?\n\n**Fourteenth Parable**\nThe Most High said: The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it; the middling person hears the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt; the inferior person hears the Dao and laughs uproariously. If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao—thus the saying arose.\n\nThe superior person is fundamentally noble and pure, their roots deep and untainted. Thus, with a single touch, they turn; their paths open in all directions, naturally unshakable, unmovable even by heaven and earth. Light and swift, continuous and subtle, they advance with vigor, unwavering from beginning to end.\n\nThe middling person, however, is entangled by karmic consciousness, bound by profit and fame, inevitably half-doubting, half-believing, wavering between presence and absence.\n\nThe inferior person is arrogant and impure, boasting of hollow wealth and empty renown, prizing superficial splendor while despising simplicity and sincerity. Thus, when they hear the sage’s Dao, they laugh derisively. If the inferior person heard the Dao and did not laugh, it would not be the supreme Dao. Therefore, the inferior person crafts clever words to mock and ridicule—yet this is no cause for surprise.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThose who comprehend the Dao and attain clarity instantly forget the body, like one in a stupor; they are unmoved by worldly affairs, like the indolent. Humble and unassuming, they blend with all, treating all beings as equals. Their great nature is pristine, though outwardly they may seem defiled; their vast virtue is complete, yet they appear lacking. They cultivate hidden virtue in secret, as if stealing; simple and unadorned, they seem as though confused.\n\nYet the boundless expanse, the great vessel slowly formed, the supreme sound unheard, the great image formless—these elude sight and hearing. The Dao is hidden, nameless, untouchable, empty and still, the very opposite of their expectations. All this the inferior person finds laughable.\n\nOnly the lofty and enlightened in the Dao embrace all with tolerance and forgiveness, skillfully employing expedient means, yielding and adapting to circumstances. Thus it is said: \"They lend generously and bring to completion.\"\n\nAssembly, in the three thousand merits and eight hundred practices of the cultivator, this chapter encompasses all. Strive on, strive on!\n\n**Hymn:**\nIn every thing the Supreme Ultimate’s truth resides,\nYet people, reckless, cast it aside and wallow in delusion’s tide.\nThe foolish, obstinate, hearts choked by brambles’ snare,\nThe superior, empty within, their nature pure as jade is fair.\nWhen one recognizes the empty nature of the mind, the original nature is known—\nThe ordinary person, once enlightened, becomes a true one.\nTurning the light inward, entering the mysterious primordial realm,\nOne may escape the toil of endless rebirth’s wheel.\n\n**Fifteenth Parable**\nThe Most High said: Those who follow life are thirteen in number; those who follow death are thirteen in number; and those who, while alive, move toward the realm of death are also thirteen. Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to the pursuit of life.\n\nThe sage, transcending all going and coming, comprehends the absence of birth and death—thus the Great Void remains undivided, neither moving nor abiding. Alas! All people lack mastery over this heart, which flickers and vanishes, emerging and submerging in the mechanisms of existence without end. Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to the pursuit of life.\n\nThose who crave abundant nourishment for life find their clothing and food ever insufficient; those who chase wealth and fame find their desires and reputations never sated. As their hearts are perpetually unsatisfied, they indulge the six desires and seven emotions, the Three Corpses and Six Thieves, exhausting their minds and depleting their strength, cunningly scattering their spirit. This causes the fire of the heart to blaze upward while the water of essence seeps downward, water and fire at odds, giving rise to illness, suffering, and torment that persist until death.\n\nOnly those who attain the Dao awaken to the illusory nature of karmic consciousness and worldly attachments. Thus, they reverse their emotions to restore their original nature, emptying the heart to embody the Dao. Naturally, fire no longer flares upward, nor does water leak downward. With water and fire in harmony, spirit and qi merge intimately, ultimately realizing the unborn—and thus escaping the realm of death.\n\nKnow then that when people, in life, move toward the realm of death, it is because water and fire remain unbalanced, spirit and qi either united or sundered—hence the thirteen. Fire corresponds to seven, water to six; together they make thirteen. The interpretations of this passage are many and varied, each clinging to its own view and fixating on fragmented forms. Some speak of the nine orifices and four gates, claiming that of ten parts, three pertain to life and seven to death. Others cite the waxing and waning of the moon, yet these explanations bear no relevance to self-cultivation and progress.\n\nOnly the Ancestral Master, the True Man Yuchan, spoke of the seven emotions and six desires, while my former teacher addressed the disharmony of water and fire—these interpretations are most apt. The text flows coherently, and one may directly apply its teachings. If emotions and desires are not stilled, if water and fire remain unbalanced, then the center lacks steadfast mastery—how can one escape the terrors of tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, and weapons? Only when spirit and qi merge as one does the self and the external world dissolve into oblivion.\n\nDisciples, clearly grasp the true meaning of this passage and strive to practice it diligently. There is no need to inquire further into the great matter of life and death.\n\n*Hymn:*\nLife and death of humankind depend on yin and yang,\nYet transcending yin and yang, one returns to the constant.\nWhen water and fire blend in harmony, the realm of death is forgotten;\nQi and spirit, firmly sealed, guard the way of life.\nOx and man both vanish, the nature shines in clarity,\nGull and self, devoid of emotion, both mechanisms fade.\nPointing to the transient forms, the wise return to their native home—\nCease delusion in counting appearances, playing with words.\n\n**Sixteenth Parable**\n\nThe Supreme Lord says: The Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them. All things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—none confer rank upon them, yet they remain naturally so.\n\nThe great Dao’s life-giving is inexhaustible; its mysterious virtue nurtures all equally. Things take form according to qi, and circumstances achieve fruition in due time. Thus, all things without exception revere the Dao as their root and honor virtue as their origin. Therefore, the Dao’s loftiness surpasses antiquity yet does not claim precedence; virtue’s supreme value perfects the myriad things yet does not assert priority. Thus, those who embody the Dao—none under heaven dare treat them as subjects, and lords and kings cannot befriend them—they ever delight in spontaneity.\n\nOf old, Emperor Yao offered the throne to Master Xu You, who declined and withdrew; Emperor Shun offered it to Master Shan Juan, who fled into the mountains. Likewise, Master Zhuang rested beside Ziling, refusing a hundred *yi* of gold and declining a ministerial post. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained the Dao and steadfast scholars—many have refused even three imperial summons—truly exemplifying that the Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor require no rank.\n\nYet we of this generation, having not yet realized the true principle nor attained genuine merit, remain ignorant of the Dao’s wondrous profundity and the subtle mysteries of its dark principle. Relying on shallow measurements and narrow views, we delude the foolish masses, flaunting empty words to seek fame and profit—how utterly shameless! Above, we betray the teachings of the immortals and sages; below, we cling to the dust of worldly vulgarity. In thus violating the Supreme Lord’s compassionate instruction, ought we not feel a chill in our hearts? Reform swiftly, reform swiftly!\n\nDisciples, do you wish to awaken and reform at once, or rouse your resolve and practice with diligence?\n\nAh, this old fool has spoken too much.\n\n*Hymn:*\n\nHighest ranks and noble caps—how the world admires them,\nYet the Daoist, seeing through all, laughs with a chuckle.\nBubbles arise and bubbles vanish—why fuss over such things?\nFlowers bloom and flowers fade—how long can they last?\n\nWhite-clad, one walks naturally, taming the mind’s steed;\nWith true nourishment, how could one abandon the sacred tortoise?\nLeisurely and carefree, spurning the ambitions of kings and lords,\nWhy fret over others’ scorn or ignorance?\n\n**Seventeenth Admonition**\nThe Supreme Lord says: *\"One whose virtue is deeply contained resembles a newborn child.\"*\n\nTo nurture one’s inherent nature with purity and simplicity is to be like a newborn child. The \"newborn child\" refers to an infant not yet three months old. At that stage, the primordial *qi* remains undiluted, the primordial spirit serene and obscure, unaware of movement or stillness, sound or form. Its hands stay clenched, its limbs supple, a single sphere of harmonious *qi*, whole and unblemished. Though it cries all day, its throat does not grow hoarse; though venomous creatures and fierce beasts draw near, none sting or harm it. For it harbors no intent toward things, and thus things do no harm in return.\n\nThe Supreme Lord uses this to illustrate the path of the true cultivator—how earnest his heart! If we seek to return to the root and restore our original nature, taking this as our model, is it not simple and wondrous?\n\nYet now, our minds lack a master, our natures know no peace. How then can the primordial spirit settle into stillness, the primordial *qi* ascend into emptiness, that we might resemble the newborn child?\n\nDisciples, *\"to grasp the axe and hew the axe-handle—the model is not far off.\"*\n\nAh, rest and repose, ceaseless yet ever-present—go forth!\n\n*Hymn:*\n\nThe art of nurturing is wondrous,\nInmost, subtle, unbroken, and continuous.\nThe infant’s heart abides in boundless vastness,\nThe newborn’s nature is pure and complete.\n\nWho through the ages has grasped its message?\nWhat in life and death truly undergoes change?\nWithin the Great Void stands the grand image—\nBeyond the mysterious, there is no further mystery.\n\n**Eighteenth Principle**\nThe Supreme Lord says: *\"Act without acting, engage without engaging, savor without savoring.\"*\n\nDisciples, these three phrases hold a wondrous truth. If you fully comprehend them within yourself, the One Reality will become perfectly clear, and all practices will be complete. Should this not yet be so, this old fool will lend his words to clarify for you.\n\nIf we awaken to the truth that all things in the world are but illusory, fleeting blossoms, our hearts grow weary of them, and we long for seclusion, instantly relinquishing all entanglements. Like an incense burner in an ancient temple, cold and ashen, we sit in silence, regarding all human affairs as no more than clay puppets—clearly distinct, untouched by them. This may seem correct, yet it is not; it is not the true marvel of the sage’s perfect purity.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe sage’s heart is like a precious mirror hung in the hall: when things approach, it reflects them; when they depart, it remains empty. Responding to circumstances with fluid adaptability, it is lively, perfectly round, utterly open, and radiantly clear. It follows what is beneficial and enhances it, aiding the natural course of all things. Without affirmation or denial, it acts yet does not act.\n\nAll-pervading and infinitely adaptable, it is nowhere absent from the Dao. Like a king wielding a sword, when the myriad phenomena arise, they are effortlessly resolved—this is engaging without engaging. Savoring the essence of virtue and the Dao, one enters the realm of the spirit, nurturing the primordial *qi* in its harmonious ascent, as though drinking jade nectar and ambrosial dew—this is savoring without savoring.\n\nDisciples, do you wish to understand this? Do you wish to practice it with diligence?\nAh!\n\n**Verse:**\n\nA thousand miles without a cloud’s obstruction,\nThe azure sky with sun at perfect center.\nPerfect clarity illumines the cosmos,\nIts radiance bright, the void made luminous.\nIllumining things with impartial light,\nIt penetrates the subtle, pervades the vast.\nMy heart bears not a single stain—\nWhat matter cannot be harmonized?\nWith skillful means it harmonizes human affairs,\nAdapting to the moment, it unfolds the ancestral wind.\n\n**Nineteenth Passage**\nThe Most High said: A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one’s feet.\nBut this single step—where does it first arise?\nDisciples, do you understand?\n\nThe master remained silent for a long while, then drew a single stroke in the air and said:\nAh! The Great Dao is utterly straight and level, vast and boundless, extending to the ten directions and eight reaches, sixfold in penetration and fourfold in thoroughfare, effortlessly unobstructed.\nAs the Old Immortal of Nanhua said: *\"All day long one walks, yet never walks.\"*\nHow effortless! Without the slightest trace.\nIf you truly grasp this, turn back and practice it with diligence—suddenly you will tread upon your native land, and all the familiar paths of former realms will vanish entirely.\nThis is called *\"leaping beyond the realm of things,\"* wandering and chanting in the immortal homeland, carefree in true joy—how wondrous!\n\n**Verse:**\nA step need not depend on the foot—\nYet still it traverses the journey’s course.\nNot-walking walks in marvelous subtlety,\nNowhere is not vast and level.\nThe heart’s path, truly empty and cut off,\nThe celestial thoroughfare—Dao’s great flourishing.\nTreading through the wondrous mystery’s aperture,\nJoyous and blissful, beyond birth and death.\n\n**Twentieth Passage**\nThe Most High said: I possess three treasures, which I hold and guard.\nThe first is *compassion*, the second *frugality*, the third *not daring to be first in the world*.\nTo dwell in magnanimity and act with benevolence, aiding others and benefiting all things, moved by kindness toward all—this is *compassion*.\nCompassion nurtures one’s celestial nature.\nTo abide in one’s allotted place, simplifying the heart and moderating affairs, speaking with caution and acting with care, sincere and unwavering—this is *frugality*.\nFrugality nurtures the heart of Dao.\nTo receive others with emptiness, to cultivate oneself with humility, gentle and yielding, lowly and deferential, yielding and holding back—this is *not being first*.\nNot being first nurtures the supreme virtue.\nDisciples, if one is truly compassionate, none in the world can oppose them—thus they are called *courageous*.\nIf one is truly frugal, true joy abounds—thus they are called *expansive*.\nIf one truly does not put themselves first, humble yet exalted in glory, lowly yet unsurpassable—thus they perfect their capacity as leaders.\nIf a follower of Dao lacks compassion, frugality, or humility, they not only lose the Dao, but misfortune will follow.\nCan one not be vigilant and cautious, to preserve eternal and perfect good fortune?\n\nThe master descended from the seat, bowed with utmost sincerity to the assembly, and recited a verse:\nWealth and honor take humility as their root,\nNobility and eminence take lowliness as their foundation.\nHumble and ever-humble, the noble one is blessed;\nArrogant and ever-arrogant, one invites others’ reproach.\nMastering oneself, the heart is without delusion;\nForgiving others, the heart is without deceit.\nStill the heart, and desire has no hold;\nHarmonious and compliant, one delights in the subtle and serene.\n\n**Twenty-First Passage**\nThe Most High said: Words have their source; affairs have their ruler.\nOnly because of ignorance do they not know me.\nThose who know me are rare—thus those who model themselves after me are precious.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\nThus the resolute scholar delights in the Dao and forgets lowly status, abides in virtue and forgets poverty.\nThough outwardly in disarray, inwardly they cherish the supreme treasure.\nThus the sage’s original essence is perfectly luminous, and their great function brings boundless benefit.\nTherefore, every word strikes the mark, every affair is just and fitting.\nBefore words are spoken, their source is already present; before affairs arise, their ruler is already established.\nOnly those ignorant of this mystery speak much that is unwholesome, act with many biases, unaware that the great body of Dao and its marvelous function are quiescent, its central ruler responding and transforming without fixed direction.\nYet those who know this Dao are rare.\nIf one truly reverses their gaze to the original ruler, firmly preserving it within, then words and affairs will all be orderly and fitting, and nowhere will they not be beneficial.\nThey become rulers and teachers, revered by heaven and humanity—how surpassing!\nThus it is said: *\"Those who model themselves after me are precious.\"*\n\nDisciples, consider this: In this very moment, who governs speech, silence, and action?\n\n**Verse:**\nBefore the seven emotions arise, the mystery—\nWhen the six desires do not stir, the moment.\nSilent and still, truly forgetting the self,\nWithin the center—who is it?\nWord after word—what is there to say?\nAffair after affair—acting without acting.\nExquisite jade concealed within,\nA divine pearl shining of itself.\nAlas! Clearly I hold forth the treasure within the household,\nYet how pitiful that people, deluded, do not know me.\n\n**Twenty-Second Passage**\nThe Most High said: To know yet not claim to know is supreme;\nNot to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\nOnly by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw.\nThe sage is without flaw because they recognize the flaw as a flaw—thus they are without flaw.\nAs the earlier scripture says: *\"Though wise, to be greatly deluded—this is called the essential mystery.\"*\nThus those who have penetrated the Dao appear clumsy or foolish, dull or inarticulate.\nYet they thoroughly comprehend the original source, contain their light, and silently illumine, naturally manifesting their luminous virtue, shining without dazzling.\nThus it is said: *\"To know yet not claim to know is supreme.\"*\nNowadays, our kind, not yet awakened, claim to be awakened; not yet enlightened, claim to be enlightened.\nLike fireflies’ light or a well’s measure, they consider themselves enlightened and penetrating, forcefully arguing and boasting, flaunting their spirit—this is the flaw of claiming to know when one does not.\nThe sage, possessing pure and abundant qi, a nature of unadorned authenticity, penetrating the eight directions and six thoroughfares, often appears as if without knowledge, uniting the three powers yet always seeming inadequate.\nWith an empty, tranquil, and serene heart, yielding, gentle, and harmonious, they harbor no self-deception, no desire to prevail or compete, no self-display or self-righteousness—none of the many flaws.\nThus it is said: *\"The sage is without flaw because they recognize the flaw as a flaw—thus they are without flaw.\"*\n\nDisciples, if one truly awakens to one’s own deluded heart and the flaw of claiming to know when one does not, masters oneself and reforms one’s errors, then one’s luminous virtue will daily renew, and joy in heaven will be boundless.\n\n**Verse:**\nA hundredfold clumsy, inept, indolent one,\nCarefree and at ease, delighting in celestial truth.\nBefore others, silent and inarticulate, utterly useless—\nYet within, all-embracing, a treasure upon the mat.\nTheir nature like fine gold, without impurity,\nTheir heart like exquisite jade, without blemish.\n\nCease boasting of quick wit and sharp repartee,\nLest you weary yourself with idle chatter and fall into the dust of dharmic defilement.\n\n**Twenty-Third Passage**\nThe Most High has said: *\"The sage does not hoard. The more they give to others, the more they themselves possess; the more they bestow upon others, the more they themselves abound.\"*\n\nConsider this: Heaven and Earth are the unwitting sages, while the sage is the intentional Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus it ceaselessly generates and transforms, bringing boundless benefit to the world without harm. The sage, empty and without accumulation, thus remains whole and complete, aiding the world through the Dao without contention. Therefore, in nourishing the people abundantly, they find themselves ever richer; in broadly bestowing and aiding the multitudes, they find themselves ever more abundant. This may be called the vast and boundless ocean of the Dharma, an inexhaustible treasury.\n\nDisciples, simply abide in this wondrous Dao of benefiting without harming, acting without contending—here, the great virtue of Heaven and Earth’s ceaseless generation and the sage’s transformative benevolence are fully realized within you. I humbly urge you to treasure this.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, beyond all reckoning,\nThe pivot of creation, master of generation and completion.\nHeaven’s strength and Earth’s compliance bring forth ceaseless transformation;\nThe worthy and the sage, in perfect sincerity, nurture life through transformation.\nShun and Yu embodied Heaven—what harm could there be?\nFu Xi and Yao aligned with the Dao—without a trace of contention.\nWhen things flourish and seasons follow in order, people dwell in peace,\nThe world’s pure wind delights in great harmony.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Passage**\nThe *Wenshi Miaodao Zhenjing* states: *\"With one emotion stilled, one becomes a sage; with one emotion inclined toward goodness, one becomes a worthy; with one emotion inclined toward evil, one becomes a petty person.\"*\n\nDisciples, setting aside the question of good and evil emotions, how does one comprehend the state when all emotion is stilled?\n\nAh!\nIf you directly accept this in the present moment,\nThen the heart of Heaven shines brightly, and your inherent nature abides in fullness.\nShould this not yet be so, listen to my vexed words:\n\nThough good and evil are two paths,\nThe Daoist would do better to cast them both aside.\nWhen the seven emotions are stilled and the self is forgotten,\nA single radiant light illumines the vast emptiness.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Passage**\n\n**From the *Wenshi Zhenjing*:**\nThe fish that would be unlike other fish leaps from the water onto the shore and dies; the tiger that would be unlike other tigers leaves the mountains for the marketplace and is captured. The sage is no different from ordinary people—only the demands of the times cannot constrain them.\n\nThus we know that the enlightened Daoists and recluses of old, though clear in their fourfold perception, dwelled in stillness and obscurity, appearing foolish and clumsy. They harmonized their light with the world, blending seamlessly, so that even adepts could not recognize them. Moving or halting as the moment required, responding to stimuli with perfect adaptability, even spirits and gods could not fathom them. Thus the demands of the times could not constrain them, and they attained great freedom.\n\nYet today, our kind rely on the measure of a dou or shao, flaunting the light of a firefly. Fond of playing the master, putting on airs, prideful and self-satisfied, they seek reputation and chase fame—unaware that they invite demonic obstacles and court disaster.\n\nDisciples, the sage’s parable of the fish leaping onto the shore and the tiger entering the marketplace, leading to the loss of life, is a profound warning. Taking this as a mirror, it is far better to embrace poverty and cultivate the Dao, delighting in one’s allotted fate. In time, boundless joy will arise naturally, and one may become a true and unassuming Daoist—is this not extraordinary?\n\nVexed words:\nCleverness often turns to clumsiness;\nNothing shines brighter than the guise of folly.\n\nFlaunting talent invites censure and ruin,\nWhile staying true to one’s lot earns trust.\nSeeking the hidden draws slander,\nChasing fame brings no ease.\nAbiding in the ordinary saves trouble,\nEver at peace, joy knows no bounds.\n\nTwenty-Sixth Maxim\nAs the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The sage gathers the myriad existences into a single breath, yet no thing can enslave his luminous clarity. He disperses a single breath into the myriad existences, yet no thing can obstruct his cloud-like actions. How vast this is!\n\nThe single spark of human emptiness—its great substance and great function—lies within a single breath. Thus, when released, it fills heaven and earth, unbounded and unobstructed; when gathered, it withdraws into a millet grain, leaving no trace. Radiant and unobscured, its substance and function fully manifest—nothing can alter it, no thing can question it.\n\nDisciples, if you can awaken to and comprehend this, then speech and silence, movement and stillness attain great freedom. But tell me—how does one embody and examine each breath in this very moment?\n\nIn verse:\nVague, it spans heaven and earth;\nFleeting, it dwells in a millet-pearl.\nStanding alone on a hair’s tip,\nLuminous, it embodies the vast void.\nPursue it—no head is seen;\nFollow it—no end is found.\nSuddenly, it meets you—\nNeither that, nor you.\n\nTwenty-Seventh Maxim\nAs the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The sage, through speech, action, and thought, aligns with others; through never speaking, never acting, never thinking, he differs from others. The Old Immortal of Nanhua says: \"Speaking all day to exhaust the Dao, every word is the Dao; speaking all day to exhaust things, every word is a thing. At the ultimate of Dao and things, there is neither speech nor silence.\"\n\nBy this, do the two patriarchs’ teachings converge as one, or remain two? Disciples, if you can thoroughly penetrate this, then speech and silence, action and rest all arise naturally, with nothing permissible or impermissible. If not yet so, turn inward and reflect.\n\nIn verse:\n\nA precious mirror hangs in the hall,\nRound and bright, free of the slightest dust.\nThose who gaze are mirrored in its gaze,\nYet the viewer’s sight is theirs alone.\nBeauty and ugliness both appear of themselves—\nThis mirror is utterly without mind.\nOnly when eye sees and ear hears truly\nMay you be called its knowing companion.\n\nTwenty-Eighth Maxim\nAs the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Though the sage’s Dao transforms like a tiger, his conduct crawls like a turtle; though the Dao is tangled as silk, his affairs are arrayed like a board of *weiqi*. Further, the Dao’s rolling and unfurling, the bird’s flight and soaring—all occur within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible. The sage’s Dao is likewise.\n\nThus we know the sage’s ordering of the world: silent, he spiritually transforms; resplendent, his patterns fully manifest. Responding to change, he follows the moment; equalizing all, he magnifies the Dao. Why is this so? The sage’s great substance is the jade-like void, purely unobstructed—thus he allows all transformations to proceed as they will. Clouds and dragons, birds in flight, wind and thunder, rain and mist—ever-changing, yet the great void never alters.\n\nDisciples, we of this generation are constantly mired in sound and form, deluded by being and non-being, clinging to things and indulging our emotions, forcing our abilities and multiplying affairs. Thus our words and deeds lose their footing, our movements and stillness encounter hindrance. How may we recover our original nature of great emptiness and attain the ease of boundless freedom?\n\nAlas—what is to be done? Each must comprehend this for themselves.\n\nIn verse:\n\nMajestic as the wind, awe-inspiring and solemn—even spirits cannot fathom him.\nHarmonious qi flows with grace, bringing beauty and benefit to all things.\nActing yet not acting, desiring what others do not desire.\nDrifting free and unobstructed, swift without haste.\n\nTwenty-Ninth Principle\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The dung beetle rolls its ball, and when the ball is formed, it concentrates its spirit within. Then a white maggot dwells inside the ball, and soon it sheds its shell to become a cicada.\nDoes the transformation occur without thought? Does the maggot wriggle of itself?\nThus we know: jade uncarved cannot become a vessel; heaven unchilled cannot form ice.\nDisciples, we are not born sages. If we wish to learn the sage’s Dao, we must rely on cultivation.\nTruly, truly—pure and unadorned—we must apply ourselves diligently to succeed.\nBut now, with eyes propped open by foreign branches and mouths flapping idly, what good does it do?\nThe sage, like the dung beetle rolling its ball, focuses its will with single-minded concentration. In emptiness and purity, light shines forth, and the shell is shed to become a cicada.\nIf even creatures of this kind must labor to achieve transformation, how can we fail to reflect on this?\nThus it is said: Cultivation that transcends cultivation is true cultivation; learning that reaches non-learning is called supreme learning.\nYet here we sit, lumps of matter, dull and ignorant, claiming no need for effort, that supreme learning requires no toil.\nThis is like scratching an itch through one’s boot—flailing limbs and idle gestures—all yielding no result in the end.\nTake heed and strive!\nThis old fool has spoken too much. I pray you, take care.\n\nIn verse:\nAt first hearing, the wondrous mystery is suddenly penetrated,\nWith deep roots of fortune and wisdom, and the wind of good affinity.\nNature and life merge, perfecting the Great Ultimate,\nForm and spirit both wondrous, embodying the primordial.\nBodhidharma’s nine years polished his jade-like heart,\nWenshu’s six years steeled his golden resolve.\nThe transcendent immortals of past and present—\nAll attained their celestial state through merit and virtue.\n\nThirtieth Principle\n\nFrom the *Wenshi Zhenjing*:\nThe multitude let the po govern the hun—when metal is in excess, wood is deficient. The sage lets the hun move the po—when wood is in excess, metal is deficient. Thus wood symbolizes the hun and nature, while metal symbolizes the po and the passions. Ordinary people follow their passions and chase delusion, so their passions are in excess while their nature is deficient. The sage gathers the passions into nature, so their nature is in excess while their passions are deficient. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth still the passions and dissolve perception, so that their original nature becomes perfectly luminous, with no lack or excess. They pacify the dead po and settle the hun, so that their wisdom-life is firm and unbreachable, with no leakage. When nature and passions merge as one, then metal and wood are without division.\n\nYet joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—love, aversion, and desire—are all passions. Stillness, clarity, and perfect luminosity are nature. Nature is one, while the passions are seven; they are many, and we are few. Thus we are ever overcome by karmic force, while the power of the Dao is vanquished. Disciples, how then can we overcome these seven beasts?\n\nAh, for others it is difficult to apply effort.\n\nA hymn says:\nSeven great demon-kings\nconstantly harm the master of the house.\nWhen the master lacks resolve and power,\nthe po and hun gallop like heroes.\nWith the sword of wisdom, slay the White Tiger;\nin the numinous palace, let the Jade Dragon sleep.\nIn great peace, nothing remains to be done—\ndrum the belly and delight in the Mysterious Wind.\n\nThirty-First Admonition\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Those who calculate life and death say either that after death there is something, or that after death there is nothing, or that after death there is neither something nor nothing. Some say one should rejoice, some say one should fear, some say one should accept, some say one should transcend—all these multiply the passions and perceptions.\n\nDisciples, today’s practitioners all claim that the matter of life and death is grave. Yet judging by this scripture’s meaning, these are all empty vexations. Whether there is or is not, whether one rejoices or fears, accepts or transcends—all these multiply the passions and perceptions. They fail to realize that I was never born; who then speaks of death?\n\nI have often said that life and death are but the constant alternation of day and night—what matters is that the heart remain unchanging. Going and coming are but the transformations of movement and stillness—what matters is that one’s nature remain unsullied and undimmed. Thus the old immortal of *Nanhua* said: “Life and death are indeed momentous, yet nothing can disturb the heart.”\n\nThough it be so, one must clarify this here and now to be a person who has resolved the matter. Why is this? If in daily life one cannot be swayed by adversity or fortune, then in the night’s dreams and sleep one cannot be deluded. When dream and waking are as one, life and death present no obstacle. If this is not yet so, then continue to investigate to the end.\n\nA hymn says:\n\nI am originally without coming or going—who speaks of life and death?\nSun and moon ever rise and set, yet how can the great void know darkness or light?\nWith adversity and fortune unstaining the heart, the realm of dreams is naturally clear.\nThe wondrous joy of non-arising—through kalpas it celebrates peace and ascent.\n\n**Thirty-Second Entry**\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:\nIntention shifts, but the heart does not shift.\nIntention awakens, but the heart does not awaken.\nOnly this single heart of mine—then intention is but dust coming and going,\naffairs are but fleeting arising and ceasing, while within my heart abides the great constancy.\n\nThus the heart is likened to fire, intention to earth.\nFire gives rise to earth, just as the heart gives rise to intention.\nWithout heart, there is no intention; without intention, there is no emotion.\nTherefore, when emotion arises, intention awakens, and with the raising of intention, the heart illumines.\n\nDisciples, in daily life use this illumination and awakening,\nso that emotional consciousness is emptied, affairs and things are both forgotten,\nand responses follow the moment—suddenly arising, suddenly ceasing—all floating and drifting.\nWhy is this?\nBecause within my heart abides the great constancy that governs all.\nDo you understand?\nHmm.\nA hymn says:\n\nClouds drift away, clouds drift in—the mountain stands still;\nTides rise, tides fall—the sea remains serene.\nTides and clouds come and go without intent,\nWhile mountain and sea, heartless, stay verdant and clear.\n\n**Thirty-Third Passage**\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Someone asked me, \"What is your clan, your surname? What is your name, your courtesy name? What do you wear, what do you eat? Who are your friends, your servants? What zither do you play, what books do you read? What is ancient, what is modern?\"\n\nAt that time, I remained silent, not uttering a single word. The questioner persisted, and I could not but respond: \"If you do not even see me, what use is there in knowing what belongs to me?\"\n\nI once read in Master Zhu Xi’s *Recorded Sayings*: \"Chan began with the Daoists. The Buddhists extracted it from Daoist scriptures, then repackaged and peddled it as their own treasure.\" Initially, I doubted this, wondering how Daoism could have Chan. But after carefully studying this scripture and the *Nanhua* and others, I realized Master Zhu did not speak idly—truly so.\n\nMaster Feng the Venerable said: \"Before Kumārajīva was born, the *Nanhua* and *Liezi* already existed.\" The Perfected One of Wenshi posed these questions, then answered with silence. Disciples, if you can truly awaken to this, you will suddenly comprehend the subtle wonders of the true immortals—you will have already answered. If not, then ponder this: *\"If you do not even see me, what use is there in knowing what belongs to me?\"*\n\nA hymn says:\nSomeone asked of me,\n\"What use is there in knowing what belongs to me?\"\nFace them with a steadfast heart,\nLeaving them nowhere to hide.\nNowhere to hide,\nNowhere to hide.\n\n**Thirty-Fourth Passage**\n\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: \"It is like the great sea, which can transform into countless dragons and fish—yet the water remains one. My self and all things flourish abundantly within the great transformation, yet their nature remains one. One who knows this oneness of nature transcends self and other, life and death.\n\nThe Three Powers and the myriad beings all emerge through transformation from the Great Ultimate. Since each was endowed with form, every thing possesses a Great Ultimate, preserving the one Heavenly Principle. Within the great transformation, they are born and transform, transforming and giving birth, endlessly. Yet the mind drifts like flowing essence, affairs surge like the wind, and things ripple like waves—never resting, never still.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, we have shifted forms and changed shells, unable to transcend. Disciples, if you can truly awaken to this illusion of emptiness and flowers, forget things and reflect on affairs, turn back the passions and quiet the mind—then your original nature will naturally become perfectly luminous, undisturbed by the myriad phenomena. This master within will be transcendent and free, returning to greatness with ease and lightness. What then could obstruct you with doubts of self and other, life and death? Treasure this, treasure this.\"\n\nA hymn says:\n\nFish and dragons transform, yet all are one with water;\nSelf and others arise, yet all share a single mind.\nSame and different, different and same—let go of this and that;\nGold is but earth, earth is but gold.\n\nAlas! Pure is the one nature, the body of great emptiness,\nSilent and luminous, transcending past and present.\n\nThe thirty-fifth verse of the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:\nOf the one thing, the multitude see only its name,\nPerceiving things but not the Dao.\nThe worthy analyze its principles,\nSeeing the Dao but not things.\nThe sage unites with Heaven,\nSeeing neither Dao nor things.\nAll is Dao—ungrasped, it is the Dao;\nGrasped, it becomes a thing.\n\nThe *Book of Changes*, in the *Appended Judgments* of Confucius, says:\nThat which is above form is called the Dao;\nThat which is below form is called the vessel.\nVessels, too, are things.\nThus the noble one embodies things without omission—profound indeed!\n\nThe Śākya school says:\nOne who can turn things is equal to the Tathāgata.\nApplying this wondrous chapter, much effort is expended—\nYet why?\nThings are things, the self is the self;\nWhy turn? Why depart?\n\nThus the sage is pure and undivided,\nEmbodying Heaven and Earth,\nNaturally forgetting both self and things,\nThe mind of the Dao undivided.\n\nDisciples, if you can truly see through this,\nUnite self and things, preserve the heavenly principle—\nThis master within will be lively and fluid, perfectly whole,\nSpacious and unobstructed, without fixed constraints,\nEmbodying the subtle before images arise,\nInstantly transcending beyond the realm of things.\nTrue joy is boundless—\nWhy cling to the illusion of self?\n\nTreasure this, treasure this.\n\nA hymn says:\n\nWhen attachment to being reaches its end, it becomes delusion;\nClinging to non-being ultimately falls into dead emptiness.\nWhen neither being nor non-being is established, the mind transcends all—\nWhere clarity is not yet through, there too is clarity.\n\nThirty-Sixth Case\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* says:\nOf Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things,\nNot one is my own thing.\nThings are not my things, yet I cannot but respond;\nI am not my self, yet I cannot but nurture it.\nThough responding to things, there has never been a thing;\nThough nurturing the self, there has never been a self.\nDo not say \"external things\" and then exclude the self;\nDo not say \"external form\" and then exclude the mind.\nThe Dao is one—there is no sequence of progression.\n\nHow great are the words of the sage!\nWhen things come, respond with sincerity;\nWhen things depart, be empty—serene and unattached,\nThis is what is meant by \"neither clinging nor rejecting.\"\nWearing linen in summer and furs in winter,\nEating when hungry, drinking when thirsty,\nAbiding in one’s lot, following what is fitting,\nMoving with the times, stopping when the time is right—\nThese are all ordinary, fundamental matters.\nUse what can be used, rest when one may rest,\nAdjusting with the seasons, harmonizing with nature,\nWithout straining the mind or expending effort.\nThis is what is meant by \"attending to non-attention, acting without acting\"—\nHow light and free!\nWhy distinguish between external things, external form, or external mind?\n\nDisciples,\nRespond to things yet forget things,\nNurture the self yet forget the self—\nNaturally, all is settled at once, and the original nature transcends.\nThus it is said: \"The Dao is one—there is no sequence of progression.\"\n\nA hymn says:\nFacing circumstances as if there were none,\nIn the dust yet free from dust’s stain.\nNeither self nor others obstruct—\nThe Dharma King’s body fills the great earth.\nOnce penetrated, the ten thousand merge without a single thing;\nWithin and beyond Heaven and Earth, all is my body.\n\n*Xuanjiao Dagong’an*, Volume One—concluded\n*Xuanjiao Dagong’an*, Volume Two\n\nMaster Jinsheng Daoshi, Shian Xiansheng, presented by Miao Taisu;\nCompiled by disciple Cheng’an Wang Zhidao—Case Thirty-Seven\n\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:\nDo not condemn the world while affirming the self,\nDo not belittle others while exalting the self,\nDo not disregard the Dao while prizing the self,\nDo not slander others while praising the self’s virtue,\nDo not despise others’ meagerness while flaunting the self’s talent.\n\nTo condemn the world while affirming the self is self-righteousness.\nTo belittle others while exalting the self is self-aggrandizement.\nTo disregard others while prizing the self is self-importance.\nTo slander others while praising the self’s virtue is self-proclaimed ability.\nTo despise others’ meagerness while flaunting the self’s talent is self-conceit.\n\nDisciples,\nThe above five matters are what the Perfected One of Wenshi urgently remedies in our fellow learners’ moral ailments. We must immediately awaken and reflect inwardly. Should even one of these persist, swiftly repent and reform to become a true follower of the Dao. If one denies cause and effect, remains deluded, and refuses to change, these five faults will breed five kinds of poisonous qi, bringing self-inflicted calamity and suffering.\n\nIf self-righteousness remains uncorrected, it accumulates a malevolent qi;\nIf self-aggrandizement remains uncorrected, it accumulates a domineering qi;\nIf self-importance remains uncorrected, it accumulates an arrogant qi;\nIf self-proclaimed ability remains uncorrected, it accumulates a resentful qi;\nIf self-conceit remains uncorrected, it accumulates a haughty qi.\n\nSuch qi arises from the inherent shallowness of one’s constitutional temperament and the polluting habits of worldly winds. Once these five poisons take root, they give rise to anger, hatred, affliction, misfortune, and suffering, becoming one’s own demonic obstructions while virtue and conduct are utterly lost. The original true nature is thus shrouded in mist and darkness—how then can one speak of illuminating the mind and perceiving the nature, or boast of profound Chan mysteries? This is nothing but covering one’s ears to steal a bell.\n\nAh! Be cautious, be ever cautious.\n\nA hymn says:\n\nThe foolish are born into poverty, dull and deluded,\nUtterly devoid of learning, perception, or wisdom.\nAmong all the clumsy and crude in the world, none compare to me—\nHow could I dare display my claws and hooves before others?\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Passage**\nThe *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Those who once discoursed on the Dao spoke of it as \"serene quiescence,\" \"profound depth,\" \"lucid clarity,\" \"emptiness in unity,\" or \"obscure darkness.\" Take care not to encounter these terms and retreat in fear.\nThe supreme principle of the world transcends words and concepts. If one knows it is neither word nor concept, one aligns with my teaching, dwelling beyond subtle words and wondrous meanings.\nDisciples, this passage pierces our kind—clinging to phrases as if they were profound mysteries, we fall to one side, unable to merge with the great unity.\nTruly awakening to the ineffable subtlety, one leaps directly to the highest realm, attaining the true principle of the *Wenshi Zhenjing*, which must be realized beyond language.\n\nA hymn says:\nSerene quiescence is but dull stillness,\nProfound depth belongs to illusory yin.\nWhat reality lies in emptiness in unity?\nLucid clarity sinks into torpor.\nObscure darkness is dim and unilluminated,\nSubtle words entangle one in dharmic dust.\nWhen all is seen without obstruction,\nJoy and bliss fill the celestial mind.\n\n**Thirty-Ninth Passage**\nThe *Chongxu Jing* states: A man worried that heaven and earth would collapse.\nA perfected one explained: \"That is one, this is one.\nThus, in life I know not death; in death I know not life. Coming, I know not going; going, I know not coming. Whether it collapses or not, why should I concern myself?\"\nIt also says: \"When the spirit enters its gate, the bones and frame return to their root—what of me remains?\"\nDisciples, life and death are like day and night; going and coming are like winter and spring.\nThus the sage, comprehending this mystery, regards life and death, going and coming with a mind as vast as the Great Void, utterly forgetting all knowledge. Naturally and spontaneously, this body is also heaven and earth.\nThus it is said: \"That and this are one.\"\nOne then knows that when the spirit returns to its origin, illusory transformations dissolve into emptiness. The singular truth is one with the present—transcendent and solitary, why ask further, \"What of me remains?\"\nGentlemen, if you each realize this now, act accordingly at once. Do not wait until the end to deliberate.\n\nA hymn says:\nIllusory forms, being formed, must perish,\nThe true origin, being formless, endures forever.\nNow, with all seen as unobstructed,\nTranscendent beyond the three realms, one stands alone and supreme.\n\n**Fortieth Passage**\n\nThe *Book of Master Chongxu* states: The Lord of Lu heard that Kang Cangzi had profoundly attained the supreme Dao of the Great One, capable of seeing with his ears and hearing with his eyes, and so dispatched his highest minister with lavish gifts to invite him. The Lord of Lu humbly entreated him for instruction. Kang Cangzi said: \"Those who transmit such claims are deluded. I can see and hear without relying on ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the natural function of ears and eyes.\" The Lord of Lu said: \"This is already a wondrous augmentation—what then is the Dao? I earnestly wish to hear of it.\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"I am able to unite my body with the mind, the mind with qi, qi with spirit, and spirit with nothingness. When there is the slightest presence, the faintest sound—whether distant beyond the eight wilds or near as the space between my brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness arises from the perception of my seven apertures and four limbs, or from the knowledge of my heart, belly, and six viscera. It is simply self-knowing, and nothing more.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu was overjoyed and reported this to Confucius. Confucius merely smiled and did not respond.\n\nDisciples, when you forget the self and enter the mystery, empty the mind and embody the Dao, then body and mind merge perfectly, spirit and qi fuse wondrously. Thus the singular nature becomes one with the Great Void, and the six senses function interchangeably. How vast is the true person who realizes such perfect attainment!\n\nAlas for the Lord of Lu—though he rejoiced and revered Kang Cangzi, he remained deluded by the allure of rank, glory, sounds, and sights, unable to awaken. He then relayed this to Master Xuan. But why did Master Xuan not answer?\n\nA verse for contemplation says:\n\nThe Three Origins merge in mystery to return to the Boundless,\nThe singular nature shines perfectly, embodying the Great Void.\nTruly unite the six senses at their undivided source,\nWhere non-roundness is also roundness.\n\n**Forty-First Passage**\nThe *Book of Master Chongxu* of the Immortals states: Long Shu suffered from ten kinds of illness and sought the physician Wen Zhi.\n\nWen Zhi inquired about his symptoms. Long Shu said: \"In my village, praise brings me no honor; national disgrace brings me no shame. Gain does not make me rejoice, nor loss make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as myself, and myself as others. At home, I dwell as in an inn; my village, I see as a foreign land.\n\nAll these afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor adversity can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me—what illness is this?\"\n\nWen Zhi gazed at him intently and said: \"Ah! Your mind is empty—you are nearly a sage. The six apertures of your heart flow freely, yet one remains unopened. Now you take sagely wisdom as illness—this is beyond the reach of my shallow art.\"\n\nDisciples, Long Shu’s \"illness\" lies in his equanimity toward honor and disgrace, gain and loss, life and death, wealth and poverty, self and other—all met with a single smile. Thus, to realize sagely wisdom is to attain perfect roundness, the six penetrations unobstructed, naturally and effortlessly.\n\nWhy then is it said that one aperture remains unopened?\nPonder this in silence. If you penetrate this single aperture, you shall attain the leakage-free state.\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nLong Shu’s tenfold illness,\nThe enlightened should awaken to its proof.\nThe six penetrations, unobstructed and free,\nRecognize nature as the empty sky’s essence.\nWhen the upward aperture opens wide,\nThe one truth fuses with wisdom and life.\nLife and nature fully realized,\nLike jade in purity, gold in unyielding luster.\n\n**Forty-Second Passage**\nThe *Book of Master Chongxu* states: That which arises without cause yet is ever-present is the Dao. That which arises from arising, though ending, is not forgotten—this is constancy.\n\nThus, arising without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain an end is called constancy. Dying without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain death is called constancy.\n\nDisciples, this passage illuminates the constancy of the Dao’s essence, which knows no cessation.\n\n\"Without cause yet ever-present\" means arising from no origin, unaware of life as life—this is the Dao. Life without attachment to life—though the body dies, the fundamental nature does not perish—this is constancy. Thus, arising without use is called the Dao; embodying the Dao to attain an end is called constancy.\n\nThrough this, awaken to the wondrous constancy of the true Dao, which is the body of spontaneity. Why then fear impermanence?\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nSun and moon have brightness and darkness,\nThe Great Void knows neither.\nNature is the body of the Great Void—\nWhat change can birth and death bring?\nAlas! Though mulberry fields turn to seas,\nA single point remains serene and clear.\n\n**Forty-Third Passage**\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua said: \"Illumined by Heaven, penetrating the sagely, the six penetrations and fourfold thoroughfares—all is dimly and indistinctly still.\n\nThe stillness of the sage is not like the dragon’s stillness, which is still because it is good at stillness. The myriad things cannot disturb the sage’s heart—thus is he still.\n\nWhen water is still, it clearly reflects even the finest hairs, its levelness serving as a standard for the great craftsman. If still water alone is so luminous, how much more the sage’s spirit-filled heart?\"\n\nDisciples, this chapter focuses entirely on the word *stillness*.\n\nStudents are often swept away by adversity and fortune, obstructed by affairs and things, unable to endure. They seek a secluded place to rest, yet unwittingly add another thought—the thought of seeking stillness. Even in remote solitude, they find only more toil and distraction. How pitiful!\n\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua, with the word *good*, reveals the essential work of true stillness. This *good* is not the good of good and evil, but the sage’s innate capacity.\n\nThe sage’s heart is empty, luminous, vast, and clear—still, round, and radiant, like a hanging mirror. When things come, it reflects them; when they depart, it is empty. No forms of beauty or ugliness remain. The mind is utterly limpid, ten thousand miles away yet brilliantly clear. Is this not simplicity and wonder?\n\nThus, if still water can so clearly and evenly reflect things, how much more the single luminous emptiness of the human heart? Truly penetrate this, and affairs will no longer disturb; the heart will cease its restless striving. Become a carefree Daoist—how light and free!\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nNeither abiding in movement nor stillness,\nUnobstructed in coming and going.\nWithin the four dignities,\nAttain great freedom.\nActing without acting,\nBenefiting without harming.\nA single point of emptiness,\nEncompasses the vastness of a sand universe.\n\n**Forty-Fourth Passage**\nAt the beginning of the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter in the *Book of Nanhua*, the Old Immortal answers questions about the three winds with two disciples.\n\nFirst, he speaks of the inequality of human and earthly winds—this aligns with Mencius’ saying, \"Things are unequal; such is their nature.\" Finally, he speaks of the heavenly wind: \"Though the myriad sounds differ, they let each be itself\"—the myriad apertures roar and sigh, all winds stilled and empty. Who is the master of this moment?\n\nFirst, he speaks of nature; then, of principle. Principle is one, yet its manifestations are many. Guest and host are distinct, yet the unequal is made equal.\n\nWithin this, he offers broad analogies to illustrate the endless transformations of things, all changes unified in the numinous. At the end, he uses his dream of the butterfly to encapsulate the chapter’s great meaning: suddenly, he dreams he is a butterfly, fluttering contentedly; suddenly, he awakens, and there is Zhuang Zhou. Does not know: was Zhou’s dream the butterfly, or the butterfly’s dream Zhou?\n\nBetween Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a boundary—yet here, he does not speak it plainly.\n\nDisciples, consider: who now dreams, and who awakens? Truly awaken to this clarity, and you will know that life and death, dream and waking, are equally subsumed in the great transformation, within which stands the solitary, towering one.\n\nThus it is said: Only with this great awakening do we know this was the great dream.\n\nIf this is not yet so, listen to my later verse:\nThings and self share the same womb, one source.\nIn inequality, equality—square and round alike.\n\nEach follows its passions to forge its karmic shell,\nYet returning to the root, all merge in the Great Ultimate’s ring.\nThe myriad sounds fall silent, heaven’s breath stills—\nOne mind, serene and solemn, knows the heart’s hidden depths.\n\nTransformation births and transforms through its own changes,\nDream and waking both forgotten, joy precedes all forms.\n\nIn the forty-fifth passage, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* says:\nConfucius taught Yan Hui the fasting of the mind. Hui asked, “May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?”\nConfucius said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at the resonance of *qi*. *Qi* is emptiness awaiting things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”\nHui said, “Before I received this teaching, there was truly only Hui. Having received it, there has never been a Hui—may this be called emptiness?”\nConfucius said, “It is complete.”\n\nDisciples, behold: the Sage declared a single word—*emptiness*—to transmit the fasting of the mind to Yan Hui. Profound indeed! Yan Hui, upon hearing it, penetrated it instantly and directly transcended to the realm of sages. “There has never been a Hui”—this is to say, he suddenly forgot the self, no longer knowing Hui existed. The Sage affirmed it as complete.\n\nNow, of seeing, hearing, speaking, and smelling—why did the Sage single out hearing for direct instruction? Because listening with the ears is the hearing of the common; it merely follows sound. Listening with the mind is the hearing of the worthy; it attains resonance. Listening with *qi* is the hearing of the sage—returning to the root.\n\nSince birth, each person is endowed with a Great Void, each receives a primordial *qi*. When the mind is empty, primordial *qi* flows freely; when *qi* stills, spirit shines bright and clear. Neither separate nor identical, their wondrous interplay severs the paths of the heart, polishing the sky of nature to flawless purity. Thus it is said: “An empty chamber generates light; auspiciousness abides in stillness. Attain the utmost emptiness, and the radiance of heaven shines forth—mysterious, and again mysterious.”\n\nHow fitting that the Buddha’s Avalokiteśvara, in the practice of perfect penetration, entered through hearing and attained the fruit of the Way—hence the name *Guanyin*. The ancient sages’ nature and the Way of Heaven are fully contained herein. How could one not hear of this?\n\nAlas, treasure this well.\n\nVerse:\n\n\"Mouth pure yet heart impure—how can one reach the original source?\nUnswerving in the precepts of sincerity and Dao, unwavering in mind-fasting’s clarity.\nThe spirit-valley remains unstained, the numinous terrace free of dust.\nThe Great Void shines bright and clear, wisdom’s sun illumines the celestial steps.\"\n\nForty-Sixth Entry\nMaster Nanhua’s *Autumn Floods* presents six exchanges between the River Earl and the Ocean Spirit, like wind lashing stone or snow-capped waves surging through the sky—striking terror into the heart, leaving one disoriented and lost. Yet by the closing lines, the limpid azure sea mirrors the vault of heaven, calming the spirit and restoring the breath, returning to utmost tranquility and truth.\n\nDisciples, why this return?\nIt all converges upon the three words: principle, Dao, and expediency.\nThus it is said: One who grasps the Dao must comprehend principle; one who comprehends principle must grasp expediency. One who grasps expediency is not harmed by external things.\nIt further states: Discerning safety and peril, abiding in fortune and misfortune, cautious in departure and approach—nothing can cause harm.\nThus, \"Heaven resides within, humanity without.\"\nWith Heaven within, purity remains unadulterated and the great body aligned; with humanity without, responses adapt without constraint and great function harmonizes.\nHerein lies the seamless, boundless flow—Dao governed by principle, affairs conducted through expediency. Safety and peril, departure and approach, embodying Heaven and responding to humanity—how could calamity, demons, or harm ever arise?\n\nAt this point, the River Earl’s mind merges in silent accord, and no further questions remain.\nFittingly, Su Dongpo declared: \"Go three days without reading *Nanhua’s Autumn Floods*, and one’s words grow stale, one’s writing dull.\"\nTruly, with clear awakening, daily practice becomes natural—all demonic hosts vanish, and boundless true joy arises.\n\nHold fast to this truth.\n\nA verse declares:\nThe River Earl beheld autumn’s flood,\nits swelling waters breaching the banks.\nYet when he gazed upon the Sea Lord,\nhe stood in awe, sighing without end.\nThe frog in the well peers at the sky,\nwhile the turtle in the sea feels shame.\nPerception reveals depths and shallows—\neach must grasp the principle aright.\nThe great body wields the great expedient;\nfortune and misfortune turn on oneself.\nEmbody the Dao in plain constancy,\nfind joy in Heaven, and flow from beginning to end.\n\n**Forty-Seventh Passage**\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua said: *\"Shatter the fervor of ambition, untangle the delusions of the heart, shed the burdens of virtue, and clear the blockages of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe six of *nobility, wealth, eminence, dignity, fame, and profit*—these stir ambition.\nThe six of *appearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, and intent*—these delude the heart.\nThe six of *aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure*—these encumber virtue.\nThe six of *departure, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability*—these obstruct the Dao.\n\nThese four sets of six, when not swept from the breast, leave no room for uprightness. Uprightness brings stillness; stillness brings clarity; clarity brings emptiness; emptiness brings non-action—and yet nothing remains undone.\n\nDisciples, shatter ambition and untangle the heart; shed burdens and clear blockages—each of these six matters is an obstacle, a demon in our path.\nWhen ambition defies principle, the Dao of Heaven is cut off—thus shatter it.\nWhen the heart is deluded, affairs become entangled—thus untangle it.\nWhen virtue is burdened, judgment grows clouded—thus shed it.\nWhen things obstruct, the center remains unempty and unpenetrated—thus clear it.\nAll these arise from human desire.\n\nWhen these four sets of six are swept from the breast, they give way to central equilibrium, purity, stillness, luminous clarity, and empty penetration. In this state, one may fully exalt the Dao and deepen virtue, perfecting nature and completing the heart.\n\nThis passage is the Old Immortal of Nanhua’s special admonition to later learners—a crucial effort on the path to gradual refinement. Chew it slowly, savor its boundless meaning.\n\nHold fast to this truth.\n\nA verse declares:\n\nWhen common emotions and human desires abound, the four sets of six obstruct the celestial mechanism.\nReduce affairs, and the heart remains free of delusion.\nForget entanglements, and the will knows no error.\nWhen emotions are emptied, virtue sheds its burdens;\nwhen nature is realized, the mind holds no doubt.\nIn central stillness, the heart is empty and penetrating—\nin non-doing, nothing is left undone.\n\n**Forty-Eighth Passage**\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua once said:\nThere is a beginning;\nthere is that which precedes the beginning;\nthere is that which precedes even the preceding of the beginning.\nThere is being;\nthere is non-being;\nthere is that which precedes non-being;\nthere is that which precedes even the preceding of non-being.\nSuddenly there is being and non-being—\nyet who can say whether being and non-being truly have a claim to existence?\nOr truly have no claim?\n\nInterpretations of this passage’s five \"precedings\" vary, each with its strengths and flaws, yet none strike the mark, leaving readers with an ever more distant and abstruse impression. Some align them with the Five Primes of the Perfected Immortals, offering a somewhat coherent explanation. Yet they fail to grasp that these refer to the being and non-being of this very body—from the most profound non-being to the subtlest being—further fused into a single \"preceding,\" each stage leading deeper into the next. Truly wondrous, truly pure.\n\nConsider this: if this body exists, from whence did it arise?\nIt came into being through a single thought—thus thought is the \"preceding\" of the body.\nThought arises from the heart—thus the heart is the \"preceding\" of thought.\nThe heart arises from nature—thus nature is the \"preceding\" of the heart.\nWhere there is qi, there is nature—thus life is the \"preceding\" of nature.\nThe original luminous nature is true non-being;\nthe empty, luminous life is wondrous being.\nWhen true non-being and wondrous being fuse into a single \"preceding,\"\nthis is the Supreme Ultimate before its inception,\nbefore parents gave birth—\nthe one true and real image,\nthe Jade Void’s wondrous essence,\nthe pure Dao-body,\nthe beginningless beginning.\n\nDisciples, invert your inquiry and pursue it to the end—\neach stage ascending higher,\ngradually entering the sublime.\nAt this point, you will realize that heaven and earth are born with me,\nand the myriad things are one with me.\nAll distinctions of right and wrong, self and other, sound and form, being and non-being\nare but illusory flowers in the air, mirages in the sun.\nTrue joy arises naturally—how simple, how wondrous!\n\nListen to the verse:\nThe five \"precedings\" of Nanhua,\ntrace them back to the source.\nThis thought arises from the heart,\nthe heart from nature’s rise.\nNature depends on the root of life—\nnature and life share a single path.\nWondrous being fuses with true non-being,\nthe mysterious Jade Void’s essence.\nThe resolute awaken in truth—\ntrue joy is beyond birth.\n\n**Forty-Ninth Passage**\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua offered a parable to illuminate the heart through the principles of things, awaken the celestial mechanism, and realize the Dao. Yet his meaning is profound and subtle, delving into the marvelous and extraordinary.\n\nHe spoke of six things:\nKui pities the centipede,\nthe centipede pities the snake,\nthe snake pities the wind,\nthe wind pities the eye,\nthe eye pities the heart.\n(The centipede here refers to the *wugong*.)\n\nBeginning with three creatures, he extends the analogy to wind, eye, and heart—\nrevealing the grand workings of creation and the celestial mechanism in clear and radiant terms.\nThe many or few legs of Kui and the centipede are likened to the size of spittle’s spray—pearls or mist.\nThe snake, though legless, moves swiftly—\nlike the sage’s movements, transformations, contractions, and extensions,\nresponding to the celestial mechanism in slowness or speed,\nall arising naturally.\nNext, the wind—\nrising tumultuously from the Northern Sea,\nentering the Southern Sea,\nshifting from yin to yang,\nvanishing in an instant—\ntranscends all things of form, surpassing them in marvel.\nFinally, the eye and the heart are left unspoken.\n\nDisciples, do you grasp the meaning?\n\nShould some still not grasp it, this humble one shall lend voice to expound—yet the honorable ones must meet it with silent, sincere accord.\n\nBehold: the eye, with but a single glance, encompasses ten thousand miles; the farthest shores and ocean’s edge lie all beneath its gaze. The heart, with but a single stir, holds within it the great earth and all its mountains and rivers. Such is the celestial mechanism in motion—arriving without traversing, swift without haste. Ought one not take heed and turn inward in vigilance?\n\nLike the wind at its first rising, its power seems faint and slight—yet soon it topples mountains and uproots trees, growing from the faintest breath to the mightiest force. The work of creation in our very breath follows the same pattern. Once the honorable ones directly awaken to the great mechanism and its wondrous workings, effort falls away of itself.\n\nA verse says:\nThe Great Dao is present in all,\nEach thing enfolds it whole.\nKui’s hooves swift as the centipede,\nThe serpent’s flight slow as the wind.\nThe celestial mechanism fuses with the Purple Ultimate,\nThe profound principle embodies the Yellow Center.\nDissolve the knowing of being and non-being,\nForget the passions of emptiness and non-emptiness.\nTurn inward to the heart’s subtle wonder—\nFace-to-face with the Master within.\n\n**Fifty-Third Entry**\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor heard that Guangchengzi had secluded himself on Mount Kongtong, relinquishing the world, he built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and dwelled in stillness for three months before going to seek the Dao. Guangchengzi lay facing south, and the Yellow Emperor approached on his knees from the downwind side, bowing twice with his forehead to the ground. He asked, “I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: how ought one cultivate the body for long life?”\n\nAfter a long while, Guangchengzi rose abruptly and said, “Excellent question! Come, I shall tell you. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing—embrace the spirit and be still, and your form will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Let your heart be serene and still, free from restless striving. Let the heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your form. All things are boundless, yet people take them to be finite. Those who attain my Dao enter the gate of the boundless and wander the fields of the infinite.”\n\nDisciples, the original spirit of humanity cannot guard its dwelling, for it is disturbed by emotions giving rise to thoughts, and thoughts stirring the essence. Guangchengzi taught the Emperor to still the heart from all knowing, that the spirit might guard itself—how profound! Even the Yellow Emperor, that great sage, prepared himself with three months of cogon-grass seclusion and approached his teacher on his knees from the downwind side to inquire of the Dao. What are we compared to him? If we cannot do likewise, how shall we enter the gate of the boundless or wander the fields of the infinite?\n\nAlas! A verse says:\n\n\"When the heart severs its restless clamor, the spirit abides in its dwelling;\nWhen essence ceases its agitation, qi returns to its root.\nThe qi and spirit interweave in serene stillness—breath within breath—\nStraightaway entering the Gate of the Mysterious Origin, the Portal of Myriad Wonders.\"\n\nFifty-First Entry\nThe *Nanhua Sutra* states: The Yellow Emperor roamed above the Red Waters, ascended the heights of Kunlun, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he had lost his Mystic Pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Departed Brilliance to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Eloquent Reproach to seek it, but it was not found. Only then did he send Indistinct Image, and Indistinct Image found it.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor exclaimed: \"How extraordinary! Can Indistinct Image alone retrieve it?\"\n\nDisciples, this single Mystic Pearl is possessed within each person, shining from antiquity to the present, its radiance piercing heaven and earth. Yet, veiled by the dust of worldly desires and obscured by the clouds of mundane affairs, the bright vision gallops astray, and intellect ranges unchecked—thus the pearl is lost and forgotten. Those fortunate enough to seek this pearl may do so through eloquent discourse, or by conjecture with cleverness, or by pondering with intellect. The clearer the seeking, the more distant it becomes; the sharper the search, the more elusive it grows. Thus, the Yellow Emperor’s three envoys all failed to retrieve it. Only with Indistinct Image was it found. What does this mean?\n\nLet one detach from speech and knowledge, forget brilliance and understanding, sincerely abide upon the cinnabar mound, and plunge the mind into Indistinct Image—then a single point of perfect clarity will naturally shine through. How simple and wondrous this is!\n\nRe-examining, the verse says:\nA priceless pearl lies buried deep in mud.\nWith cleverness and intellect we grope—\nall belongs to \"this\" and \"that.\"\nYet when the mind sinks into Indistinct Image,\nunawares, the pearl’s radiance rises.\nLeaping forth from the limpid abyss,\nits perfect brightness illumines the Great Void.\n\n**Fifty-Second Passage**\nThe *Nanhua Sutra* states: Nie Que asked the Way of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: \"Straighten your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, unify your judgment, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, and the Dao will be your home. You will be dazed like a newborn calf, seeking no former cause.\"\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que seemed to fall into slumber, his form already forgotten. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly and departed singing.\n\nDisciples, when the ancients heard the supreme Dao, their forms were forgotten and their minds intoxicated, returning to the original perfection of inherent goodness. This is what is meant by \"straightening the form and unifying the gaze\"—sincerity preserved whole, containing light without duality. \"Gathering knowledge and unifying judgment\"—thought dissolved, spirit congealed in singular essence. Thus, like a newborn calf, one is pure and whole, without contrivance. When mind and spirit merge as one, self and other are both forgotten, and one does not know the *how* yet naturally *is*. How fitting that the true master sang in true joy, for he truly knew—without clinging to the past.\n\nNow, our karmic burdens are heavy and blessings light; we cannot swiftly attain this. Yet if we can truly believe and sincerely, silently abide, proceeding thus with wholeheartedness, then when practice matures, it too will arise naturally.\n\nThe verse says:\nSet aside intellect, dismiss brilliance,\ncontain light in wondrous sincerity.\nBei Yi’s words were not yet done—\nNie Que had already forgotten his form.\nThe Dao meets the mind pure as jade,\nemotions empty, nature clear as ice.\nThe Great Void’s winds breathe softly,\nheavenly music silent, without sound.\n\n**Fifty-Third Passage**\nThe immortal elder of Nanhua said: \"The Dao is not fulfilled by petty conduct; virtue is not perfected by petty knowledge. Petty knowledge harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To be complete in joy is called attaining one’s will.\"\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"attaining one’s will\" not in terms of carriages and caps, but rather that nothing could augment their joy. Today’s \"attaining one’s will\" refers to carriages and caps. Yet when carriages and caps rest upon the body, they are not one’s nature and life—they are but transient lodgings of the external.\n\nDisciples, the sage treasures and preserves the spirit, finding joy in the peace and harmony of nature and life. Thus, they are content in poverty and delight in the Dao, not taking carriages and caps as honor, lest they lose their pure and lofty aspirations. How much less should one, in straitened circumstances and following the vulgar, indulge in petty knowledge and petty conduct, becoming a burden to the Dao and virtue!\n\nTo lose the self in things, to forfeit one’s nature to custom—what is there to say of this? Be warned, be cautious.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nWorldly affairs shift like clouds,\nHeat and cold reverse in the turn of a hand.\nThe heart grows cold to fame and profit,\nWhile the nature of Dao and virtue is like orchids and irises.\nThose with purpose drift and wander,\nThose without desire stand firm as Mount Tai.\nUnfettered and unbound,\nGreat aspirations delight in leisurely ease.\n\n**Fifty-Fourth Entry**\nAt the feast of repose in the Southern Florescence, Shu Guo Zijing asked: \"Where does the Dao reside?\"\nThe Perfected One said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nShu Guo said: \"Be specific, then you may proceed.\"\nThe Perfected One pointed to an ant before them: \"It is in the ants.\"\nShu Guo said: \"Why so lowly?\"\n\"It is in the millet and barnyard grass.\"\n\"Why even lower?\"\nThe Perfected One pointed to the bare ground: \"It is in the tiles and rubble.\"\n\"Why still lower?\"\n\"It is in the excrement and urine.\"\nShu Guo did not comprehend.\n\nHow clumsy! Our Most High has said: \"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\" And again: \"The great Dao overflows—it may be found to the left or right.\" The Proclaimed Sage said: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.\" From this, we may infer that the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence borrowed the things before his eyes to reveal the original source of the Dao. Alas that Shu Guo had no grasp of it!\n\nThe Dao fully manifests in every thing, perfectly complete in every instance—this is its \"nowhere absent.\" Like a single point of mine: wherever the eye falls, there is no limit. Where could one go and not find the Dao? Thus we know the Old Immortal’s first answer laid bare his heart and liver, while the four that followed were but secondary devices, born of necessity.\n\nDisciples, if you can truly grasp the Perfected One’s first answer, you will stand towering and alone, unbound and unobstructed. Do you understand, venerable ones?\n\nAh! Today’s Chan masters—with their \"cypress tree in the courtyard,\" \"wine table in the hall,\" \"three pounds of hemp,\" \"three punches,\" \"dry shit-stick,\" \"Buddha-dung heap\"—all their various cases derive from this. Thus Elder Feng the Venerable Master said: \"Before Kumārajīva was born, there were already the *Nanhua* and the *Liezi*.\" Master Zhu Wengong said: \"Chan arose from the Daoists; today’s patch-robed monks merely repackage and expound it.\" How could this not be so?\n\nIf you, gentlemen, can cut through doubt in an instant and fuse understanding to its depths, then the myriad dharmas will flow as one, and the Three Teachings will merge into unity. Why then contend over skill or superiority, over self and others, right and wrong? Rather, rejoice in great peace and become a transcendent great man—would this not be splendid?\n\nThe verse says:\nThe myriad things, three inches—one source of Dao,\nBefore a word is raised, it is already luminously clear.\nThe Southern Florescence’s intent fully reveals the wondrous,\nWhile Dongguo’s doubts fail to penetrate the mystery.\nTurbid qi clouds and deludes the original nature,\nBut a pure wind dispels the haze to reveal the primordial sky.\nSix penetrations, four attainments—utterly unobstructed,\nThe Three Teachings gathered into one perfect circle.\n\n**Fifty-Fifth Entry**\nThe Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence said: \"Scholars of later ages are unfortunate: they no longer see the purity of heaven and earth, nor the great body of the ancients. The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world.\"\n\nTake the learning of Hui Shi, for example: he held that the myriad things are entirely the same and entirely different, that heaven and earth form a single body. The debaters of the world delighted in this. He spoke of eggs having fur, chickens having three feet, Ying possessing all under heaven, dogs being interchangeable with sheep, horses laying eggs, tadpoles having tails, fire being not hot, mountains having mouths, wheels not touching the ground, eyes not seeing, fingers not reaching, the unreachable never ceasing, tortoises being longer than snakes, the carpenter’s square not being square, the compass not making circles, the chisel not fitting the mortise, the shadow of a flying bird not moving, the speed of an arrow having moments of neither motion nor stillness, dogs not being dogs, a yellow horse and a black ox making three, a white dog and a black fox cub never having mothers, and a one-foot rod halved daily lasting ten thousand generations without end. Debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, exhausting themselves without end.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s discourse, though he deemed it most worthy, merely adorned others’ minds, altered their intentions, and could win over their mouths—but not their hearts. He constantly sought to surpass others for fame, weak in virtue but strong in things, restless and unable to settle, chasing after things without return. He exhausted himself in echoes and forms, racing shadows in vain. How pitiful!\n\nDisciples, the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence specifically cited Hui Shi’s talent to conclude this chapter. His intent was to warn that people of later ages, light in qi and meager in fortune, would no longer embody the purity of heaven and earth or the great body of the sages. Instead, they would prize quick-wittedness and agility, answering long with short, east with west, being with non-being. When pressed and unable to reply, they would turn the question back on others. They teach the young to wield glib tongues, while gentlemen, slow of speech, struggle to respond. A single mind bent on victory, self-aggrandizing and self-important, they stir up the vulgar, deceive the foolish, spout grand words, and fancy themselves universal transformers. Gradually, this becomes a pernicious habit—how lamentable!\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Sealed are the cheeks and tongue.\" And again: \"Coming and going in distraction, friends follow your thoughts.\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nVenerable ones, if you can see through such things, awaken and comprehend fully, you should inwardly cherish your light, treasure and nurture celestial harmony, and not emulate those who flaunt deceit and delusion. Instead, return to simplicity and restore purity—this alone suffices.\n\nThe verse says:\nTo learn the Dao and cultivate the mind, return to simplicity and purity,\nSimplicity and purity need no further seeking.\nMouthing empty threefold mysteries, the tongue wags in vain,\nWhile a hundred schemes at the eye’s edge misdirect the heart.\nMozi’s frugality and diligence are still worth adopting,\nBut Hui Shi’s cunning and deceit are truly hard to admonish.\nThe wondrousness of non-speaking speech is thoroughly penetrating,\nSilent as an abyss, yet thunderous as a roaring great sound.\n\nPure Yang Emperor Lord states:\nTo awaken to the True Constant yet not comprehend destiny—\nthis is the foremost malady in cultivation.\nTo cultivate only the ancestral nature without refining the Elixir,\nthrough ten thousand kalpas the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood.\n\nPurple Yang Perfected states:\nThough you may fully awaken to the True Suchness of nature,\nyou still must cast off the body only to re-enter the body.\nHow much better to refine the Great Medicine,\ninstantly transcending the leakless to become a true person.\n\nAssembly, those who now expound on illuminating the mind and perceiving nature\nall take raising brows, darting eyes, pointing fingers, extending fists,\nknocking, shouting, speech, silence, and responses as the Way.\nAble to study and comprehend thus,\nthey mistake this conscious spirit for the original true nature,\ndeeming it the true and proper.\nSelf-assured, they cease inquiry,\nyet this one-sided affair remains unrealized—\nhow much further still from speaking of the True Empty Wisdom-Life,\nthe great matter of the final outcome!\nFar indeed—deeply pitiable.\n\nThe Patriarchs’ two poems admonish and rouse the determined,\ntruly piercing to the quick.\nAlas, our meager blessings and feeble strength\nprevent us from advancing further.\nMoreover, there are those who guard the kidneys, guard the navel,\nguard the heart, guard the brain,\nstriving with effort to circulate and transport,\nbending and stretching, contriving—\nall manner of clinging to form and attachment to appearances\nas the foundational work of destiny.\nPitiable indeed!\n\nNow, what is the genuine truth?\nSilently cease—silently cease.\n\nA Chant says:\nThe great elephant’s trunk—freely flowing,\nThe primal lion’s eyes—bursting forth.\nTwo made one in seamless fusion,\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—thundering, congealing.\nVague yet ceaseless, dense yet subtle,\nNaturally merging with the Great Purity.\nWith resolve firm as mountains, attainment is certain—\nEverlasting spring, supreme joy, the Unborn.\n\nFifty-Seventh Entry\nIn the *Zhouyi’s* *Appended Judgments*, the Sage Confucius speaks of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny. He also says: “The sage uses this to purify the heart, withdrawing and concealing it in secrecy.”\n\nGood assembly, this place of secrecy is where the sage establishes life and finds refuge—it cannot be sought through knowledge or thought, nor perceived by the ears or eyes. Only when utmost sincerity purifies the heart until it is immaculately clean, radiantly bright, may one withdraw and conceal it here. Thus the sage takes the exhaustion of principle as the first step: when principle is exhausted, nature is fulfilled. Principle is the heart. When the heart is empty and luminous, nature is still and clear. At this stage of practice, clarity and stillness become profound, merging in an instant with the Great Void’s essence—this is how one reaches the True Empty Wisdom-Life, the great matter of the final outcome.\n\nDo you wish to know it?\nDo you wish to practice it?\n\nAlas! A hymn says:\nNature finds no dwelling without life,\nLife finds no master without nature.\nWhen nature and life merge in perfect unity,\nThey naturally conceal themselves here.\nTrue fire blazes through the Great Void,\nWisdom’s wind lightly dances.\nIn an instant, heaven and earth melt,\nThe Supreme Ultimate rounds itself thus.\n\nFifty-Eighth Passage\nZhou Lianxi and Master Yichuan said: “Reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not equal to studying one *Gen* hexagram.”\n\nGood assembly, can the *Gen* hexagram alone fully encompass the meaning of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*?\nThe assembly remained silent, their reverence deepening, and entreated elucidation.\n\nThe master said: *Gen* means “to halt.” The doubled *Gen* is *Gen* itself—halting again and again, halting at utmost goodness, resting in the Great Mean. Herein lies the consummation of the sage’s work. Thus the hexagram’s judgment states: “Halting at the back, one does not grasp the body. Walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame.” The back stands opposite the heart. It does not say “halt the heart” but “halt the back,” for the heart has forgotten the self. When the heart forgets the self, naturally both self and others are forgotten, sounds and forms dissolve, and one enters the wondrous realm prior to heaven. What calamity of the world could then arise? Is this not simplicity and wonder?\n\nThe most sublime principles of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* are no more than this. Its vast analogies: the four bodhisattvas correspond to the four images of the *Yi*, the eight vajras to the eight trigrams. The twelve lines of the *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams mirror the solar terms of a year. The dragon girl becomes a boy at seven—there are six lines in a hexagram, and the seventh, *Bo* turning to *Kun*, transforms into *Fu* and *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son, the image of the yang dragon, hence the analogy of becoming a boy at seven. Purity without admixture is the image of *Qian*’s yang, hence the analogy of Sudhana the youth. The number fifty-five of heaven and earth—Sudhana’s fifty-three, plus two more—perfectly matches the number of pure yang in *Qian*. Thus the eighty-one fascicles are but the remnants of the sage’s teachings in the *Yi*. Therefore, Master Zhou’s claim that studying one *Gen* hexagram surpasses reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*—how could this not be so?\n\nYet if one speaks of the great sage transcending beyond the bounds of heaven and earth, towering alone in the truth of the Infinite, this too may be called a remnant.\n\nGood assembly, can you grasp this?\n\nA hymn says:\n\n\"To halt and halt again—halt without halting,\nOne must seek beyond words and images.\n*Gen*’s heart and *Gen*’s back merge into the Infinite,\nForgetting self and others, blending into the Great Harmony.\n\nThe Great *Yi* of Fuxi, primordial and formless,\nThe *Avataṃsaka*’s elder, embodying vast chaos.\nAll halting as one—utterly without method,\nMysterious yet again, empty yet not empty.\"\n\n**Fifty-Ninth Passage**\n*The Zhouyi’s* *Li* Hexagram, Third Line:\n\"At the sun’s decline, *Li*—\nNot drumming the jar to sing,\nBut sighing in great old age—\nOminous.\"\n\nThis single line reveals the sage’s illumination of the wandering soul’s transformations, the discourse on life and death.\n*Li* is radiant clarity.\nWhen one’s prior brightness wanes, the next follows like the sun’s descent into earth.\nThis flickering of spirit—dim or bright—\nHere, one abides in timely accord, drumming the jar to rejoice in heaven,\nThus brightness succeeds brightness, naturally and of itself.\nFailing to grasp the principle of life and death,\nHere, one flails in panic, qi muddled and heart bewildered,\nSighing without resolve—ominous indeed.\n\nThis ominousness is not the ominousness of worldly fortune.\nThis ominousness lies in a single misguided thought,\nA rebirth in another form—\nWho knows what creature it may become?\nThis ominousness cannot be spoken. Alas!\n\nGood assembly, how does one comprehend this?\nThe assembly bows, entreating elucidation.\n\nGood assembly, to comprehend this only at such a moment is already too late.\nOne must comprehend it here and now.\n\nThus, the fifth line of the *Li* Hexagram states:\n\"Taming the cow—\nSmooth and penetrating.\"\n\nPeople, driven by profit and fame, chasing emotions and things,\nRelying on brightness to scrutinize, flaunting wit and boasting ability—\nWhen do they ever turn inward to reflect on this flickering spirit?\nThe sage offers the metaphor of taming a cow.\nTo tame is to nurture and tend.\nThe cow is a docile beast; the female cow is gentle and yielding.\nNow, turn inward to reflect on emptiness, containing light within—\nLike herding a cow.\nIn all adversity and harmony, sounds and sights,\nMake this your practice.\nWith time, it becomes familiar, yielding and tranquil,\nThe nature of habit and blood qi naturally fades,\nThe original true nature naturally purifies.\nHere, dream and waking are like night and day in succession,\nLife and death like winter and spring in rotation—\nWhat ominousness remains?\n\nThe Chan school’s discourse on herding the ox derives from this.\nYet if we speak of the great sage’s wondrous union of form and spirit,\nThe mystery of neither life nor death—\nThis, too, is but a secondary mechanism.\n\nTake heed, take heed.\n\nA hymn says:\n\nOne grasps the stubborn ox by the fist,\nA three-stranded hemp rope threads its nose.\nShould it trample the crops, strike with the staff;\nIf stars scatter in the grass, lash with the whip.\nOnce untamed and stubborn, now docile and gentle—\nThe whip and tether forgotten, nothing remains,\nBefore the mountain, beneath the moon, it sleeps in deep snores.\n\n**Sixty-Entry**\nThe *Zhouyi·Xici* states: *\"The Changes have no fixed form; the spirit has no direction.\"*\nIt also says: *\"The Changes are without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—yet responsive, they penetrate all.\"*\nThus we know: the formless form is the great form of the Changes;\nThe spiritless spirit is the supreme spirit of the Changes.\nThis supreme spirit and great form are the *Xiantian Yi* (Precelestial Changes).\nThe Sage taught people to be without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—\nTo embody non-thought is to still the heart;\nTo embody non-action is to still the nature.\nDisciples, the master within this stillness and motionlessness\nIs the wondrousness of the Precelestial, the truth of the Wuji.\nIf one can directly accept this with utter sincerity and silent penetration,\nAll principles will naturally become luminous, and the one nature will merge with the Great Void.\nIn ordinary circumstances, responding to conditions,\nOne transforms without moving, accomplishes without acting,\nArrives without traveling, is trusted without speaking—\nStillness abides, movement illumines, sincerity resonates and connects.\nThus the spirit transforms without limit, no hidden place is unillumined,\nHeaven and earth cannot alter it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.\nThe early Confucians said: *\"You must believe the Changes existed before the trigrams.\"*\nHow true these words!\nAlas! If you, sirs, realize this now,\nThe entire principle of the Changes lies within yourselves,\nAnd all the sages and worthies stand in your shadow.\nIf not yet so, observe this circle—\nThe hymn says:\n\nThis circle, freely called \"One,\"\nReturns to roundness, named the Supreme Ultimate.\nWithin unmoving movement, the mechanism of opening and closing unfolds—\nThe Three Powers and the myriad things return to our profound secrecy.\nWhere they return is the center within the center,\nA vast expanse of Great Void, without trace.\nTo realize this is to be a person beyond Fuxi,\nBeyond the heavens of the Precelestial, delighting in true ease.\n\n**Sixty-First Entry**\nWhen Chongyang Patriarch first arrived at the South Garden’s Yilao Pavilion in Ninghai, where Master Danyang and his friend Zhan the Warrior were drinking, they saw the Patriarch approach and asked: *\"From where does the Master come?\"*\nHe replied: *\"From three thousand leagues away, I come especially to assist the drunk.\"*\nDanyang had once composed a poem with these lines; upon hearing them, he felt an immediate resonance. He invited the Patriarch to sit, offered rites, and inquired further.\nThe Patriarch said: *\"Where the Five Phases do not reach, before the one qi has arisen.\"*\nMaster Danyang rose in astonishment and bowed.\nFan Mingshu, standing nearby, remarked: *\"These ten words are simple yet utterly profound. If the Master is not an immortal, how could he speak thus?\"*\nDisciples, with a single glance, the Patriarch pointed to the original face before birth—\nA symbol of the most wondrous and subtle. How magnificent!\nBeyond the bounds of yin and yang—this is where the Five Phases do not reach.\nReturning to the prior state of nature and destiny—this is before parents were born.\nMaster Danyang, upon hearing this, awakened instantly and remained transcendent to the end.\nTruly rare and extraordinary!\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"The five qi return to the origin; the one true nature reverts to the root.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the above.\nDisciples, if you can spiritually awaken and penetrate the heart, directly apprehend this,\nAnd silently embody it in conduct—how wondrous!\nIf not yet so, listen carefully to my hymn.\nThe hymn says:\n\nSpirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls, intent—\nHarmonized and blended, they become one and round.\nBody and heart still and unmoving,\nIn the subtle and indistinct, the form precedes the image.\nNeither heart nor nature,\nNeither Buddha nor immortal.\nShattering the Great Void,\nBeyond the heavens of the Precelestial.\n\n**Sixty-Second Entry**\nMaster Yuchan said: *\"Before parents were born, there are endless living paths.\nAfter body and heart are still, the true mechanism of the Wuji reappears.\"*\nProfound indeed!\nOriginally, before birth, there was pure primordial qi,\nWithin which the supreme treasure resided.\nThe wondrousness of life’s generation was boundless and undifferentiated—\nThis is what is meant by endless living paths.\nSince birth, the heart of the infant gradually changes,\nThe original true nature daily shifts.\nThe cloudy obstructions of discriminating nature,\nThe misty delusions of false thoughts—\nAll day, one drifts amid karmic conditions.\nWhen will the original source be clarified?\nThus the Patriarch, in compassion, warns us with *\"body and heart unmoving,\"*\nAbruptly reversing the flow to return to the source—\nHow urgent and earnest!\nThe *\"body and heart\"* here do not refer to the deluded fleshly heart\nOr the illusory qi-blood body,\nBut to the original numinous wisdom, the formless Dharma-body.\nWhen the Dharma-body is still, true tranquility is attained;\nWhen numinous and wondrous, it is clear—this is the Jade Void.\nUtterly empty and still, one recovers the great image before the beginning,\nThe supreme truth of the Wuji.\nThe body alone precedes the image, suddenly transcending the realm of things—\nHow simple and wondrous!\nDisciples, do you wish to know this? To practice it?\nThe hymn says:\n\nBefore parents were born, a speck of the true,\nNot empty emptiness, called the primordial spirit.\nIn the wondrous stillness of the center within the center,\nSuddenly, the natural spring of the Wuji.\n\n**Sixty-Third Entry**\nThe Three Mao Lords of Destiny’s Office wrote:\n*\"The numinous terrace, pure and bright as an ice-jade vessel,\nOnly permits the primordial spirit to dwell within.\nIf you add even one thing to it,\nYour entire life will not be clear and void.\"*\nProfound indeed!\nDisciples, by this we may infer:\nFor those who cultivate the Way, the heart’s purity and simplicity are paramount—\nUtterly genuine, utterly unadorned, without a single speck of defilement.\nOnly then can one become a person of the Clear and Quiet Dao.\nMaster Danyang said: *\"If the heart is not free of wine, sex, wealth, and anger,\nEven if you attain the wondrous and subtle, it is as if you had nothing.\"*\nThus Master Lian said: *\"When the heart dies, the spirit lives;\nWhen emotions are forgotten, the Dao naturally abides.\"*\nNow observe our kind:\nIf the heart has not died and the two emotions are not forgotten,\nIt is essential to freeze the hearts of greed and delusion, anger and hatred, love and desire.\nOnce these three hearts are resolved,\nAll other hearts—pursuit of fame, profit, and the like—will naturally vanish.\nIf these three hearts are not resolved,\nTo escape the wheel of rebirth and suddenly transcend birth and death—\nI dare not promise this.\n\nMay each of you devote yourselves with utmost sincerity—resolve swiftly, resolve swiftly—and together swim in the boundless realm of Nothingness, the wondrous and pristine precelestial realm of pure emptiness. I earnestly urge you to treasure this.\n\nA verse says:\nCease, cease—let all delusions rest,\nHumble, yielding—let hatred and anger melt like ice.\nThe root of desire and clinging love is most harmful;\nOnce resolved, one naturally transcends life and death.\nTo deplete spirit and qi, to waste primordial essence—\nNever deceive yourself like one covering ears to steal a bell.\nDo not fault this humble hut for its blunt words,\nFor it seeks only to blind your ears and deafen your eyes.\n\n**Sixty-Fourth Passage**\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy suspended a precious pearl, no larger than a millet grain, in the midst of the Empty Mystery, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Worthy ascended and led the celestial perfected deities and the boundless host of sages into the pearl, and none knew where they had gone.\n\nDisciples, how can this single pearl, so minute, contain the myriad perfected sages without a trace? If you can directly cast off the five desires, transcend the five phases, and penetrate this mystery, then the celestial pivot and jade balance will halt their turning, the four poles will shine with clarity, and the ten thousand dharmas will merge within. Naturally, you will leap beyond kalpas, return to the celestial root, rise above all ancestors, and embody only the Dao. You will wander freely in the Jade Capital upon the mountain, swimming in the Great Canopy of Jade Purity.\n\nHow splendid!\n\nThe *Golden Lotus Treasure Sutra* states: The Vast and Original Perfected One addressed the assembly, holding a golden lotus flower. Within it appeared a precious pearl, radiating a hundredfold radiance that pervaded the ten directions and all realms. It further says: Alas, sentient beings sink this golden lotus treasure pearl into the mire of defilement, willingly enduring the five turbidities and obscuring their own luminosity. If those with good roots awaken even a single thought of faith, they need only leap free from all dust and filth to naturally attain purity and radiance, illuminating the ten directions and three realms. All may delight in this—it is not mine alone.\n\nFrom this, we infer that this single pearl is fully and perfectly present within each person’s body. Thus it is said: When expanded, it fills the six directions, vast and all-embracing; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy, unfathomable even to gods and spirits.\n\nA verse says:\nA world hidden within a grain of millet,\nA Mount Sumeru contained in a mustard seed.\nA single point of jade-like emptiness,\nThe warp and woof of the ten thousand dharmas.\nBoundless, it holds all within,\nSubtle and secret, beyond the faintest trace.\nWithin the formless, it is attained,\nIts treasure-light resplendent in brilliance.\n\n**The Three Ultimates of Entering the Chamber**\n**First Ultimate Chapter**\nThe pure, empty, and wondrous true heart,\nUnobscured, radiant through past and present.\nThe unadorned Daoist, when fully resolved,\nRests in peace, letting go, delighting in the rare sound.\n\nI have often said: When the cinnabar terrace is without obscurity, essence and qi merge in harmony; when the numinous palace gathers dust, heart and spirit grow dim and scattered. Let me ask you: During your time here, have you ever reflected on the nature of your own blood and qi, the endowment of your constitution, the nature of your habitual defilements from the mundane world? Have they changed? Have the hearts of greed, anger, love, and desire; the hearts of profit, fame, and delusion; the hearts of talent, competitiveness, cleverness, and discernment—have they been relinquished? If not, then to truly master this authentic practice and wondrous subtlety, you must sever every trace without exception. Let go of the entire body, and the original numinous wondrousness will appear before you. Only then can you gather it back and retreat into secrecy.\n\nThis secret place, which the immortals and perfected ones call the \"Spirit Valley,\" is elegantly named the \"Mysterious Pass\"—the place beyond yin and yang, before father and mother, where I establish my being and secure my destiny. If you can prevent the six desires from arising and extinguish the three hearts, abiding where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet emerged, in the serene emptiness of the center, then reverse your gaze inward through the celestial eye to perceive the formless. Let the breath of the nostrils settle into silence. From silent breathing to true breathing, from true breathing to settled breathing, the six pulses become profoundly still, and the one true [reality] appears in indistinct clarity.\n\nProfoundly still, as if present,\nLuminous, as if I alone exist,\nVast and empty, the Jade Void,\nPure and complete,\nPerfectly bright, merging into the formless,\nNaturally empty and white.\nAt this point, heaven and earth cannot alter its substance,\nSun and moon cannot dim its radiance,\nGhosts and spirits cannot peer into it,\nYin and yang cannot fathom it.\nThe entire body becomes a mouth,\nYet no word can be uttered.\n\nThis humble hut has spoken too much, revealing the celestial mechanism in its loftiness. If you can truly believe and put this into practice with diligence, when the water arrives, the channel will form naturally. Alas, no one can exert effort on your behalf—each must comprehend this for themselves. Treasure this, treasure this.\n\n**Second Ultimate Chapter**\nThe first thought flows in harmony with form,\nWith the body, the nature and life take shape and the primordial is complete.\nWhen the heart is at peace and serene, the pearl of nature shines;\nWhen qi and breath merge in harmony, the treasure of life is numinous.\n\nNature and life—can one cling to just one side? Originally, before the primordial wisdom-life was awakened, the original nature had no master. If the Primordial remains in its natural state without cultivation, the wisdom-life has no place to abide. To achieve the wondrous fusion of nature and life, essence and spirit must merge in secrecy.\n\nIf you wish to clarify the original true nature, you must first still the heart;\nTo cultivate and refine the wisdom-life from its inception, you must truly nurture qi.\nStilling the heart lies in calming the intent and reversing the emotions;\nNurturing qi lies in settling the spirit and harmonizing the breath.\n\nMaster Yin said: Emotions are waves, the heart is a current, nature is water, and life is the source. At rest, they are one body; in motion, they are named differently. Pursuing this to its ultimate end, how much clarity is there?\n\nJoy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, aversion, and desire—these are emotions, arising from the stirring of intent, like waves rising with the wind. Thoughts, reflections, and the root of intent—these are the heart, arising from encounters with things, like water flowing when stirred. Stillness, the empty body, clear and bright—this is nature, like a current returning to still water. The primordial qi, harmonious and dense, misty and suffused—this is life, like the vast ocean’s original source, pure and limpid.\n\nIf you can extinguish emotions within the heart, it is like the wind subsiding and waves settling.\nIf the heart is stilled and the original nature revealed, it is like the current returning to still water.\nIf nature merges with life, it is like still water returning to the source.\n\nThe Patriarch of Purple Yang said: When the wind subsides and waves settle, the pearl of the heart shines with clarity; when the green pond is pure and still, the moon of nature radiates in full splendor.\n\nTo perfect the authentic and awaken the heart to its root, to fulfill life and return to the origin—all excellence lies herein. Thus, penetrating the profound barriers, one suddenly transcends the upward path, clearly ascending to reality and attaining the realization of true emptiness. How could this compare to those who, like plank-bearers, see but one side, or to deluded Chan practitioners imprisoned in ghostly caverns?\n\nTherefore, the *Yi Jing*’s \"Striking\" hexagram states: \"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life.\" The alchemical classics speak of melting into true nothingness, naturally giving rise to wondrous being—how profound! Though I, unworthy as I am, have lightly revealed the celestial mechanism and instantly forgotten my transgression, I now expound in greater detail, secretly pointing the way for the wise. If one meets this with sincere understanding, cultivates with diligence, and advances in practice, it is indeed heaven’s charge.\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* says: \"The three superior medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—are dimly discerned, subtly obscure.\" These three superior medicines are the original spirit, original qi, and original essence, neither existent nor empty, without sound or scent, faintly glimpsed yet profoundly hidden, without fixed form. The three are fundamentally one, a single body with three names.\n\nAlas! From the moment of birth, the human heart gradually falls into darkness. Through the stirring of intent and emotions, the five essences transform. Spirit is like water, qi like wood, intent like fire, and thought like earth. When earth is stirred, it generates emotional metal; metal restrains wood, and spirit is disturbed by wood, so the original spirit becomes the discriminating spirit. Water restrains fire, and qi scatters through the nose, so the original qi becomes blood and breath. Earth restrains water, and essence follows desire, so the original essence becomes the essence of sensory union.\n\nThus, to follow circumstances is to be human; to reverse and halt is to be an immortal of the origin. Patriarch Yuchan said: \"When the five phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm is a fiery pit; when the five phases return in reverse, the great earth yields seven treasures.\" Master Zhayang said: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth.\" Intent, as earth, can restrain water and generate emotional metal; it can subdue emotional metal and control the essence-water.\n\nHe also said: \"True earth restrains true lead; true lead restrains true mercury. Lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible, where body and heart remain still and unmoving.\" All of you—open your eyes, open your eyes! Calm body and heart, tame emotions and intent, and toward the sprouting of true yang, refine the original essence into original qi; still the original qi to merge with the original spirit; condense the original spirit to embody the great void. Thus, one transcends beyond the five phases, towering alone above the three realms. All such metaphors and analogies are but forced names.\n\nNow, for all you great virtuous ones, I have flung wide the eyes beyond heaven, unblocked the nostrils before form, and united the Primordial Celestial Worthy with the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, perfectly merging upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Lofty and rare, this sound has never been heard—like the Lord of Images before heaven.\n\nAh! The heart-seal of the mysterious origin, the mysterious pass of the Dao’s transmission, the true mechanism of the upward path, the elixir-treasure of celestial immortals—all is now pure and luminous.\n\nSomeone asks: When water is damp, fire is parched, metal flows, and earth crumbles, where then are nature and life?\n\nI shout: Troops follow the seal’s command; generals obey the order. With one swing of the wisdom-sword, the demonic armies’ courage shatters! Though it is said that peace is established by the general, it is not the general who first brings peace.\n\nTake care, take care.\n\n**Ultimate Principle, Chapter Three**\n\nPure and unadulterated, serene and untroubled—\npenetrating the myriad ages as one, threading the hundred kings to reach the mean.\nIts essence is wondrous before heaven; its function shines like the bright sun.\nThis is the heart-method of the Most High.\n\nIt enables the aspirant to extinguish the human heart and illumine the Dao-heart,\nto sever worldly desires and perfect heavenly principle,\nto empty the mind and still the nature, to settle qi and congeal the true,\nto forge the wisdom-life as unyielding gold, to polish the Dao-heart as lustrous jade,\nto transcend into the mysterious pass and attain the profound mystery of the boundless.\n\nThus the patriarchs transmitted mind with mind,\nemploying words to expound the Dao,\nvaluing the fullness of virtue and power, the dual flourishing of nature and life,\nembodying the wondrous emptiness of the Jade Void,\nand directly ascending to the supreme—\nthis is called the Perfected Person of the Highest Immortals.\nTo seek elsewhere is but heterodoxy and external paths.\n\nThe perfected ones of old—\ntheir conduct was tranquil, their breath deep,\ntheir sleep without slumber, their waking without care.\nThey knew not delight in life nor aversion to death.\nThus, living yet not possessing, they rejoiced in the heaven of non-birth;\ndying yet not forgotten, they understood the realm of non-death.\nUntransformed, they transformed—naturally, spontaneously.\n\nNow, our contemporaries fixate on life and death as the great matter,\nclinging to partial views of causes and conditions,\nembracing anxieties and attachments—\ntruly, empty-headed afflictions.\nThus, Perfected Master Yin said:\n\"Those who recklessly dispute life and death,\never-shifting in their emotions and perceptions,\nare called demons, not followers of the Dao.\"\n\nO assembly! If you can truly comprehend this,\nabide in the round and enter the chamber,\nharmonizing and blending with ease,\nneither affirming nor denying—\nAh! The wondrous and eternal true,\nthe settling of primordial qi,\nthe spirit without limit,\nthe embodiment of precelestial reality.\nIn the twelve double-hours,\namid sound and form, being and non-being,\nmovement and stillness, speech and silence,\nattain great freedom,\nunhindered and at ease—\ntrue joy without end, boundless felicity.\n\nIf the work is truly here,\nmy many words are of no use.\nNone but the most refined, single-minded, and utterly sincere in the world\ncan partake of this.\n\nTake care, take care.",

      "translated_text": "**The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings**\n*Scripture Title:* The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings\nCompiled by Miao Shanshi (courtesy name Taisu) of the Yuan Dynasty, edited by his disciple Wang Zhidao. Two fascicles.\n*Source Text:* Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Four Prefaces to The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings**\n\nThe transmission of the Daoist lineage extends far into antiquity. At the beginning, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Chaos, through the subtleties of the Image-Prior, forcibly named it the *Dao/Way* and established teachings to assist it with *virtue/power*, as recorded in the Five Thousand Words. Yet the essence beyond words—subtle, wondrous, and profoundly interconnected—remains inexpressible, unfathomable, and can only be forcibly described.\n\nFrom the *Virtue/Power* received by Guan Yinzi, his ten disciples each grasped its mysteries. Thinkers like Liezi and Zhuangzi, along with immortals such as Anqisheng, Li Xianqing, and Master Ge the Immortal, transmitted it in succession, each with their own scriptures. Though branches diverged and schools flourished, generations of adepts never lacked in grotto-heavens and blessed lands.\n\nSince the Zhou and Han dynasties, only Yinzi inherited the ancestral seat. The Golden Portal Emperor then succeeded the lineage, transmitting it to the Eastern Florescence Emperor, who passed it to Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang. Zhongli transmitted it to Immortal Lü of Pure Yang, who passed it to Immortal Liu Haichan. Liu transmitted it southward to Zhang Ziyang. The Five Ancestors—Ziyang in the north—transmitted it to Wang Chongyang and the Seven Perfected, splitting the lineage into two streams.\n\nOnly Master Li Qing’an, receiving transmission from Wang Jinchan, disciple of the White Immortal Yu Chan, became a patriarch of the Mysterious Gate, inheriting the orthodox transmission of the lineage to illuminate truth. Many of his collected works circulate in the world.\n\nMaster Miao Taisu studied under him, imprinting the essentials upon his heart—truly, the indigo blue surpasses the plant. Embracing this Dao, he modeled his teachings on the mind-methods of the ancestral lineage, distilling the pivotal mysteries from various scriptures. Ascending the hall and entering the chamber, he extracted their essentials, adding a turn of phrase to the ancestral words and composing verses on them. Arranged by the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, with three additional cases for the Three Ultimates, his disciples, led by Wang Cheng’an, compiled and titled it *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.\n\nEvery word clarifies the root; every sentence returns to the source. Essence and function unite in the One Real; the Three Teachings merge in perfect harmony. It enables one to roam freely beyond Fuxi’s trigrams, to swim in the realm of the Mysterious Sage and the Image-Prior—how sublime!\n\nThe Recluse of Huayang, Tang Gong, donated funds to carve the woodblocks and disseminate it widely. His intent is truly magnanimous.\n\nIf there are resolute seekers who, beyond these *Great Cases*, possess the eye of the Infinite, piercing through every barrier to achieve sudden clarity and sixfold penetration, then the Daoist lineage will shine brightly, transmitted without end—would this not be splendid?\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Ke Daochong, the Profoundly Silent Daoist of Jinling.\n\n---\n\nThe Heart of the Infinite Heaven embraces all methods; the wisdom-eye of the Image-Prior illumines boundlessly. When nature is utterly empty, the six penetrations and eight directions open; when the mind’s clouds obscure, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions arise. Thus, to open the eye beyond heaven, one must first clarify the mind of the world.\n\nIn my youth, I studied Confucian learning; in adulthood, I admired the Mysterious Wind. I delved into the origin of principle and investigated the wonders of the heavenly Dao, seeking ever farther and probing ever deeper—yet truly, it seemed unattainable.\n\nBy what fortune in a past life did I arrive at the Central Harmony and, in due time, receive the teachings of Master Taisu? His instructions dissolved my burdens, purifying my mind to return to the origin and restore the root. My spirit congealed, my *qi* settled, and I found peace in destiny and joy in heaven. His guidance was earnest and multifaceted, his transformation gentle and thorough.\n\nOne day, the foremost disciple of the Central Harmony presented me with the Master’s teachings—ascending the hall and entering the chamber, expounding the treasures of the Dharma-sea, and the poetic verses of the mind-methods of the Daoist lineage—entitled *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.\n\nIn quiet contemplation, I savored its words and saw how it dissects the One Origin and severs the myriad methods, shaking out the marrow of the host of immortals and threading through the hearts of the ancestral lineage. It sharpens the sword of wisdom, hones the blade of spirit, slays the Three Corpses, executes the Six Thieves, unbinds fetters, shatters shackles, tears through the net of doubt, and severs the hindrance of afflictions. It revives the dead, saves the living, guides the enlightened, and penetrates the great function and great mechanism, reaching the ultimate subtlety and supreme mystery—roaming in the unbegun, delighting in the birthless.\n\nIts wonders of principle and heavenly Dao, its mechanisms of illuminating the mind and seeing nature, are perfectly merged within, each made clear. Having attained such thorough comprehension, how could it remain unheard?\n\nYet this is but the residue of the Master’s teachings. Having tasted its benefits, I joyfully commissioned artisans to carve the woodblocks, that all men of fortune and wisdom in the world might, through this text, gain a single eye, force open the barriers, shatter the Great Void, return to the original wholeness, revert to pure simplicity, and wander boundlessly in the Infinite, whistling and carefree in the Prior Heaven. This is my sincere wish.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Tang Daolin, the Recluse of Nine Bends of Green Creek in Jinling.\n\n---\n\nThe sagely immortal Dao embodies the Mystery of the Prior Heaven, its function wondrously manifesting in the myriad methods. Through sincerity and quiescence, it secretly secures the root; through humility, reverence, harmony, and compliance, it beautifully benefits the world.\n\nMaster Taisu’s *Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings* fully reveals essence and function, perfects cultivation and practice, merges the One Real into the wondrous, and unites the myriad principles in returning to the origin. It enables one to nurture primordial *qi*, fuse with the harmonious wisdom-life, still the root-nature, and pacify the mind of the Dao—how magnificent!\n\nHow could it be compared to those who fret over silent emptiness, lacking the blade’s edge, or merely chant a tune of heterodox teachings?\n\nI once heard that the Master supplemented the *Yichuan’s Commentary on the Book of Changes*, completing its three unfinished parts. Silently astonished, I exclaimed: Master Yichuan was one of the Six Masters of the former lineage—yet even he left things unfinished. Now Master Taisu has supplemented them. What manner of man is he? I regretted not being able to meet him at once.\n\nBy chance, I was appointed to a post at the Southern Terrace. In my leisure, I visited the Central Harmony with three or five colleagues.",

      "translated_text": "Upon first meeting the Master, I found him serene, tranquil, and as unperturbed as still water. When I respectfully sought his instruction, his bearing was gracious and expansive—each question met with an answer precise, lucid, and illuminating, leaving one’s mind suddenly clear and unbounded. I was further granted the privilege of examining his supplementary annotations to the unfinished portions of the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, as well as his *Net of Changes for Resolving Doubts*. Truly, his words were concise yet principle ran through them like a thread; pure, refined, and luminous, they dissolved in an instant the doubts that had accumulated over years of study. Take, for instance, the very first case of *The Great Public Cases*: it dissects with perfect clarity the subtle pivots of the Three Teachings, the central and upright essence and function, and the partial, obstinate views—all laid bare. He cites the classics throughout, each matter and principle, each mystery and wonder, as if gazing into a mirror where coarse and fine are reflected in perfect roundness. He speaks of the three bodies merging at the ultimate, the six desires sinking into emptiness, the return to the origin through extreme stillness, and the embodiment of the Dao in movement and repose. He teaches that one nurtures one’s heavenly nature with boundless compassion, the mind of the Dao with frugality and restraint, and profound virtue with humility and yielding. He expounds on the five poisonous *qi* in daily sounds and the ten forms of steadfast illness. He lifts the *Gen* trigram of Mount Jian to illuminate the true work of stillness, and inscribes the *Li* trigram of the setting sun to reveal the illusory nature of life and death. The marvels drawn before the hexagrams, the profound mysteries beyond the images, wielding the sacred sword of Fuxi, he cleaves open the mysterious gates of the sages, manifesting the primordial pearl of Yuanshi to illuminate the celestial valleys of the immortals. Such insights were never before articulated by the Daoist and Confucian masters of past generations. Indeed, his wisdom transcends ancient and modern, merging beginning and end in the profound—who but one of the highest primordial clarity could achieve this? As the Sage declared: *\"He who acts before Heaven does not contravene it.\"* How true!\n\nHow could I not pay him the reverence due a teacher? Here, I briefly recount the Master’s virtue and its manifestations, his deeds and principles—his marvelous teachings that precede even the words of the primordial. The full embodiment of this lies in the subtle, unbroken practice of those whose wisdom and resolve are aligned.\n\nFrom the Acting Surveillance Commissioner of the Branch Secretariat, Wang Zhujing, with bowed head, this preface.\n\nTrue gold fears not the fire; the more it is tempered, the brighter it shines. Flawless jade, free of the slightest blemish, becomes a treasure through careful polishing. But rotten wood and weary iron—even the hands of a master craftsman cannot shape them. Thus, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* said: *\"One with the talent of a sage who receives the Dao of a sage finds it easy. But how many are those who are born knowing?\"* Yet even those with innate roots of wisdom, whose understanding pierces all and fuses ten thousand things, still depend on the guidance of an enlightened teacher to ascend directly to the highest realm.\n\nWe, however, are of shallow fortune and dull roots, our karmic force ever overpowering our Dao-force. To claim we might leap directly to sudden enlightenment would be self-deception. But if we submit to the Master’s forging and polishing, proceeding from sincerity to clarity, from emptiness to penetration, from discipline to wisdom—step by step treading solid ground, heart by heart embodying the great void—then over time, the turbid will settle undisturbed, and what is fragile will not shatter. Naturally, we will become pure, firm, and unyielding. Is this not the greatest beauty?\n\nOur Master, Shifan the Immortal Boat of the True Hermitage, stands lofty in the realm beyond form, his teachings flourishing at the center of all things. He elucidates the profound mysteries of the Supreme’s heart, dissects the marrow of Fuxi’s legacy, overturns the Three Teachings to fuse them into one origin, sweeps away heterodox sects, and opens wide the true Dao. He carves and refines later students, establishing the great foundation of the lineage, refining the exalted and luminous to reach the primordial境. Thus, good friends and radiant companions gather like clouds, while enlightened lords and worthy ministers follow like the wind. Those who come in emptiness depart in fullness—truly, his silence is more trustworthy than speech. Those near are delighted; those afar come—all accomplish without striving.\n\nWe now see that words never spoken expand the myriad wonders beyond the reach of thought and discourse. The *\"Dao that can be spoken\"* is not the eternal Dao; it encompasses all virtues and stands alone before the throne of the Emperor of Images. Who but one of the utmost clarity, penetrating the ultimate transformation, could partake in this?\n\nDaily, I attend the Hall of the Profound, fortunate to be moistened by the rain of his dharma. I have collected the pearls and jades of his ascending the hall, the treasures of his entering the chamber. Yet though the teachings branch in many directions, their principles converge at one ultimate point. The unresolved cases left by the sages and immortals of past ages—our Master has decisively and clearly settled them all. He has titled this work *The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching*, arranging it into sixty-four cases to correspond with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*. The three cases for entering the chamber mirror the Three Ultimates. Truly, for those of resolute spirit who directly undertake the forging and refining, who inwardly comprehend and diligently practice—dissolving the allure of sound and form, deepening insight into emotion, polishing the heavenly heart, and opening the eye of the Dao—they will suddenly transcend birth and death, illuminating past and present. The great function and the great mechanism are both fully present here. What boundless joy could surpass this?\n\nIf one can truly be thus, one will not have failed the Master’s earnest teachings, nor squandered this once-in-a-millennium encounter. Though I am but one man steering the ferryboat of this transmission...\n\nIn the year *Taiding Jiazi*, his disciple, Cheng’an Wang Zhidao, with bowed head, respectfully writes this preface.\n\n**The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching, Volume One**\nBy Master Golden Lotus of the Dao, Shian the True Hermitage (Miao Taisu)\nCompiled by his disciple Cheng’an Wang Zhidao\n\n**Ascending the Hall to Illuminate the Ancient: Sixty-Four Cases**\n**First Case**",

I regretted not being able to meet him at once.\n\nBy chance, I was appointed to a post at the Southern Terrace. In my leisure, I visited the Central Harmony with three or five colleagues.",

It is the great image before heaven and earth began, the supreme spirit before father and mother were born—unattainable by thought, ungraspable by words. For it has no fixed form to discard, and the mind’s wonder has no direction. Only the Dao that cannot be spoken is the true and constant wondrous Dao; only the name that cannot be named is the original, forced designation.\n\nIf one clings to what can be named, one falls into external paths; if one clings to what can be spoken, one strays into heterodoxy.

It contains the germ of creation and abides before all phenomena—thus all under heaven dare not treat it as a subject. Those who attain this Dao instantly transcend the realm of things. Their nature mirrors the great void, circulating through the six directions without hindrance, moving and resting unimpeded.\n\nTherefore, the Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas—flowing freely, it may turn left or right. Subtle, it may take on color or sound. Gazing, it is before you; suddenly, it is behind. Though this be so, only when all entanglements cease at once and the single thought returns to the center does one realize the primordial Dao has always been self-existent, needing no external source.\n\nDoes the assembly understand?\n\n**Verse:**\nHeart is Dao, Dao is heart—\nno need to ponder or seek apart.\nFame and profit melt like snow, the spirit-terrace gleams bright;\nlove and attachment thaw like ice, the sea of wisdom runs deep.\nWind sweeps dust clean, the golden tiger crouches low;\nclouds disperse, mist clears, the jade dragon sings.\nThe sky is clear, the sun’s light full and radiant—\nall sounds hush, the great tone ceases.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High says: Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao.\n\nWhen thoughts lean askew, they are corrected by reversion. When the heart harbors delusion, it is restored by awakening. This righting and awakening is itself the movement of the Dao. The sage’s heart is like the great void—pure, still, and natural, without the slightest bias or delusion, embodying the Middle Way. In such rightness and awakening, what need is there for cultivation?\n\nThus it is said: Abandon learning and have no cares. Purity is the rectitude of all under heaven. Treading humility, dwelling in harmony, blending with softness and weakness—this is propriety, and also the function of the Dao. All things under heaven arise through birth; without birth, there would be nothing.\n\nAssembly, righting corrects the crooked; awakening illumines delusion—these are the movement and function of the Dao.

If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao—thus the saying arose.\n\nThe superior person is fundamentally noble and pure, their roots deep and untainted. Thus, with a single touch, they turn; their paths open in all directions, naturally unshakable, unmovable even by heaven and earth. Light and swift, continuous and subtle, they advance with vigor, unwavering from beginning to end.\n\nThe middling person, however, is entangled by karmic consciousness, bound by profit and fame, inevitably half-doubting, half-believing, wavering between presence and absence.\n\nThe inferior person is arrogant and impure, boasting of hollow wealth and empty renown, prizing superficial splendor while despising simplicity and sincerity. Thus, when they hear the sage’s Dao, they laugh derisively. If the inferior person heard the Dao and did not laugh, it would not be the supreme Dao. Therefore, the inferior person crafts clever words to mock and ridicule—yet this is no cause for surprise.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThose who comprehend the Dao and attain clarity instantly forget the body, like one in a stupor; they are unmoved by worldly affairs, like the indolent. Humble and unassuming, they blend with all, treating all beings as equals.

      "translated_text": "The sage, transcending all going and coming, comprehends the absence of birth and death—thus the Great Void remains undivided, neither moving nor abiding. Alas! All people lack mastery over this heart, which flickers and vanishes, emerging and submerging in the mechanisms of existence without end. Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to the pursuit of life.\n\nThose who crave abundant nourishment for life find their clothing and food ever insufficient; those who chase wealth and fame find their desires and reputations never sated. As their hearts are perpetually unsatisfied, they indulge the six desires and seven emotions, the Three Corpses and Six Thieves, exhausting their minds and depleting their strength, cunningly scattering their spirit. This causes the fire of the heart to blaze upward while the water of essence seeps downward, water and fire at odds, giving rise to illness, suffering, and torment that persist until death.\n\nOnly those who attain the Dao awaken to the illusory nature of karmic consciousness and worldly attachments. Thus, they reverse their emotions to restore their original nature, emptying the heart to embody the Dao. Naturally, fire no longer flares upward, nor does water leak downward. With water and fire in harmony, spirit and qi merge intimately, ultimately realizing the unborn—and thus escaping the realm of death.\n\nKnow then that when people, in life, move toward the realm of death, it is because water and fire remain unbalanced, spirit and qi either united or sundered—hence the thirteen. Fire corresponds to seven, water to six; together they make thirteen. The interpretations of this passage are many and varied, each clinging to its own view and fixating on fragmented forms. Some speak of the nine orifices and four gates, claiming that of ten parts, three pertain to life and seven to death. Others cite the waxing and waning of the moon, yet these explanations bear no relevance to self-cultivation and progress.\n\nOnly the Ancestral Master, the True Man Yuchan, spoke of the seven emotions and six desires, while my former teacher addressed the disharmony of water and fire—these interpretations are most apt. The text flows coherently, and one may directly apply its teachings. If emotions and desires are not stilled, if water and fire remain unbalanced, then the center lacks steadfast mastery—how can one escape the terrors of tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, and weapons? Only when spirit and qi merge as one does the self and the external world dissolve into oblivion.\n\nDisciples, clearly grasp the true meaning of this passage and strive to practice it diligently. There is no need to inquire further into the great matter of life and death.\n\n*Hymn:*\nLife and death of humankind depend on yin and yang,\nYet transcending yin and yang, one returns to the constant.\nWhen water and fire blend in harmony, the realm of death is forgotten;\nQi and spirit, firmly sealed, guard the way of life.\nOx and man both vanish, the nature shines in clarity,\nGull and self, devoid of emotion, both mechanisms fade.\nPointing to the transient forms, the wise return to their native home—\nCease delusion in counting appearances, playing with words.\n\n**Sixteenth Parable**",

All things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—none confer rank upon them, yet they remain naturally so.\n\nThe great Dao’s life-giving is inexhaustible; its mysterious virtue nurtures all equally. Things take form according to qi, and circumstances achieve fruition in due time. Thus, all things without exception revere the Dao as their root and honor virtue as their origin. Therefore, the Dao’s loftiness surpasses antiquity yet does not claim precedence; virtue’s supreme value perfects the myriad things yet does not assert priority. Thus, those who embody the Dao—none under heaven dare treat them as subjects, and lords and kings cannot befriend them—they ever delight in spontaneity.\n\nOf old, Emperor Yao offered the throne to Master Xu You, who declined and withdrew; Emperor Shun offered it to Master Shan Juan, who fled into the mountains. Likewise, Master Zhuang rested beside Ziling, refusing a hundred *yi* of gold and declining a ministerial post. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained the Dao and steadfast scholars—many have refused even three imperial summons—truly exemplifying that the Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor require no rank.\n\nYet we of this generation, having not yet realized the true principle nor attained genuine merit, remain ignorant of the Dao’s wondrous profundity and the subtle mysteries of its dark principle. Relying on shallow measurements and narrow views, we delude the foolish masses, flaunting empty words to seek fame and profit—how utterly shameless!

Without the slightest trace.\nIf you truly grasp this, turn back and practice it with diligence—suddenly you will tread upon your native land, and all the familiar paths of former realms will vanish entirely.\nThis is called *\"leaping beyond the realm of things,\"* wandering and chanting in the immortal homeland, carefree in true joy—how wondrous!\n\n**Verse:**\nA step need not depend on the foot—\nYet still it traverses the journey’s course.\nNot-walking walks in marvelous subtlety,\nNowhere is not vast and level.\nThe heart’s path, truly empty and cut off,\nThe celestial thoroughfare—Dao’s great flourishing.\nTreading through the wondrous mystery’s aperture,\nJoyous and blissful, beyond birth and death.\n\n**Twentieth Passage**\nThe Most High said: I possess three treasures, which I hold and guard.\nThe first is *compassion*, the second *frugality*, the third *not daring to be first in the world*.\nTo dwell in magnanimity and act with benevolence, aiding others and benefiting all things, moved by kindness toward all—this is *compassion*.\nCompassion nurtures one’s celestial nature.\nTo abide in one’s allotted place, simplifying the heart and moderating affairs, speaking with caution and acting with care, sincere and unwavering—this is *frugality*.\nFrugality nurtures the heart of Dao.\nTo receive others with emptiness, to cultivate oneself with humility, gentle and yielding, lowly and deferential, yielding and holding back—this is *not being first*.\nNot being first nurtures the supreme virtue.\nDisciples, if one is truly compassionate, none in the world can oppose them—thus they are called *courageous*.\nIf one is truly frugal, true joy abounds—thus they are called *expansive*.\nIf one truly does not put themselves first, humble yet exalted in glory, lowly yet unsurpassable—thus they perfect their capacity as leaders.\nIf a follower of Dao lacks compassion, frugality, or humility, they not only lose the Dao, but misfortune will follow.\nCan one not be vigilant and cautious, to preserve eternal and perfect good fortune?\n\nThe master descended from the seat, bowed with utmost sincerity to the assembly, and recited a verse:\nWealth and honor take humility as their root,\nNobility and eminence take lowliness as their foundation.\nHumble and ever-humble, the noble one is blessed;\nArrogant and ever-arrogant, one invites others’ reproach.\nMastering oneself, the heart is without delusion;\nForgiving others, the heart is without deceit.\nStill the heart, and desire has no hold;\nHarmonious and compliant, one delights in the subtle and serene.\n\n**Twenty-First Passage**\nThe Most High said: Words have their source; affairs have their ruler.\nOnly because of ignorance do they not know me.\nThose who know me are rare—thus those who model themselves after me are precious.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\nThus the resolute scholar delights in the Dao and forgets lowly status, abides in virtue and forgets poverty.\nThough outwardly in disarray, inwardly they cherish the supreme treasure.\nThus the sage’s original essence is perfectly luminous, and their great function brings boundless benefit.\nTherefore, every word strikes the mark, every affair is just and fitting.\nBefore words are spoken, their source is already present; before affairs arise, their ruler is already established.\nOnly those ignorant of this mystery speak much that is unwholesome, act with many biases, unaware that the great body of Dao and its marvelous function are quiescent, its central ruler responding and transforming without fixed direction.\nYet those who know this Dao are rare.\nIf one truly reverses their gaze to the original ruler, firmly preserving it within, then words and affairs will all be orderly and fitting, and nowhere will they not be beneficial.\nThey become rulers and teachers, revered by heaven and humanity—how surpassing!\nThus it is said: *\"Those who model themselves after me are precious.\"*\n\nDisciples, consider this: In this very moment, who governs speech, silence, and action?\n\n**Verse:**\nBefore the seven emotions arise, the mystery—\nWhen the six desires do not stir, the moment.\nSilent and still, truly forgetting the self,\nWithin the center—who is it?\nWord after word—what is there to say?\nAffair after affair—acting without acting.\nExquisite jade concealed within,\nA divine pearl shining of itself.\nAlas!

The Way of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus it ceaselessly generates and transforms, bringing boundless benefit to the world without harm.

      "translated_text": "From the *Wenshi Zhenjing*:\nThe multitude let the po govern the hun—when metal is in excess, wood is deficient. The sage lets the hun move the po—when wood is in excess, metal is deficient. Thus wood symbolizes the hun and nature, while metal symbolizes the po and the passions. Ordinary people follow their passions and chase delusion, so their passions are in excess while their nature is deficient. The sage gathers the passions into nature, so their nature is in excess while their passions are deficient. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth still the passions and dissolve perception, so that their original nature becomes perfectly luminous, with no lack or excess. They pacify the dead po and settle the hun, so that their wisdom-life is firm and unbreachable, with no leakage. When nature and passions merge as one, then metal and wood are without division.\n\nYet joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—love, aversion, and desire—are all passions. Stillness, clarity, and perfect luminosity are nature. Nature is one, while the passions are seven; they are many, and we are few. Thus we are ever overcome by karmic force, while the power of the Dao is vanquished. Disciples, how then can we overcome these seven beasts?\n\nAh, for others it is difficult to apply effort.",

We must immediately awaken and reflect inwardly. Should even one of these persist, swiftly repent and reform to become a true follower of the Dao. If one denies cause and effect, remains deluded, and refuses to change, these five faults will breed five kinds of poisonous qi, bringing self-inflicted calamity and suffering.\n\nIf self-righteousness remains uncorrected, it accumulates a malevolent qi;\nIf self-aggrandizement remains uncorrected, it accumulates a domineering qi;\nIf self-importance remains uncorrected, it accumulates an arrogant qi;\nIf self-proclaimed ability remains uncorrected, it accumulates a resentful qi;\nIf self-conceit remains uncorrected, it accumulates a haughty qi.\n\nSuch qi arises from the inherent shallowness of one’s constitutional temperament and the polluting habits of worldly winds.

I earnestly wish to hear of it.\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"I am able to unite my body with the mind, the mind with qi, qi with spirit, and spirit with nothingness. When there is the slightest presence, the faintest sound—whether distant beyond the eight wilds or near as the space between my brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness arises from the perception of my seven apertures and four limbs, or from the knowledge of my heart, belly, and six viscera. It is simply self-knowing, and nothing more.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu was overjoyed and reported this to Confucius. Confucius merely smiled and did not respond.\n\nDisciples, when you forget the self and enter the mystery, empty the mind and embody the Dao, then body and mind merge perfectly, spirit and qi fuse wondrously.

Long Shu said: \"In my village, praise brings me no honor; national disgrace brings me no shame. Gain does not make me rejoice, nor loss make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as myself, and myself as others. At home, I dwell as in an inn; my village, I see as a foreign land.\n\nAll these afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor adversity can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me—what illness is this?\"\n\nWen Zhi gazed at him intently and said: \"Ah! Your mind is empty—you are nearly a sage. The six apertures of your heart flow freely, yet one remains unopened. Now you take sagely wisdom as illness—this is beyond the reach of my shallow art.\"\n\nDisciples, Long Shu’s \"illness\" lies in his equanimity toward honor and disgrace, gain and loss, life and death, wealth and poverty, self and other—all met with a single smile. Thus, to realize sagely wisdom is to attain perfect roundness, the six penetrations unobstructed, naturally and effortlessly.\n\nWhy then is it said that one aperture remains unopened?\nPonder this in silence. If you penetrate this single aperture, you shall attain the leakage-free state.\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nLong Shu’s tenfold illness,\nThe enlightened should awaken to its proof.\nThe six penetrations, unobstructed and free,\nRecognize nature as the empty sky’s essence.\nWhen the upward aperture opens wide,\nThe one truth fuses with wisdom and life.\nLife and nature fully realized,\nLike jade in purity, gold in unyielding luster.\n\n**Forty-Second Passage**\nThe *Book of Master Chongxu* states: That which arises without cause yet is ever-present is the Dao. That which arises from arising, though ending, is not forgotten—this is constancy.\n\nThus, arising without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain an end is called constancy. Dying without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain death is called constancy.\n\nDisciples, this passage illuminates the constancy of the Dao’s essence, which knows no cessation.\n\n\"Without cause yet ever-present\" means arising from no origin, unaware of life as life—this is the Dao. Life without attachment to life—though the body dies, the fundamental nature does not perish—this is constancy. Thus, arising without use is called the Dao; embodying the Dao to attain an end is called constancy.\n\nThrough this, awaken to the wondrous constancy of the true Dao, which is the body of spontaneity. Why then fear impermanence?\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nSun and moon have brightness and darkness,\nThe Great Void knows neither.\nNature is the body of the Great Void—\nWhat change can birth and death bring?\nAlas! Though mulberry fields turn to seas,\nA single point remains serene and clear.\n\n**Forty-Third Passage**\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua said: \"Illumined by Heaven, penetrating the sagely, the six penetrations and fourfold thoroughfares—all is dimly and indistinctly still.\n\nThe stillness of the sage is not like the dragon’s stillness, which is still because it is good at stillness. The myriad things cannot disturb the sage’s heart—thus is he still.\n\nWhen water is still, it clearly reflects even the finest hairs, its levelness serving as a standard for the great craftsman. If still water alone is so luminous, how much more the sage’s spirit-filled heart?\"\n\nDisciples, this chapter focuses entirely on the word *stillness*.\n\nStudents are often swept away by adversity and fortune, obstructed by affairs and things, unable to endure. They seek a secluded place to rest, yet unwittingly add another thought—the thought of seeking stillness. Even in remote solitude, they find only more toil and distraction. How pitiful!\n\nThe Old Immortal of Nanhua, with the word *good*, reveals the essential work of true stillness. This *good* is not the good of good and evil, but the sage’s innate capacity.\n\nThe sage’s heart is empty, luminous, vast, and clear—still, round, and radiant, like a hanging mirror. When things come, it reflects them; when they depart, it is empty. No forms of beauty or ugliness remain. The mind is utterly limpid, ten thousand miles away yet brilliantly clear. Is this not simplicity and wonder?\n\nThus, if still water can so clearly and evenly reflect things, how much more the single luminous emptiness of the human heart? Truly penetrate this, and affairs will no longer disturb; the heart will cease its restless striving. Become a carefree Daoist—how light and free!\n\nA verse for contemplation:\nNeither abiding in movement nor stillness,\nUnobstructed in coming and going.\nWithin the four dignities,\nAttain great freedom.\nActing without acting,\nBenefiting without harming.\nA single point of emptiness,\nEncompasses the vastness of a sand universe.\n\n**Forty-Fourth Passage**\nAt the beginning of the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter in the *Book of Nanhua*, the Old Immortal answers questions about the three winds with two disciples.\n\nFirst, he speaks of the inequality of human and earthly winds—this aligns with Mencius’ saying, \"Things are unequal; such is their nature.\" Finally, he speaks of the heavenly wind: \"Though the myriad sounds differ, they let each be itself\"—the myriad apertures roar and sigh, all winds stilled and empty. Who is the master of this moment?\n\nFirst, he speaks of nature; then, of principle. Principle is one, yet its manifestations are many. Guest and host are distinct, yet the unequal is made equal.\n\nWithin this, he offers broad analogies to illustrate the endless transformations of things, all changes unified in the numinous. At the end, he uses his dream of the butterfly to encapsulate the chapter’s great meaning: suddenly, he dreams he is a butterfly, fluttering contentedly; suddenly, he awakens, and there is Zhuang Zhou. Does not know: was Zhou’s dream the butterfly, or the butterfly’s dream Zhou?\n\nBetween Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a boundary—yet here, he does not speak it plainly.\n\nDisciples, consider: who now dreams, and who awakens? Truly awaken to this clarity, and you will know that life and death, dream and waking, are equally subsumed in the great transformation, within which stands the solitary, towering one.\n\nThus it is said: Only with this great awakening do we know this was the great dream.\n\nIf this is not yet so, listen to my later verse:\nThings and self share the same womb, one source.\nIn inequality, equality—square and round alike.",

      "translated_text": "Each follows its passions to forge its karmic shell,\nYet returning to the root, all merge in the Great Ultimate’s ring.\nThe myriad sounds fall silent, heaven’s breath stills—\nOne mind, serene and solemn, knows the heart’s hidden depths.\n\nTransformation births and transforms through its own changes,\nDream and waking both forgotten, joy precedes all forms.\n\nIn the forty-fifth passage, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* says:\nConfucius taught Yan Hui the fasting of the mind. Hui asked, “May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?”\nConfucius said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at the resonance of *qi*. *Qi* is emptiness awaiting things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”\nHui said, “Before I received this teaching, there was truly only Hui. Having received it, there has never been a Hui—may this be called emptiness?”\nConfucius said, “It is complete.”\n\nDisciples, behold: the Sage declared a single word—*emptiness*—to transmit the fasting of the mind to Yan Hui. Profound indeed! Yan Hui, upon hearing it, penetrated it instantly and directly transcended to the realm of sages. “There has never been a Hui”—this is to say, he suddenly forgot the self, no longer knowing Hui existed. The Sage affirmed it as complete.\n\nNow, of seeing, hearing, speaking, and smelling—why did the Sage single out hearing for direct instruction? Because listening with the ears is the hearing of the common; it merely follows sound. Listening with the mind is the hearing of the worthy; it attains resonance. Listening with *qi* is the hearing of the sage—returning to the root.\n\nSince birth, each person is endowed with a Great Void, each receives a primordial *qi*. When the mind is empty, primordial *qi* flows freely; when *qi* stills, spirit shines bright and clear. Neither separate nor identical, their wondrous interplay severs the paths of the heart, polishing the sky of nature to flawless purity. Thus it is said: “An empty chamber generates light; auspiciousness abides in stillness. Attain the utmost emptiness, and the radiance of heaven shines forth—mysterious, and again mysterious.”\n\nHow fitting that the Buddha’s Avalokiteśvara, in the practice of perfect penetration, entered through hearing and attained the fruit of the Way—hence the name *Guanyin*. The ancient sages’ nature and the Way of Heaven are fully contained herein. How could one not hear of this?\n\nAlas, treasure this well.\n\nVerse:",

Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Let your heart be serene and still, free from restless striving. Let the heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your form. All things are boundless, yet people take them to be finite. Those who attain my Dao enter the gate of the boundless and wander the fields of the infinite.”\n\nDisciples, the original spirit of humanity cannot guard its dwelling, for it is disturbed by emotions giving rise to thoughts, and thoughts stirring the essence.

Thus, like a newborn calf, one is pure and whole, without contrivance. When mind and spirit merge as one, self and other are both forgotten, and one does not know the *how* yet naturally *is*. How fitting that the true master sang in true joy, for he truly knew—without clinging to the past.\n\nNow, our karmic burdens are heavy and blessings light; we cannot swiftly attain this. Yet if we can truly believe and sincerely, silently abide, proceeding thus with wholeheartedness, then when practice matures, it too will arise naturally.\n\nThe verse says:\nSet aside intellect, dismiss brilliance,\ncontain light in wondrous sincerity.\nBei Yi’s words were not yet done—\nNie Que had already forgotten his form.\nThe Dao meets the mind pure as jade,\nemotions empty, nature clear as ice.\nThe Great Void’s winds breathe softly,\nheavenly music silent, without sound.\n\n**Fifty-Third Passage**\nThe immortal elder of Nanhua said: \"The Dao is not fulfilled by petty conduct; virtue is not perfected by petty knowledge. Petty knowledge harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To be complete in joy is called attaining one’s will.\"\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"attaining one’s will\" not in terms of carriages and caps, but rather that nothing could augment their joy. Today’s \"attaining one’s will\" refers to carriages and caps. Yet when carriages and caps rest upon the body, they are not one’s nature and life—they are but transient lodgings of the external.\n\nDisciples, the sage treasures and preserves the spirit, finding joy in the peace and harmony of nature and life. Thus, they are content in poverty and delight in the Dao, not taking carriages and caps as honor, lest they lose their pure and lofty aspirations. How much less should one, in straitened circumstances and following the vulgar, indulge in petty knowledge and petty conduct, becoming a burden to the Dao and virtue!\n\nTo lose the self in things, to forfeit one’s nature to custom—what is there to say of this? Be warned, be cautious.\n\nThe verse says:",

      "translated_text": "Worldly affairs shift like clouds,\nHeat and cold reverse in the turn of a hand.\nThe heart grows cold to fame and profit,\nWhile the nature of Dao and virtue is like orchids and irises.\nThose with purpose drift and wander,\nThose without desire stand firm as Mount Tai.\nUnfettered and unbound,\nGreat aspirations delight in leisurely ease.\n\n**Fifty-Fourth Entry**\nAt the feast of repose in the Southern Florescence, Shu Guo Zijing asked: \"Where does the Dao reside?\"\nThe Perfected One said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nShu Guo said: \"Be specific, then you may proceed.\"\nThe Perfected One pointed to an ant before them: \"It is in the ants.\"\nShu Guo said: \"Why so lowly?\"\n\"It is in the millet and barnyard grass.\"\n\"Why even lower?\"\nThe Perfected One pointed to the bare ground: \"It is in the tiles and rubble.\"\n\"Why still lower?\"\n\"It is in the excrement and urine.\"\nShu Guo did not comprehend.\n\nHow clumsy! Our Most High has said: \"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\" And again: \"The great Dao overflows—it may be found to the left or right.\" The Proclaimed Sage said: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.\" From this, we may infer that the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence borrowed the things before his eyes to reveal the original source of the Dao. Alas that Shu Guo had no grasp of it!\n\nThe Dao fully manifests in every thing, perfectly complete in every instance—this is its \"nowhere absent.\" Like a single point of mine: wherever the eye falls, there is no limit. Where could one go and not find the Dao? Thus we know the Old Immortal’s first answer laid bare his heart and liver, while the four that followed were but secondary devices, born of necessity.\n\nDisciples, if you can truly grasp the Perfected One’s first answer, you will stand towering and alone, unbound and unobstructed. Do you understand, venerable ones?\n\nAh! Today’s Chan masters—with their \"cypress tree in the courtyard,\" \"wine table in the hall,\" \"three pounds of hemp,\" \"three punches,\" \"dry shit-stick,\" \"Buddha-dung heap\"—all their various cases derive from this. Thus Elder Feng the Venerable Master said: \"Before Kumārajīva was born, there were already the *Nanhua* and the *Liezi*.\" Master Zhu Wengong said: \"Chan arose from the Daoists; today’s patch-robed monks merely repackage and expound it.\" How could this not be so?\n\nIf you, gentlemen, can cut through doubt in an instant and fuse understanding to its depths, then the myriad dharmas will flow as one, and the Three Teachings will merge into unity. Why then contend over skill or superiority, over self and others, right and wrong? Rather, rejoice in great peace and become a transcendent great man—would this not be splendid?\n\nThe verse says:\nThe myriad things, three inches—one source of Dao,\nBefore a word is raised, it is already luminously clear.\nThe Southern Florescence’s intent fully reveals the wondrous,\nWhile Dongguo’s doubts fail to penetrate the mystery.\nTurbid qi clouds and deludes the original nature,\nBut a pure wind dispels the haze to reveal the primordial sky.\nSix penetrations, four attainments—utterly unobstructed,\nThe Three Teachings gathered into one perfect circle.\n\n**Fifty-Fifth Entry**\nThe Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence said: \"Scholars of later ages are unfortunate: they no longer see the purity of heaven and earth, nor the great body of the ancients. The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world.\"\n\nTake the learning of Hui Shi, for example: he held that the myriad things are entirely the same and entirely different, that heaven and earth form a single body. The debaters of the world delighted in this. He spoke of eggs having fur, chickens having three feet, Ying possessing all under heaven, dogs being interchangeable with sheep, horses laying eggs, tadpoles having tails, fire being not hot, mountains having mouths, wheels not touching the ground, eyes not seeing, fingers not reaching, the unreachable never ceasing, tortoises being longer than snakes, the carpenter’s square not being square, the compass not making circles, the chisel not fitting the mortise, the shadow of a flying bird not moving, the speed of an arrow having moments of neither motion nor stillness, dogs not being dogs, a yellow horse and a black ox making three, a white dog and a black fox cub never having mothers, and a one-foot rod halved daily lasting ten thousand generations without end. Debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, exhausting themselves without end.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s discourse, though he deemed it most worthy, merely adorned others’ minds, altered their intentions, and could win over their mouths—but not their hearts. He constantly sought to surpass others for fame, weak in virtue but strong in things, restless and unable to settle, chasing after things without return. He exhausted himself in echoes and forms, racing shadows in vain. How pitiful!\n\nDisciples, the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence specifically cited Hui Shi’s talent to conclude this chapter. His intent was to warn that people of later ages, light in qi and meager in fortune, would no longer embody the purity of heaven and earth or the great body of the sages. Instead, they would prize quick-wittedness and agility, answering long with short, east with west, being with non-being. When pressed and unable to reply, they would turn the question back on others. They teach the young to wield glib tongues, while gentlemen, slow of speech, struggle to respond. A single mind bent on victory, self-aggrandizing and self-important, they stir up the vulgar, deceive the foolish, spout grand words, and fancy themselves universal transformers. Gradually, this becomes a pernicious habit—how lamentable!\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Sealed are the cheeks and tongue.\" And again: \"Coming and going in distraction, friends follow your thoughts.\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nVenerable ones, if you can see through such things, awaken and comprehend fully, you should inwardly cherish your light, treasure and nurture celestial harmony, and not emulate those who flaunt deceit and delusion. Instead, return to simplicity and restore purity—this alone suffices.\n\nThe verse says:\nTo learn the Dao and cultivate the mind, return to simplicity and purity,\nSimplicity and purity need no further seeking.\nMouthing empty threefold mysteries, the tongue wags in vain,\nWhile a hundred schemes at the eye’s edge misdirect the heart.\nMozi’s frugality and diligence are still worth adopting,\nBut Hui Shi’s cunning and deceit are truly hard to admonish.\nThe wondrousness of non-speaking speech is thoroughly penetrating,\nSilent as an abyss, yet thunderous as a roaring great sound.",

A hymn says:\nNature finds no dwelling without life,\nLife finds no master without nature.\nWhen nature and life merge in perfect unity,\nThey naturally conceal themselves here.\nTrue fire blazes through the Great Void,\nWisdom’s wind lightly dances.\nIn an instant, heaven and earth melt,\nThe Supreme Ultimate rounds itself thus.\n\nFifty-Eighth Passage\nZhou Lianxi and Master Yichuan said: “Reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not equal to studying one *Gen* hexagram.”\n\nGood assembly, can the *Gen* hexagram alone fully encompass the meaning of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*?\nThe assembly remained silent, their reverence deepening, and entreated elucidation.\n\nThe master said: *Gen* means “to halt.” The doubled *Gen* is *Gen* itself—halting again and again, halting at utmost goodness, resting in the Great Mean. Herein lies the consummation of the sage’s work. Thus the hexagram’s judgment states: “Halting at the back, one does not grasp the body. Walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame.” The back stands opposite the heart. It does not say “halt the heart” but “halt the back,” for the heart has forgotten the self. When the heart forgets the self, naturally both self and others are forgotten, sounds and forms dissolve, and one enters the wondrous realm prior to heaven. What calamity of the world could then arise? Is this not simplicity and wonder?\n\nThe most sublime principles of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* are no more than this. Its vast analogies: the four bodhisattvas correspond to the four images of the *Yi*, the eight vajras to the eight trigrams. The twelve lines of the *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams mirror the solar terms of a year. The dragon girl becomes a boy at seven—there are six lines in a hexagram, and the seventh, *Bo* turning to *Kun*, transforms into *Fu* and *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son, the image of the yang dragon, hence the analogy of becoming a boy at seven. Purity without admixture is the image of *Qian*’s yang, hence the analogy of Sudhana the youth. The number fifty-five of heaven and earth—Sudhana’s fifty-three, plus two more—perfectly matches the number of pure yang in *Qian*. Thus the eighty-one fascicles are but the remnants of the sage’s teachings in the *Yi*. Therefore, Master Zhou’s claim that studying one *Gen* hexagram surpasses reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*—how could this not be so?\n\nYet if one speaks of the great sage transcending beyond the bounds of heaven and earth, towering alone in the truth of the Infinite, this too may be called a remnant.\n\nGood assembly, can you grasp this?\n\nA hymn says:",

      "translated_text": "May each of you devote yourselves with utmost sincerity—resolve swiftly, resolve swiftly—and together swim in the boundless realm of Nothingness, the wondrous and pristine precelestial realm of pure emptiness. I earnestly urge you to treasure this.\n\nA verse says:\nCease, cease—let all delusions rest,\nHumble, yielding—let hatred and anger melt like ice.\nThe root of desire and clinging love is most harmful;\nOnce resolved, one naturally transcends life and death.\nTo deplete spirit and qi, to waste primordial essence—\nNever deceive yourself like one covering ears to steal a bell.\nDo not fault this humble hut for its blunt words,\nFor it seeks only to blind your ears and deafen your eyes.\n\n**Sixty-Fourth Passage**\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy suspended a precious pearl, no larger than a millet grain, in the midst of the Empty Mystery, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Worthy ascended and led the celestial perfected deities and the boundless host of sages into the pearl, and none knew where they had gone.\n\nDisciples, how can this single pearl, so minute, contain the myriad perfected sages without a trace? If you can directly cast off the five desires, transcend the five phases, and penetrate this mystery, then the celestial pivot and jade balance will halt their turning, the four poles will shine with clarity, and the ten thousand dharmas will merge within. Naturally, you will leap beyond kalpas, return to the celestial root, rise above all ancestors, and embody only the Dao. You will wander freely in the Jade Capital upon the mountain, swimming in the Great Canopy of Jade Purity.\n\nHow splendid!\n\nThe *Golden Lotus Treasure Sutra* states: The Vast and Original Perfected One addressed the assembly, holding a golden lotus flower. Within it appeared a precious pearl, radiating a hundredfold radiance that pervaded the ten directions and all realms. It further says: Alas, sentient beings sink this golden lotus treasure pearl into the mire of defilement, willingly enduring the five turbidities and obscuring their own luminosity. If those with good roots awaken even a single thought of faith, they need only leap free from all dust and filth to naturally attain purity and radiance, illuminating the ten directions and three realms. All may delight in this—it is not mine alone.\n\nFrom this, we infer that this single pearl is fully and perfectly present within each person’s body. Thus it is said: When expanded, it fills the six directions, vast and all-embracing; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy, unfathomable even to gods and spirits.\n\nA verse says:\nA world hidden within a grain of millet,\nA Mount Sumeru contained in a mustard seed.\nA single point of jade-like emptiness,\nThe warp and woof of the ten thousand dharmas.\nBoundless, it holds all within,\nSubtle and secret, beyond the faintest trace.\nWithin the formless, it is attained,\nIts treasure-light resplendent in brilliance.\n\n**The Three Ultimates of Entering the Chamber**\n**First Ultimate Chapter**\nThe pure, empty, and wondrous true heart,\nUnobscured, radiant through past and present.\nThe unadorned Daoist, when fully resolved,\nRests in peace, letting go, delighting in the rare sound.\n\nI have often said: When the cinnabar terrace is without obscurity, essence and qi merge in harmony; when the numinous palace gathers dust, heart and spirit grow dim and scattered. Let me ask you: During your time here, have you ever reflected on the nature of your own blood and qi, the endowment of your constitution, the nature of your habitual defilements from the mundane world? Have they changed? Have the hearts of greed, anger, love, and desire; the hearts of profit, fame, and delusion; the hearts of talent, competitiveness, cleverness, and discernment—have they been relinquished? If not, then to truly master this authentic practice and wondrous subtlety, you must sever every trace without exception. Let go of the entire body, and the original numinous wondrousness will appear before you. Only then can you gather it back and retreat into secrecy.\n\nThis secret place, which the immortals and perfected ones call the \"Spirit Valley,\" is elegantly named the \"Mysterious Pass\"—the place beyond yin and yang, before father and mother, where I establish my being and secure my destiny. If you can prevent the six desires from arising and extinguish the three hearts, abiding where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet emerged, in the serene emptiness of the center, then reverse your gaze inward through the celestial eye to perceive the formless. Let the breath of the nostrils settle into silence. From silent breathing to true breathing, from true breathing to settled breathing, the six pulses become profoundly still, and the one true [reality] appears in indistinct clarity.\n\nProfoundly still, as if present,\nLuminous, as if I alone exist,\nVast and empty, the Jade Void,\nPure and complete,\nPerfectly bright, merging into the formless,\nNaturally empty and white.\nAt this point, heaven and earth cannot alter its substance,\nSun and moon cannot dim its radiance,\nGhosts and spirits cannot peer into it,\nYin and yang cannot fathom it.\nThe entire body becomes a mouth,\nYet no word can be uttered.\n\nThis humble hut has spoken too much, revealing the celestial mechanism in its loftiness. If you can truly believe and put this into practice with diligence, when the water arrives, the channel will form naturally. Alas, no one can exert effort on your behalf—each must comprehend this for themselves. Treasure this, treasure this.\n\n**Second Ultimate Chapter**\nThe first thought flows in harmony with form,\nWith the body, the nature and life take shape and the primordial is complete.\nWhen the heart is at peace and serene, the pearl of nature shines;\nWhen qi and breath merge in harmony, the treasure of life is numinous.\n\nNature and life—can one cling to just one side? Originally, before the primordial wisdom-life was awakened, the original nature had no master. If the Primordial remains in its natural state without cultivation, the wisdom-life has no place to abide. To achieve the wondrous fusion of nature and life, essence and spirit must merge in secrecy.\n\nIf you wish to clarify the original true nature, you must first still the heart;\nTo cultivate and refine the wisdom-life from its inception, you must truly nurture qi.\nStilling the heart lies in calming the intent and reversing the emotions;\nNurturing qi lies in settling the spirit and harmonizing the breath.\n\nMaster Yin said: Emotions are waves, the heart is a current, nature is water, and life is the source. At rest, they are one body; in motion, they are named differently. Pursuing this to its ultimate end, how much clarity is there?\n\nJoy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, aversion, and desire—these are emotions, arising from the stirring of intent, like waves rising with the wind. Thoughts, reflections, and the root of intent—these are the heart, arising from encounters with things, like water flowing when stirred. Stillness, the empty body, clear and bright—this is nature, like a current returning to still water. The primordial qi, harmonious and dense, misty and suffused—this is life, like the vast ocean’s original source, pure and limpid.\n\nIf you can extinguish emotions within the heart, it is like the wind subsiding and waves settling.\nIf the heart is stilled and the original nature revealed, it is like the current returning to still water.\nIf nature merges with life, it is like still water returning to the source.\n\nThe Patriarch of Purple Yang said: When the wind subsides and waves settle, the pearl of the heart shines with clarity; when the green pond is pure and still, the moon of nature radiates in full splendor.",

      "translated_text": "To perfect the authentic and awaken the heart to its root, to fulfill life and return to the origin—all excellence lies herein. Thus, penetrating the profound barriers, one suddenly transcends the upward path, clearly ascending to reality and attaining the realization of true emptiness. How could this compare to those who, like plank-bearers, see but one side, or to deluded Chan practitioners imprisoned in ghostly caverns?\n\nTherefore, the *Yi Jing*’s \"Striking\" hexagram states: \"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life.\" The alchemical classics speak of melting into true nothingness, naturally giving rise to wondrous being—how profound! Though I, unworthy as I am, have lightly revealed the celestial mechanism and instantly forgotten my transgression, I now expound in greater detail, secretly pointing the way for the wise. If one meets this with sincere understanding, cultivates with diligence, and advances in practice, it is indeed heaven’s charge.\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* says: \"The three superior medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—are dimly discerned, subtly obscure.\" These three superior medicines are the original spirit, original qi, and original essence, neither existent nor empty, without sound or scent, faintly glimpsed yet profoundly hidden, without fixed form. The three are fundamentally one, a single body with three names.\n\nAlas! From the moment of birth, the human heart gradually falls into darkness. Through the stirring of intent and emotions, the five essences transform. Spirit is like water, qi like wood, intent like fire, and thought like earth. When earth is stirred, it generates emotional metal; metal restrains wood, and spirit is disturbed by wood, so the original spirit becomes the discriminating spirit. Water restrains fire, and qi scatters through the nose, so the original qi becomes blood and breath. Earth restrains water, and essence follows desire, so the original essence becomes the essence of sensory union.\n\nThus, to follow circumstances is to be human; to reverse and halt is to be an immortal of the origin. Patriarch Yuchan said: \"When the five phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm is a fiery pit; when the five phases return in reverse, the great earth yields seven treasures.\" Master Zhayang said: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth.\" Intent, as earth, can restrain water and generate emotional metal; it can subdue emotional metal and control the essence-water.\n\nHe also said: \"True earth restrains true lead; true lead restrains true mercury. Lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible, where body and heart remain still and unmoving.\" All of you—open your eyes, open your eyes! Calm body and heart, tame emotions and intent, and toward the sprouting of true yang, refine the original essence into original qi; still the original qi to merge with the original spirit; condense the original spirit to embody the great void. Thus, one transcends beyond the five phases, towering alone above the three realms. All such metaphors and analogies are but forced names.\n\nNow, for all you great virtuous ones, I have flung wide the eyes beyond heaven, unblocked the nostrils before form, and united the Primordial Celestial Worthy with the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, perfectly merging upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Lofty and rare, this sound has never been heard—like the Lord of Images before heaven.\n\nAh! The heart-seal of the mysterious origin, the mysterious pass of the Dao’s transmission, the true mechanism of the upward path, the elixir-treasure of celestial immortals—all is now pure and luminous.\n\nSomeone asks: When water is damp, fire is parched, metal flows, and earth crumbles, where then are nature and life?\n\nI shout: Troops follow the seal’s command; generals obey the order. With one swing of the wisdom-sword, the demonic armies’ courage shatters! Though it is said that peace is established by the general, it is not the general who first brings peace.\n\nTake care, take care.\n\n**Ultimate Principle, Chapter Three**",
