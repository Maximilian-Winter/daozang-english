  "full_translation": "*The Expanded and Abridged Commentaries on the True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Scripture Title:** *Expanded and Abridged Commentaries on the True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue*\nOriginally titled *Imperial Commentary on the Dao De Jing by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang*.\nFour fascicles, included in the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* under the *Jade Instructions* category of the *Dongshen* section.\n\nAccording to the *External Transmission* at the beginning of this text and its main content, this work is an abridged and revised version of Du Guangting’s *Expanded Commentaries on the True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue* from the Tang dynasty. The reviser’s identity is unknown; the current title is provisionally assigned based on the content. The remaining fascicle titles follow the original *Daoist Canon* without alteration.\n\n---\n\n**External Transmission on the Commentary to the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Most High (Tai Shang) arises from no cause, emerging from the profound (xuan), unfathomable and inscrutable. Though named from existence, it manifests in accordance with conditions, impossible to fully recount. In later ages, it transformed during the Yin dynasty, taking form in the womb of the eighteenth Yin king, Yang Jia, in the seventeenth year of the gengshen cycle. It gestated within the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years, until the ninth year of King Wu Ding of the Yin, in the gengchen cycle, when it descended and was born in Bozhou’s Weizhen County—now the site of the Supreme Clarity Palace, the very place of its birth.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month, at the hour of mao, the Sage Mother gave birth by splitting open her left armpit. Other auspicious omens are fully recorded in the histories of the Dao.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* has been annotated by many scholars across the ages. Over sixty extant commentaries are listed below:\n\n- *Sectional Exegesis* (Upper and Lower Fascicles): Commentary by Lord Lao and Yin Xi.\n- *Xiang’er* (Two Fascicles): Annotations by Zhang Daoling, the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master.\n- *Inner Exegesis* (Upper and Lower Fascicles): Yin Xi’s commentary on the principles of inner cultivation.\n- *Master Heshang’s Chapter and Verse*: Descended and dwelled by the riverbanks of Shanzhou during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han;

The principles he expounded differ from those of other schools: some delve deeply into the profound mystery of the Twofold Mystery, unconfined by emptiness or being; some trace karmic causes and effects, adhering rigidly to the three lifetimes; some draw parallels with Confucian teachings, while others incline toward the quiescence of emptiness. Yet all have plumbed the depths of the dragon’s chamber, vying to gather its pearls and jades; all have traversed Mount Zhong, striving to glimpse its ritual scepters. Each holds a Liancheng gem in hand, their bosoms filled with radiant treasures. In their propagation, they illuminate silk scrolls with resplendent light; in their exposition, they adorn bamboo slips with vibrant patterns.\n\nOur August Emperor of Kaiyuan, the Illustrious and Reverent Filial Sovereign, descended in divine transformation, succeeding the celestial mandate with timely virtue. He quelled internal strife, ascended the throne through the power of Qian, and ruled with effortless governance, presiding over forty-five years. From the Fen River to Xiangcheng, his chariot tracks left no trace of toil; from the great halls of Juci, he roamed in luminous freedom. He expanded the Eight Seas into a court of benevolence and longevity, and transformed the myriad dwellings into a realm of Huaxu. His Way and virtue transcendent—how luminous! How sublime!\n\nRevering the sacred scriptures, they form the ancestral teachings of our dynasty—so profound their symbolic lineage that no analogy may suffice, so lofty their elegance that no rhetoric can fully express. They span the ages, standing alone in the cosmos. Though many schools have wielded their brushes, none have exhausted the gates of myriad wonders; though countless scholars have refined their studies, none have attained the realm of profound mystery.\n\nIn moments of leisure amid the weight of governance, the Emperor’s thoughts turned to their source. He personally annotated the eighty-one chapters and composed a six-volume commentary. Within, it encompasses the root of self-cultivation without omission; without, it sets forth the methods of statecraft, great and small alike. His imperial compositions spread far and wide, outshining the splendor of five-colored clouds; the radiance of heaven descended, enhancing the brilliance of the sun and moon. Truly, it may rival the *Ten Wings* of Ji Zhong, illuminating the *Two Southern* odes. As if receiving instruction directly from the Mysterious Origin, it bears the authentic transmission of the Most High. It crowns the nine schools of thought and stands preeminent, destined to endure through ten thousand ages without erasure. Thus, the songs of *Great Wind* and *Crimson Wild Geese* can scarcely follow in its footsteps; the works of *Classic Discourse* and *Golden Tower* cannot be mentioned in the same breath.\n\nYet within these commentaries and annotations, where scriptures are cited to align with their meanings, the *Book of Zhou* and the *Annals of Lu* mutually elucidate one another, while the *Four Beginnings* and the writings of Qiyuan occasionally clarify categories. Later scholars, upon perusing these volumes, often remain obscured to their foundational sources. Therefore, I have gathered and excerpted from various texts, delving into scrolls and chapters. Now, among the Emperor’s annotations and commentaries, I record these supplementary matters below.\n\nIn the eleventh year of Kaiyuan, the Emperor personally composed the preface to the annotations, stating:\n\nA *zhao* is an imperial edict, a written command. For the Son of Heaven, these are termed *zhao*, *gao*, *chi*, or *zhi*; for the Empress, Crown Prince, and various princes, they are called *jiao* or *ling*—all words by which superiors command their inferiors.\n\n*\"Zhao\"* enlightens future generations. *\"Qi\"* means to open; *\"di\"* means to advance. *\"Po\"* means greatly.\n\nThe commentary’s preface states: Sima Qian called him a \"reclusive gentleman.\" Sima Qian was the Grand Historian, styled Zichang, a native of Wen in Henei, grandson of Sima Xi, Chancellor to the King of Zhongshan, and son of Sima Tan, the Grand Astrologer, a descendant of Zhuanxu. Born at Longmen, at ten he recited the *Ancient Script* version of the *Book of Documents*; at twenty, he traveled to Jianghuai, Jiuyi, and the gates of Yu’s cave. He served the Han as Gentleman-in-Attendance and was dispatched to the western regions of Shu. A year after his father’s death, he became Grand Astrologer and composed the *Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\nThe *Dao and Virtue* is divided into upper and lower sections. In the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan, this division was promulgated. The distinctions are as follows: the upper volume, comprising four nines—thirty-six chapters—corresponds to spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The lower volume, comprising five nines—forty-five chapters—corresponds to metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Thus, the upper volume, from chapter one to nine, takes formlessness and namelessness as its essence, illuminating the Way of spring. From chapter ten to eighteen, it takes unknowing and the indistinct as its essence, illuminating the Way of summer. From chapter nineteen to twenty-seven, it takes having sentiment and trust as its essence, illuminating the Way of autumn. From chapter twenty-eight to thirty-six, it takes solemnity and purity as its essence, illuminating the Way of winter. In the lower volume, chapters one through nine expound the virtue of benevolence; chapters ten through eighteen, the virtue of propriety; chapters nineteen through twenty-seven, the virtue of righteousness; chapters twenty-eight through thirty-six, the virtue of wisdom; and chapters thirty-seven through forty-five, the virtue of trust.",

      "translated_text": "Revering the sacred scriptures, they form the ancestral teachings of our dynasty—so profound their symbolic lineage that no analogy may suffice, so lofty their elegance that no rhetoric can fully express. They span the ages, standing alone in the cosmos. Though many schools have wielded their brushes, none have exhausted the gates of myriad wonders; though countless scholars have refined their studies, none have attained the realm of profound mystery.\n\nIn moments of leisure amid the weight of governance, the Emperor’s thoughts turned to their source. He personally annotated the eighty-one chapters and composed a six-volume commentary. Within, it encompasses the root of self-cultivation without omission; without, it sets forth the methods of statecraft, great and small alike. His imperial compositions spread far and wide, outshining the splendor of five-colored clouds; the radiance of heaven descended, enhancing the brilliance of the sun and moon. Truly, it may rival the *Ten Wings* of Ji Zhong, illuminating the *Two Southern* odes. As if receiving instruction directly from the Mysterious Origin, it bears the authentic transmission of the Most High. It crowns the nine schools of thought and stands preeminent, destined to endure through ten thousand ages without erasure. Thus, the songs of *Great Wind* and *Crimson Wild Geese* can scarcely follow in its footsteps; the works of *Classic Discourse* and *Golden Tower* cannot be mentioned in the same breath.\n\nYet within these commentaries and annotations, where scriptures are cited to align with their meanings, the *Book of Zhou* and the *Annals of Lu* mutually elucidate one another, while the *Four Beginnings* and the writings of Qiyuan occasionally clarify categories. Later scholars, upon perusing these volumes, often remain obscured to their foundational sources. Therefore, I have gathered and excerpted from various texts, delving into scrolls and chapters. Now, among the Emperor’s annotations and commentaries, I record these supplementary matters below.\n\nIn the eleventh year of Kaiyuan, the Emperor personally composed the preface to the annotations, stating:\n\nA *zhao* is an imperial edict, a written command. For the Son of Heaven, these are termed *zhao*, *gao*, *chi*, or *zhi*; for the Empress, Crown Prince, and various princes, they are called *jiao* or *ling*—all words by which superiors command their inferiors.\n\n*\"Zhao\"* enlightens future generations. *\"Qi\"* means to open; *\"di\"* means to advance. *\"Po\"* means greatly.\n\nThe commentary’s preface states: Sima Qian called him a \"reclusive gentleman.\" Sima Qian was the Grand Historian, styled Zichang, a native of Wen in Henei, grandson of Sima Xi, Chancellor to the King of Zhongshan, and son of Sima Tan, the Grand Astrologer, a descendant of Zhuanxu. Born at Longmen, at ten he recited the *Ancient Script* version of the *Book of Documents*; at twenty, he traveled to Jianghuai, Jiuyi, and the gates of Yu’s cave. He served the Han as Gentleman-in-Attendance and was dispatched to the western regions of Shu. A year after his father’s death, he became Grand Astrologer and composed the *Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\nThe *Dao and Virtue* is divided into upper and lower sections. In the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan, this division was promulgated. The distinctions are as follows: the upper volume, comprising four nines—thirty-six chapters—corresponds to spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The lower volume, comprising five nines—forty-five chapters—corresponds to metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Thus, the upper volume, from chapter one to nine, takes formlessness and namelessness as its essence, illuminating the Way of spring. From chapter ten to eighteen, it takes unknowing and the indistinct as its essence, illuminating the Way of summer. From chapter nineteen to twenty-seven, it takes having sentiment and trust as its essence, illuminating the Way of autumn. From chapter twenty-eight to thirty-six, it takes solemnity and purity as its essence, illuminating the Way of winter. In the lower volume, chapters one through nine expound the virtue of benevolence; chapters ten through eighteen, the virtue of propriety; chapters nineteen through twenty-seven, the virtue of righteousness; chapters twenty-eight through thirty-six, the virtue of wisdom; and chapters thirty-seven through forty-five, the virtue of trust.",

He quelled internal strife, ascended the throne through the power of Qian, and ruled with effortless governance, presiding over forty-five years.

He expanded the Eight Seas into a court of benevolence and longevity, and transformed the myriad dwellings into a realm of Huaxu. His Way and virtue transcendent—how luminous! How sublime!",
