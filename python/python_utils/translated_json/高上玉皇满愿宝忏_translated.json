unbroken. Alas, the folly of mortal ignorance prevents us from practicing the wondrous Dao with sincerity. Thus, external malevolence corrupts our sacred roots, while thieves of divine treasure disrupt our sublime Way, ensnaring us in the mundane net and casting us into the realm of the profane. How then could we clarify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, lest we be ensnared by attachments and chase after transient phenomena?\n\nThe One True Essence is lost, and myriad demons assail us. We humbly implore the Celestial Sovereign’s boundless compassion to proclaim the wondrous law that severs obstacles. Thus, we earnestly petition and, according to the scriptures, confess our transgressions. May we be cleansed of all defilements, that our inner essence may shine luminous and clear; may the veils of illusion be swept away, that our enlightened vision may radiate brilliance. May we wield the sword of wisdom to sever our faults, removing the obstacles of affliction while recording our virtues. May our mortal forms be purified, our Dao’s fruition complete. May blessings permeate both the seen and unseen realms, and wisdom illuminate the singular nature of enlightenment. As the darkness dissipates and the sun shines forth, as clouds scatter and the sky clears—may we forever attain boundless freedom, free from all cycles of rebirth.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we prostrate and gratefully acknowledge the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Three Pure Ones of Ultimate Truth.\n\n**The Fifth Volume of the Jade Sovereign’s Fulfilled Wishes, the Precious Confession Scroll**\n**The Sixth Volume of the Jade Sovereign’s Fulfilled Wishes, the Precious Confession Scroll**\n**The Volume of Disaster Dissolution**\n\nHumbly, we observe the fast and purify ourselves before the Emperor, hoping that our sincerity may subtly penetrate the divine.

people and benefit all beings,\nYet what is truly essential is to seek the Dao and attain the True.\n\nThose bound in suffering only wish for advancement,\nThe poor and destitute long for wealth and honor,\nEver waiting until their desires are fulfilled before release.\n\nYet, contemplating the wondrous Dao’s boundless compassion,\nIt grants all sentient beings their deepest wishes.\n\nThus, we dare to surrender our lives,\nSeeking to follow the will of others.\n\nHumbly, we pray for Your gracious inspection of our sincere devotion,\nStill relying on the Dao’s adaptability to respond to our needs.\n\nFirst, we pray for the protection of the nation and its people;\nNext, we hope to benefit others while benefiting ourselves.\n\nWhether in the unseen or the seen,\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nMay all living descendants be cherished in peace,\nAnd all ancestors past be universally liberated.\n\nMay blessings reach the Nine Hells and dispel their suffering,\nAnd merit shine through the endless night.\n\nTogether with all beings, may we depend on the multitude of virtues.\n\nWith sincere devotion, we prostrate and give thanks to the **Supreme Void Sovereign of the Three

alone**.\n\nPreviously, we, the disciples of the Dao, reverently addressed the Great Way,\nBowing in homage before You, presenting the *Supreme Scripture of the Mystic Vault’s Highest Treasure: The Celestial Sovereign’s Fulfilled Wish and Expiation*, in its entirety—ten volumes complete.\n\nMay this merit be dedicated solely for disciple [name]’s repentance, dispelling calamity, prolonging life, and gathering joyous fortune.\n\nHumbly, we pray that human sentiment may resonate with the Divine,\nAnd that the Celestial Sovereign may observe and grant our wishes.\n\nMay obstacles be removed, sins atoned,\nAnd all desires fulfilled to their utmost.\nMay disasters be averted and blessings gathered,\nAnd the Mystic Virtue attain perfect fruition.\n\nTogether with all sentient beings,\nMay we attain the **Supreme Dao**,\nTake refuge in the Three Jewels,\nAnd dedicate ourselves to the Nine Purity Realms,\nAs the supreme cause and condition,\nWith sincere devotion, we invoke:\n\n**The Most Holy Primordial Celestial Sovereign,**\n**The Sovereign of the Highest Clarity’s Treasure,**\n**The Sovereign of the Supreme Dao’s Virtue,**\n**The Celestial Sovereign Who Forgives Transgressions.**\n\n**Unfathomable, boundless merit.**\n\n*The Tenth Volume of the Highest Treasure: The Celestial Sovereign’s Fulfilled Display and Expiation* is now complete.",

Alas, the folly of mortal ignorance prevents us from practicing the wondrous Dao with sincerity. Thus, external malevolence corrupts our sacred roots, while thieves of divine treasure disrupt our sublime Way, ensnaring us in the mundane net and casting us into the realm of the profane. How then could we clarify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, lest we be ensnared by attachments and chase after transient phenomena?\n\nThe One True Essence is lost, and myriad demons assail us. We humbly implore the Celestial Sovereign’s boundless compassion to proclaim the wondrous law that severs obstacles. Thus, we earnestly petition and, according to the scriptures, confess our transgressions. May we be cleansed of all defilements, that our inner essence may shine luminous and clear; may the veils of illusion be swept away, that our enlightened vision may radiate brilliance. May we wield the sword of wisdom to sever our faults, removing the obstacles of affliction while recording our virtues. May our mortal forms be purified, our Dao’s fruition complete. May blessings permeate both the seen and unseen realms, and wisdom illuminate the singular nature of enlightenment.
