  "full_translation": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Winding Simplicity Formulary and Register**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Winding Simplicity Formulary and Register*\n**Author:** Unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from six Upper Clarity scriptures and registers, including *The Formulary of Supreme Simplicity*, *The Seven Luminaries of the Vast Expanse*, and *The Treasured Register of the River Chart*. One scroll.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Proper Section I.\n\n---\n\n**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Winding Simplicity Formulary and Register**\n*Also titled: The Great Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi and the Mysterious Mound*\n\nTransmitted by the Left Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Most High bestowed it upon the Left Perfected, who in turn conveyed it to the Azure Lad of the Fangzhu Palace in the Eastern Sea, to be transmitted only to those superior adepts whose names are inscribed in jade—those destined to become Perfected Immortals. After wearing it for thirty years, one may behold the Three Primordial Lords and be welcomed by the Sagely Lord in the Golden Towers of Upper Clarity. Every seven hundred years, it may be passed to two recipients.\n\nWithin the oratory, one pound of incense is burned. Upon completion of the transmission, the initiate swears a blood oath upon golden silk, substituting for the blood covenant of ascending the altar.\n\n---\n\n**#1. The Winding Simplicity Formulary**\n\nThe Winding Simplicity commands the ghosts of the Six Heavens, enslaves the spirits of the myriad essences, summons the Five Thearchs, governs the Five Marchmounts, seals the rivers and marshes, and calls forth the hundred ghosts. Its formulary subdues the tigers and leopards of the famed mountains, tames the dragons of the hundred rivers, commands the ten thousand ghosts, and drives away the ten thousand perversities.\n\nAll the above talismans are to be inscribed in cinnabar.\n\n**The Covenant Formulary**\n\nThree bolts of white silk, thirty feet in length, serve as the covenant of blood and fluid, substituting for the blood oath of the Winding Simplicity. Without purification and solemnity, the register cannot be unbound.\n\nTwenty feet of plain brocade safeguard the covenant of immortals and transcendents, serving as the oath for three transmissions over seven hundred years. When entering peril, water, fire, mountains, or chambers, the register must be worn.\n\nThree pairs of golden rings secure the covenant of great deliverance and eternal life, ensuring the heart’s unobstructed pact. Without this writ, a Daoist may not behold the Lords of the Three Origins.\n\nNine ounces of incense uphold the covenant of communion with the numinous, forming the pact with the spirits of the unseen. Without it, the ghosts of the Six Heavens cannot be summoned or subdued.\n\nWhen a man receives the transmission, he faces north while the master faces south. When a woman receives it, she faces south while the master faces north. The submission of documents and offerings must be orally transmitted according to the master’s instructions. At the time of transmission, face north.\n\nFor men, after ten years, another purification rite and document submission are required. For women, after ten years, one offering is made.\n\nThe register, wine, and dried meats are arranged in a single chamber, invoking the Highest Clarity’s Lofty Perfected, the Radiant Spirit Realized Person, and the Venerable Master of the Celestial Palace to uphold the precepts.\n\nIf the recipient receives the register in person, the oral transmission suffices—no written covenant on silk, rings, incense, or bodily oath is needed.\n\nThe Highest Clarity’s Lofty Transcendent, the Radiant Cloud Realized Person, initiates the Great Register of Heaven. The Venerable Master of the Celestial Palace bestows it upon the Lords of the Five Marchmounts. Wearing it dispels misfortune, averts calamity, repels evil, expels perversity, shields against myriad essences, disperses the hundred beasts, commands ghostly beings, extends life by ten years, revives the soul, reverses aging, stabilizes the body, and ensures enduring existence. It is also called the *Inevitable Life Contract of the Three Heavens*.\n\nThe Venerable Master of the Nine Heavens, accompanied by ten female officials of the White Silk Jade Court, stations them to the left and right of the disciple.\n\nFor the above talismans, unless specified by brush and fixed colors, all are to be inscribed in cinnabar.\n\nThe *Mysterious Mound Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi*, the *Immortal Regulations of the Venerable Master of the Dark Capital*—after three days of wearing, the transmission is sealed with green silk, three pairs of rings, incense, and silk, pledging before the records of the Year-Star: no negligence, no deceit, no malice, no haste, but the practice of benevolence, the accumulation of virtue, the preservation of spirit, and the contemplation of the real. The bearer of the register is a transcendent.\n\nThe *Register of the Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse*\nThe *Vermilion Script Talisman of the Solar Radiance and Cinnabar Origin*\n\nThe *Lunar Radiance Yellow Origin Azure-Script Talisman*\nThe *Year-Star Vermilion-Script Talisman*\nThe *Blazing Deluder Yellow-Script Talisman*\nThe *Great White Black-Script Talisman*\nThe *Ephemeral Star Azure-Script Talisman*\nThe *Quelling Star Vermilion-Script Talisman*\nThe *Vermilion Talisman* (vermilion-script)\nThe *Vermilion Talisman* (vermilion-script)\nThe *Black Talisman* (black-script)\nThe *Orpiment Talisman* (yellow-script)\n\nThe above section is to be transcribed and worn by the disciple.\n\nThese are based on the sun, moon, and five planets as the Seven Origins, with an additional five talismans corresponding to those in the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons*. However, the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons* contains forty-nine talismans in total, each placed in varying spaces of differing widths. Here, only a few remain, the rest having been lost.\n\nAnother yellow talisman is said to originate from the *True Reports*, described as the *Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, Commanding the Northern Emperor of Fengtai Peak*, found in the *Scripture of the Jade Horse*. The details remain unclear.\n\nOtherwise, the talismans of the Seven Origins are roughly described in transmitted scriptures with methods for their application, though this is a manual for wearing them, hence no further explanation is given. It is fitting to follow the *True [Reports]*, inscribing them in mixed colors upon varied silks, receiving and wearing them.\n\nOne account of the *Command of Fengtai Peak* states in the talismanic decrees: \"Whoever carries this talisman shall enclose it in a layered purple pouch and wear it upon the head.\"\n\nThe *Register of the Ten Heavens’ Summoning Dragons of the Supreme Clarity* (all talismans above in vermilion-script)\n\nThe *Register of the Eight Might’s Summoning Dragons of the Supreme Clarity*\n\nOn the first day of a certain month in a certain year, [Name], a disciple of [State] [County] [Abbey/Observatory], receiving the [Name] Register of the [Peak] Perfected, respectfully approaches the gate of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Master [Name], to receive the *Supreme Clarity Jade Essence Secret Register of the Turning Chariot and Perfect Dao*, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and other texts. I vow to cultivate in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, to save beings and assist all things. Should I violate this oath, I willingly accept the underworld’s judgment, offering my body in repentance to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, without resentment.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Supreme Lord’s Mysterious Regulations. (All above in vermilion-script)\n\n**Seasonal Petitions to Mountains and Waters**\n\n*Spring Commencement (jia-yin day), Summer Commencement (jia-wu day), Autumn Commencement (jia-shen day), Winter Commencement (jia-zi day)*\nThe four talismans above are inscribed in vermilion on green ground with vermilion borders.\n\nThe Dragon Kings of the Thirty-Five Seas of the East come in attendance.\nThe Dragon Kings of the Thirty-Five Seas of the South come in attendance.\nThe Dragon Kings of the Thirty-Five Seas of the West come in abundance.\nThe Dragon Kings of the Thirty-Five Seas of the North come in rectitude.\nThe true writs and talismans above are all inscribed in vermilion.\n\n**[Supreme Clarity River Chart Register of the Nine August Guests] #2**\nA certain year, a certain month, the

the [Name] Register of the [Peak] Perfected, reverently approaches the gate of the Supreme Essence Great Cavern Master [Name], to receive the talisman of the Nine Stars’ hidden taboo for longevity and deathlessness.\n\nOne must not violate the true regulations, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Supreme Metropolis of the Dao.\n\n**Yang Brightness Grand Marshal’s Mansion:**\nNine hundred twenty ranks, nine hundred million myriad spirit officials—flying dragon riders, embroidered-robe messengers, jade lads and jade maidens—each nine hundred million myriad persons.\n\n**Yin

twenty ranks, nine hundred million myriad spirit officials—flying dragon riders, embroidered-robe messengers, golden lads and jade maidens—each nine hundred million myriad persons.\n\n**Northern

golden lads and jade maidens—each nine hundred million myriad persons.\n\n**Assistant Heaven Honored Jade Emperor’s Mansion:**\nNine hundred ninety ranks, nine hundred million myriad spirit

ninety ranks, nine hundred million myriad spirit officials—flying dragon riders, embroidered-robe messengers, golden lads and jade maidens—each nine hundred million myriad persons.\nThe talisman is inscribed in vermilion.\n\n**Supreme Clarity Purple-Woven Interlaced Sash Register**, also called *Turning Chariot Interlaced Sash*, or *Perfect Dao Contract*, or *Primal Beginning Great Contract*.\n\nThe Nine Stars’ inner taboo and hidden secret names are as follows:\nThe Nine Stars’ taboo names are all inscribed in vermilion.\n\nThe Nine Sovereigns’ inner taboos on the right are to be kept secret by the recipient, transmitted orally at the river’s mouth as true esoterica.³ The Nine Openings Star Chart, along with pacing the hours and meditative visualization, should be practiced at dawn and dusk—first knocking the teeth nine times, then silently intoning the names of the stars:\n\nFirst, the essence of the Supreme Star, named *Dark Pivot*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, riding the void and mounting the floating.\n\nSecond, the essence of the Primordial Star, named *Northern Terrace*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, roaming the grotto-chambers.\n\nThird, the essence of the Perfected Star, named *Northern Culmen Supreme Perfected*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, governing the Three Mysteries.\n\nFourth, the essence of the Pivot Star, named *Revolving Root*.\nMay this disciple’s body gain a jade name, ranked among flying immortals.\n\nFifth, the essence of the Network Star, named *Celestial Balance*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, ascending to Supreme Clarity.\n\nSixth, the essence of the Chronicle Star, named *Life Mechanism*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, with name inscribed in the Grand Tenuity.\n\nSeventh, the essence of the Pass Star, named *Dark Yang*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, empowered to command

essence of the Venerable Star, named *Grand Tenuity Imperial Lord*.\nMay this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, with name entered into the Cinnabar Jade Chamber.\n\nAfter reciting the nine invocations, knock the teeth nine more times. Practice as you will, guarding and revering these secrets—do not transmit them recklessly. Follow these methods faithfully, and the true Dao will naturally be perfected.\n\n*Tai Sui* [Year of] *Bao Ju*\n\nThe *Supervision of Transmission* concludes the *Shangqing Qu Su Jue Ci Lu* (Esoteric Oral Instructions on the Winding Silk of the Supreme Clarity).\n\n[1] Supplemented according to the *Shangqing Gaoshang Yu Chen Feng Kui Qu Su Shang Jing* (Supreme Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Jade Dawn and Phoenix Constellation Winding Silk).\n[2] This title was supplied by the editor based on the meaning of the text.\n[3] The original text read: *The true instructions are named and transmitted orally.*",
