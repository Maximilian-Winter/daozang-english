  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (Part II)**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Attributed to:** Zhao Zhijian (Tang Dynasty)\n**Six Scrolls** (Original lacks Scrolls One through Three)\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) Category\n\n**Scroll Four of the *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n*(Original lacks Scrolls One through Three)*\n\n**The Chapter on Supreme Virtue (Chapter One)**\n\nThe Dao is the subtle origin of all things—its origin is revered, hence \"supreme.\"\nVirtue is the manifestation of compassionate relief—its trace is humble, hence \"inferior.\"\n\nThis scroll contains forty-four chapters, divided into three major sections:\nThe first chapter establishes the foundational principle,\nThe next forty-two chapters expound its doctrines at length,\nAnd the final chapter concludes by returning to the principle.\n\nWithin the first chapter, there are five distinctions:\nFirst, it clarifies that virtue has a crucial essence, thus forming the distinction between supreme and inferior.\nSecond, it explains the five stages of virtue’s decline and destruction, arising from human nature and temporal conditions.\nThird, it reveals how intentions gradually become corrupted, losing the Dao and practicing rituals in vain.\nFourth, it shows how loyalty and sincerity are insufficient, while superficial ornamentation abounds.\nFifth, it demonstrates the existence of the Daoic man, who discards ornamentation and returns to substance.\n\n**Four Sentences (One Section)**\n\n*\"The supreme virtue does not act in virtue, yet it has virtue.\"*\nVirtue (*dé*) means \"to obtain.\" Obtaining the Dao, hence it is called virtue.\nVirtue has two meanings:\nFirst, the inherent virtue—the wondrous function of the Dao, nurturing all things according to their kind, ensuring universal benefit.\nSecond, the cultivated attainment—those who align with the Dao first obtain their true nature, ultimately returning to the original Dao. Having attained it themselves, they also enable others to attain it. What is obtained is the Dao, hence it is called *supreme virtue*.\n\n*\"Not acting in virtue\"* refers to *supreme virtue*.\nWhen virtue harmonizes with the Dao, benefiting all things profoundly and extensively, its deeds are accomplished yet remain hidden. Virtue does not flaunt itself—common people use it daily without knowing, and countless generations rely on it without recognizing it. This is the meaning of *having virtue*—unmatched and exalted, hence called *supreme*.\n\n*\"The inferior virtue does not lose virtue, yet it has no virtue.\"*\nWhen the mind and its objects are both forgotten, and self and other merge seamlessly, harmonizing with the mysterious Dao, this is called virtue.\nYet now, arrogance and attachment persist, and the seals of constraint remain. Though virtue is present, self-perception lingers, and true forgetting has not yet been achieved—hence it is called *inferior*.\n\n**Eleven Sentences (Second Section)**\n\n*\"The supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\n*\"Yì\"* means \"to use.\" *Without action* refers to the inner mind being empty and tranquil, free from contrived doing.\n*\"Nothing is left undone\"* means external things are pure and unadorned—all conventional affairs are abandoned without interference.\nThis is the obscurity of supreme virtue.\n\n*\"The inferior virtue acts, yet there is much left undone.\"*\nUnable to dispel noble attachments, it engages in contrived deeds and worldly achievements—hence *\"acts.\"*\nSeeking honor and profit to enrich one’s family, or fame and posthumous titles to exalt oneself—hence *\"much is left undone.\"*\n\n*\"The superior benevolence acts, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\nBenevolence (*rén*) is the advancement of kindness.\nRelieving others’ deficiencies by sacrificing oneself, or pardoning others’ faults through private favor—this is *\"acting.\"*\nYet completing what is beneficial without claiming credit, giving aid without expecting repayment—this is *\"nothing is left undone.\"*\nThose who receive such benevolence are numerous, and those transformed by it flow like water, swept away by the wind. Benevolence’s path is most excellent, hence it is called *superior*.\n\n*\"The superior righteousness acts, yet there is much left undone.\"*\nRighteousness (*yì*) means \"what is proper.\"\n\nWhen people lack their proper distinctions, and things lose their natural order, yet in times of purity and integrity, there are upright and incorruptible men who tolerate no private deceit. They clearly distinguish right from wrong, carefully judge truth from falsehood, ensuring all receive their due distinctions and nothing loses its proper place—this is the work of the righteous scholar.\n\nTo seek near-term honor and profit, or distant fame and posthumous titles—this is *\"much is left undone.\"*\n\nThe superior ritual acts, yet none respond to it, so one raises one’s arm and leads by example.\n\nRitual (*lǐ*) is the proper conduct of one’s bearing.\nBowing and rising, advancing and retreating—when these movements conform to measure, this is ritual.\n*\"Shoaling\"* means to raise one’s arm.\n*\"Leading\"* means to draw others along.\nWhen all proper decorum is complete, this is called *superior*.\n\nNow, ritual is the law governing form. As pure customs degenerate into corruption, human nature grows treacherous and thin, hearts no longer in harmony, and forms become arrogant. Thus, external regulations are established to govern posture and demeanor, so that the heart may gradually soften in step with the body, and the inner self align with the outer.\n\nYet there are those whose inner and outer selves contradict—where the form complies but the heart rebels, where deceit lurks within while the exterior conforms to ritual. Hence, anger arises, arms are raised, and contention ensues—this is the beginning of ritual’s failure, the origin of disorder.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows.\nThe Dao is the highest virtue.\n*\"Later virtue\"* refers to lower virtue.\nThe highest virtue aligns with the Dao, hence it is called *Dao*.\nInitially, it was paired with the Dao, hence called *virtue*.\nNow, paired with later virtue, it is again called *Dao*.\n\nSince people cannot practice the Dao of supreme, effortless virtue—where all is forgotten—yet cling to the lower virtue of deliberate action.\nThe lower virtue is when all actions are complete, yet nothing is forgotten.\nBenevolence is but one aspect of virtue—kindness and forgiveness.\nSince people cannot embody all virtues, this one alone is emphasized.\nWithin benevolence, the highest is called *superior*.\nBenevolence wins through kindness, while righteousness prevails through severity.\nRighteousness subdues through punishment, benevolence through grace.\nThus, benevolence surpasses righteousness.\n\nRighteousness is like wielding punishment to suppress the heart, while ritual merely regulates form to conform to propriety. Hence, though the exterior may appear refined, the interior remains rigid and unyielding—this is the outward gentleman and inward petty man, hence the raising of arms and contention.\n\nRitual is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, yet it is the first seed of disorder.\nLoyalty means a single, sincere heart; trust means unhesitating obedience.\nFrom purity to corruption, ritual becomes the lowest extreme. As loyalty and trust fade, empty formalities remain, and the body betrays the heart—thus, it becomes the origin of chaos.\n\nMoreover, the Dao is boundless, valuing only sincerity and unity. Thus, it embraces the clumsy and the refined alike, yet rejects the artificial and constrained.\nRitual, though structured by rules, emphasizes propriety in every movement—advancing, retreating, bowing, rising—thus attaining its highest form.\nHere, the Dao values the heart, while ritual governs the form. To regulate the heart is to enter the Dao; to regulate the form is to conform to convention. If the heart lacks the Dao yet follows convention, how could disorder not arise?\n\n*\"Preconception\"* is the flower of the Dao, yet the beginning of folly.\nPreconception has two forms:\nOne, where the heart truly does not know, yet the mouth speaks as if it does—where recognition precedes knowledge, hence *\"preconception.\"*\nTwo, where the mind is enslaved to premature judgments, competing to recognize first. The wise first know with the heart, then speak with the mouth; yet here, the mouth speaks before the heart knows. Thus, recognition precedes knowledge—this is the superficial bloom of the Dao.\n\nWhen pure customs decay and competitive greed takes root, this becomes the initial loss of the Dao, the start of vulgar folly.\n\nThus, the true man abides in substance, not in superficiality.\n*\"Zhang\"* means long; *\"fu\"* means to uphold.\nHe who possesses great virtue and nurtures all beings, sustaining the people—this is the true man.\nIn his conduct, he dwells in substance, not in corruption.\nHe is devoted solely to the Dao, knowing nothing of ritual’s artifices.\nSubstance and superficiality are one in origin, yet differ in preference—whether valued for their genuine or false qualities.\nThus, the false and superficial pale beside the true and substantial.\nTo reside in truth, not in illusion.\nThe true man is one who follows the Dao.\nGuarding the heart in sincerity, rejecting deceit, he inspires others to do the same.\nThus, he discards the false and embraces the true.\nTo establish oneself in action, discarding the superficial and embracing the substantial.\nFor the substantial is near the Dao, while the superficial is distant.\n\n---\n**Former Chapter Two**\nAt the beginning of this great section, forty-two chapters expound on various principles. The previous chapter clarified how the five virtues decline—from Dao to ritual as the source of disorder. This chapter demonstrates how all people return to their roots, align with the Dao, and restore harmony. It follows the natural inclinations of each to guide them back, hence its placement.\n\nWithin this chapter, four distinctions are made:\nFirst, it clarifies that all colored and formed things share the same fundamental *qi*.\nSecond, it shows that though disciples may be many, all are encouraged toward non-action.\nThird, it demonstrates that lowering the high and elevating the low is the enduring way.\nFourth, it states that abandoning the noble for the humble is the path to returning to true nature.\n\n---\n**Those who attained Oneness in the past,**\n\nThose who attained Oneness in the past,\n**were the origin of the Dao/Way’s vital *qi*—the first to emerge and give birth.**\n\nIn ancient times, Heaven, Earth, and all ten thousand things\n**received the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness, and thus came to life and form.**\nThis sentence summarizes how birth arises from the lower distinctions of obtaining Oneness.\n\nHeaven receives Oneness and becomes **clear and serene**,\nEarth receives Oneness and becomes **settled and tranquil**.\nThe *qi* of Oneness divides into yin and yang:\n**Yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven.**\nWhen Heaven receives the **clear *qi* within Oneness**, it is Heaven—thus **serene and luminous**.\n**Yin *qi* descends, turbid and dense, becoming Earth.**\nWhen Earth receives the **turbid *qi* within Oneness**, it is Earth—thus **stable and at peace**.\n\nThe **spirit** receives Oneness and becomes **responsive and alive**,\nThe **valleys** receive Oneness and become **filled and abundant**.\nWithin the *qi* of Oneness, there exists that which is **neither yin nor yang**—this is called **harmony**.\nOnce yin and yang are distinguished,\n**the yin-dominant aspect of harmony becomes ghosts and spirits,**\nas well as the **essences of mountains and rivers**.\nGhosts and spirits alike **obtain Oneness**—\ntheir **mystical responsiveness** is inexhaustible,\ntheir **flowing abundance** is unending.\nThe essences of rivers and valleys are also like **humans in possessing spirit**.\n\nAll **ten thousand things** receive Oneness and thus **come to life**,\n**Nobles and kings** receive Oneness and become **the rectifiers of the world**.\nTen thousand things—**the collective name for all that bears life**.\nHumans are **most responsive**, thus standing **at the head of all things**.\nNobles and kings **partially receive the refined harmony of Oneness**,\nand become **leaders of the people, the sovereigns of governance and teaching**.\n\n**This is how they achieve their station.**\n*Station*—**this is attainment**.\n\n**The six matters above**—\nHeaven, Earth, spirit, and valleys—\n**all share the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness**, and thus **come to life and form**.\n**Six sentences follow.**\n\nIf Heaven lacks **clarity**, it **risks fragmentation**;\nIf Earth lacks **tranquility**, it **risks upheaval**.\nOneness—**the origin of *qi***—\n**is the ultimate void, without form or trace**.\nHeaven and Earth **retain Oneness** to preserve their **clarity and peace**,\nbut they must also **guard it** to endure.\nIf they indulge in **action or desire**,\nthey **will inevitably lose Oneness**—\nthen Heaven **lacks Oneness to sustain its clarity**, and **darkness, confusion, and rupture** will ensue.\nEarth **lacks Oneness to uphold its peace**, and **tremors, convulsions, and overflow** will follow.\n**Oneness is that which can be attained from beginning to end**—\nit cannot be **obtained at the start and lost at the close**.\nThis is **the inevitability of initial attainment**,\nbut **the certainty of later loss through human interference**.\nThus, **fragmentation and upheaval** are warned against.\n\nIf the **spirit lacks responsiveness**, it **risks exhaustion**;\nIf the **valleys lack abundance**, they **risk depletion**.\nIf the spirit **employs Oneness**,\nit **rises in emptiness and attains its own clarity**—\n**mysterious and boundless, yet if it becomes arrogant and proud**,\nits **functions and powers will surely cease**.\nThe **essences of rivers and lakes**,\n**proud and self-satisfied**, clash with Oneness—\nthen **rivers and lakes dry up**, their **sources scorch**.\nAll **ten thousand things** lack **life**, and **decay will follow**;\nNobles and kings lack **Oneness**, and **downfall will surely come**.\nOneness—**the marvelous *qi* of the Dao/Way**—\n**is the root of all formed things**.\nIf humans **can return to their origin and uphold Oneness**,\nthen **life is preserved**.\nIf they **chase the superficial and lose Oneness**,\nthen **true nature is extinguished**.\nNobles and kings **lack Oneness to govern their station**,\nand **rapid ruin** will follow—**speaking of collapse**.\nThese **six matters all warn against arrogance and excess**,\nand though **Heaven, Earth, spirits, and valleys** are mentioned,\nit is because **all possess responsive essences**,\nand through human warnings, they are **included universally**.\nThus the preface to the *jue* states:\n**Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits all revere the same principle—**\n**their forms differ, yet their essence is identical.**\n\nTherefore,\n**the noble finds its foundation in the humble,**\n**the high finds its base in the low**.\nThose who **guard the Dao of Oneness**,\n**must only rise in emptiness**—\n**regardless of noble or humble status,**\n**to be modest and self-effacing is to align with the Dao and ensure safety,**\n**while pride and self-aggrandizement are to defy the Dao and court destruction**.\n\nThus, nobles and kings **call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"without grain\"**—\n**is this not their claim of humility as foundation?**\nNo?\n**\"Lonely,\" \"solitary,\" \"widowed,\" \"without grain\"**—\nthese are **humans’ vilest names**.\n**\"Without grain\"**—**also not virtuous**.\nGrain—**this is stipend**.\nTo **humble oneself without virtue**,\nto **be unworthy of receiving stipends**,\nif one’s **actions and intentions are thus**—\nhow **could this not be a claim of humility**,\nwhile **still employing Oneness to govern nobility?**\nNo—**this is a question to the saying above**.\n\nThus,\n**to earn many praises is to have no praises at all**.\n*Praise*—**this is commendation**.\nTo **seek praise and multiply commendations**,\n**is to have none truly earned**—\nthe **king is named by the people’s collective acclaim**.\nTo **examine the king’s true substance**,\n**there is no fixed form of kingship**.\nWhy?\nThe **four limbs and hundred bodies** each have their **own names**.\nIf there is **no named king**,\nand the **title is only collective acclaim**,\nthen **it is a false union, not reality**.\nTo **trace the origin of the name**,\nit **comes from the common folk**—\nby **the common folk’s own accord**, it is **empty and false**.\nIf the **name of king** lacks **true substance**,\nthen **internally, there is no fixed kingly essence**,\nand **externally, there is no true kingly name**.\nIf **both inner and outer lack substance**,\nthen **neither inner nor outer exists**—\nwho **then can claim the name?**\nThrough this **multiplication of praises**, **no true praise is earned**.\nAll **dharma/laws** follow this example—\n**false claims of origin**.\n**Carriages and vehicles**—\n**also explained thus**.\nThis **scripture is concise in principle yet broad in meaning**,\nits **body rich with implied refutations**.\nIt **discards all external causes**, and **forgets the heart’s attachments**,\n**while aligning with the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi’s teachings**—\n**both have established their doctrines**.\nThus **Zhuangzi says**:\n*\"Lending oneself to foreign things,\nentrusting oneself to shared bodies—\nif foreign things are borrowed,\nshared bodies are not truly one’s own.\"*\n\nAgain he says:\n*\"Now, if one points to a horse’s hundred bodies\nand cannot find the horse itself,\nyet the horse is tied before you,\nhow can it be called a horse?\"*\n\nAnd in the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* it states:\n*\"The four great elements—Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind—\n**are combined and dispersed according to the seasons’ *qi*.***\nEarth and Water—**these are the four great**;\nFire and Wind—**these are the four seasonal *qi*.***\nThe **four great are falsely combined**,\n**due to the ebb and flow of time**—\n**temporarily forming a body**,\nyet the **four great cannot each generate life independently**;\nthey **must rely on all causes converging** to **complete the form**.\nIf the **human body’s four great disperse**—\nwhere **does the body go?**\nFollowing the **text’s meaning**, I do not explain thus.\n**One must instead rely on the interpretations of ancient scholars**—\nhow **does this differ from the Daoist and secular traditions?**\n\n**To instruct the disciples of Fu Yi**—\nthough his **doctrine is established**, its **substance is not**—\nit **declares that common Daoists**,\n**tainted by foreign customs**,\nif **Daoists can be slandered**,\nthen **it says \"tainted\"**—\n**where does the scripture intend to place its teachings?**\nIt **does not wish to be smooth as jade,**\n**nor rough as stone**.\n**Ancient texts described smoothness like jade’s luster,**\n**roughness like stone’s hardness, inferior to jade**.\nNow **following the Master’s original terms**—*\"luoluo ququ\"*—\n**jade is what humans hold most noble**.\n\nThe name **\"falling and abandoned\"**—\n**stone is the most despised among things**.\n**Those who follow the Dao do not wish to be as noble as jade,**\n**chasing and striving without rest,**\n**nor do they wish to be as despised as stone,**\n**settling into stillness and returning to the Dao**.\n\nNow **not speaking of being between jade and stone**,\n**for this chapter follows only from the low and base,**\n**with no intention of moderation**.\n\n**The chapter on \"Return\"**—the third—\n**previously clarified that all things, born of shared qi, are made,**\n**now clarifies that all people, in their natural state, are without affairs.**\n**Life follows the superficial while returning to the root—**\n**contrasting the two to show gain and loss differ.**\n\n**Previously, it was said to abandon traces and return to the root, without affairs;**\n**now it points out the origin of life, ordering things to follow accordingly.**\n\n**Two sentences before.**\n**\"Return\" is the Dao’s movement,**\n**\"weakness\" is the Dao’s application.**\n**Return is returning to the root.**\n**Movement refers to affairs.**\n**Common people take change as movement—**\n**seeking the new while abandoning the old.**\n**Those who follow the Dao abandon the superficial and return to the root,**\n**which is the affair of the enlightened—**\n**thus it is called the Dao’s movement.**\n**The body at ease, the heart tranquil—this is stillness.**\n**Abandoning what is to return to what is not—this is movement.**\n**Just as \"far\" is called returning first,**\n**though not physically distant,**\n**it is named \"far\" because the Dao has no form.**\n**Now also not coming is not near,**\n**for though the body possesses it, it is called \"return.\"**\n**The Dao has no coming or going, yet bears the names \"far\" and \"return,\"**\n**and the tranquil heart also holds the meaning of return-movement.**\n\n**When the inner heart is empty and still,**\n**and outward conduct is gentle and yielding—**\n**this is the practice of returning to the root.**\n**Thus it is said: \"Weakness is the Dao’s application.\"**\n\n**Three sentences after.**\n**All things under heaven are born from existence.**\n**Existence is qi.**\n**Though not yet formed, it already possesses qi.**\n**Thus it is said that heaven, earth, and all dharmas**\n**arise from one qi—**\n**hence, \"born from existence.\"**\n**Existence is born from non-existence.**\n**Non-existence is the Dao.**\n**Qi arises from the Dao, hence \"born from non-existence.\"**\n**Pushing to the extreme the source of generation, pointing to the Dao,**\n**to make all beings turn their hearts toward something before them—**\n**for \"return\" is to return to this non-existence.**\n\n**The chapter on the \"Superior Person\"**—the fourth—\n**previously demonstrated the Dao’s root, ordering all things to return in unity,**\n**now clarifies that the superior person, without doubt, diligently practices with faith.**\n**First, diligence; then, habituation—**\n**thus the three distinctions in rank.**\n\n**Initially, it clarifies that the three kinds of people—**\n**hearing the Dao and believing or slandering—differ:**\n**Next, it cites ancient methods where blind teachers hid their virtue,**\n**and finally, it states that only the Dao lends itself equally to all beings.**\n\n**Seven sentences—first section.**\n**The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.**\n**The Dao is what was previously spoken of—**\n**that which, born of non-existence, returns to the root.**\n**The superior person, hearing of this Dao, believes and practices it with diligence,**\n**the heart without doubt—**\n**thus the superior person.**\n\n**The middle person hears the Dao, as if it exists, as if it does not.**\n**Existence is \"having\"; non-existence is \"not.\"**\n**Though hearing of the Dao, the heart does not fully believe,**\n**sometimes desiring to return, yet doubting its truth—**\n**thus the middle person.**\n\n**The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it.**\n**Hearing of the Dao’s emptiness, stillness, and formlessness,**\n**not believing in its marvel, clapping and laughing—**\n**thus the inferior person.**\n\n**By this, the faith and slander of scholars are distinguished—**\n**superior, middle, and inferior.**\n**Not to laugh is insufficient to be the Dao.**\n**Insufficient is as much as \"not obtaining.\"**\n**The inferior person takes gentleness for cowardice,**\n**not competing for foolishness,**\n**and thus laughs at it.**\n**The inferior person does not laugh because they take**\n**much knowledge as strength,**\n**debate as virtue, deceit as wisdom,**\n**and whatever is obtained as ability—**\n**these are not the Dao, yet the inferior person holds them in esteem,**\n**thus deeming them virtue and not laughing.**\n**How can this be the Dao?**\n**Thus it is insufficient to be the Dao.**\n\n**Thirteen sentences—second section.**\n\n**Thus it is said:**\n\n*\"To abandon the void and forget gentleness is what the inferior person laughs at.\nTherefore, I cite ancient methods to prove the law of what is laughed at—\nthis is the superior sage’s teaching.\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscured,\nadvancing yet seems retreating—\nthis is the ancient sage’s law, which the superior person believes and diligently practices.\nWithin, the heart is clear and advancing;\nwithout, the appearance is dark and retreating.\n\nThe Dao is plain yet seems ordinary.\nWithin, the heart is level as the Dao,\nwhile outward, the form does not differ from the common crowd.\n*[Note: Some texts read *颣 (jié) as \"restrained,\" meaning self-restraint.]*\nThe heart is level, the form restrained—\nnot differing from restraint.\n\nThe highest virtue is like a valley,\ngreat brightness like humiliation,\nvast virtue like insufficiency.\nThe valley—empty and receptive—\nis the likeness of the highest virtue.\nWithin, the heart is pure and unadorned,\nwhile outwardly, it appears as if stained with shame.\nVirtue and deeds are fully present,\nyet the form seems common and foolish—\nthus, it appears insufficient.\n\nEstablishing virtue is like theft,\nauthentic simplicity like deceit.\n*Theft—stealing. Deceit—change.*\nTo establish virtue as if secretly stealing,\nfearing others’ awareness,\nhiding one’s name while rejecting boastfulness.\n*[Some ancient texts read *输 (shū) as \"surrender,\" or *揄 (yú) as \"to draw out.\" But the Sage’s teaching, for the sake of practical guidance, takes \"theft\" as the primary meaning.]*\nDeceit—also meaning shallow color.\nWithin, the heart is pure and unchanging in the Dao,\nwhile outwardly, it follows the times,\nadapting to things and changing.\nSpeaking of shallowness—\nits form is neither impure nor pure,\nlike the indistinct green and white of an ambiguous symbol.\n\nThe great square has no corners,\nthe great vessel is late in forming.\n*[The next four lines elucidate the completion of Dao and virtue.]*\nHe who walks the straight Dao\nhas no small angles—\nno minor practices to obstruct the Dao,\nno petty corners to harm the upright.\nThe great vessel is the Dao-heart.\nAll things, though great, form early,\nbut the Dao-vessel, without doing,\ncannot be completed in haste—\nthus, it is late in forming.\n*[This is for those who seek the Dao in the morning but gaze toward evening.]*\n\nGreat sound is rare in voice,\ngreat form has no shape.\nGreat sound—speech that elucidates the Dao.\nThose who harbor the Dao scarcely sense its response,\nasking nothing, speaking little—\nfew question the Dao, so great sound is rare.\nThus, it warns against excessive speech.\nThose who harbor the Dao and virtue\nhold themselves in humble simplicity,\nnot adorned with artificial restraints—\nhence, it is said to have no shape.\n*[This warns against embellishing appearance.]*\n*[End of the next three sentences.]*\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\n*[This clarifies the Dao’s essence—\nthe ultimate Dao is formless,\nshared yet unseen by all,\nso it is hidden;\nwithout substance to name,\nso it is nameless.]*\nClothing covers all life—\na forced name for the great Dao.\nThe first eight lines and the four great principles are all methods;\nthis section reveals the Dao’s hidden exterior and illuminated interior,\nestablishing it as the core principle.\n\nOnly the Dao\nis good at lending and completing.\n*[A sigh of praise—\namong all things, only the Dao\ncan lend qi and complete all things.]*\nSpeaking of lending—\nit is temporary borrowing, not permanent giving,\n\"and\" implies provisional completion, not lasting permanence.\nIt desires that those who borrow do not linger long,\nthat those who are completed do not remain forever—\nthat gratitude for borrowing and completion comes swiftly.\n\nThose who are completed and return\nowe it to the lending;\nthe profound meaning of \"and\" is deep.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Dao Gives Birth**\n\nPreviously, it was said that the Dao alone\nis good at lending and completing virtue and deeds.\nNow, it is said that the Dao has divine mystery\nas the source of birth and the origin of virtue and form—\nthus, there are four distinctions:\nFirst, it clarifies the origin of birth\nto recognize the root.\nSecond, it reveals the delusions of the vulgar and foolish\nin their inclinations toward or against the Dao.\nThird, it warns of the consequences\nto demonstrate gain and loss.\nFourth, it emphasizes the arrogance of the strong\nas the heaviest delusion.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\nThe Dao is ultimate emptiness,\nOne is subtle existence.\nUltimate emptiness is not nothing—\nit can give birth from One.\nThe Dao is one body,\nOne is the Dao’s qi.\nQi arises from the body,\nhence, the Dao gives birth to One.\nThough the Dao gives birth to One,\nit remains within One,\nits divine functions flowing freely—\nonly coarse and subtle differ.\n\nOne originates from the Dao,\nits essence never diminished.\nOne—this is the Original Qi, also called *Taihe* [Great Harmony].\nSpeaking numerically, it is called One;\nspeaking of virtue, it is called Harmony.\nIt is the beginning of qi, hence also called Original.\nQi is subtle existence, yet not existence—\nwithout color, without sound,\nnot existing yet existing,\nable to give birth to Two.\nTwo refers to the coarse qi of yin and yang.\nNow, One as a thing—\nfrom nothingness to existence,\nmost subtle and mysterious,\nits nature distinct from emptiness,\nnot to be called nothing,\nits form not yet shaped,\nnot to be called existence—\nit contains all things,\nmixed within.\nIt has divine function,\nable to be clear or turbid.\nClear qi is yang,\nturbid qi is yin.\nYin and yang emerge together,\nhence, it gives birth to Two.\nYin and yang separate,\nOne spreads into Two affairs,\nTwo originates from One,\nremaining whole as before.\n\nTwo then gives birth to Three—\nThree refers to form and substance already complete:\nheaven, earth, and humanity.\nPure yang is clear—heaven;\npure yin is turbid—earth;\nharmonious qi is humanity.\nHarmony—One qi containing the mysteries of yin and yang.\nThe three combine as harmony.\nIf harmony is taken as the blending of clear and turbid\nto form heaven, earth, and humanity,\nthen this would be Three giving birth to Three.\nBut here it says Two gives birth to Three,\nmeaning One qi is spread within Two,\nso only Two is spoken of.\nIt is like the Dao permeating the Three Realms—\ndirectly taking heaven, earth, and humanity as Three,\nnot counting the Dao as a fourth.\nThough heaven, earth, and humanity each contain\nthe three qi of yin, yang, and harmony in full,\noutside of heaven, earth, and humanity,\nthe original yin, yang, and harmony qi are undiminished.\nIf heaven, earth, yin, and yang, and all things\nlack harmonious qi, how could they stand?\nHow much more could they give birth to things?\n\n*[Above, from nothingness to existence,\nfrom subtlety to coarseness—\nthis is called \"giving birth,\"\nnot like today’s generation from form.]*\n\n「Thus, when humanity first comes into being, it receives the harmonious and the two qi of purity and turbidity. The subtle and the refined coalesce and solidify, transforming and giving rise to form. The spirit and consciousness are the refined essence of the harmonious Dao, sharing with heaven and earth the same received qi to bring forth life. Therefore, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *\"I divide One qi with heaven and earth to govern them, maintaining the original root as my principle.\"*\n\nThe Three giving birth to myriad things are as follows: heaven and earth give birth to myriad things, and humanity gives birth to humanity, nurturing and lengthening them, so that all things fulfill their nature and flourish. From this point onward, all is the interplay of yin and yang, generating life through form and appearance—thus it is called the Three giving birth to myriad things.\n\n**The next five sentences speak of Two.**\n\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in front, with the harmonious qi as their core. *Bear* means to lean against; *embrace* means to turn toward; *core* means the central space. For humanity, the back is yin, hence the word *bear*. The heart and front are yang, hence the word *embrace*. The harmonious qi resides within, permeating and regulating yin and yang, harmonizing the viscera and bowels, so that form and spirit are fully complete—thus it is said, *\"the harmonious qi as their core.\"*\n\nGrasses and trees grow from the earth and stretch toward the sky, similarly bearing yin and embracing yang, all possessing harmonious qi—only differing in lacking consciousness.\n\nWhat humanity detests are the states of *孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled), yet kings and nobles take these as titles. This reveals the emergence of emotional desires, where love and aversion first arise—this is the beginning of all beings creating karma.\n\n*孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled) are universally despised, yet all seek wealth and honor for their own gain. Others harm them instead of helping. Kings and nobles adopt these titles for themselves, and the people love them.\n\n**The next two sentences speak of Three.**\n\nThus, things either suffer loss to bring benefit or benefit to bring loss. *Things* here refers to all humanity. Kings and nobles adopt titles of *孤* and *寡* for themselves—this is self-loss. Yet they ultimately reside in wealth and honor—this is the people’s loss to benefit themselves. Self-benefit invites harm from others.\n\nThis passage ties together the preceding and following sections. **The next five sentences speak of Four.**\n\nWhat humanity is taught is also what I teach—easily understood. Common teachings all deviate from my Dao of *wuwei* (non-action), instead practicing the Way of *youwei* (action). Thus, the heart lacks humility and moderation, and life is cut short by untimely death. The strong and ruthless do not attain a natural death.\n\nThe bold and decisive, who harm others to benefit themselves, are like the strong and unyielding. All things suppress and crush them, causing them to perish midway—dying unnaturally, not in accordance with the Dao. They do not attain a good end, nor do they die in accord with principle.\n\nI shall take them as my teaching example. *I* refers to Laozi. *Example* means root. For the bold and ruthless, death cannot be avoided, so I speak of self-loss to restrain them. Teaching serves as the foundation for those who study; by weighing loss and benefit, I clearly demonstrate what is to come.\n\nThis chapter first explains the origin of life to inspire reverence, then enumerates calamities to instill fear and abandonment. It is a combination of admonition and encouragement, urging one to discard superficiality and return to the root.\n\n**The next four sentences speak of the sixth chapter on the world:**\n\nBefore, it was explained that the bold and ruthless do not attain a natural death; now, it is made clear that the gentle and weak align with the true and authentic.\n\nGentle opposes firm—this is the second distinction of the subsequent teachings. First, it is shown that refined intent and gentle weakness can break through rigidity and strength; then, it is lamented that the common people rarely understand the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**The first four sentences:**\n\nThe world’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness. *Utmost gentleness* and *utmost firmness* each have two meanings: one external, one internal. The external meaning is that within all phenomena, the gentlest is the Dao, and the firmest is metal and stone. *Overcomes* is like the swiftness of a galloping horse—though metal and stone are firm, the Dao penetrates and courses through them, coming and going like a galloping horse.\n\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *\"The Dao’s gentleness and weakness envelop heaven and earth, penetrating all things.\"*\n\nThe internal meaning is that *utmost gentleness* refers to the Dao-heart, and *utmost firmness* refers to afflictions. Afflictions, though countless, are as firm as metal and stone—only the gentle and weak Dao-heart can effectively assail them, causing all to dissolve. Without afflictions, one enters the realm of *wujian* (no separation).\n\nTherefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action). *Without afflictions* refers to the heart, and *no separation* refers to the Dao. The heart, free from sensory attachments, exhausts all worldly desires—thus it is called *without afflictions*. The supreme Dao is subtle and boundless, without flaws or gaps—thus it is called *no separation*. *Enter* means to unite harmoniously. Though the Dao is subtle and profound, the heart is the gap, and one who possesses nothing—uniting with the Dao’s inner emptiness—finds the heart ever more spacious. By this measure, it is known that the virtue of a vacant heart and the practice of *wuwei* greatly benefit humanity.\n\n**The next three sentences speak of the seventh chapter:**\n\nThe teaching of *wuwei* (non-action), though unspoken, brings benefit—yet few in the world attain it. Those who know the Dao lead by example, not speaking aloud. Those who learn the Dao observe with their eyes and act with their hearts, laboring not with their bodies. The body does nothing, the heart desires nothing—first breaking afflictions, then entering *wujian*, attaining the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nHe who does not speak is heard by none, and he who acts without doing is seen by none. Beyond hearing and seeing, this is not the knowledge of ordinary people. Thus, few in the world can truly grasp it—only those who can discern traces and know the heart may receive the unspoken teaching.\n\n**The next three sentences speak of the eighth chapter:**\n\nBefore, it was shown that the virtue of *wuwei* benefits one without words; now, it is revealed that the common worldly Way is filled with greed, harming oneself. The first distinction was between gain and loss in relation to the body—what is closer, the body or reputation? Next, it is made clear that deep attachment brings danger, and heavy loss follows. Finally, it is shown that cutting off greed and knowing contentment brings self-fulfillment and eternal life.\n\n**The first three sentences:**\n\nReputation and the body—what is closer? Reputation is the empty praise of external things, while the body is the true essence of life and death. Without the body, life is severed; without reputation, life endures long. Thus, the wise conceal their reputation to avoid calamity and preserve their body, while the foolish covet reputation and lose their spirit, harming their life.\n\nThis is why the question is posed: between reputation and the body, which is closer? It prompts self-examination and understanding. In Laozi’s time, there were those who killed their bodies to gain reputation—he lamented their delusion, hence setting this question to warn the virtuous.»\n\nBetween the body and wealth, which is more abundant?\nWealth is the general term for all possessions.\nThose who seek wealth intend to nourish their bodies, yet now there are those who, in their greed for riches, lose their lives—it seems wealth is plentiful while the body is scarce, the height of folly.\n\nIf one arm is worth more than all under heaven, how much greater the benefit of preserving one’s whole body?\nThis is a warning to the petty.\n\nBetween gain and loss, which is the greater affliction?\nThis is a paired question.\nTo lose reputation and wealth is an affliction, while gain is not.\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, gain is dishonor and injury to virtue, inviting calamity and misfortune—this is the affliction.\nLoss, however, brings bodily peace, flourishing virtue, and blessings—full life is without affliction.\n\nReputation and wealth are what people commonly rely upon.\nWhen appropriate, they bring fortune; when excessive, they bring disaster.\nThe distinction between appropriateness and excess is clear—this is the mirror.\n\nThus, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure;\nthe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\nThis explains the answer to the question of reputation.\nTo love dangerous tools excessively harms the spirit and shortens life, undermines merit, and depletes qi—this is great expenditure.\nGreed without restraint, unable to disperse what is gained, hoarding deeply and hiding away—this invites robbery and plunder.\nAll who die unnaturally or suffer harm for the sake of reputation and wealth are victims of great loss.\n\nTherefore, contentment brings no shame,\nand knowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one may endure long.\nThe contented know their proper measure, which has two aspects:\none is the measure of nature,\nthe other is the measure of things.\nThe measure of nature is like hunger requiring food, cold requiring clothing—\nwhen the belly is full and the body warm, nature is already satisfied.\nExcessive furs not worn, leftover food not tasted—\nthese are beyond natural measure.\nContentment is the ability to stop, called wisdom.\nIf one eats when already full, it breeds abdominal illness.\nIf one clothes oneself when already warm, it invites fever.\nWithin, there is the ugliness of self-harm;\nwithout, there is the reputation of gluttony—\nthus it is shameful.\n\nThe measure of things refers to what one ought to possess—\nthis is one’s proper share.\nNot taking beyond one’s share is knowing when to stop,\nand thus there is no danger or peril.\nThe unrestrained take beyond their share by force,\nand thus invite ruin and death.\nEven if one eats beyond fullness, unaware that food is one’s proper share and not another’s,\nit is a failure of self-restraint—\nthus one earns a shameful reputation.\nThough shame is an ugly deed, it does not lead to ruin and death.\nThis shows that contentment’s virtue is profound while its deficiency is shallow,\nand knowing when to stop is weak while its excess is deep.\nSince one’s conduct already has contentment and restraint,\nshame and peril cannot touch them—\nthus they preserve their natural lifespan without early death,\nsecuring enduring life—who can shorten it?\n\n**Chapter Eight of *Daode Jing* Commentary:**\nPreviously, it was shown that greed for reputation and competition for wealth lead to the loss of both.\nNow it is shown that abandoning wealth and forgetting reputation bring fulfillment of virtue and merit,\nholding up blessings and warning against calamity—\nthus the two distinctions follow in order.\nPreviously, it was shown that having virtue could diminish and thus achieve fulfillment;\nnow it is shown that agitation leads to deficiency while tranquility aligns with the Dao.\n\nIf Great Completion is deficient,\nits use will not be exhausted.\n\"Exhausted\" means impoverished.\nThose whose deeds are perfectly accomplished\nremain humble all day, as if deficient,\nyet their virtue fills within and benefits others without—\nlike a wellspring, its use never ends,\nand thus there is no exhaustion.\n\nPreviously, it was those who sought reputation and lost their lives,\nfor they did not forget.\nNow, those who forget reputation and obscure their traces\npreserve their virtue and longevity.\n\nIf Great Fullness is empty,\nits use will not be spent.\nThose whose virtue and Dao are perfectly full\nappear externally empty, as if lacking,\nyet they respond to circumstances without end—\nalready complete and full, their virtue is comprehensive.\n\nIf Great Straightness is bent,\nthe heart conforms to the Dao,\ncutting off private and evil desires—\nthis is Great Straightness.\nTo follow the ways of the world, yielding without resistance—\nthis is bending.\n\nIf Great Skill is clumsy,\nto act with clever expedience, perfectly suited—\nthis is Great Skill.\nTo follow conventions without innovation—\nthis is clumsiness.\n\nIf Great Eloquence is inarticulate,\nto discern truth from falsehood, analyze doubts—\nthis is Great Eloquence.\nTo speak without flattery, expressing meaning without words—\nthis is inarticulateness.\n\n**Chapter Nine (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Ten (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Eleven: *For Learning* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Twelve: *The Sage* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Thirteen: *Birth* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter

salvation is dire.\nNow, with knowledge and action along the Dao,\nfear is profound, warnings earnest.\nThus, three distinctions are made:\nFirst, the expedient speech of the Sage\nso things may follow in trust.\nSecond, how humans, loving false paths,\nsuffer loss in virtue and wealth.\nLast, how thieves, boasting of their gains,\nprove the Dao’s falsity.\n\n**First Three Lines:**\n*\"Make me aware, that I may walk the Great Dao,*\n*yet act with utmost reverence.\"*\n\n*\"Make me\"*—expedient words.\n*\"Aware\"*—vast.\nZang Xiú both deemed it small.\nNow, with the Two Virtues,\nthose who know plot schemes—\nsmall wisdom, yet hearts walk the Great Dao,\nteaching with laborious intent.\nEven killing a father or elder brother\ndemands restraint—\nhow much more so for those who know\nand teach with purpose?\n\nThey blaspheme the brilliance of sun and moon,\nerode the essence of mountains and rivers,\ndisrupt the harmony of the four seasons,\nso that crawling worms feast upon them,\nseated in their ruin.\nThe pure customs of antiquity\nare thus defiled,\nthe Three Powers unbalanced,\nthe Five Phases disordered—\nwhat greater terror than this?\nThus, with no trifling intent,\none who knows must not act in transformation.\n\n**Next Nine Lines:**\nThe Great Dao is effortless,\nyet people love shortcuts.\n*\"Shortcuts\"*—false paths.\nRen and righteousness are minor deeds,\nartificial actions bring scant fortune—\nall are not the True Way,\nyet crowds pursue them,\nfearing they may not keep up,\ntheir hearts lost to the vast,\nunaware of what is not true.\n\nThe Great Dao is smooth and level,\nwithout desire, without striving.\nWithin, the mind is not weary with thought,\nwithout, no wealth is wasted.\nSitting in ease, doing nothing,\nthe world follows in transformation—\nthis is the Great Dao’s way.\nYet none can truly know it.\n\nMorning, the halls are cleared,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries stand empty.\n\n「The morning court—\na hall of the Great Dao.\nWhen the Five Ranks gather in unity,\nand the Four Quarters bow in allegiance,\none must demonstrate **humility and gentleness** (谦柔),\nand adorn with **frugality and plainness** (俭素).\n\n*\"Cleared\"* (除)—the steps of the palace,\nor the removal of old adornment for new.\nDestroying thatched roofs and earthen steps,\nerecting lofty halls and ornate pavements,\nexaggerating craftsmanship to dazzle others,\nindulging in extravagance to exalt oneself—\nthis is what *\"cleared\"* means.\n\nSeizing the farmer’s labor,\nconscripting the strong,\nleaving eastern slopes unplowed,\nabandoning southern fields to ruin—\nthis is *\"fallow\"* (芜).\n\nGrain fails to ripen,\nwalls crumble, roofs leak,\nthe people lack sustenance,\nhouseholds and states hold no reserve—\nthis is *\"empty\"* (虚).\n\n**Morning** (朝) refers to the mind within the body—\nthe mind, where the Five Spirits and myriad talents converge,\nwhere gain and loss of fame and profit intersect,\nwhere right and wrong, deliberation and calculation gather.\nThus, it is called **morning**.\n\nYet, when one further diminishes the already diminished,\nuntil reaching **non-action** (无为),\nand instead scorns plainness and simplicity,\ndespises sincerity and authenticity,\nspeaks without truthfulness,\nand favors empty flourishes—\nthis is *\"cleared\"* (除).\n\nCravings fill the heart,\nright and wrong clutter the mind,\nthe **spiritual chamber** (灵府) grows dim and filthy,\nwisdom and discernment wither—\nthis is *\"fallow\"* (芜) of the mind.\n\n**Dao-practice** (道业) neglected,\nvirtuous deeds left incomplete,\nstraining necks to flaunt hollow boasts—\nthis is *\"empty\"* (虚).\n\nWearing garments of fine colors,\nbearing sharp blades for gain,\nsated by every delicacy,\nwhile treasures overflow the storehouses—\nthis is called **robbery and boasting** (盗夸).\n**Robbery and boasting** is not the Dao.\nAll these riches were never truly yours—\nstripped from the people,\nyet paraded as your own possessions.\nThe calamity and blame are profound—\nhow can this be the Dao?\nAll that was previously condemned\nfails to embody the Great Dao.\n\nThose who practice **Ren and righteousness** (仁义) have already been shown to abandon the Dao—\nhow much more so when they stray beyond Ren and righteousness into false paths?\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: On the Goodness of Establishing Virtue**\nThe **illuminated** (明) love shortcuts without restraint,\nbenefiting themselves at others’ expense—\nthis is the **illuminated** (明) who value **true virtue** (真守分),\ncultivate the self for others’ benefit (修身利物).\n*\"Remedy follows ailment\"* (前病后药)—\nthus it comes next.\n\nThere are three distinctions:\nFirst, the **illuminated** (明) who steadfastly establish virtue and uphold the Dao without wavering.\nSecond, those who cultivate the self and their household, gradually broadening their benefit to others.\nThird, those who, through this, perceive others and know what constitutes **true kinship** (至亲).\n\n**Establishing virtue does not waver** (善建不拔),\n**Embracing virtue does not falter** (善抱不脱).\n\n*\"Establishing\"* (建)—the beginning of a matter.\n*\"Wavering\"* (拔)—its ruin afterward.\nTo establish virtue in the Dao,\nto correct its onset and solidify its foundation,\nwithout being toppled by changing times—\nthis is to establish virtue well.\n\n*\"Embracing\"* (抱)—to uphold and guard.\n*\"Faltering\"* (脱)—to lose and abandon.\nIf one steadfastly upholds the Dao,\nnever losing it—\nthis is embracing virtue well.\n\nDescendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\nTo *\"cease\"* (辍)—to stop.\nSacrifices by descendants—\nthose with ancestral halls,\nwhen descendants flourish, sacrifices endure.\nWhen descendants decline, sacrifices vanish.\nIf virtue is established and the Dao unbroken,\na household of goodness accumulates vast blessings—\nancestors honored above,\ndescendants enlightened below,\neach generation producing the worthy and wise,\ntheir succession unbroken.\nThough some may dismiss descendants as shallow,\nthis *Scripture* does not limit its teaching by such distinctions—\nfor even those with descendants\nneed not be excluded from embracing the Dao.\n\nThe following text speaks of\ncultivating the self, the household,\nand extending this to all under heaven—\nthus it is known that the *Scripture*’s intent\npermeates universally,\nbenefiting both **Daoists** (道士) and the **common folk** (俗).\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the self** (修之身),\nits **power** (德) becomes **true** (真).\nTo cultivate the self with the Dao—\nto abandon cravings,\nto discard falsehood and deceit,\nto focus and guard in unity—\nits **power** (德) is **true**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the household** (修之家),\nits **power** (德) has **surplus** (有余).\nLike birds nurturing their young,\n**power** (德) is complete and can transform—\nwhen cultivation of the self is finished,\nthis principle is applied to the household,\nteaching wife and children to return to sincerity,\nto find ease in poverty and delight in the Dao,\nas vulgar habits fade and **virtue** (德行) renews daily,\n**Dao-practice** (道业) flourishes—\nthus it is **surplus**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the village** (修之乡),\nits **power** (德) becomes **long-lasting** (长).\nThose with the Dao dwelling in the village,\nneighbors and kin admire them in awe,\nsuperior and inferior recognize their order,\nthe greedy and competitive know moderation—\ntheir **power** (德) grows ever stronger,\nhence it is called **long-lasting**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the state** (修之国),\nits **power** (德) becomes **abundant** (丰).\nTo govern the state with the Dao—\nall receive its nourishment,\ncustoms shift and morals ease,\npeople return to sincerity, goods overflow—\nthus it is called **abundant**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **throughout the world** (修之天下),\nits **power** (德) becomes **universal** (普).\nWhere the Dao resides,\nits kindred spread like a lamp passed on—\nno one is left unnurtured,\nwhile I alone accumulate profound virtue.\nTransformation reaches the far and near,\ngrace extends to the hidden and the manifest,\nthe humble and the lofty alike find peace,\nthe sluggish and the restless attain their nature—\nnothing is left unbenefited,\nhence it is called **universal**.\n\nThus, one observes the self **through the self** (以身观身),\nthe household **through the household** (以家观家),\nthe village **through the village** (以乡观乡),\nthe state **through the state** (以国观国),\nthe world **through the world** (以天下观天下).\n\nTo observe others,\nfirst observe oneself—\nyet observation has many methods.\nHere, three are briefly stated:\n**1. Observing with discernment** (有观),\n**2. Observing with emptiness** (空观),\n**3. Observing with truth** (真观).\n\n**1. Observing with discernment** (有观)—\n**Master of the Yellow River** (河上公) says:\n*\"Observe those who cultivate the Dao in their bodies\nand those who do not—\nwho endures, who perishes?\nThe village, state, and world follow the same pattern.\nOnly by observing traces of endurance and ruin at the edges\ncan one know the difference between cultivation and neglect—\nthus it is called **observing with discernment**.\"*\n\n**2. Observing with emptiness** (空观)—\nto observe the body as illusory and without true substance,\nand thus settle one’s resolve.\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"The essential precept must know\nthat within the **Three Realms** (三界),\neven the **Three Dynasties** (三代) are empty.\nThough there is my body,\nall must return to emptiness—\nthus it is called **observing with emptiness**.\"*\n\n**3. Observing with truth** (真观)—\nthen, one must observe according to this *Scripture*,\ninvestigating:\n*\"From what did this body arise?\nFrom whence did it come?\nWhose child is it?\nWith what does it form its limbs and myriad parts?\nWho governs its **qi** (气命) and **spirit** (精神)?\nSeeking the *Scripture*’s principles,\ntracing the Dao’s flow,\nfirst, the **One Qi** (一气) of the *Scripture*,\nthen the **Yin-Yang** (阴阳) transformations,\nthe Dao as **spirit** (精神),\n**Primordial Unity** (元和) as **qi** (气命),\n**Yin-Yang** as the **substance** (质绪),\nthe **Great Dao** as the **master craftsman** (都匠).\nCollecting these elements,\nmolding and refining them into the body—\nthe **heart** (心) is the **essence of Yin-Yang** (阴阳之精),\nyet it is the master of cravings.\nThe **spirit** (神) is the **essence of the Dao** (至道之精),\nyet it is the master of **qi** (气命).\nIn all the body’s functions,\nnothing is left unaccounted for.\"*\n\nAll conditions converge,\neach with its own refinement and coarseness.\nThe refined become sages and worthies,\nthe coarse become common and foolish—\neven birds and beasts,\nall encounter this by nature.\n\nThis is called the **initial body**.\nFrom here onward,\nlife arises through form,\nwith sentience yet no feeling—\neach a distinct lineage,\nwhere evil gradually takes root,\nand deeds accumulate like grass and trees.\nPlants lack sentience,\ntheir nature unchanging,\nbut humans and beasts, endowed with awareness,\nflow through their deeds.\n\nBy this reasoning,\nexamine step by step—\nclear and distinct.\n\nKnow that **Dao** is the **mother**,\nfor if **Dao** is the mother,\nthen one is her child.\nRecognizing the mother,\none must return to her early.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The world has its beginning,\nand it is the mother of the world.\"*\n\nHaving found the mother,\none knows her child.\nHaving known the child,\none must again guard the mother.\nThis is the true principle—\nonly the enlightened understand it,\nhence it is called **true observation**.\n\nThus, one must cherish and preserve oneself,\nnot abandoning the **Dao’s** ways,\ndevoting the heart to serving the mother,\nwith sincere filial devotion.\nDo not indulge desires or cling to defilements,\nlest you fall into death’s snare,\nand the **Dao’s** essence be lost in the Three Realms of Suffering.\nHaving known the mother,\ndo not casually seek her—\nfirst, know where the mother resides,\nwhat form she takes.\n\nNow observe the mother’s nature:\nneither existence nor nonexistence,\ncoming from nowhere,\nvanishing without trace,\nbeyond all forms and images,\nunfathomable in description.\nSeeking beyond empty and full,\nshe cannot be confined by any measure.\n\nApproaching, no head is seen;\nfollowing, no tail appears.\nFlickering like a lost shadow,\none does not know where she goes.\n\nHaving observed the mother’s ineffable mystery,\nshe is truly worthy of reverence,\ndeep reflection, and diligent practice.\n\nThe essence of the **law** lies in:\nnot clinging to existence,\nnot clinging to nonexistence,\nempty yet grounded,\nsolitary yet unmoving.\nAfter long practice,\na serene contentment arises,\nas if something were attained.\nComparing the heart to the mother,\nthe method of placement is:\nemptiness and stillness align.\nWhen the heart resembles the mother,\nit merges with the **One**,\nand the **Dao** reaches divine harmony—\nthus, it feels as if something is gained.\n\nWhen the mind dwells here,\nit is like losing one’s home,\nyet the **Primordial Pearl** is obtained—\nall matters are complete.\nWhat more is there to seek?\n\nHaving understood the body thus,\nnext observe family, nation,\neven the world—\nfrom true sages to the lowliest insects,\nall share the same mother,\nthe same **qi**,\nthe same **law-nature**.\n\nConfucius cherished his brothers,\nyet did not consider them alone as kin,\nfor the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:\n*\"The **Dao** is not confined to me alone—\nall things possess it.\"*\n\nAll things are unaware,\nyet the **Dao** dwells within them.\nObserving the body through the body,\nthis is the key.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe **Venerable Master** feigned asking me\nto show how one attains knowledge—\nyet even so, it remains as described.\n\nThus, this *Scripture* is the finest guide\nfor recognizing the mother,\nthe essential method for awakening to truth.\nIt unifies all things into **One**,\nharmonizing heaven and earth into great unity—\nonly this *Scripture* holds this secret.\n\nThough the *Scripture’s* principles are clear,\nthose who attain it must still practice.\nCease all thought and action,\nabandon all striving,\nand verify through **sitting-forgetfulness**.\nDiligence is essential—\nmere recitation leads to familiarity and confusion,\nlike striking the water to seek a shadow,\nwasting effort on mere reflection.\n\nThose who practice **emptiness** see emptiness\nand thus remain untouched by all things.\nThose who practice **true observation** recognize truth\nand thus falsehoods naturally cease.\n\nYet the mind that sees emptiness\nstill opposes existence,\nwhile true wisdom transcends both empty and full—\nonly by abandoning existence does one emerge beyond empty and full.\n\nWords arise from principles,\nprinciples resonate with sentiment—\nwhen understood, no words remain.\nSeek the harmony of intent and attainment.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighteen: Containing Virtue**\n\nPreviously, it was explained how practicing the **Dao**\ntransforms the self and the world into harmony.\nNow it is shown how **containing virtue** nurtures all things\nwithout causing harm.\n\nFrom humans to creatures,\nthere are two distinctions in order:\nFirst, the pure and harmonious fills internally,\nharming nothing externally.\nLater, one knows harmony brings benefit\nbut does not yet understand how to avoid harm.\n\nThe first ten lines:\nThe depth of **containing virtue**\nis like that of an infant.\n\nThose who deeply embrace **virtue and the Dao**\nare internally filled with harmonious **qi**,\nand thus external evils cause no harm.\nTheir virtue is profound and distant,\nunknown to others,\nyet even infants recognize it—\nhence the comparison.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not attack,\ngrasping birds do not seize.\n\nPoisonous creatures—snakes and lizards—\nsnakes bite with their mouths,\nlizards strike with their tails.\n*\"Sting\"* refers to venomous action.\n*\"Grasp\"* means to clutch and seize.\nSome birds snatch prey with their claws\nto carry it away for feeding.\n\nFerocious beasts—tigers and wolves—\ndo not harm those who embody **containing virtue**,\nfor harmonious **qi** influences all things,\nreaching even this extent.\n\nTheir bones are weak, their sinews soft,\nyet their grasp is firm.\nAn infant, newly born,\nhas no hair, its skin red and plump—\nhence *\"赤子\"* (赤子).\nAt this stage, sinews and bones are frail,\nyet when it closes its fingers around the thumb,\nits grip is unyielding.\nThis is the natural result of undispersed harmony—\nno effort is exerted, yet it is so.\n\nBefore knowing the union of male and female,\nthe infant’s loins stir—\nthe essence is at its peak.\n*\"朘\"* refers to the infant’s yin stirring.\nMale and female—yin and yang—\nbefore understanding sexual union,\nthe infant’s yin moves—\na sign of harmonious **qi** overflowing,\nnot driven by lust.\n\nIt cries all day without hoarseness—\nthe ultimate harmony.\n*\"嘎\"* means a voice that is rough or strained.\nThough it cries endlessly,\nits voice remains unbroken—\na proof of complete internal harmony.\n\nThe next seven lines:\nKnowing

wǒ dàn bùzuò guófù rén chún*).\n---\n**Five sentences in one** (*wǔ jù yī*).\n---\nWith **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhī guó*),」\n\nWith **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhī guó*), it refers to the **feudal lords** (*zhūhóu yě*). Governance (*zhèng*) encompasses **仁** (*rén*—benevolence), **義** (*yì*—righteousness), **礼** (*lǐ*—ritual/propriety), **信** (*xìn*—trustworthiness), **法令** (*fǎlìng*—laws and decrees), and **科条** (*kētiáo*—statutes and regulations), which serve as methods for **teaching and regulating the people** (*zhèngjiào lǐrén zhī fǎ*). Yet, those who implement them find it **burdensome** (*fán*), and those who follow them labor under their weight. Such governance may suffice for **small matters** (*lǐ xiǎo*), but it cannot **transform the great** (*huà dà*). Hence, it is called **governance** (*zhì guó*).\n\nWith **unconventional means** (*yǐ qí*) in **wielding arms** (*yòng bīng*), unconventional (*qí*) here means **deception** (*zhà yě*). Those who wield arms—such as the **four tyrants** (*sì xióng*) rebelling against humanity—defy **heavenly order** (*bèi luàn tiāncháng*), causing unrest among the **common folk** (*wànxìng bù ān*). In such times, **sound strategies** (*liángcè*) are needed. Yet, **using arms to maintain peace** (*yòng bīng jìng nán*) is a challenge even for the wise, who must take it up. When difficulty arises, **flexibility and deception** (*quándào guì zhà*) become paramount, though such tactics cannot be **prolonged** (*bùkě jiǔxíng*).\n\nWith **non-action** (*wúwéi wúshì*) in **acquiring the world** (*qǔ tiānxià*), acquiring the world (*qǔ tiānxià*) refers to **emperors and kings** (*dìwáng yě*). **Non-action and non-interference** (*wúwéi wúshì*) are the **virtue/power** (*dé*) of emperors and kings. When the heart **has no desires** (*wú suǒ yù*), and affairs **are left undone** (*shì wú suǒ wéi*), they do not **summon the people** (*zhào yú rén*), yet the people **return in admiration** (*bǎixìng guī mù*), and all directions **come in harmony** (*sìfāng tóng zhì*). This is because they do not **purposefully take** (*wéi yǒuxīn qǔdé*) the world, hence it is called **acquiring the world without interference** (*wúshì qǔ tiānxià*).\n\n**Ten sentences in two** (*xià shí jù èr*).\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? **By this** (*yǐ cǐ*). How do I know? **This is inquiry** (*hé yǐ zhī, fā wèn yě*). The world is thus (*zhī rán*), just as it is (*yú rú shì yě*). By this (*yǐ cǐ*) means **judging and measuring these three matters** (*zhǐ cǐ sān shì jiàoliáng yǐ dáshì*).\n\n**Deception, governance, and non-interference** (*qí zhèng wúshì*) are **talent** (*cái yě*). **Military, state, and worldly affairs** (*jūn guó tiānxià*) are **position** (*wèi yě*). When **position secures talent**, affairs are **regulated** (*shì lǐ*), and when **talent finds position**, the **Dao/Way is practiced** (*dào xíng*). Therefore, seeing **talent** reveals the **order or chaos** (*lǐ luàn*) of **position**, and observing **position** can distinguish the **superiority or inferiority** (*yōu liè*) of **talent**. Hence, it is said **by this** (*yǐ cǐ yě*).\n\nThe world **abounds in taboos** (*tiānxià duō jìhuì*), yet the people **grow ever poorer** (*mín mí pín*). This illustrates that **acquiring the world through interference** (*yǒushì qǔ tiānxià*) harms the people (*shēng xià jìhuì*), just as **excessive governance impoverishes the populace** (*shàng zhèng mí pín*). It clarifies that **harsh taboos and governance** (*xià shēng jìhuì fēi yī lèi*) are not of one kind, hence it is said **the world abounds** (*guó duō*).\n\nTaboos (*jìhuì*) are **laws and decrees** (*fǎlìng yě*). Strict statutes and severe laws (*yán kē jùn fǎ*), dense as **congealed fat** (*mì ruò níng zhī*), cause **internal distress from hunger and cold** (*gōngshǒu zé nèi pò jīhán*) if one does nothing, and **external entanglement in punishments and ordinances** (*cóngshì zé wài luó xíngzhuàn*) if one acts. Now, **restricting affairs and imposing taboos** (*yǔ shì míng huì*) briefly refers to three types:\n\n1. **Family and state taboos** (*jiāguó jìhuì*), where **speech loses its meaning** (*yán tán zé shī qí yì*).\n2. **Yin and yang taboos** (*yīnyáng jìhuì*), where **actions lose their timing** (*wéishì zé shī qí shí*).\n3. **Laws and decrees taboos** (*fǎlìng jìhuì*), where **livelihoods lose their occupation** (*yíngshēng zé shī qí yè*).\n\nThough **laws are established to benefit the people** (*fǎ zhī suǒshè, běn nǐ rén*), if the people are **forced to comply**, it becomes **inconvenient for them** (*yǐ zhòng cóngjī, zé yú rén bù biàn*). Disobedience leads to **punishment**, while compliance results in **loss of benefit** (*fán zé fàn jìn, cóng zé shī lì*). Hence, **poverty** (*pín yě*).\n\n**By this, it is verified** (*yǐ cǐ yàn zhī*), knowing that **they are not the sovereigns of non-interference** (*bù wéi wúshì zhī zhǔ*). If **conducting affairs with utmost propriety and no taboos** (*xíng zhì lǐ, bùhuì*) is practiced, then **all will prosper naturally** (*rén jiē zì fù*).\n\nWhen the people **abound in clever devices** (*mín duō lìqì*), the state **grows more corrupt** (*guójīā hūn*). The people (*rén*) are the **general term for all ranks** (*guì biān zhī tōngchēng*). Clever devices (*lìqì*) refer to **schemes and stratagems** (*jīquán móucè*). Those capable of **harming others for personal gain** (*kān yǐ shēng rén yì jī*) are all called **clever devices** (*lìqì*). Yet, when **family and state** pursue **affairs and interference** (*hǎoshì yǒuwéi*), the **rulers value clever schemes and stratagems** (*shàng wù quánzhì yǐ jìn xià*), while the **common folk devise deceitful plots to defy the rulers** (*xià shēng jiān cè yǐ wǔ shàng*). Rulers and subjects **colluding in schemes**, not practicing the **Dao/Way of rectitude** (*bù xíng zhèngdào*), lead to **deception and falsehood among the populace** (*rénshù wěi wàng*), and **confusion and bewilderment among rulers and ministers** (*jūnchén hūn huò*).\n\nWhen the people **abound in cleverness and ingenuity** (*mín duō zhìxiào*), **unconventional things proliferate** (*qí wù zī qǐ*). Proliferate (*zī*) means **to increase** (*yì yě*). Cleverness and ingenuity (*zhìxiào*) are **unconventional products of worry and labor** (*yōuláo zhī qíwù*), referring to those who **possess extraordinary cleverness and ingenuity** (*bùfēi yǒushì zhī tú*), delight in **unusual things** (*hǎo wéi yìwù*), and **compete in mutual boasting** (*jìng xiāng guā shàng*), daily **increasing their unconventional abilities** (*yìbiàn qí néng*). This is because the **rulers cherish the strange and unusual** (*shàng guì zhēn qí*), causing the **common folk to indulge in extravagance and excess** (*bǎixìng jiāo huā yì shèn*).\n\nWhen **punishments and regulations proliferate** (*fǎwù zī zhāng*), **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*). Punishments and regulations (*fǎwù*) refer to **tools of penal law** (*xíngfá zhī jù*), such as **strict statutes and harsh laws** (*yán kē kù fǎ*), including **stocks, fetters, and flogging** (*jiāsuǒ zhuīchǔ zhī shǔ*). Though **applying punishments and regulations aims to prevent theft** (*shī fǎwù běn nǐ fàn dào*), when **harsh penal methods are excessive** (*chǔ fǎ duō ér dào zéi shèn*), it is because the **rulers favor strange and unusual things** (*shàng hǎo qíwù*), the **common folk have no choice but to steal** (*xià wú zé dào*). Even if the **legal net is dense** (*fǎwǎng suī mì*), thieves **grow ever more cunning** (*dào zéi mí qí*), and **offenders multiply** (*fàn dào zé zhòng*), hence it is said **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*).\n\n**Five sentences in two** (*xià wǔ jù èr*).\n\nThus, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) proclaims: **\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves naturally\"** (*wǒ wúwéi, mín zì huà*);\n\nThe **Sage** now elucidates how the **uninvolved** (*wúshì*) attains **my Heavenly Sovereign** (*wǒ tiānwáng*).\n\nSuppose the **Heavenly Sovereign** declares:\n*\"I govern from above with non-action, and all under heaven naturally transform themselves.\"*\n\n**Non-action** refers to **superior governance** (*shàng zhèng*), while **self-transformation** reveals the **people’s growth** (*xià yì*). This aligns with the **fourfold harmony** of principle—**self-evident**.\n\n*\"I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich.\"*\nAbove, there are **no taxes or corvée labor** (*shàng wú fùyì zhī shì*), and below, there are **no weary or disturbed people** (*xià wú láorǎo zhī rén*).\nAll households dwell in peace, the **four classes** (*sìmín*) resume their vocations—women at their looms, men at their plows. **Pure virtue** fills the heart, and **abundant grain** overflows the fields—hence, they are **rich**.\n\n*\"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves.\"*\nPeople are like water: **still, they become clear and level**; level, they can **rectify all things**.\nStillness arises from **tranquility**—when the lower moves, the upper follows. **Desires and perversities are severed**, and people return to **simplicity and rectitude**.\nAs previously stated: *\"Clarity and stillness are the rectification of all under heaven.\"*\n\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n**Desire** begins with **covetousness and attachment**; **simplicity** is the **undivided purity of the heart** before dispersion.\nIf the **Sovereign** abandons desire, the people **cease greed and licentiousness**, weary of frivolous excess, and **naturally revert to their original simplicity**.\n\nThe **Laozi’s** teaching does not merely extol the benefits of **non-action** but contrasts it with the **harm caused by governance**. The **gains and losses of kingship** are mirrored here—**like the tortoise-shell and bronze divination** (*guījìng*).\n**Chapter Twenty-One on Governance** follows:\nPreviously, it was shown how **transformation** leads to **deviance or purity** among people. Now it clarifies how **governance**, whether **lenient or severe**, leads to **completeness or deficiency**.\nThough **excesses are not fully removed**, this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions**:\nFirst, it distinguishes **governance’s leniency or urgency** and their **benefits or harms**.\nSecond, it explains that **calamity and fortune cycle endlessly**, with **no ultimate limit**.\nThird, it demonstrates how **non-action** governs by **rectifying oneself and leading others**.\n\n**Four sentences in one.**\n\nWhen **governance is slow and measured** (*qí zhèng mènmèn*), the people are **simple and sincere** (*qí mín chúnchún*).\n*\"Slow and measured\"* means **lenient and relaxed**. Some texts read *\"mǐnmǐn\"* (蒙昧), with the same pronunciation as *\"mén\"* (门), meaning **obscured and ignorant**.\n*\"Simple and sincere\"* means **unadorned and straightforward**. If the **Sovereign** is **dim like darkness**, and governance is **lenient and relaxed**, then the people **naturally become honest and thick-witted like the unlearned**.\n**Turning from corruption back to simplicity** marks the **beginning of fortune**.\n\nWhen **governance is sharp and scrutinizing** (*qí zhèng cháchá*), the people are **depleted and failing** (*qí mín quēquē*).\n*\"Sharp and scrutinizing\"* marks the **onset of strict governance**. *\"Depleted and failing\"* follows **exhaustion and ruin**.\nThis is for those who **cultivate fortune through self-discipline**: when the **Sovereign’s heart is broad and still**, the **five viscera** are harmonious, the **hundred passages** are regulated—**all functions operate as they should**.\nBut if the **Sovereign is overly vigilant**, **external conduct falters**, and **inner vitality dissipates**, leading to **premature death**—hence, they are **depleted**.\n\n**Eight sentences in two.**\n\n**Calamity** is the **leaning of fortune**; **fortune** is the **hidden seed of calamity**.\n*\"Leaning\"* means **dependence**; *\"hidden\"* means **concealed**.\n**Calamity and fortune** are the **retributions of good and evil**.\nIf one **empties the heart** of all **good and evil**, then **having neither**, how could there be **fortune or calamity**?\nBut when the **heart engages in good or evil**, **fortune and calamity naturally arise**—**calamity clings to evil**, while **fortune lies within**, though **calamity is evident** and **fortune is concealed**.\nIf one **abandons evil and practices goodness**, then **fortune emerges from calamity**, and **calamity is concealed while fortune appears**—hence, *\"calamity is the leaning of fortune.\"*\nIf one **indulges in fortune with arrogance and excess**, then **fortune vanishes and calamity arises**—**calamity is the hidden seed of fortune**.\nAs long as **good and evil persist**, **fortune and calamity will never cease**.\nThe **heart is the master of good and evil**; thus, **calamity and fortune depend on it**, both **existing within the heart**.\n**Fortune and calamity are formless**—they arise **instantly with perception**. Who can **know their limits**? There is **no fixed measure**.\n*\"Measure\"* refers to the **central principle**—the **heart**.\n**Fortune comes from goodness**, and **calamity arises from evil**; **fortune and calamity cycle endlessly**—who can **know their bounds**?\nIt is because **partial and perverse hearts** **give rise to goodness and evil**, yet those who **forget goodness and evil** possess the **rectified heart**.\nThe **rectified heart** is **strange**, and **goodness is also strange**.\nThough the **Sovereign’s heart may forget**, **goodness and evil remain as the rectified principle**—this is **not yet the ultimate rectitude**.\n*\"Strange\"* differs from other **good and evil**; **not inviting fortune or calamity**, though **called good**, it is **not yet worthy of the Dao**. This is **strangeness** (*xiān*).\n*\"Strangeness\"* is the **perverse path** (*dào zhī yé*).\n**Conforming to the Dao** still leaves **residual defilement**; **dwelling in the world** leaves **remaining hatred**.\nThis is merely **self-imposed eccentricity**, not yet **true goodness**.\nThe **people’s delusion** has **lasted for ages**.\n*\"Strangeness\"* is the **habit of clinging to rectitude**; *\"perversity\"* is the **calamity of fixating on goodness**.\n**Nurturing illness without awareness**, hence called **delusion**.\n**Abandoning perversity and clinging to rectitude** is like **being trapped in a sack**—hence, **fixed**.\nFrom **calamity and fortune** to **perversity and goodness**, spanning **ages and eons**, hence called **long-lasting**.\n\nThe **Sage’s compassionate benevolence** will **rescue them**—this is elaborated below.\n\n**Five sentences in three.**\n\nThus, the **Sage** is **square yet does not cut**, **sharp yet not defiled**.\n*\"Square\"* means **rectified**; *\"cut\"* means **severed**.\n*\"Defiled\"* means **evil**; some texts read *\"shuài\"* (刿), meaning **harm**.\nAll who **cling to rectitude or perversity** as their own **strange conduct**—the **Sage** practices **great rectitude**, blending **all teachings into one**, **not severing the crooked** to follow the straight, **self-sufficient in virtue**, **not seeking external purity**.\nThe **people’s greed and defilement** are **internalized as true purity**, yet still **contaminated by worldly habits**.\n\n**Breaking the perverse yet not indulging**, **bright yet not dazzling**.\n*\"Indulging\"* means **displaying**; the **body acts upright**, the **mouth does not proclaim**, **boasting or provoking greed**—these are **self-imposed eccentricities**.\nThough **wisdom, virtue, and names** differ externally, their **inner essence is empty and forgotten**.\n\nIf **goodness is attained through empty forgetfulness**, then **fools will naturally perceive it**, and the **wise will emulate it**, **hiding their brilliance**—**not disturbing the masses**, **not coveting darkness**, **non-action’s transformation** is **greatly realized**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Governing the People** follows:\nPreviously, it was shown how **calamity and fortune have no end** due to **governance and teaching through action**.\nNow it clarifies how **transformation** extends to **both people and the heavens** through **non-action’s principles**.\n**Transformation precedes action**—this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions** within the chapter:\nFirst, it shows how **non-action’s principles** can **transform people and the heavens**.\nSecond, it demonstrates that **mastering non-action** can **secure a kingdom**.\nThird, it reveals that **sustaining non-action** leads to **self-attained longevity**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Governing the People (continued)**\n\n**Eleven Sentences (First Section):**\nTo govern both people and the heavens, nothing surpasses **establishing the Dao as the standard**.\n*\"Thus\"* (及) means *\"to reach\"* (至).\n*\"Heavens\"* (天) refers to **Nature’s spontaneity**.\nSome manuscripts read *\"affairs\"* (事), meaning *\"undertakings\"* (事业).\n*\"Standard\"* (式) means **Law/Principle**.\nEarlier, it was said: *\"The Sage embraces Oneness as the standard for the world.\"*\nSome manuscripts read *\"frugality\"* (啬), meaning *\"thrift,\"* but mere frugality is insufficient to subdue the world, hence **Law/Principle** is the correct interpretation.\n\nTo transform the people and unify distant and near in harmonious intent—so that all may attain **Nature’s inherent order**—nothing surpasses employing the **Dao of non-action** as the standard.\nThus, people are all governed, and the heavens all aligned.\nThose who take **undertakings** (事业) as transforming the myriad people, or who practice **non-action** as their undertaking—once they have won the hearts of the myriad people and aligned with **Nature’s Way**, they can truly subdue.\n\nOnly through **establishing the standard** can one achieve early submission.\n*\"Submission\"* (伏) means *\"to follow.\"*\nTo lead and transform the myriad people, so that the four quarters submit early—this is achieved solely by the **Law of non-action**, the most critical principle.\nEarly submission is called **\"accumulating virtue\"** (重积德).\n*\"Virtue\"* (德) refers to the **manifestation of the Dao in action**, encompassing all virtues, ever-increasing and unceasing—this is **\"accumulating virtue.\"**\nDifficult-to-transform individuals submit early because this virtue is profound and vast, layered and thickly accumulated, hence they are won over.\n**\"Accumulating virtue\"** ensures nothing is unconquered.\n*\"Conquer\"* (克) means *\"to achieve fruitfully.\"*\nWhen virtue resides within, one can move the heavens and earth, and awaken spirits and gods—nothing resists, so where can one not conquer?\nNothing is unconquered—its extent is boundless.\nWhen virtue is deeply accumulated, all things revere and honor it, following the wind and emulating the Dao—what limit can there be?\nIts extent being unknown—this is how one secures a kingdom.\nThere are two meanings of *\"unknown extent\"*:\nFirst, virtue is accumulated so deeply and broadly that its measure equals the boundless void, with no limits to gauge.\nSecond, the number of those who submit is countless—only when virtue reaches this magnitude can one rule as sovereign to nourish the people of a kingdom.\n\n**Two Sentences (Second Section):**\nThe **Dao as the mother of a kingdom** ensures its enduring longevity.\nThe **Dao** has the function of **generation and nourishment**, hence it is called *\"mother.\"*\nIf one possesses the **Dao** and applies it, governing the state will bring stability and prosperity to the people, with blessings enduring long.\n\n**Two Sentences (Third Section):**\nThus, **deep roots and firm foundations** yield the **Dao of longevity and enduring vision**.\nFor those who have previously accumulated virtue, treating the **Dao as the mother of the kingdom** grants longevity—yet it has not yet explained how guarding the mother ensures enduring rule.\nNow, the full method of **preserving life and securing the state** is fully expounded, warning of the benefits of governing well.\nWood, as a thing, has roots below and fruit above—deep roots make it unpluckable, firm foundations make it unfailing.\nThose who accumulate virtue have the **Dao in their person** and **virtue in their heart**; guarding the **Dao through non-action** deepens their **life-root**.\nCultivating the heart to nourish virtue ensures **longevity**.\nFirm foundations and deep roots ensure **life’s continuity**.\nFirm foundations prevent bodily dissolution, extended life ensures **longevity**, and bodily integrity ensures **enduring vision**.\n*\"Longevity\"* refers to the **body**, *\"enduring vision\"* to its **function**—thus it is known that **deep roots and firm foundations** yield the **Dao of longevity and enduring vision**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Three on Governing a Great State**\nPreviously, it was shown how **non-action’s transformation** benefits the people and the heavens.\nNow, it clarifies how **applying the Dao to govern** brings blessings to both humans and spirits.\nVirtue permeates the hidden and the manifest—hence the chapter is structured in three distinctions:\nFirst, it uses the analogy of cooking to show that **action is unworkable**.\nSecond, it directly explains the principle to demonstrate that **humans and spirits alike receive blessings**.\nThird, it reveals how **virtue extends to the hidden and manifest**, uniting humans and spirits in kinship.\n\n**Two Sentences (First Section):**\nTo govern a great state is like **cooking a small fish**.\n*\"Cook\"* (烹) means *\"to boil.\"*\n*\"Fish\"* (腥) is sometimes read as *\"fresh\"* (鲜)—both refer to **small fish**.\nBoiling a small fish: if left alone, it remains whole; if prodded, it breaks apart.\nThis illustrates that **governing a state cannot rely on action**.\nIf the ruler practices **non-action**, the world is governed and the state preserved.\nIf the ruler acts, the world falls into chaos and the state perishes.\nThe fate of the world—**preservation or ruin**—is a grave matter.\nYet many fail to understand.\n\n「Cooking a small fish is a minor affair,\nyet it serves to illustrate a great principle.\n\nA state being so, how much more should one cultivating **virtue** dare to act with **hasu**!\n\n**Six sentences in three:**\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is applied to govern the world,\nits spirits do not become **shen**—*[**shen**: divine, supernatural, or awe-inspiring]*.\n**Govern** (*莅*) means **to rule over** (*临*).\nThose who rule the world with the **non-action** **Dao/Way**—\nnot only do humans cease their wickedness,\nand those who rebel are punished for offending above—\nbut also the spirits below do not become **shen**,\nand those who **feng** (*祟*) harm people are restrained.\nIt is not that the spirits lack **shen** and thus do not harm people,\nbut that the ruler above possesses **virtue/power** and **moral authority**,\nand the spirits below dare not act with reckless **jingshen** (*精邪*)—*[**jingshen**: malevolent spiritual forces]*.\nNor is it that the spirits lack **shen** and thus do not harm people,\nfor the **sage** does not harm people either.\nThis demonstrates that the **sage’s** merit is the true cause,\nnot that the spirits inherently lack **shen** and thus do not harm people.\nRather, it is because they are blessed by the **sage’s** transformation,\nand the spirits, moved by gratitude, act with propriety,\nnot daring to harm people.\n\n**Two sentences in three:**\n\nWhen both do not harm each other,\n**virtue/power** flows in mutual exchange.\nBoth refers to **humans and spirits**.\nHumans, when they do not **dig graves** (*掘冢*), **mutilate corpses** (*戮尸*), or **scold** (*诃骂*) the spirits,\nthis is humans not harming spirits.\nSpirits, when they do not bring **disasters** (*灾*), **ominous portents** (*怪*), **calamities** (*祸*), or **feng** (*祟*) upon humans,\nthis is spirits not harming humans.\nHumans, when they follow the **Dao/Way** in the world,\nand their kindness extends even to the **white bones** (*白骨*—the dead),\nand they perform sacrifices at the proper times,\nthen **virtue/power** flows from humans to spirits.\nSpirits, when they guard and bless humans with their **shen** and **ling** (*灵*—numinous, spiritual),\nthen **virtue/power** flows from spirits to humans.\nThus, there is no calamity between them,\nbut blessings are shared in mutual exchange.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four of the Great State:**\nThe previous section illustrated that when the **Dao/Way** rules over all,\nhumans and spirits alike receive blessings.\nThis section reveals how a great state practices **humility** (*谦*) and **harmony** (*华夷*—civilized and barbaric peoples),\nand all nations are drawn by its **virtue/power**.\n\nThe first distinction shows that **great humility** overcomes arrogance,\nthe second that both great and small nations practice humility,\nand the third that a great state must particularly guard against arrogance.\n\n**Four sentences in one:**\n\nA great state is the **lower stream** (*下流*—the receiving end),\nthe **gathering place** (*交*) of the world.\nWide lands and many people make it a great state.\nHumility and self-abasing make it the **lower stream**.\nSmall states, admiring its **virtue/power**, vie to come and assemble.\nThe **gathering place** of the world:\nthe **yin** (*牝*—receptive, yielding) always triumphs over the **yang** (*牡*—assertive, aggressive).\n\n**Yin** and **yang**—the yielding and the harmonious—\nare those who practice **humility**.\nThe **yang**—the forceful, violent, and aggressive—\nillustrates those who boast and compete.\nThe **yin**, when it is yielding and humble,\nthen the world’s nations come to assemble,\nand thus it is victorious.\nThe **yang**, when it is forceful, violent, and aggressive,\nthen people all rebel and scatter,\nand thus it is inferior.\n\n**Eight sentences in two:**\n\nThus, when a great state humbles itself to small states,\nit wins them over.\nA great state, when it humbles itself to small states,\nthen the small states come to join it.\nOne cultivating **virtue**—when the heart is humble and yielding—\nthen the people all come to revere and look up to them.\n**Wang Dai** (*王骀*—a legendary sage) gathered crowds,\nand this was his way.\n\nSmall states humbling themselves to great states,\nthen they are gathered by the great states.\nSmall states, knowing their own inferiority and weakness,\nuse humble words and bend their conduct,\nsubmitting to serve the great states,\nand thus they are able to assemble within the great states.\nThey seek **favorable winds** (*钦风*—auspicious influence) and **request guidance** (*请益*—ask for instruction),\njust as the **lower streams** (*小见*—minor tributaries) remove their narrow confines,\nadmiring the vast and distant,\nsending their own people inward\nand inquiring about those who follow the **Dao/Way** externally,\nnot boasting of their own strength but practicing **humility** and **self-effacement**,\npushing others forward—\nthis is the **lower stream** of such a person.\n\nThus, there are those who humble themselves and win,\nand those who humble themselves and gather.\n**Or** (*或*—sometimes) refers to the indeterminate.\nThough great and small differ,\nboth practice **humility**.\nThe great win over the small states,\nthe small are gathered by the great states.\nHumility is the same,\nbut winning and gathering differ,\nand thus it is said **or**.\n\nThe intent of the great state’s **humility**\ndoes not exceed the desire to **comprehensively nurture** (*兼畜*—to embrace and protect) all people.\nThe intent of the small states\ndoes not exceed the desire to **enter into service** (*入事*—to submit and be governed).\nThe **humility** of the great state is without excess,\nonly desiring to embrace and protect the people of small states.\nThe **humility** of the small states is also without excess,\nonly desiring to serve the great state.\n\n**Humility** is the **Dao/Way** for establishing oneself,\nhow could it be that one only practices **humility**\nafter desiring to **nurture and serve** others?\nNow, for both great and small to practice **humility**,\nthe **qi** of like minds resonates—\nthe small entering the great is like returning home,\nthe great embracing the small is like nurturing one’s own children.\nTheir emotions are fulfilled,\ntheir intentions harmonious,\nall stemming from **humility**—\nnearby people are united,\ndistant nations are aligned.\nThe **sage’s** teachings vary in depth,\nto lure people in and strengthen the resolute.\nEven the **forceful and aggressive** (*强梁*) are urged to speak,\nbut their intent is only to **nurture and serve** others.\n\n**Four sentences in three:**\n\nThus, both parties attain what they desire.\n\nThe two parties—great and small states—\nthe great desires to **nurture and serve** the small, now already attains it,\nthe small desires to **nurture and serve** the great, now again attains it.\nBoth fulfill their wishes, hence it is said each attains its desire.\nTherefore, the great ought to be the humble one.\nThe great and small practice **humility**,\nfrom ancient times, humility has been inherent.\nNow, it is emphasized again that the great ought to be humble,\nfor fear that **humility** may not endure long,\nand lest the great should **overwhelm** the small.\nThus, a separate precept is given to the great,\nto ensure they begin and end well.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five of the *Dao* (Way):**\nThe great **Dao/Way** returns all under Heaven to **revere** the **Virtuous One** (*大人*),\nthis reveals the **Way**’s supreme **virtue/power** (*至道*)—formless yet embracing life’s shared treasure.\nThe **Way** of **virtue/power** (*从德之道*) is explained in four distinctions:\nFirst, the profound and mysterious essence of the **Dao/Way** is treasured only by the worthy.\nSecond, the unworthy—foolish and dim—hold it lightly and do not cherish it.\nThird, the **sage’s** heart is equally balanced, universally saving without neglect.\nFourth, seeking it is easy, and those with faults are all absolved.\n\n**Three sentences in one:**\nThe **Dao/Way** is the profound essence of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous.\n\nThe essence (*奥*) is a deep chamber.\nThe **Dao/Way**’s profound mystery,\nlike the depths of a chamber,\nis immeasurable.\n\nThose who follow the **Dao/Way** yet do not know it,\nthose who bear the **Dao/Way** within yet do not recognize it,\nare truly foolish.\nThe **Dao/Way**’s essence, unperceived and uncherished,\nis only treasured by the wise and refined—\nthe truly virtuous alone can prize and love it.\n\n**Four sentences in two:**\nThe unworthy do not treasure it.\nThe unworthy are the lesser folk.\nTheir actions are crooked and evil,\nthus they are called unworthy.\n\nTheir hearts lack clarity and wisdom,\nso they do not treasure it.\n\nSweet words can buy gain,\nnoble conduct can elevate others.\nThe petty seek profit through flattery,\npleasing those before them with smooth speech,\nlike merchants haggling for cheap bargains.\n\nThe noble vie for reputation through virtue,\ntheir conduct lofty, their intent to uplift others,\nto win hearts with noble deeds,\nto surpass others in virtue.\n\nThese are not the virtuous,\nbut those without the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**Seven sentences in three:**\nHow could one abandon the unworthy?\nThe unworthy are not joyful in nature.\nTheir minds are clouded and unaware,\nso they should not be cast aside.\nTeaching through expedient means,\nthey may yet have hope.\n\nThus, the **Son of Heaven** (*天子*) is established,\nand the Three Exalted Ministers (*三公*) are appointed—\nthe ministers of **teaching** (*师*), **nurturing** (*傅*), and **protection** (*保*).\nSince they are not abandoned,\nthere must be methods to guide them.\nWith expedient governance and restraint,\nhe offers lavish rewards to encourage virtue,\nand severe punishments to halt evil—\nthis is the **Son of Heaven**’s way of not abandoning them.\n\nEven with **jewel-embracing** (*拱璧*) and **four-horsed chariots** (*先驷马*),\nit is not as good as sitting in **forgetting** (*坐进*) this **Dao/Way**.\nThis **Dao/Way** is the profound essence of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous.\n\n**Jewel-embracing** (*拱璧*)—as when two hands join to hold a **jewel**—\n**Four-horsed chariots** (*驷马*)—the steeds that lead a **Son of Heaven**’s carriage.\nAt rest, the **jewel** fills one’s sight,\nin motion, the chariots precede.\nTruly the height of wealth and honor,\nyet still not as good as **non-action** (*无为*) and **forgetting** (*坐忘*), advancing in wondrous **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhy so?\nThe splendor of **jewel** and **chariot** is not free from care,\nbut through **forgetting** and **advancing in the Dao**,\none attains the **Divine** (*神*) and the **True** (*真*).\nBy this measure,\nthe latter is far superior.\n\nThis exhorts the **Son of Heaven** and the Three Exalted Ministers\nto advance in the **supreme Dao/Way**,\nto transform the unworthy into abandoning evil,\nand now to transform the rulers into abandoning virtue.\n\n**Four sentences in four:**\nWhat makes the ancient **Dao/Way** so honored?\nIs it not that seeking it brings attainment,\nand faults are pardoned?\n\nThus, it is prized by all under Heaven.\nThis reveals the benefits of cultivating the **Dao/Way**,\nnot that one must seek to gain it—\nno need for laborious body or mind,\ndaily searching afar to call it attainment.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** comes naturally through **non-action** and **forgetting**,\nthus it is called attainment.\nThe *Sutra of Western Ascension* (*西升经*) says:\n*\"If a person can be empty and do nothing,\nthe **Dao/Way** will naturally return to them.*\nFaults are the retribution of past evil,\nbut through **forgetting** (*坐忘*), they are naturally extinguished.\nIt is not said one must seek to gain clarity—\nattainment is effortless.\nTo absolve faults and extinguish evil is not difficult,\nwith such divine efficacy,\nthe ancient **sages** and **worthy kings** all held it in highest esteem.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six of the *Dao* (Way):**\nThis reveals that the profound essence of the **Dao/Way** is attained without effort,\nnow it is explained that **non-action** alone can cultivate it.\n\nIt must be elaborated on how attainment comes,\nthus three distinctions are given:\nFirst, **non-action**’s practice can **repay enmity with virtue** (*以德报冤*).\nSecond, **non-action**’s heart is hard to stir—great deeds do not arise.\nThird, the **sage** transcends all signs and portents—no calamities are born.\n\n**Five sentences in one:**\n**Non-action** (*无为*) is **non-action** (*为无*).\n**Non-action**’s flavor (*味无味*) is **non-action** (*无味*).\n\n**Action** and **flavor** are the common pursuits of people.\n**Non-action**, **non-action**’s practice, and **non-action**’s flavor—\nthese are the **Dao/Way**’s work.\n\nThose advancing in **virtue/power** (*进德*) regard these three as their true calling,\nthus they attain the **Dao/Way**.\nAll who stray from the **Dao/Way** and incur faults\ndo so because of **action**, **pursuits**, and **flavor**.\n\nNow, to avoid faults and attain the **Dao/Way**,\none must abandon **action** and embrace **non-action**—\nthis is the **Dao/Way**’s heart.\n\nTo cease all scheming and contriving,\nto take **non-action** as one’s practice—\nthis is the **Dao/Way**’s body.\n\nTo reject richness and delicacy,\nto cut off all **flavor**,\nto partake in the **Dao/Way**’s mystery—\nthis is the **Dao/Way**’s mouth.\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s body and mouth\nare the roots of **action** and **flavor**,\nbut its foundation is the heart.\nIf the heart attains **emptiness** and **forgetting**,\nall burdens are cast off—\nwhy single out **action** and **flavor**?\n\nGreat or small, many or few,\n**repay enmity with virtue** (*报怨以德*).\nThe great and small refer to the **Dao/Way**’s **action** and **flavor**.\nThe many and few refer to the **Dao/Way**’s quantity.\nTo encroach on reputation and profit is small,\nto slay or harm others is great.\n**Enmity** (*怨*) is resentment and grudge.\nEven if one’s **action** is small yet can become great,\nif few can accumulate into many,\none small act turning great is still hard to undo—\nhow much more so if few accumulate into many?\n\nOnly through **non-action** can past faults be daily erased,\nand new deeds permanently severed,\nthus through **virtue** one **repays enmity** with the old,\nand all resentment is fully extinguished.\nHence it is said: **\"Repay enmity with virtue.\"**\n\n**Eight sentences in two:**\nTo plot against the difficult through the easy,\nto act great through the small.\nThe difficult is the retribution of faults,\nthe easy is the small cause.\n\nThe person of **non-action** and **non-doing** has already severed all causes—\nno faults arise from nothing.\nAs for those who act and do things,\ntheir initial causes are still small—\nthey should be immediately severed and extinguished,\nfor effort is slight and easy to complete.\nIf not cut off early, they grow into great matters,\ntheir deeds becoming heavy and difficult to undo.\n\nAll great difficulties in the world begin in the easy,\nall great matters arise from the small.\n*\"Action\"* means *\"to initiate.\"*\nWhen it says *\"the world,\"*\nit means all difficult and great matters\noriginate from easy and small beginnings.\nSince their forms and kinds are numerous,\nthey cannot be exhaustively listed—\nthus, *\"the world\"* encompasses them all.\n\nHe who makes light of promises will lack trustworthiness,\nhe who multiplies ease will invite difficulty.\n*\"He\"* is a general term.\n*\"Promise\"* means *\"to agree.\"*\nThose who lightly agree with others\nmake their words easy to speak.\nBut without corresponding action,\nthey inevitably break their word—\nthus, they lack trustworthiness.\nWhen they break their word,\nothers take offense,\nand resentment and anger arise—\nhence, they invite difficulty.\n\nEarlier, I spoke of matters and things;\nnow, I turn to human tendencies—\nall speak of ease leading to difficulty,\nurging early severance while causes are still small.\n\n**Eight sentences in three:**\nThus, even the **Sage** finds it difficult,\nand so never encounters difficulty.\nThe **Sage** knows that light promises\noften lack sincerity,\nself-inviting future calamities,\nnever extinguishing prior causes—\ntherefore, the **Sage** exercises caution even in difficulty,\navoiding suffering from misfortune and easy causes.\nThe **Sage** does not act lightly,\nwhile common folk are shallow and careless—\nhow much less should they be warned?\nThese are words urging the common through the **Sage’s** example,\nnot implying the **Sage** fears thus.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Stability**\n\nEarlier, it was shown that accumulated habits of **non-action** extinguish resentment and calamity.\nNow, it is made clear that if the mind is undisturbed,\nno misfortune will arise.\nBefore and after, the same principle connects—\nfour distinctions arise:\nFirst, the mind at rest, desires unarisen;\nSecond, small causes unchecked accumulate into ruin;\nThird, the **Sage’s** lack of failure stems from adhering to **non-action**;\nFourth, learning to sever and aid innate nature.\n\n**Six sentences in one:**\n\nIts stability is easy to maintain,\nits unmanifested state easy to plan.\n*\"Maintain\"* means to preserve what is established;\n*\"plan\"* means to be cautious with what is new.\nWhen at rest, the mind is still and empty,\nnot yet disturbed—\nmaintaining it is effortless.\nNext, when the mind is barely stirred,\nnot yet attached to anything,\nthe mind and matters are not yet entangled—\nat this stage, severance is effortless and requires little force.\nHow could it not be easy?\n\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nits subtlety easy to disperse.\n*\"Subtle\"* refers to what arises from non-being,\nalready manifesting in form and appearance,\nlight and insubstantial—\neasy to dissipate.\nIf not severed now, it gradually coalesces.\nThough it has form, its substance is still weak—\nto break it is not difficult.\n\nThese four sentences discuss the mind’s shift\nfrom non-being to manifestation,\nfrom subtlety to attachment—\nall urging early intervention,\nfor matters are easy when small.\nIf not severed early,\nthey grow, expanding beyond control.\n\nWhy does subtlety precede attachment?\nBecause subtle *qi* is light and insubstantial,\nnearly indistinguishable from non-being,\nits form fragile like smoke or dust—\nthus, its early stage is known.\n\nIts fragility, though not yet firm,\nhas already begun to decay—\nthis is what is meant by *\"easy.\"*\nThough its segments remain,\ntime has passed, and attachment has taken root.\nBy this reasoning, subtlety is known to precede.\n\nEarlier, it spoke of stability and the unmanifested;\nlater, of the unarisen and the undisturbed—\nthese four sentences reverse the order:\nfirst coarse, then subtle.\nYet in structure, *\"subtle\"* follows *\"fragile\"*—\nperhaps the recorder of the *Classic* erred.\nIf this were the **Sage’s** original intent,\nI am too dull to discern.\n\n*\"To act before it arises,\"*\n*\"to regulate before it is disturbed.\"*\n*\"Before it arises\"* means when the mind is undisturbed.\n*\"Before it is disturbed\"* means when the mind is untainted.\n\nThese two sentences recapitulate *\"stability\"* and *\"the unmanifested,\"*\nleading into what follows.\nIf one can regulate while at rest,\nno disturbance will arise.\nIf one can extinguish when it first appears,\nit will not reach subtlety or fragility.\nIf subtlety and fragility are broken early,\nthey will not grow to the thickness of a man’s embrace.\nSmall faults accumulate into great ones—\ncalamity originates from the minute.\nAll causes of disaster are laid out in order,\nto be systematically severed and dispelled.\nIf one does not trust and guards desire,\nhow should one proceed?\n\n**Eight sentences in two:**\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace\ngrows from a tiny sprout.\n*\"Embrace\"* speaks of greatness;\n*\"sprout\"* speaks of smallness.\nToday’s greatness comes from yesterday’s smallness—\nif the small is not severed,\nit gradually becomes today’s greatness.\nWhen great, even a gust of wind obscures the sun—\nits removal is finally impossible.\nThis illustrates how initial thoughts, though slight as a sprout,\nif nurtured, grow vast and deep,\nshading the true nature like a courtyard tree.\n\nA nine-layered tower\nbegins with a single basket of earth.\n*\"Layer\"* means *\"stacked.\"*\nA nine-tiered tower starts with one basket of soil,\naccumulated without pause,\nuntil nine layers rise.\nThis shows how present-life sins\nbecome towering and vast.\n\nA height of a hundred *rèn*\nbegins at one’s feet.\nSeven *chi* make a *rèn*;\nascending a mountain begins with lifting one foot,\nstep by step, until a hundred *rèn* is reached.\nThis illustrates that from now onward,\nif evil is not halted,\neach step compounds the height—\nlike piling earth from the ground up.\n\nNine layers, a hundred *rèn*—\nthis is perilous height.\nFrom small beginnings, it ascends to ruin.\nSome texts say *\"a thousand-*li* journey,\"*\nbut *\"hundred *rèn*\"* and *\"thousand-*li*\"* share similar meaning.\nYet ancient texts paired *\"nine layers\"* with *\"hundred\"*—\nboth rising from below—\nso *\"thousand-*li*\"* was likely a later alteration.\nNow, *\"hundred *rèn*\"* is retained as definitive.\n\n*\"To act\"* leads to ruin,\n*\"to grasp\"* leads to loss.\n*\"To act\"* means to pursue and chase;\n*\"to grasp\"* means to cling without release.\nPursuing without cease brings ruin to self and affairs.\nClinging without release brings loss of life and wealth.\nIf subtlety and fragility are not severed,\nruin and loss are inevitable.\n\n「The seven lower sentences are three in number.\nThus, the Sage has no *forcing* hence no *ruin*,\nno *grasping* hence no *loss*.\nThe Sage’s *ruin* and *loss* come from the commoner’s *forcing* and *grasping*;\nto prevent people from *ruin* and *loss*,\nthe Sage himself speaks of *non-forcing* and *non-grasping*.\n\nThose who meet with *ruin* must do so at *completion*.\nBut if there is no *forcing*, there is no *completion*.\nWithout *completion*, where is *ruin* to come from?\nThose who suffer *loss* must do so through *acquisition*.\nIf I do not *grasp* or *take*, then there is no *acquisition*.\nWithout *acquisition*, where is *loss* to come from?\nThis is why, when the subtle and fragile are not early severed,\n*ruin* and *loss* are inevitable.\n\nThe Sage’s words of *non-forcing* and *non-grasping*\ncan safeguard the original mind—\nno *ruin*, no *loss*,\nclearly avoiding all subsequent calamities.\n\nPeople’s undertakings\noften falter just as they near *completion*.\n*Few* (几) means *near* (近).\n*From* (从) means *to act* (行).\nPeople’s actions, whether in Dao or worldly matters,\nhave many beginnings but few who can finish.\nWhen their undertakings are near *completion*,\nthey are already self-destructing.\n*Forcing* affairs never lasts long,\nwhile *non-forcing* can endure to the end.\nTo lack an end is to meet with *ruin*—\nthis is the constant principle of Heaven.\nIf one treats the end as the beginning,\nthen there will be no *ruin* in affairs.\nThe nature of the mediocre person\nis to begin but not to finish.\nAt first, they may have resolve,\nbut soon they falter and decline.\nIf one can persist in the initial resolve,\nseeing the *ruin* of unfinished ends\nand heeding the warning at the end,\nthen the Dao can truly be attained—\nhow much more so for worldly matters!\n\nThe four lower sentences are four in number.\nThus, the Sage desires what the desiring despise,\nand does not value hard-to-obtain wealth.\nHard-to-obtain wealth is prized by the greedy,\nbut despised by those without desire.\nTherefore, commoners, when they desire,\nvalue what is hard to obtain and greedily cling to it,\nleading to *ruin* and *loss*.\nThe Sage, when acting, desires what the desiring despise\nand leaves hard-to-obtain things behind—\nthus, no *ruin* or *loss* occurs.\n\nYet in the Sage,\nthere is no duality of desire or non-desire—\nonly the desiring are deceived into thinking\nthe Sage desires what the non-desiring despise,\nso that all desiring may emulate his non-desire\nand avoid *ruin* and *loss*.\n\nTo study or not to study,\nprevents the errors of the multitude.\n*Prevent* (备) means *to guard against* (防).\nThe multitude’s errors are not confined to one path.\nBriefly, this speaks to their essential flaw.\n\nThe root of greed lies in the desire to learn what one desires,\nyet non-desire is used to guide the petty.\nThe scholar’s source of distinction arises from learning,\nyet non-learning is used to encourage the virtuous.\nTo uproot the root and block the source,\nthen people will have no contention or theft,\nno action or strife—\nthe world will unite in virtue,\nand wealth will be held cheap while learning is abandoned—\nits benefit lies here.\n\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things\nwithout daring to act.\nNaturalness is the innate essence of things.\nWhen desire and learning harm this essence,\nremoving desire and learning restores it—\nthus, aiding the naturalness of all things.\nWhen speaking of \"all things,\" even the lifeless are included.\nHuman excess in desire harms oneself,\nand extends harm to the lifeless.\nWhen humans abandon desire and learning,\nthe essence of things remains whole.\nThus, encompassing all things.\n\nThose who speak thus intend to save all things,\ndaring not to act for their own gain.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight of the Ancient Text**\nPreviously, it was made clear that action and contrivance lead to self-ruin.\nNow, it is made clear that following the Dao,\nabandoning cleverness and eliminating harm,\nnothing arises.\n\nTeaching through stillness,\naligning with the Mysterious Virtue—\nthere are three distinctions:\nFirst, abandoning cleverness as if in foolishness,\nso that errors do not arise.\nSecond, using cleverness without measuring gain or loss.\nThird, knowing gain and loss reveals profound virtue.\n\nFive sentences make one meaning.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten people—\nthey sought to make them foolish.\n*For* (wei) means *to cultivate* (xiu).\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao well\ninternally cultivated virtue,\nconcealing their brilliance and hiding their radiance,\nappearing foolish.\nThey did not desire to reveal their clarity to others,\nlest the multitude revere cleverness and wisdom,\ndamaging others to benefit themselves.\nThose who cultivate the Dao make themselves foolish and obscure,\nbenefiting both self and others—\nthis is the path of entering the Dao.\nThus, it is said they excel.\n\nThieves and robbers are minor harms.\nThe clever disrupting the masses are major harms.\nEliminating major harms prevents minor ones from arising,\nso by making oneself foolish,\ncleverness’s harm is removed.\n\nThe difficulty in governing people lies in their excess cleverness.\nThe ruler uses cleverness, the subjects use deceit.\nDeceitful cunning is manifold,\nfalsehoods are not singular.\nThey seek honor and favor in advancement,\navoiding punishment in retreat.\nThe more refined the nets of law,\nthe more cunning the evaders.\nThe people’s difficulty in being restrained\ncomes from the ruler’s use of cleverness in governance.\n\nThus, governing with cleverness is the state’s ruin.\nNot governing with cleverness is the state’s virtue.\n\nCleverness has two forms:\nDao-cleverness and worldly cleverness.\nDao-cleverness is a mind aligned with the Dao’s path,\ntreating excess as the highest practice,\nand non-action as supreme achievement.\nWorldly cleverness lacks Dao-knowledge but has keen perception.\nThe unvirtuous harbor deceit to seek reward.\nThe crafty use cleverness to provoke punishment.\nAbove and below deceive and betray each other,\nmutually harming and benefiting.\nThe greatest ruin of the state stems from cleverness’s influence.\n\nThose who do not use cleverness\ngovern through non-action, measuring the pure and the simple,\ntaking without sullying integrity,\ngiving without demanding repayment—\nwhen the people reach this state,\nit is due to the ruler’s virtue.\n\nUnderstanding these two paths\nis the model.\nThe two paths refer to using cleverness and not using it.\nSpeaking of \"also\" (yì) refers to the preceding text,\nwhich spoke of governing through non-action,\nnow reiterating \"not using cleverness\" to govern.\nKnowing that using cleverness is the state’s ruin,\nand not using cleverness is the virtue of nurturing people—\nthis is the method for governing the state and cultivating oneself.\nAlways knowing this model\nis called Mysterious Virtue.\nBeginning to end, without change, is called constancy.\nKnowing not to use cleverness\ncan be the method for governing the state and cultivating oneself.\nConsistently practicing it without cessation\nis the supreme virtue of aligning with the Mysterious Dao.\n\nMysterious Virtue is profound and far-reaching,\ncontrary to the ways of things,\nonly then reaching the Great Harmony.\n\"Profound\" speaks to its depth,\n\"far-reaching\" to its breadth.\nIts virtue is thus called Mysterious.\nThe Dao permeates the hidden and the manifest,\nvirtue fills the universe—\nthis is called far-reaching.\nCommon people value cleverness,\nMysterious Virtue values foolishness.\nCommon people value accumulation,\nMysterious Virtue values dispersion.\nCommon people follow convention,\nMysterious Virtue follows the Dao—\nthus, it is called contrary.\nIts path always brings peace to the state and benefits the people—\nthus, it is called Great Harmony.\nThe *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue—Commentary and Meaning, Volume Five

People*\n\n*\"The people do not fear death,\nyet rulers impose executions and punishments.\nThe people suffer hunger,\nyet rulers levy heavy taxes.\nExcesses stem from the ruler—\nthus, the sage must be cautious in season.\nThe chapter presents three distinctions:\nFirst, it explains that burdensome levies and labor drain both wealth and virtue,\nNext, that indulgence in life shortens one’s days through self-neglect,\nAnd finally, that forgetting life brings longevity—\nthis surpasses the value placed on life itself.\"*\n\nSix sentences, one meaning.\n\n*\"The people’s hunger arises\nfrom the ruler’s excessive consumption and taxes.\nConsumption refers to lavish expenditures,\ntaxes refer to burdensome levies.\nWhen the common folk are destitute,\nwith none to provide them food,\nit is surely because the ruler’s spending is unrestrained,\ntaxes are excessive,\nexternal labor exhausts them,\nand internal reserves are depleted—\nthus, they hunger.\nThe first sentence reveals the emptiness of the state’s foundation,\nthe second shows the cause of its troubles,\nthe third leads to the conclusion,\nand the fourth seals the overarching principle.\"*\n\n*\"The people’s difficulty in governance stems\nfrom the ruler’s excessive actions—\nthus, they are difficult to govern.\nWhen moral teachings flow downward from above,\nthe people conform from below.\nIf food and wealth are insufficient, they turn to theft and strife;\nif desires and competition overflow, they indulge in deceit and fraud,\nand falsehoods proliferate—\nthus, they are difficult to govern.\nThe first sentence shows that the more one avoids [excess], the more secure the retreat,\nthe second that the more one restrains [the people], the more cunning the assault,\nand the third concludes the reasoning.\"*\n\nThree sentences below, two in meaning.\n\nThe people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life—\nthus, they scorn death.\nLong enduring hunger and cold, constantly fearing want,\nthey resort to means without the Dao.\nPublic punishments and private vengeance,\nindulging beyond measure, harming life and nature—\nthough people may despise death themselves,\nultimately, it is governance and teaching that drive them thus.\nHence, it is known that imparting instruction must not be coercive.\n\nTwo sentences below, three in meaning.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n*\"Wise\"* means *\"good.\"*\nThose who do not cling to life are those who forget life.\nExcessive greed for nourishment swiftly leads to death—\nonly those who forget life surpass those who cling to life.\nTo forget life while living is the greatest good—\nthus, they are called *\"wise.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine of Human Nature**\nPreviously, it was shown that resolving to live while forgetting life is superior;\nnow, it is shown that desiring life and avoiding death through gentleness is skillful.\nHaving already spoken of excessive nourishment and forgetting life,\nnow it speaks of firmness and entering death—\nboth share the same *qi*, hence the two distinctions follow.\nThe first uses analogy to explain firmness and entering death, gentleness and living,\nwhile the second concludes that the rigid do not surpass the gentle.\n\nFive sentences, one meaning.\n\nHuman life is gentle and weak,\nbut death is firm and strong.\nLife possesses harmonious *qi*, then sinews and bones are supple and yielding.\nWhen death comes, harmonious *qi* departs the body,\nand limbs become rigid and hard.\nBy contrasting death with life, it is shown that the gentle prevail,\nwhile the strong and bold are inferior.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nin life are gentle and fragile,\nbut in death, they wither and stiffen.\nSpeaking of *\"all things\"* encompasses both sentient and insentient.\nHumans and grasses alike, when *qi* is severed, their forms become firm and strong,\nwhile in life, their forms are entirely gentle and weak.\nThis is an illustrative analogy.\n\nSix sentences, two meanings.\n\nThus, the firm and strong are of death’s kind,\nwhile the gentle and weak are of life’s kind.\nThe nature of rigidity and harshness\ngoes wherever it will—\nsome are bold and domineering over others,\nsome forcibly seize what they desire,\ntheir will fixed on gain, fearless of danger.\nThough perilous, they press forward;\nthough strong, they still overreach—\nthese are called *\"walking corpses,\"*\nakin to the dead.\n\nThe gentle and weak, though death may not spare them,\nwalk as those who seek longevity do—\nthis is the proper teaching.\nThus, the strong in arms are not victorious,\nthe strong in wood are split.\nThese two examples serve as proof.\nThe strong in arms: when many attack, they are annihilated and do not prevail.\nThe strong in wood: when pressed by clay and tiles, they break.\nHence, the rigid and strong are beneath,\nwhile the gentle and weak are above.\nThe strong in arms: when many attack, they are subdued by strength,\nwhile the gentle and weak: when in peril, others aid them;\nwhen harmonious, others uphold them—\nthus, they are above.\n\n**Chapter Forty of Heaven’s Nature**\nPreviously, it was shown that discarding strength and embracing weakness is the way to life;\nnow, it is shown that suppressing the high and elevating the low\nto attain the middle path is essential.\nThe first is crude, the second refined—\nhence, the four distinctions follow:\nfirst, using analogy to show that the Dao seeks the balanced middle;\nsecond, that Heaven benefits through humility while humans benefit through excess and deficiency;\nthird, that only through methodical self-abnegation and benefiting others can one achieve it;\nfourth, that the sage’s wisdom forgets merit and conceals virtue.\n\nSix sentences, one meaning.\n\nHeaven’s Way is like drawing a bow:\nthe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s principles are profound and distant—\nno one can fathom them.\nThe analogy of the bow is given\nto make it comprehensible to all.\nYet the bow’s true purpose lies in its tuning.\nWhether tuned or not is only seen when drawn—\npulling, releasing, loosening—\nobserving whether it is tuned or not.\nWhen the grip is high, it lowers the bow;\nwhen the grip is low, it raises it.\nIf the upper strength is excessive, wood is removed;\nif the lower strength is insufficient, sinew is added.\nWhen the upper and lower strengths are balanced—\nequal in firmness and weakness—\nonly then does the bow serve its purpose.\nThe principles of governance must align thus.\nCultivating the Dao and attaining authenticity\nshould also follow this.\n\n*\"High\"* and *\"low\"* refer to *\"noble\"* and *\"base,\"*\n*\"excessive\"* and *\"deficient\"* refer to *\"wealthy\"* and *\"poor.\"*\nSome say that when the bow is slack,\nthe two ends curve outward, and the grip is convex and high.\nWhen drawn, the two ends curve inward, and the grip bulges outward.\nIf *\"high\"* and *\"low\"* are thus,\nit is like exceeding or falling short—\nwhy? When slack, the face is high;\nwhen drawn, the back is high—\nyet it is never truly level,\nnor is it enduring.\nThus, it does not accord with Heaven’s Way.\n\nSix sentences, two meanings.\n\nHeaven’s Way is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient.\nHuman conduct is otherwise:\nthey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\nNatural principle is empty and without possession—\nwhen there is excess, it is diminished;\nit seems as if it has sentiment,\nyet fate and necessity compel it—\nno one knows why.\nThe sage takes this as truth,\nusing it as a clear warning.\nIf a person can diminish their own excess\nto supplement others’ deficiencies,\nthey align with Heaven’s Way.\nIf they diminish others’ deficiencies\nto serve their own excess,\nthey follow human conduct.\nThe distance between these two paths—\none corrupt, one virtuous—\nis vast.\n\nThree sentences, three meanings.\n\nWho can have excess to bestow upon the world?\nOnly the Daoist.\nWho can diminish their own excess\nto supplement those in want?\nNone but the benevolent and virtuous.\nOnly the sagely and virtuous can achieve this.\n\nFour sentences, four meanings.\n\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\nachieves success without dwelling on it,\nand does not desire to be seen as virtuous.\n*\"Demonstrate\"* means *\"to be seen.\"*\n*\"Virtuous\"* means *\"able.\"*\nThe sage diminishes the excessive—\npreviously encouraging self-abnegation to aid others,\nfearing they might rely on their deeds,\nthus citing the sage’s model:\nthough they open the way and guide with virtue,\nthey do not claim merit.\nHigh-minded and accomplished individuals\ndespise the reputation of virtue\nfor two reasons:\nfirst, relying on virtue and boasting of ability\nis unworthy of the Dao;\nsecond, fame brings gain,\nfostering deceit and greed—\ntaking from those without benefit,\na sin Heaven punishes.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One of the World’s Nature**\nPreviously, it was shown that Heaven’s Way balances excess and deficiency;\nnow, it is shown that water’s gentle and weak nature\nattacks the strong from below.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two of the Great Harmony**\nPreviously, it was shown that the Way’s transformation and application lie in gentle and weak endurance of defamation to become a ruler—\nall these are in accordance with the Dao.\nTrue words are like their opposites.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three of the Small Realm**\nPreviously, it was shown that goodness aligns with the Dao and that people harbor no grudges.\nNow, it is shown that the ruler and ministers unite in harmony,\nwith no need for action above or below.\n\n*\"Gentle\"* is not *\"rigid,\"* and *\"virtuous\"* is secondary to three distinctions:\nfirst, gentle overcoming strength is effortless in application;\nsecond, principles and affairs are clear, yet people fail to act accordingly;\nthird, tolerating defamation brings blessings, yet the foolish do not believe.\n\n**Five Sentences, One Meaning:**\nAmong all things in the world, none are as gentle and weak as water.\nWithin all things, the most gentle and weak are none other than water.\nThis illustrates water’s essence,\nso that those who follow the Dao may take it as their model.\nYet in overcoming strength and rigidity,\nnothing can surpass it—\nits power is unchanging.\nStrength and rigidity are like mountains and stones.\nWater’s use: it erodes stone, topples mountains,\nwhile other things cannot compare.\nIn essence, it bears no burden;\nin application, it achieves great results.\nEssence and application both excel—\nin things, its power is unchanging;\nthis illustrates its application.\nIn humans, strength and rigidity are afflictions;\ngentle and weak are the Dao-heart.\nTo overcome afflictions,\nonly the Dao-heart can do so—\nno other thing can replace it.\n\n**Four Sentences, Two Meanings:**\nThus, gentle overcomes rigid,\nweak overcomes strong—\nyet none in the world can know or act upon this.\nRigid refers to afflictions,\nwhich are extinguished by the Dao-heart,\nso the heart prevails.\nHuman arrogance and obstinacy\nare subdued by gentle and weak conduct,\nso strength is inferior.\nAll this is verifiable by sight—\nyet those who cannot know are foolish.\nOr those who know but cannot act—\nthey lack faith in the Dao.\n\n**Six Sentences, Three Meanings:**\nHence, the sage says:\n*\"To bear a nation’s defamation,\nthis is called the sovereign of the land and grain.\"*\n*\"To bear a nation’s ill fortune,\nthis is called the ruler of all under Heaven.\"*\nThe Old Master cites ancient sage laws\nto exhort the present:\ndefamation refers to slanderous words and calumny,\nill fortune refers to unjust suffering—\nthen all directions have faults,\nwhile the blame rests solely on me.\nTo be gentle and weak below,\nwith a mind set on humility,\nyet able to endure defamation,\none attains the rank of a public duke,\nbecoming the sovereign of the land and grain.\nTo bear ill fortune,\none’s virtue is even greater—\nthus one becomes an emperor and sovereign ruler.\nAll under Heaven reveres the wind of virtue;\nthis is the flow of the sage’s Way.\nWith a heart as vast as a valley,\nnearby, one becomes a transformative sage for humans and Heaven;\nfarther, one becomes the true sovereign of the law.\n\nTrue words appear as their opposites.\nEarlier, it was said that gentle and weak overcoming strength,\nenduring defamation to become a ruler—\nall these are in accordance with the Dao.\nTrue words are sincere and not false,\nyet to the common masses they seem contrary to convention.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two of the Great Harmony**\nPreviously, it was shown that the Way’s transformation and application lie in gentle and weak endurance of defamation to become a ruler—\nall these are in accordance with the Dao.\nNow, it is shown that the ruler’s virtue lies in non-action,\nnot provoking grudges.\n\n**Three Sentences, One Meaning:**\nTo reconcile great grudges,\nthere must still be lingering grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\n*\"Reconcile\"* means *\"to pacify and settle.\"*\nGreat grudges are those where one has been killed or injured.\nWhen clothing and food are sufficient and rites and propriety are known,\npeople still harbor grudges—\nthis is truly insufficient.\nInsufficiency leads to theft, plunder, killing, and injury;\ngrudges follow in succession.\nWith resentment and shame unresolved,\none must seek revenge,\nswearing to kill to satisfy one’s heart.\nEven if one sweetly speaks and acts with good intentions,\ntemporarily achieving reconciliation,\nthe grudge remains unfulfilled,\nand the heart still harbors resentment.\nThough this grudge may subside,\nanother will arise.\nThe world is vast,\nand grudges and enmities are boundless.\nTo make those skilled in persuasion\ntravel from house to house,\nusing this method to reconcile grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\nIf one achieves great harmony under Heaven,\nthen there are no grudges to reconcile—\nthis is true goodness.\nYet only the enlightened ruler’s virtue\ncan bring this about.\nThose who cultivate themselves\nwish to sever the cycle of birth and death,\nfreeing themselves from past grudges and afflictions.\nThose newly tainted\nmust settle their minds in non-action,\nconduct their bodies in non-doing—\nthen they attain the root of grudges permanently severed,\nand no further grudges arise.\nUsing this to reconcile grudges,\none can truly be called good.\n\n**Five Sentences, Two Meanings:**\nThus, the sage holds the left token\nand does not blame others.\nThe token symbolizes *\"trust.\"*\nIn ancient times, before writing existed,\npeople carved wooden tokens for agreements.\nMale and female tokens fit together—\nthe left (male) token was held by the lord,\nthe right (female) token by the subject,\nused for governance and transformation.\nIf their laws are just,\nthen all under Heaven will be as one—\ntrusting each other,\nscales and measures will not be needed,\nand love and respect will be equal.\nThe strong will not oppress the weak,\nthe noble will not bully the humble—\nthen how can grudges arise?\nHence, the enlightened ruler above\nmust observe the customs of the people.\nIf there are disputes and conflicts,\ninvestigate their origins—\nif they stem from above,\nabolish the token decrees.\nIf the fault lies with oneself,\none does not blame others.\nThis is speaking of those who harbor great grudges.\nIf one cultivates oneself through practice,\nnourishing life with the Dao,\npreserving nature through non-action,\nand others hold grudges against me,\nI only blame myself—\nnot daring to blame Heaven, people, or gods and spirits.\nThus, the virtuous hold the token,\nwhile the unvirtuous lose it.\n*\"Lose\"* means *\"to fail.\"* The virtuous ruler,\nseeing others’ faults,\nonly reflects on himself—\n*\"My laws are not appropriate,\"*\nand does not punish or blame others.\nThe unvirtueful ruler\nonly knows to spy on others’ mistakes,\nunaware that others’ faults originate from himself—\nthus he punishes and blames others,\nwhile not blaming himself.\n\n**Two Sentences, Three Meanings:**\nThe Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nalways aligning with the virtuous.\n*\"Heaven\"* means *\"the natural order.\"*\n*\"No favorites\"* means *\"equality.\"*\nThe virtuous include all—\nrulers, subjects, and the common folk.\nIf one can take responsibility for their own faults,\nbe humble and detached in non-action,\nthen the natural order will align with them—\nthough they hold the left token,\ntheir agreements will be without grudges.\nBetter still is one who walks the great Dao—\nno tokens are needed, yet grudges do not arise.\nEven spirits and gods remain hidden;\nhow much more so among human relations?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three of the Small Realm**\nPreviously, it was shown that goodness aligns with the Dao,\nand that people harbor no grudges.\nNow, it is shown that the ruler and ministers unite,\nwith no need for action above or below.\n\n**Three Sentences, One Meaning:**\nRulers and ministers, if they follow the Dao,\nwill ensure safety for the people.\nPeople are content in their dwellings,\nknowing the joy of the Dao,\ncontent with sufficiency.\nRulers and ministers forget each other,\npracticing the Dao—\nno need for visits or exchanges.\n\n**Six Sentences, One Meaning:**\n\nThe Small Realm, few in its people,\ncommands them to possess tenfold or hundredfold implements yet not employ them.\nIts lands are narrow, hence called the Small Realm;\nIts commoners and scholars are few, hence called few in its people.\nThis is because one can walk the Dao—\nhouseholds are rich, the people content.\n*Tenfold* and *hundredfold* refer to the great numbers of household goods;\nall things are fully provided, yet simplicity saves effort—\nthus they are not used.\n*Moderation* is the Dao of the realm,\nand the people’s six senses—\nto speak of fewness and smallness is humility.\n\nWhen it speaks of *tenfold* and *hundredfold implements*,\nit means arts and crafts—\narts and crafts can be employed, hence called *implements*.\nTo say *not employed* is to say they are forgotten in emptiness.\n\nLet the people hold death as weighty,\nyet not flee to distant lands.\nWhen the ruler walks the Dao,\nthe people rejoice in life yet dread death—\ndeath is hard to bear, hence they do not lightly enter perilous ground.\nTheir bodies are self-sufficient,\nfree from laborious hoarding—\nthus they do not wander far or scheme for external gains.\nIf the heart-mind’s king walks the Dao,\nthe senses and consciousness are tranquil and harmonious,\nwith no cravings, no demands—\nevil is dispelled, burdens vanish,\nand even minor offenses in life are not lightly committed,\nhow much more so death?\nThough chariots and boats exist,\nthey find no use for them.\nThough armor and weapons are kept,\nthey find no need to display them.\n\n「Chariots and boats rank first among myriad implements.\nIn grand discourse, only the four matters are mentioned.\nBoats traverse the waters, carriages bear the land—\nwhen the Dao suffices for the body,\nand wealth suffices for the home,\nthere is no need for further seeking,\nso they are not employed.\n\n*Armour* refers to protective gear,\nto be worn on the body and head,\nto repel external foes.\n*Weapons* are spears and blades,\nheld in hand to strike and slash.\nYet the finest of weapons are called *armour*.\nIn cultivating the self, the ancient heart-mind was fierce and bold as weapons,\nbut now it is gentle and yielding, compliant and serene as water—\nseeking only to benefit others,\nnot desiring to harm.\nTheir outward forms may exist,\nbut their application is none,\nso though present, they are not displayed.\n\nLet the people return to the governance of knotted cords.\n*Return* means to revert to origins.\n*Knotted cords* symbolize the pure politics of antiquity.\nIn terms of time, the ancient was pure while the present is corrupt.\nIn terms of the heart, the Dao-heart is pure while the vulgar heart is corrupt.\nAt their inception, when the heart-mind’s desires first sprout,\nit shifts from purity to corruption.\nWhen the heart-mind discards greed and craving,\nit shifts from corruption back to purity.\nThus, the corruption or purity of time follows the heart-mind’s transformation,\nlike the Four Husbands’ pure simplicity—\nit depends solely on one’s own cultivation,\nnot on altering the world’s customs.\nIf one wishes to restore the world to purity,\nto match the age of antiquity,\nit must await a ruler who walks the Dao.\n\nThe next four sentences are the second category:\nLet their food be savoury,\ntheir clothing be fine,\ntheir dwellings be secure,\nand their customs be joyous.\nWith no cravings for worldly tastes,\nplain food is naturally sweet.\nWith only modest desires,\nrough garments are deemed splendid.\nWhen their abode is pleasing—\neven a thatched hut suffices for comfort—\nand they take delight in the Dao’s effortless Way,\nwhat need have they for changing customs?\n\nThe following four sentences are the third category:\nNeighbouring lands are visible,\nand the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard between them,\nyet the people do not visit one another until old age.\n*Neighbouring lands* are small nations close at hand,\nso that what the eye can see includes morning roosters and nighttime dogs,\nmaking it clear they are not distant.\nFrom childhood to old age,\nspanning long years,\nthey do not come and go—\nbecause each suffices in their own right.\nWhen the Dao suffices, there is no need for consultation,\nwhen wealth suffices, there is no need for borrowing or lending,\nand mutual sufficiency leads to forgetting one another,\nso they do not visit.\n\nThe next six sentences are the fourth category:\n*True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.*\n*True words* refer to the teachings of the Dao.\nThe *Scriptures*’ teachings should be spoken directly,\nplain in language yet profound in meaning,\nwithout embellishment or allure,\nwithout concealment or distortion—\neasy to know, easy to practice.\nThis is the *direct Scripture*.\nCrafty, ornate speech,\nadorned with flowery words,\nhollowly proclaiming blessings and calamities,\nto seduce the greedy and mislead the foolish—\nthough it may appeal to the shallow,\nit further confuses the profound.\nSuch is superficial without substance,\nnot the true *Scripture*.\nWith these two distinctions—*true* and *ornate*—\nall teachings of the Dao can be judged for authenticity or falsity.\n\n*Good persons do not argue; arguers are not good.*\nKnowledge of words lies in the heart,\ngoodness of words lies in practice—\nwhen the heart knows and the body acts,\nthere is no need to argue for oneself.\nThe true good person rejects what others deem wrong.\nIf one argues only for oneself,\ncondemning others while flattering the crowd,\nusing eloquence to bend others,\nand many words to subdue things—\nthis is not the good person.\nThese six sentences universally discuss the merits and faults of scholars,\nthe authenticity or falsity of teachings,\nand seek the most refined—\nthe tortoise-shell mirror lies here.\nFortunate are those who meet with like-minded hearts,\nto leave behind a clear reflection for future generations.\n\n*The wise are not versed in many things; versed ones are not wise.*\nThose who truly grasp the Dao\nknow the Dao is not conveyed through words,\nso they do not rely on excessive speech.\nTo amass knowledge and claim wisdom\nis to drown in superficiality,\nto further bewilder the heart-mind—\nthus, they are said to be *unwise*.\nThis is *wisdom*, so they are not *versed*.\nTo be *versed*, they are *unwise*.\nThe Sage does not hoard.\n*Hoard* means to store and accumulate.\nThere are two meanings of *hoard*:\none is to accumulate virtue,\nthe other is not to accumulate.\n\nTo cultivate virtue and establish merit,\nlayer upon layer, as in *repeatedly accumulating virtue*.\nNot to accumulate means to bestow virtue upon the foolish,\nto give wealth to the poor—\nwhen the opportunity arises, to teach without hesitation,\nto spare nothing of oneself.\nTo accumulate speech in self-cultivation,\nbut not to accumulate speech for others’ benefit.\nHaving served the people,\none’s own virtue grows ever more abundant.\n*Having* means to exhaust,\n*serve* means to teach and guide,\n*abundant* means to increase.\nThe Sage’s virtue is boundless,\nwithout stinginess or reluctance—\nexhausted in teaching others,\nguiding them through practice,\nand benefiting them according to their capacity.\nThe recipients grow enriched,\nand the Sage’s virtue renews itself daily—\nthus it is said to *increase*.\nHaving given to the people,\none’s own virtue becomes even greater.\nWealth is given to the poor,\nand one’s own abundance grows richer—\nthe Dao has no outward form,\nso subtle and profound it can only be grasped by the heart-mind’s silent communion,\nnot by physical holding or seizing—\nthus it is called *serve*.\nWealth is tangible and measurable,\nso it is called *give*.\n\nThe Way of Heaven,\nbenefits yet does not harm.\nThe *Way of Heaven* is the Way of Nature.\nIn speaking of its essence,\nit is empty, yet all-pervading—\ndivine and elusive.\nIn speaking of its function,\nit gives rise to all things,\nand brings all things to fruition.»\n\nThis is the Way of universal benefit,\nyet never causing loss.\nThe Sage’s Dao is to act without striving.\nThe Sage’s teaching is in subtle words,\nseeking only to preserve the empty self—\nacting yet not claiming credit,\nalways attributing merit to others.\nIf one does not take, how can one contend?\nIf one benefits, how can one compete?\nMerit and benefit without contention—\nthe ultimate of self-forgetting,\nthe marvelous harmony with the Dao,\nthe peak of virtue.\n\nThe heart and mouth are the tools of contention.\nThe Dao of Heaven and the Sage’s virtue\nare indistinct and profound in unity.\nAll things arise and reach fulfillment\nthrough the interplay of Heaven and Sagehood—\nwithout Heaven, nothing is born;\nwithout the Sage, nothing is perfected.\nHence, the Dao of Heaven speaks without harm,\nwhile the Sage’s words avoid contention.\nYet though their names differ,\ntheir essence is one:\nHeaven’s speech causes no harm,\nthe Sage’s words provoke no strife.\nIf spoken of as indistinct unity,\nthen Heaven’s Dao has no contention,\nand the Sage’s Way causes no harm—\nyet they are distinguished by their teachings,\nthus bearing two names.\n\nTo abandon teachings and return to principle,\nto rest in the silent unity of Heaven and Sagehood—\nthe root of Heaven and Sagehood is already \"none.\"\nThe progression of contention and harm\nhas no difference at all.\nA single wondrous *Sutra*,\nits meaning concludes here.\nThose who establish and then discard\ndo so to forget words and grasp the Dao.\n\nThus, this chapter encapsulates the five thousand profound truths,\nand if its intent is understood,\nwhat words remain unclear?\n\nThe Dao pervades all existence—\nyet if one seeks it within existence,\none will never find it.\nBeyond existence, it is nonexistent.\nIf one seeks it apart from existence,\nthere is no method to attain it.\nThe faithful know that the Dao is without absence,\nyet wherever it is present, it is without form.\nTo truly seek the Dao,\none must disregard all distinctions of place and direction.\n\nMany household interpretations explain it through worldly affairs,\nattaching words to the body—\nthis is the meaning of \"node\" (节).\nAlchemical refinement of the highest medicines—\nthe origin of the *Dan Jing*.\nDistant talk of emptiness—\nthe style of Wang Bi.\nIllustrating principle through affairs—\nthe manner of Sun Login.\nPreserving all phenomena—\nthe tradition of Yin-Yang.\nPeaceful dwelling yet abandoning restraint—\nthe metaphor of Han Fei.\nDrowning the mind to extinguish form—\nthe expansive method of Yan Zun.\nAdding words to gain enlightenment—\nthe core of Confucian learning.\n\nThe vulgar cling to existence,\nfailing to grasp the Dao’s absolute wisdom;\nThe monks adhere to emptiness,\nderiding Li Ji’s teachings as mere household matters.\nThis is because Confucius lacked the pursuit of true essence,\nand the Buddha had no skill in elucidating the Dao—\nboth merely exhausted their vitality to earn later fame,\nand drained their precious resources to seek transient fortune.\n\nThus, they sit in three corners and insist on their own correctness,\nor monopolize a single tune and speak in riddles,\nprolonging their confusion of the Great Dao,\nuntil death they remain perplexed—\nall are caught in contention over principle,\ndigging into corners to debate emptiness,\nsplitting the profound and true,\nand their minds lean ever so slightly from the Dao.\n\nThis *Sutra*’s vast source is deep and broad,\nits applications ranging from refined to coarse—\nlike a great bird soaring to the heavens,\nseen from afar as a swallow, up close as a crane,\nnortherners behold it as southern,\nsoutherners perceive it as northern.\nSince minds differ,\ntheir interpretations vary.\nNow, we strive to transcend material adornments,\nto focus on our own true essence.\nThe Dao is obtained through the body,\nyet to attain it, one must demolish form and sit in forgetfulness,\npursuing it with constancy,\ngradually feeling its profound benefits.\n\nThus, we know that the medicine which does not cause calloused hands\nis but a floating wisp of cotton,\na mere shred of earthly deception—\nhow strange and false!\n\n*The True Classic of Dao and Virtue*—\nExhaustive Exegesis, Volume Six concludes.",

Having attained it themselves, they also enable others to attain it. What is obtained is the Dao, hence it is called *supreme virtue*.\n\n*\"Not acting in virtue\"* refers to *supreme virtue*.\nWhen virtue harmonizes with the Dao, benefiting all things profoundly and extensively, its deeds are accomplished yet remain hidden. Virtue does not flaunt itself—common people use it daily without knowing, and countless generations rely on it without recognizing it. This is the meaning of *having virtue*—unmatched and exalted, hence called *supreme*.\n\n*\"The inferior virtue does not lose virtue, yet it has no virtue.\"*\nWhen the mind and its objects are both forgotten, and self and other merge seamlessly, harmonizing with the mysterious Dao, this is called virtue.\nYet now, arrogance and attachment persist, and the seals of constraint remain. Though virtue is present, self-perception lingers, and true forgetting has not yet been achieved—hence it is called *inferior*.\n\n**Eleven Sentences (Second Section)**\n\n*\"The supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\n*\"Yì\"* means \"to use.\" *Without action* refers to the inner mind being empty and tranquil, free from contrived doing.\n*\"Nothing is left undone\"* means external things are pure and unadorned—all conventional affairs are abandoned without interference.\nThis is the obscurity of supreme virtue.\n\n*\"The inferior virtue acts, yet there is much left undone.\"*\nUnable to dispel noble attachments, it engages in contrived deeds and worldly achievements—hence *\"acts.\"*\nSeeking honor and profit to enrich one’s family, or fame and posthumous titles to exalt oneself—hence *\"much is left undone.\"*\n\n*\"The superior benevolence acts, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\nBenevolence (*rén*) is the advancement of kindness.\nRelieving others’ deficiencies by sacrificing oneself, or pardoning others’ faults through private favor—this is *\"acting.\"*\nYet completing what is beneficial without claiming credit, giving aid without expecting repayment—this is *\"nothing is left undone.\"*\nThose who receive such benevolence are numerous, and those transformed by it flow like water, swept away by the wind. Benevolence’s path is most excellent, hence it is called *superior*.\n\n*\"The superior righteousness acts, yet there is much left undone.\"*\nRighteousness (*yì*) means \"what is proper.\"",

      "translated_text": "When people lack their proper distinctions, and things lose their natural order, yet in times of purity and integrity, there are upright and incorruptible men who tolerate no private deceit. They clearly distinguish right from wrong, carefully judge truth from falsehood, ensuring all receive their due distinctions and nothing loses its proper place—this is the work of the righteous scholar.\n\nTo seek near-term honor and profit, or distant fame and posthumous titles—this is *\"much is left undone.\"*\n\nThe superior ritual acts, yet none respond to it, so one raises one’s arm and leads by example.\n\nRitual (*lǐ*) is the proper conduct of one’s bearing.\nBowing and rising, advancing and retreating—when these movements conform to measure, this is ritual.\n*\"Shoaling\"* means to raise one’s arm.\n*\"Leading\"* means to draw others along.\nWhen all proper decorum is complete, this is called *superior*.\n\nNow, ritual is the law governing form. As pure customs degenerate into corruption, human nature grows treacherous and thin, hearts no longer in harmony, and forms become arrogant. Thus, external regulations are established to govern posture and demeanor, so that the heart may gradually soften in step with the body, and the inner self align with the outer.\n\nYet there are those whose inner and outer selves contradict—where the form complies but the heart rebels, where deceit lurks within while the exterior conforms to ritual. Hence, anger arises, arms are raised, and contention ensues—this is the beginning of ritual’s failure, the origin of disorder.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows.\nThe Dao is the highest virtue.\n*\"Later virtue\"* refers to lower virtue.\nThe highest virtue aligns with the Dao, hence it is called *Dao*.\nInitially, it was paired with the Dao, hence called *virtue*.\nNow, paired with later virtue, it is again called *Dao*.\n\nSince people cannot practice the Dao of supreme, effortless virtue—where all is forgotten—yet cling to the lower virtue of deliberate action.\nThe lower virtue is when all actions are complete, yet nothing is forgotten.\nBenevolence is but one aspect of virtue—kindness and forgiveness.\nSince people cannot embody all virtues, this one alone is emphasized.\nWithin benevolence, the highest is called *superior*.\nBenevolence wins through kindness, while righteousness prevails through severity.\nRighteousness subdues through punishment, benevolence through grace.\nThus, benevolence surpasses righteousness.\n\nRighteousness is like wielding punishment to suppress the heart, while ritual merely regulates form to conform to propriety. Hence, though the exterior may appear refined, the interior remains rigid and unyielding—this is the outward gentleman and inward petty man, hence the raising of arms and contention.\n\nRitual is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, yet it is the first seed of disorder.\nLoyalty means a single, sincere heart; trust means unhesitating obedience.\nFrom purity to corruption, ritual becomes the lowest extreme. As loyalty and trust fade, empty formalities remain, and the body betrays the heart—thus, it becomes the origin of chaos.\n\nMoreover, the Dao is boundless, valuing only sincerity and unity. Thus, it embraces the clumsy and the refined alike, yet rejects the artificial and constrained.\nRitual, though structured by rules, emphasizes propriety in every movement—advancing, retreating, bowing, rising—thus attaining its highest form.\nHere, the Dao values the heart, while ritual governs the form. To regulate the heart is to enter the Dao; to regulate the form is to conform to convention. If the heart lacks the Dao yet follows convention, how could disorder not arise?\n\n*\"Preconception\"* is the flower of the Dao, yet the beginning of folly.\nPreconception has two forms:\nOne, where the heart truly does not know, yet the mouth speaks as if it does—where recognition precedes knowledge, hence *\"preconception.\"*\nTwo, where the mind is enslaved to premature judgments, competing to recognize first. The wise first know with the heart, then speak with the mouth; yet here, the mouth speaks before the heart knows. Thus, recognition precedes knowledge—this is the superficial bloom of the Dao.\n\nWhen pure customs decay and competitive greed takes root, this becomes the initial loss of the Dao, the start of vulgar folly.\n\nThus, the true man abides in substance, not in superficiality.\n*\"Zhang\"* means long; *\"fu\"* means to uphold.\nHe who possesses great virtue and nurtures all beings, sustaining the people—this is the true man.\nIn his conduct, he dwells in substance, not in corruption.\nHe is devoted solely to the Dao, knowing nothing of ritual’s artifices.\nSubstance and superficiality are one in origin, yet differ in preference—whether valued for their genuine or false qualities.\nThus, the false and superficial pale beside the true and substantial.\nTo reside in truth, not in illusion.\nThe true man is one who follows the Dao.\nGuarding the heart in sincerity, rejecting deceit, he inspires others to do the same.\nThus, he discards the false and embraces the true.\nTo establish oneself in action, discarding the superficial and embracing the substantial.\nFor the substantial is near the Dao, while the superficial is distant.\n\n---\n**Former Chapter Two**\nAt the beginning of this great section, forty-two chapters expound on various principles. The previous chapter clarified how the five virtues decline—from Dao to ritual as the source of disorder. This chapter demonstrates how all people return to their roots, align with the Dao, and restore harmony. It follows the natural inclinations of each to guide them back, hence its placement.\n\nWithin this chapter, four distinctions are made:\nFirst, it clarifies that all colored and formed things share the same fundamental *qi*.\nSecond, it shows that though disciples may be many, all are encouraged toward non-action.\nThird, it demonstrates that lowering the high and elevating the low is the enduring way.\nFourth, it states that abandoning the noble for the humble is the path to returning to true nature.\n\n---\n**Those who attained Oneness in the past,**",

thousand things\n**received the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness, and thus came to life and form.**\nThis sentence summarizes how birth arises from the lower distinctions of obtaining Oneness.\n\nHeaven receives Oneness and becomes **clear and serene**,\nEarth receives Oneness and becomes **settled and tranquil**.\nThe *qi* of Oneness divides into yin and yang:\n**Yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven.**\nWhen Heaven receives the **clear *qi* within Oneness**, it is Heaven—thus **serene and luminous**.\n**Yin *qi* descends, turbid and dense, becoming Earth.**\nWhen Earth receives the **turbid *qi* within Oneness**, it is Earth—thus **stable and at peace**.\n\nThe **spirit** receives Oneness and becomes **responsive and alive**,\nThe **valleys** receive Oneness and become **filled and abundant**.\nWithin the *qi* of Oneness, there exists that which is **neither yin nor yang**—this is called **harmony**.\nOnce yin and yang are distinguished,\n**the yin-dominant aspect of harmony becomes ghosts and spirits,**\nas well as the **essences of mountains and rivers**.\nGhosts and spirits alike **obtain Oneness**—\ntheir **mystical responsiveness** is inexhaustible,\ntheir **flowing abundance** is unending.\nThe essences of rivers and valleys are also like **humans in possessing spirit**.\n\nAll **ten thousand things** receive Oneness and thus **come to life**,\n**Nobles and kings** receive Oneness and become **the rectifiers of the world**.\nTen thousand things—**the collective name for all that bears life**.\nHumans are **most responsive**, thus standing **at the head of all things**.\nNobles and kings **partially receive the refined harmony of Oneness**,\nand become **leaders of the people, the sovereigns of governance and teaching**.\n\n**This is how they achieve their station.**\n*Station*—**this is attainment**.\n\n**The six matters above**—\nHeaven, Earth, spirit, and valleys—\n**all share the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness**, and thus **come to life and form**.\n**Six sentences follow.**\n\nIf Heaven lacks **clarity**, it **risks fragmentation**;\nIf Earth lacks **tranquility**, it **risks upheaval**.\nOneness—**the origin of *qi***—\n**is the ultimate void, without form or trace**.\nHeaven and Earth **retain Oneness** to preserve their **clarity and peace**,\nbut they must also **guard it** to endure.\nIf they indulge in **action or desire**,\nthey **will inevitably lose Oneness**—\nthen Heaven **lacks Oneness to sustain its clarity**, and **darkness, confusion, and rupture** will ensue.\nEarth **lacks Oneness to uphold its peace**, and **tremors, convulsions, and overflow** will follow.\n**Oneness is that which can be attained from beginning to end**—\nit cannot be **obtained at the start and lost at the close**.\nThis is **the inevitability of initial attainment**,\nbut **the certainty of later loss through human interference**.\nThus, **fragmentation and upheaval** are warned against.\n\nIf the **spirit lacks responsiveness**, it **risks exhaustion**;\nIf the **valleys lack abundance**, they **risk depletion**.\nIf the spirit **employs Oneness**,\nit **rises in emptiness and attains its own clarity**—\n**mysterious and boundless, yet if it becomes arrogant and proud**,\nits **functions and powers will surely cease**.\nThe **essences of rivers and lakes**,\n**proud and self-satisfied**, clash with Oneness—\nthen **rivers and lakes dry up**, their **sources scorch**.\nAll **ten thousand things** lack **life**, and **decay will follow**;\nNobles and kings lack **Oneness**, and **downfall will surely come**.\nOneness—**the marvelous *qi* of the Dao/Way**—\n**is the root of all formed things**.\nIf humans **can return to their origin and uphold Oneness**,\nthen **life is preserved**.\nIf they **chase the superficial and lose Oneness**,\nthen **true nature is extinguished**.\nNobles and kings **lack Oneness to govern their station**,\nand **rapid ruin** will follow—**speaking of collapse**.\nThese **six matters all warn against arrogance and excess**,\nand though **Heaven, Earth, spirits, and valleys** are mentioned,\nit is because **all possess responsive essences**,\nand through human warnings, they are **included universally**.\nThus the preface to the *jue* states:\n**Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits all revere the same principle—**\n**their forms differ, yet their essence is identical.**\n\nTherefore,\n**the noble finds its foundation in the humble,**\n**the high finds its base in the low**.\nThose who **guard the Dao of Oneness**,\n**must only rise in emptiness**—\n**regardless of noble or humble status,**\n**to be modest and self-effacing is to align with the Dao and ensure safety,**\n**while pride and self-aggrandizement are to defy the Dao and court destruction**.\n\nThus, nobles and kings **call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"without grain\"**—\n**is this not their claim of humility as foundation?**\nNo?\n**\"Lonely,\" \"solitary,\" \"widowed,\" \"without grain\"**—\nthese are **humans’ vilest names**.\n**\"Without grain\"**—**also not virtuous**.\nGrain—**this is stipend**.\nTo

Oneness to govern nobility?**\nNo—**this is a question to the saying above**.\n\nThus,\n**to earn many praises is to have no praises at all**.\n*Praise*—**this is commendation**.\nTo **seek praise and multiply commendations**,\n**is to have none truly earned**—\nthe **king is named by the people’s collective acclaim**.\nTo **examine the king’s true substance**,\n**there is no fixed form of

external causes**, and **forgets the heart’s attachments**,\n**while aligning with the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi’s teachings**—\n**both have established their doctrines**.\nThus **Zhuangzi says**:\n*\"Lending oneself to foreign things,\nentrusting oneself to shared bodies—\nif foreign things are borrowed,\nshared bodies are not truly one’s own.\"*\n\nAgain he says:\n*\"Now, if one points to a horse’s hundred bodies\nand cannot find the horse itself,\nyet the horse is tied before you,\nhow can it be called a horse?\"*\n\nAnd in the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* it states:\n*\"The four great elements—Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind—\n**are combined and dispersed according to the seasons’ *qi*.***\nEarth and Water—**these are the four great**;\nFire and Wind—**these are the four seasonal *qi*.***\nThe **four great are falsely combined**,\n**due to the ebb and flow of time**—\n**temporarily forming a body**,\nyet the **four great cannot each generate life independently**;\nthey **must rely on all causes converging** to **complete the form**.\nIf the **human body’s four great disperse**—\nwhere **does the body go?**\nFollowing the **text’s meaning**, I

      "translated_text": "「Thus, when humanity first comes into being, it receives the harmonious and the two qi of purity and turbidity. The subtle and the refined coalesce and solidify, transforming and giving rise to form. The spirit and consciousness are the refined essence of the harmonious Dao, sharing with heaven and earth the same received qi to bring forth life. Therefore, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *\"I divide One qi with heaven and earth to govern them, maintaining the original root as my principle.\"*\n\nThe Three giving birth to myriad things are as follows: heaven and earth give birth to myriad things, and humanity gives birth to humanity, nurturing and lengthening them, so that all things fulfill their nature and flourish. From this point onward, all is the interplay of yin and yang, generating life through form and appearance—thus it is called the Three giving birth to myriad things.\n\n**The next five sentences speak of Two.**\n\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in front, with the harmonious qi as their core. *Bear* means to lean against; *embrace* means to turn toward; *core* means the central space. For humanity, the back is yin, hence the word *bear*. The heart and front are yang, hence the word *embrace*. The harmonious qi resides within, permeating and regulating yin and yang, harmonizing the viscera and bowels, so that form and spirit are fully complete—thus it is said, *\"the harmonious qi as their core.\"*\n\nGrasses and trees grow from the earth and stretch toward the sky, similarly bearing yin and embracing yang, all possessing harmonious qi—only differing in lacking consciousness.\n\nWhat humanity detests are the states of *孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled), yet kings and nobles take these as titles. This reveals the emergence of emotional desires, where love and aversion first arise—this is the beginning of all beings creating karma.\n\n*孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled) are universally despised, yet all seek wealth and honor for their own gain. Others harm them instead of helping. Kings and nobles adopt these titles for themselves, and the people love them.\n\n**The next two sentences speak of Three.**\n\nThus, things either suffer loss to bring benefit or benefit to bring loss. *Things* here refers to all humanity. Kings and nobles adopt titles of *孤* and *寡* for themselves—this is self-loss. Yet they ultimately reside in wealth and honor—this is the people’s loss to benefit themselves. Self-benefit invites harm from others.\n\nThis passage ties together the preceding and following sections. **The next five sentences speak of Four.**\n\nWhat humanity is taught is also what I teach—easily understood. Common teachings all deviate from my Dao of *wuwei* (non-action), instead practicing the Way of *youwei* (action). Thus, the heart lacks humility and moderation, and life is cut short by untimely death. The strong and ruthless do not attain a natural death.\n\nThe bold and decisive, who harm others to benefit themselves, are like the strong and unyielding. All things suppress and crush them, causing them to perish midway—dying unnaturally, not in accordance with the Dao. They do not attain a good end, nor do they die in accord with principle.\n\nI shall take them as my teaching example. *I* refers to Laozi. *Example* means root. For the bold and ruthless, death cannot be avoided, so I speak of self-loss to restrain them. Teaching serves as the foundation for those who study; by weighing loss and benefit, I clearly demonstrate what is to come.\n\nThis chapter first explains the origin of life to inspire reverence, then enumerates calamities to instill fear and abandonment. It is a combination of admonition and encouragement, urging one to discard superficiality and return to the root.\n\n**The next four sentences speak of the sixth chapter on the world:**\n\nBefore, it was explained that the bold and ruthless do not attain a natural death; now, it is made clear that the gentle and weak align with the true and authentic.\n\nGentle opposes firm—this is the second distinction of the subsequent teachings. First, it is shown that refined intent and gentle weakness can break through rigidity and strength; then, it is lamented that the common people rarely understand the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n**The first four sentences:**\n\nThe world’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness. *Utmost gentleness* and *utmost firmness* each have two meanings: one external, one internal. The external meaning is that within all phenomena, the gentlest is the Dao, and the firmest is metal and stone. *Overcomes* is like the swiftness of a galloping horse—though metal and stone are firm, the Dao penetrates and courses through them, coming and going like a galloping horse.\n\nThus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *\"The Dao’s gentleness and weakness envelop heaven and earth, penetrating all things.\"*\n\nThe internal meaning is that *utmost gentleness* refers to the Dao-heart, and *utmost firmness* refers to afflictions. Afflictions, though countless, are as firm as metal and stone—only the gentle and weak Dao-heart can effectively assail them, causing all to dissolve. Without afflictions, one enters the realm of *wujian* (no separation).\n\nTherefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action). *Without afflictions* refers to the heart, and *no separation* refers to the Dao. The heart, free from sensory attachments, exhausts all worldly desires—thus it is called *without afflictions*. The supreme Dao is subtle and boundless, without flaws or gaps—thus it is called *no separation*. *Enter* means to unite harmoniously. Though the Dao is subtle and profound, the heart is the gap, and one who possesses nothing—uniting with the Dao’s inner emptiness—finds the heart ever more spacious. By this measure, it is known that the virtue of a vacant heart and the practice of *wuwei* greatly benefit humanity.\n\n**The next three sentences speak of the seventh chapter:**\n\nThe teaching of *wuwei* (non-action), though unspoken, brings benefit—yet few in the world attain it. Those who know the Dao lead by example, not speaking aloud. Those who learn the Dao observe with their eyes and act with their hearts, laboring not with their bodies. The body does nothing, the heart desires nothing—first breaking afflictions, then entering *wujian*, attaining the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nHe who does not speak is heard by none, and he who acts without doing is seen by none. Beyond hearing and seeing, this is not the knowledge of ordinary people. Thus, few in the world can truly grasp it—only those who can discern traces and know the heart may receive the unspoken teaching.\n\n**The next three sentences speak of the eighth chapter:**\n\nBefore, it was shown that the virtue of *wuwei* benefits one without words; now, it is revealed that the common worldly Way is filled with greed, harming oneself. The first distinction was between gain and loss in relation to the body—what is closer, the body or reputation? Next, it is made clear that deep attachment brings danger, and heavy loss follows. Finally, it is shown that cutting off greed and knowing contentment brings self-fulfillment and eternal life.\n\n**The first three sentences:**\n\nReputation and the body—what is closer? Reputation is the empty praise of external things, while the body is the true essence of life and death. Without the body, life is severed; without reputation, life endures long. Thus, the wise conceal their reputation to avoid calamity and preserve their body, while the foolish covet reputation and lose their spirit, harming their life.\n\nThis is why the question is posed: between reputation and the body, which is closer? It prompts self-examination and understanding. In Laozi’s time, there were those who killed their bodies to gain reputation—he lamented their delusion, hence setting this question to warn the virtuous.»",

when excessive, they bring disaster.\nThe distinction between appropriateness and excess is clear—this is the mirror.\n\nThus, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure;\nthe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\nThis explains the answer to the question of reputation.\nTo love dangerous tools excessively harms the spirit and shortens life, undermines merit, and depletes qi—this is great expenditure.\nGreed without restraint, unable to disperse what is gained, hoarding deeply and hiding away—this invites robbery and plunder.\nAll who die unnaturally or suffer harm for the sake of reputation and wealth are victims of great loss.\n\nTherefore, contentment brings no shame,\nand knowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one may endure long.\nThe contented know their proper measure, which has two aspects:\none is the measure of nature,\nthe other is the measure of things.\nThe measure of nature is like hunger requiring food, cold requiring clothing—\nwhen the belly is full and the body warm, nature is already satisfied.\nExcessive furs not worn, leftover food not tasted—\nthese are beyond natural measure.\nContentment is the ability to stop, called wisdom.\nIf one eats when already full, it breeds abdominal illness.\nIf one clothes oneself when already warm, it invites fever.\nWithin, there is the ugliness of self-harm;\nwithout, there is the reputation of gluttony—\nthus it is shameful.\n\nThe measure of things refers to what one ought to possess—\nthis is one’s proper share.\nNot taking beyond one’s share is knowing when to stop,\nand thus there is no danger or peril.\nThe unrestrained take beyond their share by force,\nand thus invite ruin and death.\nEven if one eats beyond fullness, unaware that food is one’s proper share and not another’s,\nit is a failure of self-restraint—\nthus one earns a shameful reputation.\nThough shame is an ugly deed, it does not lead to ruin and death.\nThis shows that contentment’s virtue is profound while its deficiency is shallow,\nand knowing when to stop is weak while its excess is deep.\nSince one’s conduct already has contentment and restraint,\nshame and peril cannot touch them—\nthus they preserve their natural lifespan without early death,\nsecuring enduring life—who can shorten it?\n\n**Chapter Eight of *Daode Jing* Commentary:**\nPreviously, it was shown that greed for reputation and competition for wealth lead to the loss of both.\nNow it is shown that abandoning wealth and forgetting reputation bring fulfillment of virtue and merit,\nholding up blessings and warning against calamity—\nthus the two distinctions follow in order.\nPreviously, it was shown that having virtue could diminish and thus achieve fulfillment;\nnow it is shown that agitation leads to deficiency while tranquility aligns with the Dao.\n\nIf Great Completion is deficient,\nits use will not be exhausted.\n\"Exhausted\" means impoverished.\nThose whose deeds are perfectly accomplished\nremain humble all day, as if deficient,\nyet their virtue fills within and benefits others without—\nlike a wellspring, its use never ends,\nand thus there is no exhaustion.\n\nPreviously, it was those who sought reputation and lost their lives,\nfor they did not forget.\nNow, those who forget reputation and obscure their traces\npreserve their virtue and longevity.\n\nIf Great Fullness is empty,\nits use will not be spent.\nThose whose virtue and Dao are perfectly full\nappear externally empty, as if lacking,\nyet they respond to circumstances without end—\nalready complete and full, their virtue is comprehensive.\n\nIf Great Straightness is bent,\nthe heart conforms to the Dao,\ncutting off private and evil desires—\nthis is Great Straightness.\nTo follow the ways of the world, yielding without resistance—\nthis is bending.\n\nIf Great Skill is clumsy,\nto act with clever expedience, perfectly suited—\nthis is Great Skill.\nTo follow conventions without innovation—\nthis is clumsiness.\n\nIf Great Eloquence is inarticulate,\nto discern truth from falsehood, analyze doubts—\nthis is Great Eloquence.\nTo speak without flattery, expressing meaning without words—\nthis is inarticulateness.\n\n**Chapter Nine (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Ten (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Eleven: *For Learning* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Twelve: *The Sage* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Thirteen: *Birth* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Fourteen: *Dao Gives Birth* (Original text omitted)**\n**Chapter Fifteen: *Returning to the Root* (Original text omitted)**\n\n**Volume Five of *Commentary on the Dao-De Jing* concludes.**\n**Volume Five of *De Jing* begins.**\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: *Making Me* (Original text omitted)**",

the Dao,\nas vulgar habits fade and **virtue** (德行) renews daily,\n**Dao-practice** (道业) flourishes—\nthus it is **surplus**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the village** (修之乡),\nits **power** (德) becomes **long-lasting** (长).\nThose with the Dao dwelling in the village,\nneighbors and kin admire them in awe,\nsuperior and inferior recognize their order,\nthe greedy and competitive know moderation—\ntheir **power** (德) grows ever stronger,\nhence it is called **long-lasting**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated **in the state** (修之国),\nits **power** (德) becomes **abundant** (丰).\nTo govern the state with the Dao—\nall receive its nourishment,\ncustoms shift and morals ease,\npeople return to sincerity, goods overflow—\nthus it is called **abundant**.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated

Observing with discernment** (有观)—\n**Master of the Yellow River** (河上公) says:\n*\"Observe those who cultivate the Dao in their bodies\nand those who do not—\nwho endures, who perishes?\nThe village, state, and world follow the same pattern.\nOnly by observing traces of endurance and ruin at the edges\ncan one know the difference between cultivation and neglect—\nthus it is called **observing with discernment**.\"*\n\n**2. Observing with emptiness** (空观)—\nto observe the body as illusory and without true substance,\nand thus settle one’s resolve.\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"The essential precept must know\nthat within the **Three Realms** (三界),\neven the **Three Dynasties** (三代) are empty.\nThough there is my body,\nall must return to emptiness—\nthus it is called **observing with emptiness**.\"*\n\n**3. Observing with truth** (真观)—\nthen, one must observe according to this *Scripture*,\ninvestigating:\n*\"From what did this body arise?\nFrom whence did it come?\nWhose child is it?\nWith what does it form its limbs and myriad parts?\nWho governs its **qi** (气命) and **spirit** (精神)?\nSeeking the *Scripture*’s principles,\ntracing the Dao’s flow,\nfirst, the **One Qi** (一气) of the *Scripture*,\nthen the **Yin-Yang** (阴阳) transformations,\nthe Dao as **spirit** (精神),\n**Primordial Unity** (元和) as **qi** (气命),\n**Yin-Yang** as the **substance** (质绪),\nthe **Great Dao** as the **master craftsman** (都匠).\nCollecting these elements,\nmolding and refining them into the body—\nthe **heart** (心) is the **essence of Yin-Yang** (阴阳之精),\nyet it is the master of cravings.\nThe **spirit** (神) is the **essence of the Dao** (至道之精),\nyet it is the master of **qi** (气命).\nIn all the body’s functions,\nnothing is left unaccounted for.\"*",

this *Scripture* is the finest guide\nfor recognizing the mother,\nthe essential method for awakening to truth.\nIt unifies all things into **One**,\nharmonizing heaven and earth into great

does not yet understand how to avoid harm.\n\nThe first ten lines:\nThe depth of **containing virtue**\nis like that of an infant.\n\nThose who deeply embrace **virtue and the Dao**\nare internally filled with harmonious **qi**,\nand thus external evils cause no harm.\nTheir virtue is profound and distant,\nunknown to others,\nyet even infants recognize it—\nhence the comparison.\n\nPoisonous

      "translated_text": "With **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhī guó*), it refers to the **feudal lords** (*zhūhóu yě*). Governance (*zhèng*) encompasses **仁** (*rén*—benevolence), **義** (*yì*—righteousness), **礼** (*lǐ*—ritual/propriety), **信** (*xìn*—trustworthiness), **法令** (*fǎlìng*—laws and decrees), and **科条** (*kētiáo*—statutes and regulations), which serve as methods for **teaching and regulating the people** (*zhèngjiào lǐrén zhī fǎ*). Yet, those who implement them find it **burdensome** (*fán*), and those who follow them labor under their weight. Such governance may suffice for **small matters** (*lǐ xiǎo*), but it cannot **transform the great** (*huà dà*). Hence, it is called **governance** (*zhì guó*).\n\nWith **unconventional means** (*yǐ qí*) in **wielding arms** (*yòng bīng*), unconventional (*qí*) here means **deception** (*zhà yě*). Those who wield arms—such as the **four tyrants** (*sì xióng*) rebelling against humanity—defy **heavenly order** (*bèi luàn tiāncháng*), causing unrest among the **common folk** (*wànxìng bù ān*). In such times, **sound strategies** (*liángcè*) are needed. Yet, **using arms to maintain peace** (*yòng bīng jìng nán*) is a challenge even for the wise, who must take it up. When difficulty arises, **flexibility and deception** (*quándào guì zhà*) become paramount, though such tactics cannot be **prolonged** (*bùkě jiǔxíng*).\n\nWith **non-action** (*wúwéi wúshì*) in **acquiring the world** (*qǔ tiānxià*), acquiring the world (*qǔ tiānxià*) refers to **emperors and kings** (*dìwáng yě*). **Non-action and non-interference** (*wúwéi wúshì*) are the **virtue/power** (*dé*) of emperors and kings. When the heart **has no desires** (*wú suǒ yù*), and affairs **are left undone** (*shì wú suǒ wéi*), they do not **summon the people** (*zhào yú rén*), yet the people **return in admiration** (*bǎixìng guī mù*), and all directions **come in harmony** (*sìfāng tóng zhì*). This is because they do not **purposefully take** (*wéi yǒuxīn qǔdé*) the world, hence it is called **acquiring the world without interference** (*wúshì qǔ tiānxià*).\n\n**Ten sentences in two** (*xià shí jù èr*).\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? **By this** (*yǐ cǐ*). How do I know? **This is inquiry** (*hé yǐ zhī, fā wèn yě*). The world is thus (*zhī rán*), just as it is (*yú rú shì yě*). By this (*yǐ cǐ*) means **judging and measuring these three matters** (*zhǐ cǐ sān shì jiàoliáng yǐ dáshì*).\n\n**Deception, governance, and non-interference** (*qí zhèng wúshì*) are **talent** (*cái yě*). **Military, state, and worldly affairs** (*jūn guó tiānxià*) are **position** (*wèi yě*). When **position secures talent**, affairs are **regulated** (*shì lǐ*), and when **talent finds position**, the **Dao/Way is practiced** (*dào xíng*). Therefore, seeing **talent** reveals the **order or chaos** (*lǐ luàn*) of **position**, and observing **position** can distinguish the **superiority or inferiority** (*yōu liè*) of **talent**. Hence, it is said **by this** (*yǐ cǐ yě*).\n\nThe world **abounds in taboos** (*tiānxià duō jìhuì*), yet the people **grow ever poorer** (*mín mí pín*). This illustrates that **acquiring the world through interference** (*yǒushì qǔ tiānxià*) harms the people (*shēng xià jìhuì*), just as **excessive governance impoverishes the populace** (*shàng zhèng mí pín*). It clarifies that **harsh taboos and governance** (*xià shēng jìhuì fēi yī lèi*) are not of one kind, hence it is said **the world abounds** (*guó duō*).\n\nTaboos (*jìhuì*) are **laws and decrees** (*fǎlìng yě*). Strict statutes and severe laws (*yán kē jùn fǎ*), dense as **congealed fat** (*mì ruò níng zhī*), cause **internal distress from hunger and cold** (*gōngshǒu zé nèi pò jīhán*) if one does nothing, and **external entanglement in punishments and ordinances** (*cóngshì zé wài luó xíngzhuàn*) if one acts. Now, **restricting affairs and imposing taboos** (*yǔ shì míng huì*) briefly refers to three types:\n\n1. **Family and state taboos** (*jiāguó jìhuì*), where **speech loses its meaning** (*yán tán zé shī qí yì*).\n2. **Yin and yang taboos** (*yīnyáng jìhuì*), where **actions lose their timing** (*wéishì zé shī qí shí*).\n3. **Laws and decrees taboos** (*fǎlìng jìhuì*), where **livelihoods lose their occupation** (*yíngshēng zé shī qí yè*).\n\nThough **laws are established to benefit the people** (*fǎ zhī suǒshè, běn nǐ rén*), if the people are **forced to comply**, it becomes **inconvenient for them** (*yǐ zhòng cóngjī, zé yú rén bù biàn*). Disobedience leads to **punishment**, while compliance results in **loss of benefit** (*fán zé fàn jìn, cóng zé shī lì*). Hence, **poverty** (*pín yě*).\n\n**By this, it is verified** (*yǐ cǐ yàn zhī*), knowing that **they are not the sovereigns of non-interference** (*bù wéi wúshì zhī zhǔ*). If **conducting affairs with utmost propriety and no taboos** (*xíng zhì lǐ, bùhuì*) is practiced, then **all will prosper naturally** (*rén jiē zì fù*).\n\nWhen the people **abound in clever devices** (*mín duō lìqì*), the state **grows more corrupt** (*guójīā hūn*). The people (*rén*) are the **general term for all ranks** (*guì biān zhī tōngchēng*). Clever devices (*lìqì*) refer to **schemes and stratagems** (*jīquán móucè*). Those capable of **harming others for personal gain** (*kān yǐ shēng rén yì jī*) are all called **clever devices** (*lìqì*). Yet, when **family and state** pursue **affairs and interference** (*hǎoshì yǒuwéi*), the **rulers value clever schemes and stratagems** (*shàng wù quánzhì yǐ jìn xià*), while the **common folk devise deceitful plots to defy the rulers** (*xià shēng jiān cè yǐ wǔ shàng*). Rulers and subjects **colluding in schemes**, not practicing the **Dao/Way of rectitude** (*bù xíng zhèngdào*), lead to **deception and falsehood among the populace** (*rénshù wěi wàng*), and **confusion and bewilderment among rulers and ministers** (*jūnchén hūn huò*).\n\nWhen the people **abound in cleverness and ingenuity** (*mín duō zhìxiào*), **unconventional things proliferate** (*qí wù zī qǐ*). Proliferate (*zī*) means **to increase** (*yì yě*). Cleverness and ingenuity (*zhìxiào*) are **unconventional products of worry and labor** (*yōuláo zhī qíwù*), referring to those who **possess extraordinary cleverness and ingenuity** (*bùfēi yǒushì zhī tú*), delight in **unusual things** (*hǎo wéi yìwù*), and **compete in mutual boasting** (*jìng xiāng guā shàng*), daily **increasing their unconventional abilities** (*yìbiàn qí néng*). This is because the **rulers cherish the strange and unusual** (*shàng guì zhēn qí*), causing the **common folk to indulge in extravagance and excess** (*bǎixìng jiāo huā yì shèn*).\n\nWhen **punishments and regulations proliferate** (*fǎwù zī zhāng*), **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*). Punishments and regulations (*fǎwù*) refer to **tools of penal law** (*xíngfá zhī jù*), such as **strict statutes and harsh laws** (*yán kē kù fǎ*), including **stocks, fetters, and flogging** (*jiāsuǒ zhuīchǔ zhī shǔ*). Though **applying punishments and regulations aims to prevent theft** (*shī fǎwù běn nǐ fàn dào*), when **harsh penal methods are excessive** (*chǔ fǎ duō ér dào zéi shèn*), it is because the **rulers favor strange and unusual things** (*shàng hǎo qíwù*), the **common folk have no choice but to steal** (*xià wú zé dào*). Even if the **legal net is dense** (*fǎwǎng suī mì*), thieves **grow ever more cunning** (*dào zéi mí qí*), and **offenders multiply** (*fàn dào zé zhòng*), hence it is said **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*).\n\n**Five sentences in two** (*xià wǔ jù èr*).\n\nThus, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) proclaims: **\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves naturally\"** (*wǒ wúwéi, mín zì huà*);",

      "translated_text": "The **Sage** now elucidates how the **uninvolved** (*wúshì*) attains **my Heavenly Sovereign** (*wǒ tiānwáng*).\n\nSuppose the **Heavenly Sovereign** declares:\n*\"I govern from above with non-action, and all under heaven naturally transform themselves.\"*\n\n**Non-action** refers to **superior governance** (*shàng zhèng*), while **self-transformation** reveals the **people’s growth** (*xià yì*). This aligns with the **fourfold harmony** of principle—**self-evident**.\n\n*\"I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich.\"*\nAbove, there are **no taxes or corvée labor** (*shàng wú fùyì zhī shì*), and below, there are **no weary or disturbed people** (*xià wú láorǎo zhī rén*).\nAll households dwell in peace, the **four classes** (*sìmín*) resume their vocations—women at their looms, men at their plows. **Pure virtue** fills the heart, and **abundant grain** overflows the fields—hence, they are **rich**.\n\n*\"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves.\"*\nPeople are like water: **still, they become clear and level**; level, they can **rectify all things**.\nStillness arises from **tranquility**—when the lower moves, the upper follows. **Desires and perversities are severed**, and people return to **simplicity and rectitude**.\nAs previously stated: *\"Clarity and stillness are the rectification of all under heaven.\"*\n\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n**Desire** begins with **covetousness and attachment**; **simplicity** is the **undivided purity of the heart** before dispersion.\nIf the **Sovereign** abandons desire, the people **cease greed and licentiousness**, weary of frivolous excess, and **naturally revert to their original simplicity**.\n\nThe **Laozi’s** teaching does not merely extol the benefits of **non-action** but contrasts it with the **harm caused by governance**. The **gains and losses of kingship** are mirrored here—**like the tortoise-shell and bronze divination** (*guījìng*).\n**Chapter Twenty-One on Governance** follows:\nPreviously, it was shown how **transformation** leads to **deviance or purity** among people. Now it clarifies how **governance**, whether **lenient or severe**, leads to **completeness or deficiency**.\nThough **excesses are not fully removed**, this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions**:\nFirst, it distinguishes **governance’s leniency or urgency** and their **benefits or harms**.\nSecond, it explains that **calamity and fortune cycle endlessly**, with **no ultimate limit**.\nThird, it demonstrates how **non-action** governs by **rectifying oneself and leading others**.\n\n**Four sentences in one.**\n\nWhen **governance is slow and measured** (*qí zhèng mènmèn*), the people are **simple and sincere** (*qí mín chúnchún*).\n*\"Slow and measured\"* means **lenient and relaxed**. Some texts read *\"mǐnmǐn\"* (蒙昧), with the same pronunciation as *\"mén\"* (门), meaning **obscured and ignorant**.\n*\"Simple and sincere\"* means **unadorned and straightforward**. If the **Sovereign** is **dim like darkness**, and governance is **lenient and relaxed**, then the people **naturally become honest and thick-witted like the unlearned**.\n**Turning from corruption back to simplicity** marks the **beginning of fortune**.\n\nWhen **governance is sharp and scrutinizing** (*qí zhèng cháchá*), the people are **depleted and failing** (*qí mín quēquē*).\n*\"Sharp and scrutinizing\"* marks the **onset of strict governance**. *\"Depleted and failing\"* follows **exhaustion and ruin**.\nThis is for those who **cultivate fortune through self-discipline**: when the **Sovereign’s heart is broad and still**, the **five viscera** are harmonious, the **hundred passages** are regulated—**all functions operate as they should**.\nBut if the **Sovereign is overly vigilant**, **external conduct falters**, and **inner vitality dissipates**, leading to **premature death**—hence, they are **depleted**.\n\n**Eight sentences in two.**\n\n**Calamity** is the **leaning of fortune**; **fortune** is the **hidden seed of calamity**.\n*\"Leaning\"* means **dependence**; *\"hidden\"* means **concealed**.\n**Calamity and fortune** are the **retributions of good and evil**.\nIf one **empties the heart** of all **good and evil**, then **having neither**, how could there be **fortune or calamity**?\nBut when the **heart engages in good or evil**, **fortune and calamity naturally arise**—**calamity clings to evil**, while **fortune lies within**, though **calamity is evident** and **fortune is concealed**.\nIf one **abandons evil and practices goodness**, then **fortune emerges from calamity**, and **calamity is concealed while fortune appears**—hence, *\"calamity is the leaning of fortune.\"*\nIf one **indulges in fortune with arrogance and excess**, then **fortune vanishes and calamity arises**—**calamity is the hidden seed of fortune**.\nAs long as **good and evil persist**, **fortune and calamity will never cease**.\nThe **heart is the master of good and evil**; thus, **calamity and fortune depend on it**, both **existing within the heart**.\n**Fortune and calamity are formless**—they arise **instantly with perception**. Who can **know their limits**? There is **no fixed measure**.\n*\"Measure\"* refers to the **central principle**—the **heart**.\n**Fortune comes from goodness**, and **calamity arises from evil**; **fortune and calamity cycle endlessly**—who can **know their bounds**?\nIt is because **partial and perverse hearts** **give rise to goodness and evil**, yet those who **forget goodness and evil** possess the **rectified heart**.\nThe **rectified heart** is **strange**, and **goodness is also strange**.\nThough the **Sovereign’s heart may forget**, **goodness and evil remain as the rectified principle**—this is **not yet the ultimate rectitude**.\n*\"Strange\"* differs from other **good and evil**; **not inviting fortune or calamity**, though **called good**, it is **not yet worthy of the Dao**. This is **strangeness** (*xiān*).\n*\"Strangeness\"* is the **perverse path** (*dào zhī yé*).\n**Conforming to the Dao** still leaves **residual defilement**; **dwelling in the world** leaves **remaining hatred**.\nThis is merely **self-imposed eccentricity**, not yet **true goodness**.\nThe **people’s delusion** has **lasted for ages**.\n*\"Strangeness\"* is the **habit of clinging to rectitude**; *\"perversity\"* is the **calamity of fixating on goodness**.\n**Nurturing illness without awareness**, hence called **delusion**.\n**Abandoning perversity and clinging to rectitude** is like **being trapped in a sack**—hence, **fixed**.\nFrom **calamity and fortune** to **perversity and goodness**, spanning **ages and eons**, hence called **long-lasting**.\n\nThe **Sage’s compassionate benevolence** will **rescue them**—this is elaborated below.\n\n**Five sentences in three.**\n\nThus, the **Sage** is **square yet does not cut**, **sharp yet not defiled**.\n*\"Square\"* means **rectified**; *\"cut\"* means **severed**.\n*\"Defiled\"* means **evil**; some texts read *\"shuài\"* (刿), meaning **harm**.\nAll who **cling to rectitude or perversity** as their own **strange conduct**—the **Sage** practices **great rectitude**, blending **all teachings into one**, **not severing the crooked** to follow the straight, **self-sufficient in virtue**, **not seeking external purity**.\nThe **people’s greed and defilement** are **internalized as true purity**, yet still **contaminated by worldly habits**.\n\n**Breaking the perverse yet not indulging**, **bright yet not dazzling**.\n*\"Indulging\"* means **displaying**; the **body acts upright**, the **mouth does not proclaim**, **boasting or provoking greed**—these are **self-imposed eccentricities**.\nThough **wisdom, virtue, and names** differ externally, their **inner essence is empty and forgotten**.\n\nIf **goodness is attained through empty forgetfulness**, then **fools will naturally perceive it**, and the **wise will emulate it**, **hiding their brilliance**—**not disturbing the masses**, **not coveting darkness**, **non-action’s transformation** is **greatly realized**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Governing the People** follows:\nPreviously, it was shown how **calamity and fortune have no end** due to **governance and teaching through action**.\nNow it clarifies how **transformation** extends to **both people and the heavens** through **non-action’s principles**.\n**Transformation precedes action**—this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions** within the chapter:\nFirst, it shows how **non-action’s principles** can **transform people and the heavens**.\nSecond, it demonstrates that **mastering non-action** can **secure a kingdom**.\nThird, it reveals that **sustaining non-action** leads to **self-attained longevity**.",

the spirits lack **shen** and thus do not harm people,\nfor the **sage** does not harm people either.\nThis demonstrates that the **sage’s** merit is the true cause,\nnot that the spirits inherently

substance is still weak—\nto break it is not difficult.\n\nThese four sentences discuss the mind’s shift\nfrom non-being to manifestation,\nfrom subtlety to attachment—\nall urging early intervention,\nfor matters are easy when small.\nIf not severed early,\nthey grow, expanding beyond control.\n\nWhy does subtlety precede attachment?\nBecause subtle *qi* is light and insubstantial,\nnearly indistinguishable from non-being,\nits form fragile like smoke or dust—\nthus, its early stage is known.\n\nIts fragility, though not yet firm,\nhas already begun to decay—\nthis is what is meant by *\"easy.\"*\nThough its segments remain,\ntime has passed, and attachment has taken root.\nBy this reasoning, subtlety is known to precede.\n\nEarlier, it spoke of

unmanifested,\"*\nleading into what follows.\nIf one can regulate while at rest,\nno disturbance will arise.\nIf one can extinguish when it first appears,\nit will not reach subtlety or fragility.\nIf subtlety and fragility are broken early,\nthey will not grow to the thickness of a man’s embrace.\nSmall faults accumulate into great ones—\ncalamity originates from the minute.\nAll causes of

teaching that drive them thus.\nHence, it is known that imparting instruction must not be coercive.\n\nTwo sentences below, three in meaning.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n*\"Wise\"* means *\"good.\"*\nThose who do not cling to life are those who forget life.\nExcessive greed for nourishment swiftly leads to death—\nonly those who forget life

resolving to live while forgetting life is superior;\nnow, it is shown that desiring life and avoiding death through gentleness is skillful.\nHaving already spoken of excessive nourishment and forgetting life,\nnow it speaks of firmness and entering death—\nboth share the same *qi*, hence the two distinctions follow.\nThe first uses analogy to explain firmness and entering death, gentleness and living,\nwhile the second concludes that the rigid do not surpass the gentle.\n\nFive sentences, one meaning.\n\nHuman life is gentle and weak,\nbut death is firm and strong.\nLife possesses harmonious *qi*, then sinews and bones are supple and yielding.\nWhen death comes, harmonious *qi* departs the body,\nand limbs become rigid and hard.\nBy contrasting death with life, it is shown that the gentle prevail,\nwhile the strong and bold are inferior.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nin life are gentle and fragile,\nbut in death, they wither and stiffen.\nSpeaking of *\"all things\"* encompasses both sentient and insentient.\nHumans and grasses alike, when *qi* is severed, their forms become firm and strong,\nwhile in life, their forms are entirely gentle and weak.\nThis is an illustrative analogy.\n\nSix sentences, two meanings.\n\nThus, the firm and strong are of death’s kind,\nwhile the gentle and weak are of life’s kind.\nThe nature of rigidity and harshness\ngoes wherever it will—\nsome are bold and domineering over others,\nsome forcibly seize what they desire,\ntheir will fixed on gain, fearless of danger.\nThough perilous, they press forward;\nthough strong, they still overreach—\nthese are called *\"walking corpses,\"*\nakin to the dead.\n\nThe gentle and weak, though death may not spare them,\nwalk as those who seek longevity do—\nthis is the proper teaching.\nThus, the strong in arms are not victorious,\nthe strong in wood are split.\nThese two examples serve as proof.\nThe strong in arms: when many attack, they are annihilated and do not prevail.\nThe strong in wood: when pressed by clay and tiles, they break.\nHence, the rigid and strong are beneath,\nwhile the gentle and weak are above.\nThe strong in arms: when many attack, they are subdued by strength,\nwhile the gentle and weak: when in peril, others aid them;\nwhen harmonious, others uphold them—\nthus, they are above.\n\n**Chapter Forty of Heaven’s Nature**\nPreviously, it was shown that discarding strength and embracing weakness is the way to life;\nnow, it is shown that suppressing the high and elevating the low\nto attain the middle path is essential.\nThe first is crude, the second refined—\nhence, the four distinctions follow:\nfirst, using analogy to show that the Dao seeks the balanced middle;\nsecond, that Heaven benefits through humility while humans benefit through excess and deficiency;\nthird, that only through methodical self-abnegation and benefiting others can one achieve it;\nfourth, that the sage’s wisdom forgets merit and conceals virtue.\n\nSix sentences, one meaning.\n\nHeaven’s Way is like drawing a bow:\nthe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s

gentle and weak are none other than water.\nThis illustrates water’s essence,\nso that those who follow the Dao may take it as their model.\nYet in overcoming strength and rigidity,\nnothing can surpass it—\nits power is unchanging.\nStrength and rigidity are like mountains and stones.\nWater’s use: it erodes stone, topples mountains,\nwhile other things cannot compare.\nIn essence, it bears no burden;\nin application, it achieves great results.\nEssence and application both excel—\nin things, its power is unchanging;\nthis illustrates its application.\nIn humans, strength and rigidity are afflictions;\ngentle and weak are the Dao-heart.\nTo overcome afflictions,\nonly the Dao-heart can do so—\nno other thing can replace it.\n\n**Four Sentences, Two Meanings:**\nThus, gentle overcomes rigid,\nweak overcomes strong—\nyet none in the world can know or act upon this.\nRigid refers to afflictions,\nwhich are extinguished by the Dao-heart,\nso the heart prevails.\nHuman arrogance and obstinacy\nare subdued by gentle and weak conduct,\nso strength is inferior.\nAll this is verifiable by sight—\nyet those who cannot know are foolish.\nOr those who know but cannot act—\nthey lack faith in the Dao.\n\n**Six Sentences, Three Meanings:**\nHence, the sage says:\n*\"To bear a nation’s defamation,\nthis is called the sovereign of the land and grain.\"*\n*\"To bear a nation’s ill fortune,\nthis is called the ruler of all under Heaven.\"*\nThe Old Master cites ancient sage laws\nto exhort the present:\ndefamation refers to slanderous words and calumny,\nill fortune

true sovereign of the law.\n\nTrue words appear as their opposites.\nEarlier, it was said that gentle and weak overcoming strength,\nenduring defamation to become a ruler—\nall these are in accordance with the Dao.\nTrue words are sincere and not false,\nyet to the common masses they seem contrary to convention.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two of the Great Harmony**\nPreviously, it was shown that the Way’s transformation and application lie in gentle and weak endurance of defamation to become a ruler—\nall these are in accordance with the Dao.\nNow, it is shown that the ruler’s virtue lies in

*\"to pacify and settle.\"*\nGreat grudges are those where one has been killed or injured.\nWhen clothing and food are sufficient and rites and propriety are known,\npeople still harbor grudges—\nthis is truly insufficient.\nInsufficiency leads to theft, plunder, killing, and injury;\ngrudges follow in succession.\nWith resentment and shame unresolved,\none must seek revenge,\nswearing to kill to

this grudge may subside,\nanother will arise.\nThe world is vast,\nand grudges and enmities are boundless.\nTo make those skilled in persuasion\ntravel from house to house,\nusing this method to reconcile grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\nIf one achieves great harmony under Heaven,\nthen there are no grudges to reconcile—\nthis is true goodness.\nYet only the enlightened ruler’s virtue\ncan bring this about.\nThose who cultivate themselves\nwish to sever the cycle of birth and death,\nfreeing themselves from past grudges and afflictions.\nThose newly tainted\nmust settle their minds in non-action,\nconduct their bodies in non-doing—\nthen they attain the root of grudges permanently severed,\nand no further grudges arise.\nUsing this to reconcile grudges,\none can truly be called good.\n\n**Five Sentences, Two Meanings:**\nThus, the sage holds the left token\nand does not blame others.\nThe token symbolizes *\"trust.\"*\nIn ancient times, before writing existed,\npeople carved wooden tokens for agreements.\nMale and female tokens fit together—\nthe left (male) token was held by the lord,\nthe right (female) token by the subject,\nused for governance and transformation.\nIf their laws are just,\nthen all under Heaven will be as one—\ntrusting each other,\nscales and measures will not be needed,\nand love and respect will be equal.\nThe strong will not oppress the weak,\nthe noble will not bully the humble—\nthen how can grudges arise?\nHence, the enlightened ruler above\nmust observe the customs of the people.\nIf there are disputes and conflicts,\ninvestigate their origins—\nif they stem from above,\nabolish the token decrees.\nIf the fault lies with oneself,\none does not blame others.\nThis is speaking of those who harbor great grudges.\nIf one cultivates oneself through practice,\nnourishing life with the Dao,\npreserving nature through non-action,\nand others hold grudges against me,\nI only blame myself—\nnot daring to blame Heaven, people, or gods and spirits.\nThus, the virtuous hold the token,\nwhile the unvirtuous lose it.\n*\"Lose\"* means *\"to fail.\"* The virtuous ruler,\nseeing others’ faults,\nonly reflects on himself—\n*\"My laws are not appropriate,\"*\nand does not punish or blame others.\nThe unvirtueful ruler\nonly knows to spy on others’ mistakes,\nunaware that others’ faults originate from himself—\nthus he punishes and blames others,\nwhile not blaming himself.\n\n**Two Sentences, Three Meanings:**\nThe Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nalways aligning with the virtuous.\n*\"Heaven\"* means *\"the natural order.\"*\n*\"No favorites\"* means *\"equality.\"*\nThe virtuous include all—\nrulers, subjects, and the common folk.\nIf one can take responsibility for their own faults,\nbe humble and detached in non-action,\nthen the natural order will align with them—\nthough they hold the left token,\ntheir agreements will be without grudges.\nBetter still is one who walks the great Dao—\nno tokens are needed, yet grudges do not arise.\nEven spirits and gods remain hidden;\nhow much more so among human relations?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three of the Small
