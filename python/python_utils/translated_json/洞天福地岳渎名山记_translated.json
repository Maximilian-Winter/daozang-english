Some align with the celestial lodges above, while others conceal grotto-heavens below. All are governed by the Great Saints and Supreme Perfected Ones, where divine palaces and jade mansions stand, golden terraces and cloud-wrought halls arise—some formed by condensed *qi*, others by the coagulation of mist. There are jade pools and emerald ponds flowing to the four corners, pearl trees and coral groves flourishing upon the land. Here, the phoenixes of the gods take flight, and the dragons of heaven, the sacred fish, and the marsh steeds find their abode. Some lie beneath the sun’s chariot, others beneath the stars’ embrace, harboring wind and rain, storing clouds and thunder, serving as the pivots of Heaven and Earth, the axles of *yin* and *yang*. Now rising in splendor above the seas, now receding into the void of the heavens, some are entwined by the Weak Waters, others sundered by vast waves. Some dwell where sunlight never reaches, where human footsteps never tread—all recorded in the secret scrolls of the true scriptures.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"Within the vast wilderness, there are five thousand renowned mountains, among which the Five Peaks stand as guardians, with ten mountains as their aides.\" The *Jade Scripture of Mount Gui* further states: \"Within the great heavens, there are thirty-six grotto-heavens, each with its own sun, moon, stars, and palaces of the immortals, governing sin and fortune, recording life and death. There reside the Highest Perfected and the Kings of the Immortals.\" Beyond the seas lie the Five Peaks, the Three Isles, the Ten Continents, the thirty-six *jinglu* retreats, the seventy-two blessed lands, the twenty-four transformations, and the four guardian mountains. This volume compiles them all for the edification of those who seek such wonders.\n\nAs for the locations of immortal cities, the names of those who attained the Dao, the lords of grotto-palaces, and the ranks of the celestial bureaus—these matters are too vast and intricate to record in full. Thus, I have merely noted the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction, along with the general count of immortal altars and Daoist temples.\n\nOn the *guiwei* day of the fourth day of the eighth month in the *xinyou* year of the Tianfu era, the Feathered Man of Huading Peak, Du Guangting, compiled this at the Jade Bureau in Chengdu.\n\n**Record of Grotto-Heavens, Blessed Lands, Sacred Peaks, and Divine Waterways**\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting.\n\nThe Sacred Peaks and Myriad Mountains\n\nThe Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Mountain lies at the center of Great Luo, above Jade Purity.

Some align with the celestial lodges above, while others conceal grotto-heavens below. All are governed by the Great Saints and Supreme Perfected Ones, where divine palaces and jade mansions stand, golden terraces and cloud-wrought halls arise—some formed by condensed *qi*, others by the coagulation of mist. There are jade pools and emerald ponds flowing to the four corners, pearl trees and coral groves flourishing upon the land. Here, the phoenixes of the gods take flight, and the dragons of heaven, the sacred fish, and the marsh steeds find their abode. Some lie beneath the sun’s chariot, others beneath the stars’ embrace, harboring wind and rain, storing clouds and thunder, serving as the pivots of Heaven and Earth, the axles of *yin* and *yang*. Now rising in splendor above the seas, now receding into the void of the heavens, some are entwined by the Weak Waters, others sundered by vast waves. Some dwell where sunlight never reaches, where human footsteps never tread—all recorded in the secret scrolls of the true scriptures.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"Within the vast wilderness, there are five thousand renowned mountains, among which the Five Peaks stand as guardians, with ten mountains as their aides.\" The *Jade Scripture of Mount Gui* further states: \"Within the great heavens, there are thirty-six grotto-heavens, each with its own sun, moon, stars, and palaces of the immortals, governing sin and fortune, recording life and death. There reside the Highest Perfected and the Kings of the Immortals.\" Beyond the seas lie the Five Peaks, the Three Isles, the Ten Continents, the thirty-six *jinglu* retreats, the seventy-two blessed lands, the twenty-four transformations, and the four guardian mountains. This volume compiles them all for the edification of those who seek such wonders.\n\nAs for the locations of immortal cities, the names of those who attained the Dao, the lords of grotto-palaces, and the ranks of the celestial bureaus—these matters are too vast and intricate to record in full. Thus, I have merely noted the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction, along with the general count of immortal altars and Daoist temples.\n\nOn the *guiwei* day of the fourth day of the eighth month in the *xinyou* year of the Tianfu era, the Feathered Man of Huading Peak, Du Guangting, compiled this at the Jade Bureau in Chengdu.\n\n**Record of Grotto-Heavens, Blessed Lands, Sacred Peaks, and Divine Waterways**\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting.",
