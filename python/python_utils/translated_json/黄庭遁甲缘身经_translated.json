  "full_translation": "**Huangting Dunjia Yuan Shen Jing**\n\n**Title:** *Huangting Dunjia Yuan Shen Jing*\n**Attributed Author:** Unknown\n**Single scroll.** Source of the original text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), under the *Dongshen* (洞神) section, Methods category (方法类).\nCross-referenced editions: *Yunjiao Qiqian* (云笈七签), where portions of this text appear in volumes twelve and fourteen.\n\n---\n\n**Huangting Dunjia Yuan Shen Jing** (黄庭遁甲缘身经)\nLaozi’s *Huangting Dunjia Lushen Jing* (黄庭遁甲绿身经): If one suffers from illness, swelling, pain, or nightmares, and is plagued by malevolent spirits, recite this.\n\nBegin by **closing the qi** (闭气) from *Jiawu* (甲午) to *Wuxu* (戊戌), retaining the breath in the *Shang Dou* (上斗, Upper Dipper) region. Then, **close the qi** (便闭气), silently recite ten cycles while curling the fingers inward, and **release the qi** (放气). When finished, repeat from *Jiazzi* (甲子) to *Wuchen* (戊辰), retaining the breath in the *Xia Dou* (下斗, Lower Dipper) region. Silently count ten cycles, then **release the qi** (徐放气) gradually. All maladies shall be cured; sudden ailments driven by malevolent qi or the *Feishi* (飞尸, Wandering Corpses) shall be instantly resolved.\n\nIf one’s limbs suffer from pain or affliction, **call upon them** (亦宜呼) and the pain shall be relieved. **Close the qi** (上闭气) three times; if no improvement, repeat the process three times more, then cease. **Take the talisman’s efficacy** (取其符题) to address the pain above.\n\nIf ingested, **invoke the name of the day’s deity** (呼其日神名), proclaiming, *“[Deity’s name] protects me; [Deity’s name] accompanies me—great fortune!”* (某甲护我，某来与我俱，大吉).\n\nTo **attain success in official matters** (欲奏记上书见贵人长者), **hold the talisman for self-protection** (持符自护), invoke the deity’s name, and declare, *“[Deity’s name] accompanies me—fortune!”* (与我俱，吉).\n\nWhen **visiting the sick or mourning households** (若看病及丧家), **carry the talisman** (持符自随), placing it on the left for *yang* (阳) days and the right for *yin* (阴) days.\n\nTo **ward off tigers and wolves in mountains and forests** (欲入山林辟虎狼), **invoke the talisman’s power** (亦呼之).\n\nTo **ward off ghosts and spirits** (欲辟鬼神), inscribe the *Six Jia* (六甲) talisman.\nTo **ward off bandits and soldiers** (欲辟兵贼), inscribe the *Six Bing* (六丙) talisman.\nTo **ward off fire** (欲辟火), inscribe the *Six Ren* (六壬) talisman.\nTo **ward off water deities** (欲辟水神) or **cross rivers** (渡江河), inscribe the *Six Wu* (六戊) talisman.\nTo **ward off slander and calumny** (欲辟口舌), inscribe the *Six Geng* (六庚) talisman.\n**Carry these talismans with you** (皆持以随身) for protection—fortune shall follow.\n\n---\n\nLaozi further states: *“All beings who cultivate the Dao of non-action (无为之道), must, like one in a chamber, guard against human sight. Facing west, they dance in abandon (任哉). The sun and moon shine perpetually at night; I, [deity’s name], delight in the Dao, and grant eternal life. I dance again: The Dao is vast and formless, yet it can enable me to embody the *Taqing* (太清, Supreme Clarity).*\n\n*‘Without’ (无) declares: *“My virtue empowers the Six Ding (六丁), and my words heal all people—three cycles end.”*\n\nLaozi says: *“If humans do not dance, their sinews and bones cannot be strengthened; if they do not speak, their blood vessels cannot flow. To harmonize these, let them labor and enjoy benefits—only then can they endure. Those who do not know song and dance cannot live long.”*\n\n---\n\n**Excerpt from *Huangting Yishu* (黄庭义疏):**\n*“Always examine the throat’s form, lest one forget. Hold good and evil accountable here (善恶责之於此). The throat, from the tongue’s root to the heart, measures one foot and six inches. Below it is sharp, above it is upright and red at the core. Its hue is white, like a silver ring, with twelve layers of crimson veins. The lungs are white and lustrous, their lobes covering the heart in twelve layers, with three lobes resting behind. The *Zhizhen* (至真, Ultimate Truth) resembles white leaves, extending upward to the sternum.”*\n\n---\n\n**On the Body’s Vital Forms (分形谶):**\nThe *Huangting* (黄庭, Yellow Court) region lies **three inches above the navel** (脐上三寸), known as *Dongting* (洞庭), also called *Zifang* (紫房), *Weiyu* (胃愈), or *Shengzhong* (升中). Below it is the *Guan Yuan* (关元, Vital Pass) region, **three inches beneath the navel** (脐下三寸), also named *Dihuang* (地黄) or *Zefu* (泽府).\n\nIts color is true yellow, like two *bolu* (博棋) tiles joined, with a hidden recess—**the two kidneys** (两肾), also called *Shuang Que* (双阙). Above them stand two figures, each **three inches tall** (长三寸), whose presence is constant. On the left is *Chengyi* (承翼, Supporting the Wings), on the right is *Taiyin* (太阴, Supreme Yin)—**the Eastern Sovereign (Dongwang Gong, 东王公) and the Western Sovereign (Xwang Mu, 西王母).** The left figure bears the sun, the right the moon; the left is green, the right is white—**these are Fu Xi (伏羲) and Nu Wa (女娲).**\n\nIn front is the *Mingmen* (命门, Gate of Life), **the central region within the navel** (脐里中). The *Mingmen* is where **qi accumulates like a pearl** (积气状如珠), also called *Lianhuo* (廉火, Refined Fire) entering and exiting the *Dantian* (丹田, Elixir Field)—**the qi reaching its root at the navel** (气至根脐), also known as *Taichu* (太初), *Taisu* (太素), *Taihe* (太和), *Taiyang* (太阳), *Hunting* (魂停), *Zhonghuang* (中黄), or *Taiwugong* (太悟公).\n\nThe *Taiyin* (太阴) governs **the Gate of All Marvels** (众妙之门), where life originates. If one is **sad or anxious, or fails to find joy** (悲忧不乐), the liver is harmed—**dimmed vision and premature graying** (目暝头白). **Cultivate the heart to nourish it** (思心以养之), and the illness shall heal.\n\nIf one **indulges excessively in pleasure** (淫乐), the kidneys are harmed—**lower back pain, heaviness in the body, pus or blood in urine or stool** (腰痛体重，大小便脓血). **Cultivate the liver to nourish it** (思肝以养之), and the affliction shall subside.\n\nIf one **overindulges in food or drink** (饮食醉饱), the spleen is injured. **Cultivate the lungs to nourish it** (思肺以养之). **Let the mother and child nourish each other** (当令母子相养), and the disease shall vanish.\n\n---\n\nThe liver lies beneath the ribs, its hue like a male mandarin duck, with a crucible-like structure. Beneath it are six leaves, and the gallbladder rests within, green as a pouch, storing blood. Its tendons attach to the spine, beneath the nipple crucible. The spleen lies beneath the ribs, above the dancing diaphragm, its true form like molten gold, curving downward three to two inches.\n\nThe kidneys reside above the lumbar region, flanked by the spine, shaped like a nose, enveloped in yellow-white fat. Often, the kidneys appear dark, like black lacquer. To behold the dead and recoil at their form and stench—this harms the spirit. Exposure to foul odors weakens it; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Though foul odors may not be sensed, their essence lingers here. Harm arises from witnessing those bearing刑 wounds, fractures, or injuries. Anger or joy depletes the spirit of the lungs and liver; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Fear damages the spirit of the liver and gallbladder; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Excessive speech and overthinking dim the spirit; observe the heart’s form and adjust accordingly. Failure to harmonize yin and yang weakens the spirit of the kidneys; observe their form and adjust accordingly. The kidneys govern the genitals—when vision and hearing fail, this too is their responsibility.\n\nGrief harms the spirit of the spleen; observe its form and adjust accordingly. Always, at the crowing of the rooster, survey the organs once. In daylight’s leisure, examine them to discern what to nourish and what to avoid. Let strife remain clear. Question and observe the organs ten times daily. Treat and nourish all injuries until they heal. A hundred observations bring lifelong health; a thousand extend youth; ten thousand grant immortality.\n\nWithin the inner chamber, white qi rises like a rooster, luminous as the moon, illuminating all. Always, let this be preserved day and night. If you seek the Dao, godhood, and immortality, first eliminate the Three Vermin.\n\nThe *Fushe* (伏尸) lies beneath the heart, inhaling three hundred sixty breaths daily, absorbing qi thirty times per swallow, resting after ninety. Perform this four times daily. At midnight, crowing like a rooster, chant:\n*\"束方青牙, serve the Green Fang, drink with Morning Blossom—three swallows suffice.*\n*南方朱丹, serve the Vermilion Elixir, drink from the Crimson Pool—three swallows suffice.*\n*中央戊己, nourish the Vital Essence, drink from the Honeyed Spring—three swallows suffice.*\n*西方明石, consume the Luminous Stone, drink from the Sacred Flow—three swallows suffice.*\n*北方玄滋, ingest the Mystic Nourishment, drink from the Jade Congee—three swallows suffice.\"*\n\nFor thirty days, the three vermin shall die. The *Fushe* departs, and true qi settles. Once the vermin are subdued and no longer return to the heart, you shall manifest as a transcendent.\n\nSubdue the *Hun* (魂) and govern the *Po* (魄). Observe the red and white qi between the eyebrows like a rooster. From the brow, guide it down to the navel, transforming it into pure green. From the navel to the *Dantian* (丹田), transform it into pure white. Withdraw the abdomen three times, inhaling through the nose, drawing white qi up the spine in three parallel streams, rising from the *Jingguan* (项关) to the inner chamber. Retreat the brow inward three inches to reach the inner chamber.\n\nThe True Person of the *Taiji* (太极) consumes the elixirs of the Four Extremes and the Cloud Teeth of the Gods, making his divine light radiant within and his crimson brilliance manifest without. His body gleams like jade, and his qi moves with clarity. After seventeen years, the Four Extremes Elder descends upon you, and in union, you ascend on clouds, riding dragons, to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe *Xilianzi* (西梁子) received the Supreme Master’s oral instructions, passed down five times over a thousand years, not to be recklessly divulged. The Four Brightnesses’ methods follow the hidden scriptures. After five days of fasting, the precepts are授授, kneeling in blood oath to the teacher, encircling the five directions with golden rings, binding the disciple with patterned silk, and swearing an unbreakable covenant. The oral instructions are the Five Paired Rings. Additionally, five *liang* of green silk are used—this is the method of the *Xilian* people. The *Nanyue* (南岳) Lady’s *Yunque Jing* (云阙经) may also be used, though this text does not elaborate.\n\nAlways, at dawn, crowing like a rooster, sit in ease, strike the teeth nine times, then intone the incantation:\n*\"束方青牙, wreathed in purple clouds and flowing mists, three pure essences hover, frost and jade robes—consume the morning radiance, drink from the blossoming dawn.\"* After chanting, lick the outer edge of the upper lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Eastern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Green Truth, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"南方朱丹, radiant as the *Tawei*, nine paths of crimson bonds, scattering luminous splendor—consume the sacred dawn, drink from the Crimson Pool.\"* After chanting, lick the outer edge of the lower lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Southern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Vermilion Manifestation, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"西方明石, flying mists and golden elixirs—consume the Supreme Luminosity, the purity of the white essence, drink from the Sacred Constraint. Divine brilliance awakens the spirit, bearing me aloft on clouds, ascending to the lofty purity.\"* After chanting, lick the inner edge of the upper lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Western Extremity Elder shall arrive, granting you the White Talisman of Might, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"北方玄滋, celebratory clouds awaken the congee, green mists spread at dawn, purple canopies and azure banners—consume the moon’s essence, drink from the Jade Congee.\"* After chanting, lick the inner edge of the lower lip, collecting saliva thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Northern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Mystic Record of Brilliance, and together you shall ascend.\n\nFinally, intone:\n*\"戊己之元, yellow purity in five clouds, four mists of violet observation, eight scenes and nine celestial bodies, twin luminaries stirring radiance, seven divine stars—harmonizing essence to nourish qi, consume the Central Primordial, the dragon’s pearl, drink from the Honeyed Spring.\"*\n\n「Once the chant is complete, with the tongue rinse the inner and outer *Xuanying* of the mouth, as well as the spaces between the teeth and tongue—both upper and lower, exterior and interior—until the saliva is gathered and swallowed thirty times in succession. After practicing for ten years, the Central Primordial Sovereign, the Yellow-Qi Divine Lord, shall descend, bestowing upon you the Yellow-Qi Yang-Essence, concealing the Heaven-Hidden Moon, and presenting the *Zhu Jing Lǜ Zhāng Qīng Yào Hǔ Shū*. Together, you shall ascend with the Five Elders in unity.\n\nThe *Yùjīng* Supreme Secret reveals the Dao of the Five Elders: abstain from grains and discard the corpse-like body, retaining youthful radiance, unperturbed by cold or heat, untouched by calamities or harm. Your spirit and qi shall be sharp and clear, extending life and adding years—reaching the limitless span. You shall obtain the Nine-Lined Jade Elixir and the Eight-Jade Flying Essence, thus uniting with the Two Scenes, aligning with Heaven and Earth in perfect harmony.\n\nAll Five Yin Chants must be recited with nine rhythmic tooth-strikings (*kòuchǐ*), which can be practiced diligently without waiting for the crowing of the rooster at dawn. In the stillness of midnight, when the body is pure and the mind serene, one may begin the practice.\n\nFor those who guard the *One*, if they hear this Dao, their practice shall swiftly succeed. With emptiness and simplicity filling within, guarding the Primordial and swallowing saliva—the True One—one seeks abundant fortune naturally. Cultivating the Dao with the Six Elixirs and Five Qis, the elixirs are already within; thus, it is said one seeks fortune by oneself.\n\nIn practicing this Dao, one must not consume dried meats. If hungry, eat *liú* (sprouted grains) gradually, reducing grains step by step—never abruptly ceasing in a single day. This is the principle of *\"reduce, reduce again, until reaching non-action.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao of *Xūyìng*—the natural law, taking Heaven and Earth’s essence from afar, and from the self, as it is said.\n\n**Wei Fu Ren’s Praise:**\n*\"Yúnchǐ\"* (Cloud Teeth) is the refined essence of the Five Elders, the misty radiance of the *Tàijí*. Thus, riding the descending luminosity, it fills the inner self. The Six Elixirs blend harmoniously, penetrating and resonating with the void, as myriad spirits descend. In the depths, they seek each other without summoning—thus, the dragon’s roar echoes in the marshes. Hence, the mists descend upon the peaks, and the tiger howls at the sacred mounds. The gale stirs the four directions, the sun’s mirror (*yángguì*) captures light, and the vermilion flames surge forth. At the rare *Hán yīn* (cold shadow), the dark currents overflow naturally, ascending without awareness. How much more so for the enlightened, who focus their hearts on the Mysterious and delve deeply into the Dao’s roots?\n\nImpurities are purged from the chest, while the true and pure reside in the Three Officials. Drawing the scattered radiance of the Five Dawns, consuming the Six Elixir’s misty nectar, invoking the Nine Heavens’ treasures, uttering the secrets of the Void’s marvels—Dragon-Light shines with dazzling brilliance. Tasting the Three Floras on pearly teeth, extracting the full saliva from the lips’ edge.\n\nInternally refining the Six Organs, opening clarity and sharpness, breathing the Heavenly Primordial, tempering the soul and spirit to perfect the form—dispelling the Dark to attain the Mysterious.\n\nAfter ten years of tranquil practice, the Five Spirits descend—what need for further praise?\n\nThough weak as a woman, I have undergone the Supreme Practices, my subtle voice fading into silence, unworthy of wide proclamation. I merely hint at its mysteries to share with kindred souls. If those who cultivate virtue fall short, let it not be blamed as ruinous.\n\n---\n**Unfolding the *Huángtíng Jīng* Secrets, the Pure and Clever Sage says:**\n*\"To cultivate the *Huángtíng Inner Classic*, one must follow the Imperial Lord’s宝神混化玄真 Dao. After completing the rites and chants, sit upright facing east, gazing straight ahead, visualizing the form’s length and color, calling its name, and returning it to its original palace. Without this method, even if recited ten thousand times, the true spirit will not be guarded, and no response will manifest. It only drains qi and exhausts the spirit, benefiting neither lifespan nor vitality.\n\nWhen copying the scripture to share, always taste the Mysterious Void, savoring the numinous sounds. Read it three times, then retire in purity, with deep faith in the True. Renew your devotion daily, surrendering to the Dao, extinguishing all distinctions. Walk the transformation without fear, revering the True. Merely preserve the Five Zang’s spirits and forms—unaware of the full count—until the Dragon Chariot arrives, the Most High appears. Who says the distant world lacks such beings?\n\nMorning and evening, rinse and purify. Entering the chamber, advance with the right foot first, burn incense, and bow twice, kneeling to say: *\"Respectfully, I open to the Great Emperor of *Fúshāng*, the Divine King of *Yánggǔ*, [name], as I read the *Inner Scene Jade Classic*, preserving the Five Zang’s blossoms, and the spirit ascends with the Dragon.\"*\n\nAgain, face north and bow twice, kneeling to say: *\"Respectfully, I open to the Supreme Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord. [Name] reads the *Inner Scene Jade Classic*, beseeching ascent to the Dragon Plow and feasting in *Zǐqīng*.\"*\n\nReturning to face forward, bind the scripture and read it three times, preserving the spirit and form. Sit levelly, gazing straight ahead, striking the teeth thirty-six times, then still.\n\n**The Divine Spirits:**\nThe *Brain Spirit* (精根), named *Níwán*, length two inches and one fen.\nThe *Eye Spirit* (明上), named *Yīngxuán*, length three inches.\nThe *Nose Spirit* (玉垄), named *Língjiān*, length two inches and five fen.\nThe *Ear Spirit* (空闲), named *Yōutián*, length three inches and one fen.\nThe *Tongue Spirit* (通命), named *Zhènglún*, length three inches and six fen.\nThe *Tooth Spirit* (胖峰), named *Luōqiān*, length one inch and five fen.\n\nThese seven spirits of the face wear purple robes with embroidered skirts, all in the form of infants. Visualize them clearly, arranged in order, each returning to its palace.\n\nUpon completion, strike the teeth twenty times, swallow the breath twelve times, and recite:\n*\"The Seven Sources disperse the qi, gathering it to form the spirit. Distinguishing front and back, circling the *Níwán*, supporting each other above and below, the Seven Spirits spread out, their forms shifting and evading. Nourished by the Primordial Floras, guiding the Eight Spirits, they surge upward through the Cavern Gate, guarding the body and containing the scenes, ascending to the Imperial Dawn.\"*\n\nNext, meditate:\nThe *Heart Spirit* (丹元), named *Shǒuhún*, length nine inches, wearing crimson brocade and a skirt.\nThe *Lung Spirit* (皓华), named *Xūchéng*, length eight inches, in white robes with a sash.\nThe *Liver Spirit* (龙姻), named *Hánmíng*, length six inches and two fen, in green brocade robes.\nThe *Kidney Spirit* (玄冥), named *Yùyīng*, length three inches and six fen.\"»\n\n«The *Spleen Spirit* (常在) remains steadfast, named *Húntíng*, length seven inches and three fen, clad in yellow-green brocade robes.\nThe *Gallbladder Spirit* (龍耀), named *Wēimíng*, length three inches and six fen, wears nine-hued brocade robes and a green skirt.\n\nThe *Six Organs' True Spirits* (右六腑真神), dwelling within the *Five Zàng* and the *Six Fǔ* palaces, appear as infants, their complexion like that of a youth of refined beauty.\n\nPreserve them with vigilance, array them fully in form, then strike the teeth twenty-four times, swallow the *qi* twelve times, and recite:\n\n*\"The Five Zàng and Six Fǔ, their True Spirits united, govern the Vermilion Palace as one, ascending and descending in harmony. The Golden Chamber's crimson child opposes the Four Gates. The Yellow Court eludes the Armor, encircling the Body's Essence—thus the practice is complete.\"*»",

Its hue is white, like a silver ring, with twelve layers of crimson veins. The lungs are white and lustrous, their lobes covering the heart in twelve layers, with three lobes resting behind. The *Zhizhen* (至真, Ultimate Truth) resembles white leaves, extending upward to the sternum.”*\n\n---\n\n**On the Body’s Vital Forms (分形谶):**\nThe *Huangting* (黄庭, Yellow Court) region lies **three inches above the navel** (脐上三寸), known as *Dongting* (洞庭), also called *Zifang* (紫房), *Weiyu* (胃愈), or *Shengzhong* (升中). Below it is the *Guan Yuan* (关元, Vital Pass) region, **three inches beneath the navel** (脐下三寸), also named *Dihuang* (地黄) or *Zefu* (泽府).\n\nIts color is true yellow, like two *bolu* (博棋) tiles joined, with a hidden recess—**the two kidneys** (两肾), also called *Shuang Que* (双阙). Above them stand two figures, each **three inches tall** (长三寸), whose presence is constant. On the left is *Chengyi* (承翼, Supporting the Wings), on the right is *Taiyin* (太阴, Supreme Yin)—**the Eastern Sovereign (Dongwang Gong, 东王公) and the Western Sovereign (Xwang Mu, 西王母).** The left figure bears the sun, the right the moon; the left is green, the right is white—**these are Fu Xi (伏羲) and Nu Wa (女娲).**\n\nIn front is the *Mingmen* (命门, Gate of Life), **the central region within the navel** (脐里中). The *Mingmen* is where **qi accumulates like a pearl** (积气状如珠), also called *Lianhuo* (廉火, Refined Fire) entering and exiting the *Dantian* (丹田, Elixir Field)—**the qi reaching its root at the navel** (气至根脐), also known as *Taichu* (太初), *Taisu* (太素), *Taihe* (太和), *Taiyang* (太阳), *Hunting* (魂停), *Zhonghuang* (中黄), or *Taiwugong* (太悟公).\n\nThe *Taiyin* (太阴) governs **the Gate of All Marvels** (众妙之门), where life originates. If one is **sad or anxious, or fails to find joy** (悲忧不乐), the liver is harmed—**dimmed vision and premature graying** (目暝头白). **Cultivate the heart to nourish it** (思心以养之), and the illness shall heal.\n\nIf one **indulges excessively in pleasure** (淫乐), the kidneys are harmed—**lower back pain, heaviness in the body, pus or blood in urine or stool** (腰痛体重，大小便脓血). **Cultivate the liver to nourish it** (思肝以养之), and the affliction shall subside.\n\nIf one **overindulges in food or drink** (饮食醉饱), the spleen is injured. **Cultivate the lungs to nourish it** (思肺以养之). **Let the mother and child nourish each other** (当令母子相养), and the disease shall vanish.\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "The liver lies beneath the ribs, its hue like a male mandarin duck, with a crucible-like structure. Beneath it are six leaves, and the gallbladder rests within, green as a pouch, storing blood. Its tendons attach to the spine, beneath the nipple crucible. The spleen lies beneath the ribs, above the dancing diaphragm, its true form like molten gold, curving downward three to two inches.\n\nThe kidneys reside above the lumbar region, flanked by the spine, shaped like a nose, enveloped in yellow-white fat. Often, the kidneys appear dark, like black lacquer. To behold the dead and recoil at their form and stench—this harms the spirit. Exposure to foul odors weakens it; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Though foul odors may not be sensed, their essence lingers here. Harm arises from witnessing those bearing刑 wounds, fractures, or injuries. Anger or joy depletes the spirit of the lungs and liver; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Fear damages the spirit of the liver and gallbladder; observe their form and adjust accordingly. Excessive speech and overthinking dim the spirit; observe the heart’s form and adjust accordingly. Failure to harmonize yin and yang weakens the spirit of the kidneys; observe their form and adjust accordingly. The kidneys govern the genitals—when vision and hearing fail, this too is their responsibility.\n\nGrief harms the spirit of the spleen; observe its form and adjust accordingly. Always, at the crowing of the rooster, survey the organs once. In daylight’s leisure, examine them to discern what to nourish and what to avoid. Let strife remain clear. Question and observe the organs ten times daily. Treat and nourish all injuries until they heal. A hundred observations bring lifelong health; a thousand extend youth; ten thousand grant immortality.\n\nWithin the inner chamber, white qi rises like a rooster, luminous as the moon, illuminating all. Always, let this be preserved day and night. If you seek the Dao, godhood, and immortality, first eliminate the Three Vermin.\n\nThe *Fushe* (伏尸) lies beneath the heart, inhaling three hundred sixty breaths daily, absorbing qi thirty times per swallow, resting after ninety. Perform this four times daily. At midnight, crowing like a rooster, chant:\n*\"束方青牙, serve the Green Fang, drink with Morning Blossom—three swallows suffice.*\n*南方朱丹, serve the Vermilion Elixir, drink from the Crimson Pool—three swallows suffice.*\n*中央戊己, nourish the Vital Essence, drink from the Honeyed Spring—three swallows suffice.*\n*西方明石, consume the Luminous Stone, drink from the Sacred Flow—three swallows suffice.*\n*北方玄滋, ingest the Mystic Nourishment, drink from the Jade Congee—three swallows suffice.\"*\n\nFor thirty days, the three vermin shall die. The *Fushe* departs, and true qi settles. Once the vermin are subdued and no longer return to the heart, you shall manifest as a transcendent.\n\nSubdue the *Hun* (魂) and govern the *Po* (魄). Observe the red and white qi between the eyebrows like a rooster. From the brow, guide it down to the navel, transforming it into pure green. From the navel to the *Dantian* (丹田), transform it into pure white. Withdraw the abdomen three times, inhaling through the nose, drawing white qi up the spine in three parallel streams, rising from the *Jingguan* (项关) to the inner chamber. Retreat the brow inward three inches to reach the inner chamber.\n\nThe True Person of the *Taiji* (太极) consumes the elixirs of the Four Extremes and the Cloud Teeth of the Gods, making his divine light radiant within and his crimson brilliance manifest without. His body gleams like jade, and his qi moves with clarity. After seventeen years, the Four Extremes Elder descends upon you, and in union, you ascend on clouds, riding dragons, to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe *Xilianzi* (西梁子) received the Supreme Master’s oral instructions, passed down five times over a thousand years, not to be recklessly divulged. The Four Brightnesses’ methods follow the hidden scriptures. After five days of fasting, the precepts are授授, kneeling in blood oath to the teacher, encircling the five directions with golden rings, binding the disciple with patterned silk, and swearing an unbreakable covenant. The oral instructions are the Five Paired Rings. Additionally, five *liang* of green silk are used—this is the method of the *Xilian* people. The *Nanyue* (南岳) Lady’s *Yunque Jing* (云阙经) may also be used, though this text does not elaborate.\n\nAlways, at dawn, crowing like a rooster, sit in ease, strike the teeth nine times, then intone the incantation:\n*\"束方青牙, wreathed in purple clouds and flowing mists, three pure essences hover, frost and jade robes—consume the morning radiance, drink from the blossoming dawn.\"* After chanting, lick the outer edge of the upper lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Eastern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Green Truth, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"南方朱丹, radiant as the *Tawei*, nine paths of crimson bonds, scattering luminous splendor—consume the sacred dawn, drink from the Crimson Pool.\"* After chanting, lick the outer edge of the lower lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Southern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Vermilion Manifestation, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"西方明石, flying mists and golden elixirs—consume the Supreme Luminosity, the purity of the white essence, drink from the Sacred Constraint. Divine brilliance awakens the spirit, bearing me aloft on clouds, ascending to the lofty purity.\"* After chanting, lick the inner edge of the upper lip, collecting saliva to swallow thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Western Extremity Elder shall arrive, granting you the White Talisman of Might, and together you shall ascend.\n\nNext, intone:\n*\"北方玄滋, celebratory clouds awaken the congee, green mists spread at dawn, purple canopies and azure banners—consume the moon’s essence, drink from the Jade Congee.\"* After chanting, lick the inner edge of the lower lip, collecting saliva thirty times. Practice for ten years, and the Northern Extremity Elder shall arrive, bestowing upon you the Mystic Record of Brilliance, and together you shall ascend.\n\nFinally, intone:\n*\"戊己之元, yellow purity in five clouds, four mists of violet observation, eight scenes and nine celestial bodies, twin luminaries stirring radiance, seven divine stars—harmonizing essence to nourish qi, consume the Central Primordial, the dragon’s pearl, drink from the Honeyed Spring.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Once the chant is complete, with the tongue rinse the inner and outer *Xuanying* of the mouth, as well as the spaces between the teeth and tongue—both upper and lower, exterior and interior—until the saliva is gathered and swallowed thirty times in succession. After practicing for ten years, the Central Primordial Sovereign, the Yellow-Qi Divine Lord, shall descend, bestowing upon you the Yellow-Qi Yang-Essence, concealing the Heaven-Hidden Moon, and presenting the *Zhu Jing Lǜ Zhāng Qīng Yào Hǔ Shū*. Together, you shall ascend with the Five Elders in unity.\n\nThe *Yùjīng* Supreme Secret reveals the Dao of the Five Elders: abstain from grains and discard the corpse-like body, retaining youthful radiance, unperturbed by cold or heat, untouched by calamities or harm. Your spirit and qi shall be sharp and clear, extending life and adding years—reaching the limitless span. You shall obtain the Nine-Lined Jade Elixir and the Eight-Jade Flying Essence, thus uniting with the Two Scenes, aligning with Heaven and Earth in perfect harmony.\n\nAll Five Yin Chants must be recited with nine rhythmic tooth-strikings (*kòuchǐ*), which can be practiced diligently without waiting for the crowing of the rooster at dawn. In the stillness of midnight, when the body is pure and the mind serene, one may begin the practice.\n\nFor those who guard the *One*, if they hear this Dao, their practice shall swiftly succeed. With emptiness and simplicity filling within, guarding the Primordial and swallowing saliva—the True One—one seeks abundant fortune naturally. Cultivating the Dao with the Six Elixirs and Five Qis, the elixirs are already within; thus, it is said one seeks fortune by oneself.\n\nIn practicing this Dao, one must not consume dried meats. If hungry, eat *liú* (sprouted grains) gradually, reducing grains step by step—never abruptly ceasing in a single day. This is the principle of *\"reduce, reduce again, until reaching non-action.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao of *Xūyìng*—the natural law, taking Heaven and Earth’s essence from afar, and from the self, as it is said.\n\n**Wei Fu Ren’s Praise:**\n*\"Yúnchǐ\"* (Cloud Teeth) is the refined essence of the Five Elders, the misty radiance of the *Tàijí*. Thus, riding the descending luminosity, it fills the inner self. The Six Elixirs blend harmoniously, penetrating and resonating with the void, as myriad spirits descend. In the depths, they seek each other without summoning—thus, the dragon’s roar echoes in the marshes. Hence, the mists descend upon the peaks, and the tiger howls at the sacred mounds. The gale stirs the four directions, the sun’s mirror (*yángguì*) captures light, and the vermilion flames surge forth. At the rare *Hán yīn* (cold shadow), the dark currents overflow naturally, ascending without awareness. How much more so for the enlightened, who focus their hearts on the Mysterious and delve deeply into the Dao’s roots?\n\nImpurities are purged from the chest, while the true and pure reside in the Three Officials. Drawing the scattered radiance of the Five Dawns, consuming the Six Elixir’s misty nectar, invoking the Nine Heavens’ treasures, uttering the secrets of the Void’s marvels—Dragon-Light shines with dazzling brilliance. Tasting the Three Floras on pearly teeth, extracting the full saliva from the lips’ edge.\n\nInternally refining the Six Organs, opening clarity and sharpness, breathing the Heavenly Primordial, tempering the soul and spirit to perfect the form—dispelling the Dark to attain the Mysterious.\n\nAfter ten years of tranquil practice, the Five Spirits descend—what need for further praise?\n\nThough weak as a woman, I have undergone the Supreme Practices, my subtle voice fading into silence, unworthy of wide proclamation. I merely hint at its mysteries to share with kindred souls. If those who cultivate virtue fall short, let it not be blamed as ruinous.\n\n---\n**Unfolding the *Huángtíng Jīng* Secrets, the Pure and Clever Sage says:**\n*\"To cultivate the *Huángtíng Inner Classic*, one must follow the Imperial Lord’s宝神混化玄真 Dao. After completing the rites and chants, sit upright facing east, gazing straight ahead, visualizing the form’s length and color, calling its name, and returning it to its original palace. Without this method, even if recited ten thousand times, the true spirit will not be guarded, and no response will manifest. It only drains qi and exhausts the spirit, benefiting neither lifespan nor vitality.\n\nWhen copying the scripture to share, always taste the Mysterious Void, savoring the numinous sounds. Read it three times, then retire in purity, with deep faith in the True. Renew your devotion daily, surrendering to the Dao, extinguishing all distinctions. Walk the transformation without fear, revering the True. Merely preserve the Five Zang’s spirits and forms—unaware of the full count—until the Dragon Chariot arrives, the Most High appears. Who says the distant world lacks such beings?\n\nMorning and evening, rinse and purify. Entering the chamber, advance with the right foot first, burn incense, and bow twice, kneeling to say: *\"Respectfully, I open to the Great Emperor of *Fúshāng*, the Divine King of *Yánggǔ*, [name], as I read the *Inner Scene Jade Classic*, preserving the Five Zang’s blossoms, and the spirit ascends with the Dragon.\"*\n\nAgain, face north and bow twice, kneeling to say: *\"Respectfully, I open to the Supreme Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord. [Name] reads the *Inner Scene Jade Classic*, beseeching ascent to the Dragon Plow and feasting in *Zǐqīng*.\"*\n\nReturning to face forward, bind the scripture and read it three times, preserving the spirit and form. Sit levelly, gazing straight ahead, striking the teeth thirty-six times, then still.\n\n**The Divine Spirits:**\nThe *Brain Spirit* (精根), named *Níwán*, length two inches and one fen.\nThe *Eye Spirit* (明上), named *Yīngxuán*, length three inches.\nThe *Nose Spirit* (玉垄), named *Língjiān*, length two inches and five fen.\nThe *Ear Spirit* (空闲), named *Yōutián*, length three inches and one fen.\nThe *Tongue Spirit* (通命), named *Zhènglún*, length three inches and six fen.\nThe *Tooth Spirit* (胖峰), named *Luōqiān*, length one inch and five fen.\n\nThese seven spirits of the face wear purple robes with embroidered skirts, all in the form of infants. Visualize them clearly, arranged in order, each returning to its palace.\n\nUpon completion, strike the teeth twenty times, swallow the breath twelve times, and recite:\n*\"The Seven Sources disperse the qi, gathering it to form the spirit. Distinguishing front and back, circling the *Níwán*, supporting each other above and below, the Seven Spirits spread out, their forms shifting and evading. Nourished by the Primordial Floras, guiding the Eight Spirits, they surge upward through the Cavern Gate, guarding the body and containing the scenes, ascending to the Imperial Dawn.\"*\n\nNext, meditate:\nThe *Heart Spirit* (丹元), named *Shǒuhún*, length nine inches, wearing crimson brocade and a skirt.\nThe *Lung Spirit* (皓华), named *Xūchéng*, length eight inches, in white robes with a sash.\nThe *Liver Spirit* (龙姻), named *Hánmíng*, length six inches and two fen, in green brocade robes.\nThe *Kidney Spirit* (玄冥), named *Yùyīng*, length three inches and six fen.\"»",
