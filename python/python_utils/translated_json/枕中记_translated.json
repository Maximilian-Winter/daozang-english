  "full_translation": "*The Pillow Record*\n\n*The Pillow Record* is a text of unknown authorship, comprising one scroll. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the \"Methods\" category of the *Dongshen* section. Collated versions include the *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*. A portion of this work is also included in scroll thirty-three of Sun Simiao’s *Pillow Prescriptions for Nurturing Life* in the same collection.\n\nThose who govern the body yet lack reverent fear will be shunned by friends;\nThose who govern the household yet lack reverent fear will be disdained by servants;\nThose who govern the state yet lack reverent fear will be betrayed by neighboring lands;\nThose who govern the realm yet lack reverent fear will lose the Dao and its virtue.\n\nThus, reverent fear is the gate of life and death, the master of ritual and teaching, the cause of survival and ruin, the root of fortune and misfortune, the origin of good and ill. Therefore:\nScholars without reverent fear cannot establish their name;\nFarmers without reverent fear cannot cultivate their crops;\nArtisans without reverent fear cannot set their compass and square;\nMerchants without reverent fear cannot amass their wealth;\nChildren without reverent fear cannot fulfill filial piety;\nFathers without reverent fear cannot manifest kindness;\nMinisters without reverent fear cannot fulfill their duties;\nRulers without reverent fear cannot secure their realm.\n\nThus, those who nurture life, if they lose reverent fear, will find their minds disordered and ungoverned, their bodies restless and unsettled, their spirits scattered and qi dispersed, their wills adrift and intentions muddled. What should live will die; what should endure will perish; what should succeed will fail; what should prosper will meet misfortune.\n\nReverent fear is like water and fire—it must never be forgotten for even a moment. Without reverent fear, one’s children and younger brothers become adversaries, and wives and concubines turn into enemies. Therefore, the highest reverence is for the Dao; next, for Heaven; then, for things; then, for others; and finally, for oneself. Thus:\nHe who fears for himself is not constrained by others;\nHe who is wary of himself is not controlled by others;\nHe who is cautious in small matters is not daunted by great ones;\nHe who is vigilant in near matters does not regret distant ones.\n\nThose who understand this cannot be harmed by dragons in water or tigers and rhinoceroses on land; they are untouched by weapons, unassailed by illness, unslandered by slanderers, and unharmed by venom. Those who truly grasp this have mastered all things.\n\nMost illnesses and premature deaths arise from diet. The harm of diet exceeds that of sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures may be abstained from for years, but diet cannot be abandoned for even a day. Though it brings great benefit, it also poses grave harm. Among the myriad flavors, some clash in their qi and potency; violating their prohibitions turns them into subtle poisons. Slowly, they accumulate into chronic illness; swiftly, they bring sudden disaster.\n\nFrom the summer solstice to the autumn equinox, avoid all rich, greasy, and hard foods, for these conflict with wine, congee, melons, and fruits. Though illness may not appear immediately, the shift of autumn often brings violent fluxes—all due to excessive cooling and dietary immoderation in summer. Yet some mistake the day of illness for its onset, unaware of its gradual accumulation. Those who wish to be prudent must exercise caution in the slightest matters.\n\nFor those who nurture life:\nThink little, contemplate little, desire little, engage in few affairs, speak little, laugh little, grieve little, rejoice little, delight little, rage little, favor little, loathe little. Practicing these twelve \"littles\" is the essence of nurturing life.\nExcessive thought wearies the spirit; excessive contemplation scatters the will; excessive desire harms wisdom; excessive affairs exhaust the body; excessive speech provokes qi; excessive laughter injures the organs; excessive grief oppresses the heart; excessive joy overflows the intent; excessive delight leads to confusion and error; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive favor leads to obsession and disorder; excessive loathing brings emaciation and sorrow. These twelve \"excesses\" are the root of life’s ruin. Only those who neither lack nor overindulge approach the Dao.\n\nThus, recluses suffer few illnesses, while wanderers endure many afflictions—due to the simplicity or complexity of their affairs. Farmers live long, while the noble and wealthy die young—proof of the fewness or excess of their desires. The common folk vie for profit, while Daoists seldom scheme. Ordinary people cannot be without desires or affairs, but by harmonizing the mind, restraining thoughts, calming the body, and reducing cares, these gradually subside.\n\nFeng Junda said: \"The body should always be active, but not to exhaustion; the diet should always be light, but not to the point of emptiness. Regularly avoid rich wines and reduce salt and sour flavors. Curb thoughts, temper joy and anger, abandon reckless pursuits, and be prudent in the bedchamber. In spring and summer, release and discharge; in autumn and winter, store and preserve essence.\" Moreover, raw fish, raw meat, and all cold, fishy foods often harm people—it is best to abstain from them entirely, for great good lies therein.\n\nKeep the heart ever inclined toward goodness, and do not scheme or deceive—this greatly dishonors the spirit and shortens life.\n\nPeng Zu said: \"Heavy clothing and thick bedding make the body unable to endure hardship, leading to wind and cold illnesses; rich flavors, dried meats, and excessive feasting breed hernial and intestinal diseases; beautiful women and alluring concubines bring the calamity of depletion; lewd sounds and mournful music bewitch the heart and ears, leading to dissipation; galloping and hunting in the wilds result in madness; scheming for victory, seizing the weak, and exploiting disorder lead to the downfall of arrogance and indulgence.\" These are the warnings of sages against losing principle—one cannot but reflect on them to admonish oneself.\n\nThe Dao of nurturing life:\nDo not walk, sit, listen, or gaze for too long. Do not force eating or drinking, nor indulge in sorrow, grief, or anxiety. Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty. After eating, walk several hundred steps—greatly beneficial. Do not eat at night; if you must, walk five or six *li* afterward to avoid illness. Always engage in some activity day and night, without ceasing, but do not exhaust yourself. Neither should you be too idle, doing nothing at all.\n\nThus it is said: \"Flowing water does not stagnate, a door hinge does not rot—because they move without ceasing.\" The *Xiang’er* states: \"Do not contend with others over right and wrong; instead, call upon the longevity of others.\" If the body is unwell, turn the tongue to block the throat, rinse with saliva, and swallow repeatedly—soon it will be cured. When Daoists fall ill, they close their eyes and look inward, using the heart to generate fire to burn the body completely, preserving it until their essence appears like dewdrops on a topknot—then they recover. If there is pain in any part, visualize the fire burning it—this is a secret and effective method.\n\n**Prohibitions and Taboos**\nOn *jiǎyín* and *gēngshēn* days, when corpse-ghosts vie in chaos and the spirit is restless and defiled, one must not share a mat, speak, or meet face-to-face with a spouse. One must bathe in purity and remain vigilant, avoiding sleep. These days are suitable for expelling desire.\n\nWhen taking medicinal substances, avoid garlic, pomegranates, animal liver, dog meat, and pork; celibacy is best. When ingesting divine medicines, never face north—this is a great taboo. On *hài* and *zǐ* days, do not spit, lest one lose essence and qi, harming one’s lifespan.\n\nWhen entering mountains, before reaching a hundred paces from the mountain, first retreat a hundred paces, then turn and ascend—thus mountain spirits dare not harm you, all evil flees, and every poison hides.\n\nWhen taking medicines, avoid bloody flavors, lest the Three Corpses remain. Those seeking immortality must not see corpses—this is greatly inauspicious. Also, avoid residing with women during the third and first months—this is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Avoidances and Taboos**\nDo not sleep on a *jiǎzǐ* night in winter. Those seeking immortality must avoid the Ten Failings: first, do not indulge in lust; second, do not commit hidden cruelty or evil; third, do not become drunk; fourth, do not be filthy, lazy, or contentious; fifth, do not eat the meat of your parents’ birth signs; sixth, do not eat the meat of your own birth sign; seventh, do not eat any meat; eighth, do not consume pungent, greasy, or the Five Acrids; ninth, do not kill any insects or living beings; tenth, do not urinate or defecate facing north, nor gaze upward at the Three Luminaries.\n\nDo not face north when undressing, nor curse or destroy things facing north. Do not offend the sun, moon, or stars. Do not mete out punishments on the Eight Nodal Days. Do not rage on the first and last days of the lunar month. Do not eat scaled creatures on *liùjiǎ* days. Do not eat parrot meat on *bǐngshēn* days. Do not eat pheasant meat on *bǐngwǔ* days. Do not become greatly drunk on *yǐmǎo* days. Do not eat fish on the ninth day of the second month. Do not eat organ meats or the hearts of grasses on the third day of the third month. Do not cut down plants on the eighth day of the fourth month. Do not see blood on the fifth day of the fifth month. Do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month. Do not dwell on evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month. Do not purchase creatures with attached limbs on the eighth day of the eighth month. Do not gather reeds or mats on the ninth day of the ninth month. Do not punish or reproach others on the fifth day of the tenth month. Do not bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Do not fail to fast, burn incense, or recite the Dao within the last three days of the twelfth month.\n\nThese taboos are the great prohibitions of heaven and humanity, observed and examined by the Three Officials. Violating them on these days is a grave offense, causing the Three Hun to sicken one another, the Seven Po to vie in chaos, or the Womb Spirit to be offended—times when the Three Palaces receive evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, demons exploit one’s unguarded moments, essence and fluids are violated, and the divine spirits grow distracted, leading to many transgressions and prohibitions. Those who truly understand these taboos and abide by them will become immortal talents; those who defy the heavenly prohibitions will suffer harm and defeat.\n\nThe great gods of the heavenly offices forbid consuming raw blood, burning the fur of the Six Livestock, or burning garlic skins and various smoked vegetables—all of which disrupt the Womb Origin and offend the Infant Spirit. Beware!\n\nFor all Daoist practitioners, do not pass on clothing, shoes, headscarves, or coarse garments—this is greatly inauspicious.\n\nDo not attend funerals or approach corpses to avoid defilement by impurity. If there are those who revere the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons, do not dwell in their chambers, partake of their offerings, wear their clothes, or don their headscarves. This is to evade the foul vapors of death and distance oneself from the passage of perverse winds. For all Daoist practitioners, do not hold infants—a great taboo among immortals.\n\nOn the eight seasonal nodes, do not mingle with others; this is to focus the spirit in pursuit of the subtle. Avoid treading upon filth, and always burn incense and bathe frequently. Those who violate these precepts will wither and fail; those who heed them will ascend in flight.\n\nThough the inner defense of the Yin Elixir in the bedchamber, the benefits of the Yellow Way and Red Qi in union, the essentials of seven-nine morning refinement through breath and essence, and the method of Six-One Reverted Elixir with its yin-yang pairing may earn one the name of immortal, the Upper Clarity does not deem them comparable to virtue. Though they may achieve transformation, the Most High does not regard them as noble—these are the impure immortals and turbid perfected, forever barred from gazing upon the Jade Gates. Truly, treading treacherous paths and skating on thin ice often ends in overturned chariots; even those who survive whole remain but foul and disordered earthbound immortals.\n\nThose who establish resolve in inner cultivation, nurture the spirit, and seek immortality must bathe frequently to invite the numinous qi. For Daoist practitioners, every matter should be kept secret—reveal even a single word or deed, and one’s allotted span is diminished by a reckoning. A reckoning is three days.\n\nWhen offering morning prayers, do not wear cold or mixed clothing. Upon entering or leaving a quiet chamber, rinse the mouth with water. When burning incense, exit the chamber and do not look back. When swallowing saliva, always close the eyes and turn the gaze inward. When writing talismans or scriptures, face north, keep brush and inkstone separate, and first burn incense.\n\nIf suddenly hearing cries, wails, the sound of rushing water, thunder, drums, or if smelling foul odors or the stench of blood in the nose, these are all ominous signs. Immediately burn incense, bathe, and observe abstinence for three days, invoking the Three Primordial Sovereigns to seek protection.\n\nPractice hidden virtue: do what others cannot, undertake what others will not, pity the orphaned and destitute, rescue those in peril, and support the fallen—then all evils will vanish of themselves. When purchasing medicinal substances, do not haggle over price; buy from elders or virtuous persons, and avoid those who gossip or envy.\n\nJoy and anger harm resolve; sorrow and anxiety damage nature. Infatuation with glory and splendor deludes virtue; the exhaustion of yin and yang depletes essence—all are great taboos in Daoist practice and abhorred by immortal methods. Care for clothing and bedding as one would ordinarily, and always burn incense to keep them pure and untainted.\n\nThose who cultivate the true must be free from the stirrings of desire and thoughts of male and female. If the White Elixir resides within the breast, the true will not respond, and the numinous maidens and exalted ones will not descend. Even if one gains something, it will be no more than an earthbound master. Those who engage with yin qi can never attain the supreme Dao.\n\nI once deeply regretted this, but fortunately corrected it swiftly. Thus, know that the true Dao cannot be sought in opposition, and essential words cannot be heard in passing. Take heed! Take heed!\n\n**Daoist Breathing and Guiding Methods**\n\n**Guiding and Pulling Method**\nRegularly rub the face with both hands to give it a lustrous glow and prevent wrinkles and blemishes. Practicing this for five years will restore a youthful complexion like that of a maiden.\n\nUpon rising or retiring, sit upright and calm the breath. First, clasp the hands and cover the nape, then tilt the head back to gaze upward, causing the nape and hands to strain against each other. Repeat this three or four times to harmonize essence and circulate blood, preventing wind and qi from entering. With long practice, one will remain free from illness.\n\nNext, bend and stretch the four limbs, arch the back, twist the sides, and rotate all joints—each movement performed three times.\n\nBefore rising or after lying down, use a towel or thick cloth to wipe the nape, ears, and surrounding areas until they grow warm. Then, stroke the nape along the hairline for a long while, and rub the hands to massage the face and eyes. With prolonged practice, the eyes will grow bright, and noxious qi will not invade.\n\nAfter completing these steps, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids. Frequently press the ears on both sides without counting, ensuring they do not grow deaf, and the nose does not become blocked.\n\nAt the time when vital qi is born (just after midnight), swallow saliva twenty-one times, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize. Then, press any painful areas of the body. During seated practice, always close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and six bowels. With long practice, they will become distinctly clear.\n\nRegularly press the inner corners of both eyes near the nose, holding the breath until qi flows through, then repeat. With consistent practice, one may see clearly for a thousand miles.\n\nPress the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times, then rub the face above the eyes with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times—these actions have no fixed count or timing.\n\nFinally, stroke the forehead thirty-nine times with the hands, beginning between the eyebrows and moving upward into the hairline. Swallow saliva repeatedly from the corners of the mouth. With regular practice, the eyes will grow clear and bright, and within a year, one may read by night. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum without describing its form—excellent indeed.\n\n**Breathing Method**\nFor those seeking immortality, there are three great methods: first, preserving essence; second, circulating qi; and third, ingesting elixirs. These three progress from shallow to deep, and without encountering a perfected master or enduring diligent effort, they cannot be swiftly understood.\n\nThe techniques for preserving essence number nearly a hundred, while methods for circulating qi reach into the thousands. The formulas for ingesting elixirs comprise roughly ten types, all requiring unceasing effort.\n\nThus, circulating qi can cure a hundred illnesses, ward off pestilence, subdue snakes and beasts, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow one to dwell underwater, stave off hunger and thirst, and prolong life. Its essential principle is *embryonic breathing*. Embryonic breathing means no longer inhaling or exhaling through the mouth or nose, as if within the womb—when this is achieved, the Dao is attained.\n\nThose skilled in using qi can exhale upon water to make it flow backward, exhale upon fire to extinguish its flames, exhale upon insects and leopards to make them submit, and exhale upon wounds to stop pain and bleeding. If one hears of someone bitten by a venomous creature, even unseen, one may exhale a spell upon the hand—left for men, right for women—and though they be a thousand miles away, they will immediately recover. For sudden illnesses or malevolent afflictions, swallowing qi thirty-nine times will cure them instantly. Yet most people are restless by nature and seldom cultivate stillness to contemplate the Way.\n\nThe method for circulating qi requires a secluded room with closed doors, a soft mat, and a pillow two and a half inches high. Lie flat on the back, close the eyes, and hold the breath within the chest and diaphragm. Place a goose feather over the nose and mouth—if it remains motionless for three hundred breaths, the ears will hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, and the mind think nothing. This is gradually achieved.\n\nIf one consumes raw or cold foods, the five pungent vegetables, fish, or meat, or indulges in joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety while practicing qi circulation, not only will there be no benefit, but it will aggravate qi disorders, causing counterflow and coughing. One cannot suddenly hold the breath for long; it must be learned gradually. Begin with three, five, seven, or nine breaths before exhaling, then increase the count. Twelve breaths without exhaling is a minor attainment; one hundred twenty breaths is a major attainment. One hundred twenty breaths without exhaling can cure illness—direct the intention to the afflicted area: for headaches, focus on the head; for foot pain, focus on the feet. To heal, guide harmonious qi to attack the ailment, and it will dissipate from moment to moment. This is the great essential of healing the body.\n\nWhen circulating qi, always do so after midnight when vital qi is born. Hold the breath and count silently in the mind until the ears hear nothing. To avoid miscounting, use fingers or counting rods. Reaching a thousand breaths brings one close to immortality.\n\nWhen exhaling, always take in more and release less, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. If the weather is heavily foggy, fiercely windy, or bitterly cold, do not practice qi circulation—simply hold the breath. This is the essential subtlety.\n\nPeng Zu said: The supreme Dao is not burdensome; merely refrain from thinking of anything, and the mind will not labor. Furthermore, practice guiding and pulling, circulate qi without ceasing, and one may attain a thousand years. By ingesting golden elixirs and superior medicines, one may become imperishable for all time. Fast and purify the body, visualize the sun and moon within the mouth—store the sun by day and the moon by night.\n\n**Ingesting Medicines Method**\nAmong the myriad formulas for ingesting medicines, most are verbose and difficult to grasp. Here, I have selected several dozen proven methods from my studies to supplement what is lacking. The great elixirs and unproven medicines are not discussed here.\n\nFor those wishing to ingest medicines, begin with herbs, then proceed to woods, and finally to minerals—this is the general progression of medicines, moving from refined to coarse, ascending from shallow to deep. From youth to adulthood, the body is accustomed to the five grains, which cannot be abandoned in a single day. Medicines provide gradual and subtle benefits, lacking the immediate satiation of food. Only through unceasing accumulation will the bones and marrow become filled, and the five grains will naturally be forsaken.\n\nAmong the five grains, barley is the finest, for it does not perish even in the depths of winter and thus may be consumed. Next is the acorn, neither fruit nor grain yet most beneficial to man. For those who have not yet succeeded in forsaking grains, eating it is excellent—it receives qi though it has none, receives flavor though it has none, dissolves drink and arrests dysentery, and strengthens the body without exhaustion. Next are jujubes and chestnuts, which are also fine.\n\n**Method for Constantly Ingesting While Forsaking Grains**\nFive *jin* of poria powder\nFive *jin* of raw chestnut powder\nFive *jin* of sesame, steamed and sun-dried nine times, then ground\n\nTake these three ingredients. First, boil five *dou* of large, plump dried jujubes in one *shi* of water until half the liquid remains, then grind and strain them until the skins and pits are thoroughly cold. Add another *dou* of water to wash the sweetness from the skins and pits, ensuring none is left. Simmer over a low flame until it thickens like syrup, then cool it and mix it with the other ingredients. Pound ten thousand times, seal tightly, and gradually ingest as a substitute for meals. Even if one does not eat, this does not hinder the ingestion of great medicines.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake asparagus, remove the heart and skin, grind it into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily. Whether among men or in the mountains, never cease this practice, for the longer it is done, the better. It may also be fermented into wine and consumed, treating lumps, accumulations, wind, madness, and convulsions, expelling the three worms and hidden corpses, eliminating sores, damp impediment, and numbness, lightening the body, augmenting qi, and rendering one free from hunger. After a hundred days, it restores youth and reverses aging; the earlier one begins, the better. Plant yams abundantly in good soil and steam them as a substitute for grains—this is highly effective.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Medicines Alongside Poria as a Substitute for All Foods**\nTake five *jin* of poria, process it cold, pound it, and sift. Mix with three *sheng* of white honey and place in a bronze vessel, then steam it in a double boiler, stirring frequently. If no bronze vessel is available, a fine porcelain one will also suffice. When the honey is dry, remove it and pound thirty thousand times. Take thirty pills the size of *wutong* seeds once daily, three times a day. After a hundred days, a hundred illnesses will be dispelled; after two hundred days, one will see in the dark; after two years, one will command ghosts; after four years, jade maidens will attend.\n\nWhen compounding immortal medicines, first purify oneself for three days. Simmer the medicine in a secluded place, allowing no humans or animals to see it. Only the one preparing the medicine should oversee it, covering the vessel with wood and keeping it concealed. Use only cool wood for the fire, tend it with care, and prepare as much as desired. Once the medicine is complete, store it in a sealed vessel—it will not spoil for ten thousand years.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake three *dou* of sesame, whether yellow or black, carefully select and clean it, then lightly roast it in a cauldron until fragrant. Grind it finely and sift. Mix with three *sheng* of white honey, simmer as in the poria method, and pound thirty thousand times. Take thirty pills the size of *wutong* seeds at dawn. When one dose is finished, the intestines will transform into sinews. These two methods differ slightly from common formulas. Those who are young should ingest poria, while those over forty should take sesame. Generally, poria treats the young, and sesame nourishes the old; the two may also be combined, doubling the honey and simmering them together into pills. This serves both old and young, eliminating the need for separate preparations.\n\n**Great Method for Ingesting to Attain Longevity**\nWhen ingesting medicines, first take herbal medicines until one feels their power, then proceed to mineral medicines. Medicines have their sequences—what is meant by \"a hairsbreadth’s deviation leads to a thousand *li*’s error.\" Only then may one ingest elixirs without harm.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Oil**\nWhen preparing to ingest divine medicines or mica, first consume this. Take one *dou* of sesame oil and three *jin* of wild rice stems, cut them, and place them in the oil. Simmer over a low flame until the stems turn black and charred, then remove the dregs and mix with wine. Take half a *sheng* warm, twice daily, or three *ge*. After a hundred days, the blood and vessels will be abundant; after a year, one may ingest medicines.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Sesame**\nTwo *dou* of sesame\nOne *dou* of soybeans\n\nRoast each until fragrant, then grind the soybean paste and sift. Take five *ge* three times daily, washing it down with broth or mixing it with honey. Take a piece the size of a pigeon’s egg four times daily. Gradually, one will cease to hunger, then ingest the Four Stabilizers to supplement deficiency and taxation.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Mica**\nThe *Bencao* states: Mica is a superior medicine, sweet in flavor, non-toxic, and balanced. It governs the descent of qi, firms the flesh, augments essence, removes dead skin and muscle, treats wind-cold and heat evil qi, brightens the eyes, stabilizes the five viscera, and endures cold and heat. With prolonged ingestion, one’s aspirations will soar, aging will cease, and one will attain longevity and transcendence. It grows in the stone crevices of Qiyun Mountain and the northern Ding Mountain of Langye, and is harvested in the second month. Water plantain serves as its assistant; it fears turtle shells and dew.\n\nMica has eight varieties, each with distinct names. Observe them facing the sun to distinguish them:\n- That which is yellow-white with much green is called *yunying*. Ingest it in spring to lighten the body, enter water without cold, and extend life by four thousand years.\n- That which is green-yellow, radiant, and mostly red is called *yunzhu*. Ingest it in summer to lighten the body, endure cold and heat, and extend life by three thousand years.\n- That which resembles ice and snow, now yellow, now white, is called *xuesha*. Ingest it in late summer to lighten the body, emit light, endure wind and cold, and extend life by two thousand years.\n- That which is yellow-white and crystalline is called *yunguang*. Ingest it in autumn to strengthen the sinews and bones, unblock the channels and vessels, and extend life by one thousand years.\n- That which is green-white with much black is called *linshi*. Ingest it in winter to lighten the body and enter fire without burning.\n- That which possesses all five colors is called *yunmu* and may be ingested in all seasons.\n- That which is mixed with black and toughens the flesh grows among copper and iron and is called *dizhong*—it must not be ingested, for it harms life.\n- That which is red and heavy is called *yangqishi*, the root of the five clouds. It is used separately in medicines and must not be ingested.\n\nAll mica, when one *cun* thick, has one thousand eight hundred layers. When buried with sand and soil, the finest quality will grow naturally in a basin placed in a shady spot over months and years.\n\n**Refinement Method**\n\nThinly peel away the sand and soil, then soak in flowing water for several days. Pound and split it, then rinse in water a hundred times or more, washing thoroughly until pure. Use it promptly or store it as needed.\n\nFor delayed use, soak it in water collected from the long-term leaks of a thatched roof in a white ceramic vessel during the fifth month, and let it steep for a hundred days before straining. If any water scum remains, rinse again with flowing water several times, then strain and dry. The fine, floating particles should be collected in a separate vessel.\n\nIn the eighth month, take new cloth, with two people each holding one end—or strike a bamboo pole—then brush it over mountain grasses to gather dew. Squeeze the cloth to extract the juice, and continue until the mica is fully submerged. If insufficient, gather more dew to soak it. After fifty or sixty days of steeping, it may be used. Store it in a warm place, avoiding cold or frost.\n\nTo make powder: dry the mica, then place it in a tanned leather pouch and vigorously knead it by hand from dawn until noon. Sift the fine powder through silk, then knead the remaining residue again until fully processed. If still not fine enough, examine it with your fingers—if uneven, mix it with a small amount of water in a large wooden basin to form a paste. After a while, rinse with water and strain through fine silk. Repeat the process with the residue until fully refined, then allow it to settle.\n\nAlternatively, after kneading, sift through coarse silk or linen, then grind in a dry white basin and strain through silk as before. Another method: first grind, then strain through silk, dry, place in a leather pouch, and sift through fine silk. It may also be steeped in dew for a hundred days, then dried, pounded, and placed in a pouch to rinse in water, collecting the liquid and allowing it to settle before refining.\n\nAll such methods yield powder as fine as felt, smooth to the touch like silk, and lustrous—this is best. If still not pure, boil the powder in dew until it bubbles, then dry and pound it in a mortar, sifting again through silk.\n\nFor immediate use: after rinsing, thinly peel the mica, place it in a silk pouch, and immerse it in boiling water. Remove and cool in cold water, then repeat—dipping in hot water and cooling in cold—ten times, changing the water each time until the mica softens. Remove, dry in the sun, then press in a leather pouch to form powder.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Mica from Wei Shuqing’s *Jade Cabinet Plain Book***\nTake one *jin* of mica with all five colors, finely peel it, and soak it for a hundred days in water from a long-standing thatched roof or dew gathered from autumn grasses. Place it in a leather pouch, pound it, sift through silk, and store it in a bamboo tube, sealing the opening. Suspend it beneath steamed rice, with one *dan* of white sand layered on top, and steam for a day and night. When the steam permeates, remove it, then add one *dan* of glutinous and non-glutinous rice, steaming for another day. Repeat: steam for a day and night, let the steam permeate, remove the rice, and add another *dan* of fresh glutinous and non-glutinous rice, steaming until the steam permeates again. Then remove the mica, mix it with one *sheng* of white honey in a copper vessel, and simmer over a gentle heat until it can be formed into pills the size of sesame seeds.\n\nTake two pills when the stars appear, continuing for thirty to fifty days. Increase to three pills the size of *wutong* seeds, taking one at the call of the parrot each morning. After thirty days, the body will feel light and the eyes bright. After fifty days, the abdomen will itch. After seventy days, the three worms and corpse parasites will depart. After eighty days, the skin will become lustrous. After ninety days, one may enter water and fire without harm. After a hundred days, the sinews and bones will transform. After three hundred days, one will run as swiftly as a galloping horse. After a year, one will become a perfected person. It is also said that those over seventy must practice for four hundred days before attaining immortality.\n\nThis is the method for one *jin*; for greater quantities, increase proportionally. Some say two *jin*, others three.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake ten *jin* of cinnamon, peel and retain three *jin*, then pound and sift. Take four *jin* of green onion stalks, thoroughly pound them, and wring out the juice through cloth to mix with the cinnamon powder. Place the mixture in a fresh bamboo tube, seal the opening with a wooden lid, and suspend it to steam. Add five *dou* of glutinous rice below, and when the rice is cooked, it will turn to water. Then add one *jin* of mica powder, and after a day, it will also dissolve into water. Take a small spoonful, three times daily. After thirty days, one’s appearance will resemble that of a child.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake one *jin* of mica powder and one *jin* of white saltpeter, pound and sift them, then mix with three *sheng* of white honey. Place the mixture in a fresh bamboo tube, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it beneath a northern wall. After thirty days, remove it and store it in a copper vessel—it will gradually liquefy like water or wine. After twenty days of ingestion, the body will radiate light. After thirty days, dew will not cling to the body. After fifty days, fire will not harm it. After a hundred days, one will become an immortal.\n\n**Jade-Dissolving Method**\nTake one *jin* of fine jade, grind it into powder, and place it in mica-infused water. After ten days, it will dissolve, and half a *jin* may be ingested. All stone fragments placed within will dissolve, not just jade.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake one *jin* of mica powder and one *jin* of saltpeter, pound them into a paste, place in a jar, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it in damp earth at a depth of three *chi*, or suspend it in a well for ten days until it liquefies. Take a small spoonful three times daily, gradually increasing the dose.\n\n**Reversing Aging and Restoring Youth, Making the Body Radiant and Lustrous**\nI have tested these three methods, and all have proven effective.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Realgar**\nThe *Materia Medica* states: Realgar is bitter and sweet in flavor, neutral to greatly warming in nature, and toxic. It governs cold-heat rat fistula, malignant sores, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, necrotic flesh, scabies, mites, and ulcers; eye pain; nasal polyps; severed sinews and broken bones; severe wind in all joints; accumulations, gatherings, and conglomerations of *qi*; sudden afflictions with abdominal pain; ghostly infestations; and kills essence-devouring entities, malevolent ghosts, perverse *qi*, and the poisons of a hundred insects. It overcomes the five weapons, slays the poisons of all serpents and insects, and imparts a lustrous glow to the face. When refined and ingested, it lightens the body; immortals who consume it all find it ascending into the brain, surpassing ghosts and spirits, prolonging years and extending life, preserving the center and eliminating hunger.\n\nIn the days when the Master of Embracing Simplicity and Tao Hongjing dwelled south of the Yangtze, realgar was valued as highly as gold. When compounding great elixirs, they sought it in vain. Since ancient times, all the sages and immortals have lamented the scarcity of this substance, fearing their Dao could not be perfected in time—how much more so for these two worthies! In my youth, I aspired to the Dao, but only in maturity did I learn the methods. Yearning for this medicine, I devoted a year to quieting my mind and practicing ingestion.\n\nDuring the Zhenguan era, I traveled to Mount Emei and purchased over forty *jin* of Wudu realgar. The pieces were extraordinarily large, their brilliance and hue dazzling—unseen since antiquity. Without the favor of sagely virtue, how could such a treasure be obtained? Upon seeing this medicine, I felt my four limbs grow light and buoyant, as if I could ascend the clouds. Having encountered this divine substance in a sagely age, I urge those of like mind to hasten and employ it!\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: Among all stones, only cinnabar and realgar are supreme. The methods for refining and ingesting them are not difficult; they should be diligently pursued. This is the essential medicine for transcending the world, second only to the Great Elixir—all other ingested medicines fall short of it. Yet those who are sated with food and drink cannot believe in it.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Realgar**\nTake realgar powder, refine it by sublimation to obtain the \"flower,\" steam it for several days, and form pills with white honey. Ingest a pill the size of a bullet thrice daily, gradually reducing the dose. This expels the three worms and grants longevity. Blending it with refined pine resin is excellent. One may prepare a large quantity, not limited to two *jin*. Sublime it in an earthenware cauldron.\n\n**Another Method**\n\n**Another Method**\nTake realgar powder, blend it with clear wine, steam it, then form pills with white honey. Ingesting realgar ensures that tigers, wolves, and all poisons dare not approach; entering water repels dragons and serpents; it wards off weapons, all gu toxins, and malevolent spirits. The heart becomes enlightened, the eyes bright, and one exudes awe-inspiring might.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake equal parts realgar and mercury, grind them thoroughly together, place them in a bronze vessel, and steam for three days and nights until they transform into liquid. If not fully liquefied, steam again, repeatedly removing and replacing them. Warm them over charcoal fire, repeatedly turning, until they turn purple. Form pills with white honey, ingesting three the size of sesame seeds thrice daily. After a thousand days, one attains spiritual communion.\n\n**Another Method**\nBlend realgar with refined pine resin, forming pills the size of small beans. Ingest two daily. After ten days, the three worms descend; after twenty days, all illnesses are cured; after a hundred days, one attains spiritual communion.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Realgar must be sourced from Wudu Mountain, pure and unadulterated, its color a radiant crimson like a parrot’s crest, gleaming brilliantly—only this may be used. That which is merely pure yellow, resembling orpiment and lacking luster, is unfit for immortal elixirs and may only be used in medicinal compounds for treating illnesses. Methods for ingesting it include steaming or boiling, blending with wine, dissolving with nitre into liquid then solidifying, wrapping in pig’s bladder and steaming beneath red earth, or mixing with pine resin. Alternatively, refining it like *fawu* and drawing it into ice-like threads on cloth—all these methods grant longevity, cure all diseases, expel the three corpses, erase scars, turn white hair black, regrow fallen teeth. After a thousand days, jade maidens will attend you, ready to be commanded to summon provisions. Moreover, jade maidens always bear a yellow jade mark, the size of a millet grain, upon their noses—this is the true sign. Those without such marks are ghosts testing mortals. I have previously ingested this and witnessed it firsthand.\n\n**True Man’s Formula for Grain-Immortal Pills (also called Worm-Restraining Pills)**\nThose who study the Dao of immortality should first ingest this to fortify bones and sinews, halt aging and restore youth, and make the body radiate extraordinary light. With prolonged ingestion, one attains transcendence. In ancient times, the Right True Man Guo Shaojin transmitted this formula to Jie Xiang, who in turn passed it to Liu Gen, Zhang Ling, and others. All who followed and ingested it achieved immortality.\n\nWhen compounding the medicine, it must be prepared in a separate, clean chamber, free from the presence of many onlookers. One should bathe, fast, and maintain ritual purity for three days before grinding and processing the ingredients.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Roasted licorice root: 6 *liang*\n- Cinnabar: 3 *liang* (select the finest, lustrous variety and grind it)\n- Rhubarb: 5 *liang* (choose the patterned, dried variety)\n- Dried rehmannia root: 7 *liang*\n- Schisandra fruit: 5 *liang*\n- Poria: 3 *liang*\n- Ginseng: 5.5 *liang* (select the firm, heavy variety)\n- Wolfberry root bark: 4 *liang*\n- Chinese angelica: 3.5 *liang*\n- Asparagus root: 4 *liang*\n- Woodland stephania: 1 *liang*\n- Polyporus: 3 *liang*\n- Manchurian wild ginger: 2 *liang*\n- Cassia seed: 2 *liang*\n\n**Preparation:**\nAll fourteen ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality; do not use old or stale herbs. First, grind each finely and sift, then weigh them precisely. Place them in a mortar in the following order: begin with licorice root, pounding it a thousand times; next add cinnabar, pounding another thousand times. Proceed thus through all fourteen ingredients, totaling fourteen thousand strokes. Then blend with white honey and pound an additional sixteen thousand times, for a total of thirty thousand strokes. Once complete, store the medicine in an airtight vessel.\n\n**Dosage:**\nAfter meals, ingest ten pills the size of *wutong* seeds, starting with a small dose and gradually increasing to thirty pills. This medicine nourishes internally, eliminates illness without toxicity, and has no dietary restrictions. After a year of ingestion, its full benefits manifest—do not expect immediate results. Women who ingest it will bear many children without harm.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Primordial Unities* states: Juanzi told Su Lin, \"If you wish to become a terrestrial immortal, you must first ingest medicines to expel the three corpses and eradicate the grain worms. These worms have three names and sever three lives:\n1. **Green Maiden** severs the life of the eyes, causing wrinkles, foul breath, and tooth loss—her qi bores through the *niwan* palace.\n2. **White Maiden** severs the life of the five viscera, causing mental decline, shortness of breath, forgetfulness, and confusion—her forces pierce the fluids of the six bowels.\n3. **Blood Corpse** severs the life of the stomach, causing abdominal distension, bone desiccation, flesh emaciation, dullness of will, instability of thought, hunger upon missing meals, sorrow, grief, and spiritual disarray—her worms gnaw at the gates of the soul’s womb.\n\nWithout expelling the three corpses, even if one abstains from grains, the worms remain—this brings no benefit. Moreover, dreams will not be true, thoughts will be disordered, and evil desires will persist, all due to the worms stirring the five spirits within. To seek the true Dao and longevity, one must first ingest Worm-Restraining Pills—this is the very formula. Without this knowledge, no one has ever attained immortality.\"\n\n**Ritual for Compounding Immortal Medicines**\nBefore compounding divine medicines, one must fast and maintain ritual purity for seven days, then bathe and enter the chamber, wearing clean garments for another seven days. Once prepared, gather the ingredients on a clear, auspicious day, preferably the *kai* or *chu* day, or the *yin* day. In the courtyard, select a spot facing northwest, place the ingredients on the ground, and set up a high table. On the table, arrange a *sheng* of dates, a vessel of wine, and a portion of dried meat. The practitioner bows twice, kneels, and invokes: *\"Your servant, a child of the Celestial Perfected, a grandchild of the Supreme August, humbly offers this to the Left Jade Chamber Immortal Official of the Supreme Unity Lord. Your servant compounds this medicine to ingest and prolong life. With reverence, I present this offering and bow twice.\"*\n\nFor all methods of ingesting cinnabar, the eight minerals, mica, or herbal pills and powders to prolong life and seek immortality, one must first perform this ritual to honor the Supreme Unity Lord.\n\nThose who do not perform this ritual will often fail in compounding the medicine; even if successful, its ingestion will bring no benefit and cannot lead to immortality. Thus, when the ritual is performed, the Supreme Unity descends, or dispatches Jade Maidens to attend. The divine *qi* infuses the medicine, rendering it spiritually efficacious—all must fast and declare themselves as servants.\n\nWhen making pills, perform the ritual at the moment the ingredients are placed into the mortar. When preparing medicinal cakes, perform it when the fire is lit. When making powders, perform it only after completion. For all such rituals, first arrange the various fruits and medicines, displaying them before the seat of the Supreme Unity, then proceed. Use a table facing south, with five cups of wine, five portions of dried meat, and two plates of dates. For a more elaborate ritual, use five *dou* of wine, five slices of dried meat, two *dou* of dates, and burn incense before bowing twice. The invocation reads:\n\n*\"With reverence, I invite the Perfected of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme August of the Highest, the Celestial Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Terrestrial Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Jade Lads of the Supreme Unity, the Jade Maidens of the Supreme Unity, and the Envoys of the Canopy and Radiant Fire. Descend to this seat!\"*\n\nBow twice and kowtow, saying: *\"I beseech you to avert calamity and dispel misfortune, granting long life and enduring vision. As I now compound this [specific] medicine, I humbly pray that the Most High Lords and the Supreme Unity Lord descend to partake of this offering. Beneath the Yellow Palace and Purple Canopy, may the medicine’s *qi* neither scatter nor disperse, neither fly nor drift, but harmonize with the balanced *qi*, extending life to distant longevity. With devotion, I present this to the celestial spirits. May the divine medicine shine brightly, the Celestial Master kindle the flame, and the Jade Maidens attend. May the *qi* of Heaven be apportioned, and the Supreme Unity descend.\"*\n\nAfter offering the wine, bow again and conclude the ritual. One must fast for three days, avoiding impurity, before the ritual may be performed.\n\nPerform the ritual in seclusion, unseen by others, preferring a quiet and serene location. If assistance is unavoidable, midnight—the hour of *zi*—is also suitable, provided no one witnesses it. Daoists who ingest these medicines should hold an annual sacrifice, not waiting until the compounding of the medicine to do so. The remnants of the sacrificial offerings may only be consumed by the officiant; others must not partake.\n\n**Prohibitions for Ingesting Medicines**\nWhen taking *yu*-jade, avoid wine, the five pungent vegetables, fish, and meat.\nWhen taking cinnabar elixirs, avoid defilement and the sight of blood; seeing dead blood is especially inauspicious.\nWhen taking cinnabar or realgar, avoid all blood-based foods. Failure to abstain will eventually cause hemiplegia.\nWhen taking pine or cypress, avoid pork, dog meat, salt, and fermented soybeans.\nWhen taking *asparagus cochinchinensis*, avoid carp.\nWhen taking *acorus calamus*, avoid hot foods.\nWhen taking *morus* wood, avoid peaches, plums, and wine.\nWhen taking *coptis*, avoid pork.\nWhen taking sesame, avoid pork and dog meat.\nWhen taking *polygonatum*, avoid plums.\nWhen taking *rehmannia*, avoid dog meat.\n\nThose with robust *qi* and blood should begin treatment early; those whose bodies are withered and emaciated are difficult to save. These are the secret methods of the immortals—guard them carefully and do not transmit them lightly. If the recipient is unworthy, do not recklessly impart them.\n\nShennong said: \"Superior medicines nourish life, middling medicines nurture nature, and inferior medicines treat illness.\" This is the principle.\n\n**The Immortals’ Method for Cultivating Life and Prolonging Years: The Five *Lingzhi* Formula**\nThe Five *Lingzhi* are the essence and *qi* of the Five Elders. All plants and trees absorb the essence and *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, yet only pine and cypress receive the purest *qi* in greatest measure. They withstand frost and sleet without withering, their color unchanged through autumn and winter, their lifespan enduring for millennia. The wise immortals have assessed the efficacy of herbs and plants for ingestion, and none surpass pine and cypress. Daoist immortals, after examining countless formulas, have found none equal to this Five *Lingzhi* method. Those Daoists who study immortality, cultivate life, seek longevity, or aspire to eternal life may follow this formula to gather, prepare, and ingest it. From antiquity to the present, its efficacy has been proven time and again. This formula must not be transmitted to those who do not sincerely pursue the Dao.\n\n**Method for Gathering Pine and Cypress**\nRegularly gather newly sprouted pine and cypress leaves in the third or fourth month, when they are about three or four *cun* in length, collecting both the blossoms and leaves together. Dry them in the shade, then finely grind them into powder.\n\n[Text incomplete.]\n\nForm the powder into honeyed pills the size of small beans. On the first and fifteenth day of each month, before sunrise, burn incense, face east, and hold eighty-one pills in hand, swallowing them with wine. Ingesting this for one year extends life by ten years; for two years, by twenty. To strengthen the flesh, add a small amount of hemp seeds and sesame. For those with weak heart-strength, add *fuling* (poria) and ginseng. This medicine eliminates all illnesses, fortifies primordial *qi*, benefits the five viscera and six bowels, clarifies the spirit and brightens the eyes, invigorates youth and prevents aging, prolongs life, and is divinely efficacious. If made into pills with dew collected on the seventh day of the seventh month, its effects are even more excellent.\n\nWhen taking the medicine, recite the following incantation:\n*\"Divine immortal medicine, body in harmony with nature.\nUpon entering the abdomen, may heaven and earth share the same years.\"*\nAfter reciting, take the medicine and abstain from meat and the five pungent vegetables. This is most strictly to be observed!",

      "translated_text": "*The Pillow Record*\n\n*The Pillow Record* is a text of unknown authorship, comprising one scroll. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the \"Methods\" category of the *Dongshen* section. Collated versions include the *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*. A portion of this work is also included in scroll thirty-three of Sun Simiao’s *Pillow Prescriptions for Nurturing Life* in the same collection.\n\nThose who govern the body yet lack reverent fear will be shunned by friends;\nThose who govern the household yet lack reverent fear will be disdained by servants;\nThose who govern the state yet lack reverent fear will be betrayed by neighboring lands;\nThose who govern the realm yet lack reverent fear will lose the Dao and its virtue.\n\nThus, reverent fear is the gate of life and death, the master of ritual and teaching, the cause of survival and ruin, the root of fortune and misfortune, the origin of good and ill. Therefore:\nScholars without reverent fear cannot establish their name;\nFarmers without reverent fear cannot cultivate their crops;\nArtisans without reverent fear cannot set their compass and square;\nMerchants without reverent fear cannot amass their wealth;\nChildren without reverent fear cannot fulfill filial piety;\nFathers without reverent fear cannot manifest kindness;\nMinisters without reverent fear cannot fulfill their duties;\nRulers without reverent fear cannot secure their realm.\n\nThus, those who nurture life, if they lose reverent fear, will find their minds disordered and ungoverned, their bodies restless and unsettled, their spirits scattered and qi dispersed, their wills adrift and intentions muddled. What should live will die; what should endure will perish; what should succeed will fail; what should prosper will meet misfortune.\n\nReverent fear is like water and fire—it must never be forgotten for even a moment. Without reverent fear, one’s children and younger brothers become adversaries, and wives and concubines turn into enemies. Therefore, the highest reverence is for the Dao; next, for Heaven; then, for things; then, for others; and finally, for oneself. Thus:\nHe who fears for himself is not constrained by others;\nHe who is wary of himself is not controlled by others;\nHe who is cautious in small matters is not daunted by great ones;\nHe who is vigilant in near matters does not regret distant ones.\n\nThose who understand this cannot be harmed by dragons in water or tigers and rhinoceroses on land; they are untouched by weapons, unassailed by illness, unslandered by slanderers, and unharmed by venom. Those who truly grasp this have mastered all things.\n\nMost illnesses and premature deaths arise from diet. The harm of diet exceeds that of sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures may be abstained from for years, but diet cannot be abandoned for even a day. Though it brings great benefit, it also poses grave harm. Among the myriad flavors, some clash in their qi and potency; violating their prohibitions turns them into subtle poisons. Slowly, they accumulate into chronic illness; swiftly, they bring sudden disaster.\n\nFrom the summer solstice to the autumn equinox, avoid all rich, greasy, and hard foods, for these conflict with wine, congee, melons, and fruits. Though illness may not appear immediately, the shift of autumn often brings violent fluxes—all due to excessive cooling and dietary immoderation in summer. Yet some mistake the day of illness for its onset, unaware of its gradual accumulation. Those who wish to be prudent must exercise caution in the slightest matters.\n\nFor those who nurture life:\nThink little, contemplate little, desire little, engage in few affairs, speak little, laugh little, grieve little, rejoice little, delight little, rage little, favor little, loathe little. Practicing these twelve \"littles\" is the essence of nurturing life.\nExcessive thought wearies the spirit; excessive contemplation scatters the will; excessive desire harms wisdom; excessive affairs exhaust the body; excessive speech provokes qi; excessive laughter injures the organs; excessive grief oppresses the heart; excessive joy overflows the intent; excessive delight leads to confusion and error; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive favor leads to obsession and disorder; excessive loathing brings emaciation and sorrow. These twelve \"excesses\" are the root of life’s ruin. Only those who neither lack nor overindulge approach the Dao.\n\nThus, recluses suffer few illnesses, while wanderers endure many afflictions—due to the simplicity or complexity of their affairs. Farmers live long, while the noble and wealthy die young—proof of the fewness or excess of their desires. The common folk vie for profit, while Daoists seldom scheme. Ordinary people cannot be without desires or affairs, but by harmonizing the mind, restraining thoughts, calming the body, and reducing cares, these gradually subside.\n\nFeng Junda said: \"The body should always be active, but not to exhaustion; the diet should always be light, but not to the point of emptiness. Regularly avoid rich wines and reduce salt and sour flavors. Curb thoughts, temper joy and anger, abandon reckless pursuits, and be prudent in the bedchamber. In spring and summer, release and discharge; in autumn and winter, store and preserve essence.\" Moreover, raw fish, raw meat, and all cold, fishy foods often harm people—it is best to abstain from them entirely, for great good lies therein.\n\nKeep the heart ever inclined toward goodness, and do not scheme or deceive—this greatly dishonors the spirit and shortens life.\n\nPeng Zu said: \"Heavy clothing and thick bedding make the body unable to endure hardship, leading to wind and cold illnesses; rich flavors, dried meats, and excessive feasting breed hernial and intestinal diseases; beautiful women and alluring concubines bring the calamity of depletion; lewd sounds and mournful music bewitch the heart and ears, leading to dissipation; galloping and hunting in the wilds result in madness; scheming for victory, seizing the weak, and exploiting disorder lead to the downfall of arrogance and indulgence.\" These are the warnings of sages against losing principle—one cannot but reflect on them to admonish oneself.\n\nThe Dao of nurturing life:\nDo not walk, sit, listen, or gaze for too long. Do not force eating or drinking, nor indulge in sorrow, grief, or anxiety. Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty. After eating, walk several hundred steps—greatly beneficial. Do not eat at night; if you must, walk five or six *li* afterward to avoid illness. Always engage in some activity day and night, without ceasing, but do not exhaust yourself. Neither should you be too idle, doing nothing at all.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"Flowing water does not stagnate, a door hinge does not rot—because they move without ceasing.\" The *Xiang’er* states: \"Do not contend with others over right and wrong; instead, call upon the longevity of others.\" If the body is unwell, turn the tongue to block the throat, rinse with saliva, and swallow repeatedly—soon it will be cured. When Daoists fall ill, they close their eyes and look inward, using the heart to generate fire to burn the body completely, preserving it until their essence appears like dewdrops on a topknot—then they recover. If there is pain in any part, visualize the fire burning it—this is a secret and effective method.\n\n**Prohibitions and Taboos**\nOn *jiǎyín* and *gēngshēn* days, when corpse-ghosts vie in chaos and the spirit is restless and defiled, one must not share a mat, speak, or meet face-to-face with a spouse. One must bathe in purity and remain vigilant, avoiding sleep. These days are suitable for expelling desire.\n\nWhen taking medicinal substances, avoid garlic, pomegranates, animal liver, dog meat, and pork; celibacy is best. When ingesting divine medicines, never face north—this is a great taboo. On *hài* and *zǐ* days, do not spit, lest one lose essence and qi, harming one’s lifespan.\n\nWhen entering mountains, before reaching a hundred paces from the mountain, first retreat a hundred paces, then turn and ascend—thus mountain spirits dare not harm you, all evil flees, and every poison hides.\n\nWhen taking medicines, avoid bloody flavors, lest the Three Corpses remain. Those seeking immortality must not see corpses—this is greatly inauspicious. Also, avoid residing with women during the third and first months—this is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Avoidances and Taboos**\nDo not sleep on a *jiǎzǐ* night in winter. Those seeking immortality must avoid the Ten Failings: first, do not indulge in lust; second, do not commit hidden cruelty or evil; third, do not become drunk; fourth, do not be filthy, lazy, or contentious; fifth, do not eat the meat of your parents’ birth signs; sixth, do not eat the meat of your own birth sign; seventh, do not eat any meat; eighth, do not consume pungent, greasy, or the Five Acrids; ninth, do not kill any insects or living beings; tenth, do not urinate or defecate facing north, nor gaze upward at the Three Luminaries.\n\nDo not face north when undressing, nor curse or destroy things facing north. Do not offend the sun, moon, or stars. Do not mete out punishments on the Eight Nodal Days. Do not rage on the first and last days of the lunar month. Do not eat scaled creatures on *liùjiǎ* days. Do not eat parrot meat on *bǐngshēn* days. Do not eat pheasant meat on *bǐngwǔ* days. Do not become greatly drunk on *yǐmǎo* days. Do not eat fish on the ninth day of the second month. Do not eat organ meats or the hearts of grasses on the third day of the third month. Do not cut down plants on the eighth day of the fourth month. Do not see blood on the fifth day of the fifth month. Do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month. Do not dwell on evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month. Do not purchase creatures with attached limbs on the eighth day of the eighth month. Do not gather reeds or mats on the ninth day of the ninth month. Do not punish or reproach others on the fifth day of the tenth month. Do not bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Do not fail to fast, burn incense, or recite the Dao within the last three days of the twelfth month.\n\nThese taboos are the great prohibitions of heaven and humanity, observed and examined by the Three Officials. Violating them on these days is a grave offense, causing the Three Hun to sicken one another, the Seven Po to vie in chaos, or the Womb Spirit to be offended—times when the Three Palaces receive evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, demons exploit one’s unguarded moments, essence and fluids are violated, and the divine spirits grow distracted, leading to many transgressions and prohibitions. Those who truly understand these taboos and abide by them will become immortal talents; those who defy the heavenly prohibitions will suffer harm and defeat.\n\nThe great gods of the heavenly offices forbid consuming raw blood, burning the fur of the Six Livestock, or burning garlic skins and various smoked vegetables—all of which disrupt the Womb Origin and offend the Infant Spirit. Beware!\n\nFor all Daoist practitioners, do not pass on clothing, shoes, headscarves, or coarse garments—this is greatly inauspicious.",

If there are those who revere the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons, do not dwell in their chambers, partake of their offerings, wear their clothes, or don their headscarves. This is to evade the foul vapors of death and distance oneself from the passage of perverse winds. For all Daoist practitioners, do not hold infants—a great taboo among immortals.\n\nOn the eight seasonal nodes, do not mingle with others; this is to focus the spirit in pursuit of the subtle. Avoid treading upon filth, and always burn incense and bathe frequently. Those who violate these precepts will wither and fail; those who heed them will ascend in flight.\n\nThough the inner defense of the Yin Elixir in the bedchamber, the benefits of the Yellow Way and Red Qi in union, the essentials of seven-nine morning refinement through breath and essence, and the method of Six-One Reverted Elixir with its yin-yang pairing may earn one the name of immortal, the Upper Clarity does not deem them comparable to virtue. Though they may achieve transformation, the Most High does not regard them as noble—these are the impure immortals and turbid perfected, forever barred from gazing upon the Jade Gates. Truly, treading treacherous paths and skating on thin ice often ends in overturned chariots; even those who survive whole remain but foul and disordered earthbound immortals.\n\nThose who establish resolve in inner cultivation, nurture the spirit, and seek immortality must bathe frequently to invite the numinous qi. For Daoist practitioners, every matter should be kept secret—reveal even a single word or deed, and one’s allotted span is diminished by a reckoning. A reckoning is three days.\n\nWhen offering morning prayers, do not wear cold or mixed clothing. Upon entering or leaving a quiet chamber, rinse the mouth with water. When burning incense, exit the chamber and do not look back. When swallowing saliva, always close the eyes and turn the gaze inward. When writing talismans or scriptures, face north, keep brush and inkstone separate, and first burn incense.\n\nIf suddenly hearing cries, wails, the sound of rushing water, thunder, drums, or if smelling foul odors or the stench of blood in the nose, these are all ominous signs. Immediately burn incense, bathe, and observe abstinence for three days, invoking the Three Primordial Sovereigns to seek protection.\n\nPractice hidden virtue: do what others cannot, undertake what others will not, pity the orphaned and destitute, rescue those in peril, and support the fallen—then all evils will vanish of themselves. When purchasing medicinal substances, do not haggle over price; buy from elders or virtuous persons, and avoid those who gossip or envy.\n\nJoy and anger harm resolve; sorrow and anxiety damage nature. Infatuation with glory and splendor deludes virtue; the exhaustion of yin and yang depletes essence—all are great taboos in Daoist practice and abhorred by immortal methods. Care for clothing and bedding as one would ordinarily, and always burn incense to keep them pure and untainted.\n\nThose who cultivate the true must be free from the stirrings of desire and thoughts of male and female. If the White Elixir resides within the breast, the true will not respond, and the numinous maidens and exalted ones will not descend. Even if one gains something, it will be no more than an earthbound master. Those who engage with yin qi can never attain the supreme Dao.\n\nI once deeply regretted this, but fortunately corrected it swiftly.

      "translated_text": "**Daoist Breathing and Guiding Methods**\n\n**Guiding and Pulling Method**\nRegularly rub the face with both hands to give it a lustrous glow and prevent wrinkles and blemishes. Practicing this for five years will restore a youthful complexion like that of a maiden.\n\nUpon rising or retiring, sit upright and calm the breath. First, clasp the hands and cover the nape, then tilt the head back to gaze upward, causing the nape and hands to strain against each other. Repeat this three or four times to harmonize essence and circulate blood, preventing wind and qi from entering. With long practice, one will remain free from illness.\n\nNext, bend and stretch the four limbs, arch the back, twist the sides, and rotate all joints—each movement performed three times.\n\nBefore rising or after lying down, use a towel or thick cloth to wipe the nape, ears, and surrounding areas until they grow warm. Then, stroke the nape along the hairline for a long while, and rub the hands to massage the face and eyes. With prolonged practice, the eyes will grow bright, and noxious qi will not invade.\n\nAfter completing these steps, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids. Frequently press the ears on both sides without counting, ensuring they do not grow deaf, and the nose does not become blocked.\n\nAt the time when vital qi is born (just after midnight), swallow saliva twenty-one times, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize. Then, press any painful areas of the body. During seated practice, always close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and six bowels. With long practice, they will become distinctly clear.\n\nRegularly press the inner corners of both eyes near the nose, holding the breath until qi flows through, then repeat. With consistent practice, one may see clearly for a thousand miles.\n\nPress the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times, then rub the face above the eyes with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times—these actions have no fixed count or timing.\n\nFinally, stroke the forehead thirty-nine times with the hands, beginning between the eyebrows and moving upward into the hairline. Swallow saliva repeatedly from the corners of the mouth. With regular practice, the eyes will grow clear and bright, and within a year, one may read by night. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum without describing its form—excellent indeed.\n\n**Breathing Method**\nFor those seeking immortality, there are three great methods: first, preserving essence; second, circulating qi; and third, ingesting elixirs. These three progress from shallow to deep, and without encountering a perfected master or enduring diligent effort, they cannot be swiftly understood.\n\nThe techniques for preserving essence number nearly a hundred, while methods for circulating qi reach into the thousands. The formulas for ingesting elixirs comprise roughly ten types, all requiring unceasing effort.\n\nThus, circulating qi can cure a hundred illnesses, ward off pestilence, subdue snakes and beasts, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow one to dwell underwater, stave off hunger and thirst, and prolong life. Its essential principle is *embryonic breathing*. Embryonic breathing means no longer inhaling or exhaling through the mouth or nose, as if within the womb—when this is achieved, the Dao is attained.\n\nThose skilled in using qi can exhale upon water to make it flow backward, exhale upon fire to extinguish its flames, exhale upon insects and leopards to make them submit, and exhale upon wounds to stop pain and bleeding. If one hears of someone bitten by a venomous creature, even unseen, one may exhale a spell upon the hand—left for men, right for women—and though they be a thousand miles away, they will immediately recover. For sudden illnesses or malevolent afflictions, swallowing qi thirty-nine times will cure them instantly. Yet most people are restless by nature and seldom cultivate stillness to contemplate the Way.\n\nThe method for circulating qi requires a secluded room with closed doors, a soft mat, and a pillow two and a half inches high. Lie flat on the back, close the eyes, and hold the breath within the chest and diaphragm. Place a goose feather over the nose and mouth—if it remains motionless for three hundred breaths, the ears will hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, and the mind think nothing. This is gradually achieved.\n\nIf one consumes raw or cold foods, the five pungent vegetables, fish, or meat, or indulges in joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety while practicing qi circulation, not only will there be no benefit, but it will aggravate qi disorders, causing counterflow and coughing. One cannot suddenly hold the breath for long; it must be learned gradually. Begin with three, five, seven, or nine breaths before exhaling, then increase the count. Twelve breaths without exhaling is a minor attainment; one hundred twenty breaths is a major attainment. One hundred twenty breaths without exhaling can cure illness—direct the intention to the afflicted area: for headaches, focus on the head; for foot pain, focus on the feet. To heal, guide harmonious qi to attack the ailment, and it will dissipate from moment to moment. This is the great essential of healing the body.\n\nWhen circulating qi, always do so after midnight when vital qi is born. Hold the breath and count silently in the mind until the ears hear nothing. To avoid miscounting, use fingers or counting rods. Reaching a thousand breaths brings one close to immortality.\n\nWhen exhaling, always take in more and release less, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. If the weather is heavily foggy, fiercely windy, or bitterly cold, do not practice qi circulation—simply hold the breath. This is the essential subtlety.\n\nPeng Zu said: The supreme Dao is not burdensome; merely refrain from thinking of anything, and the mind will not labor. Furthermore, practice guiding and pulling, circulate qi without ceasing, and one may attain a thousand years. By ingesting golden elixirs and superior medicines, one may become imperishable for all time. Fast and purify the body, visualize the sun and moon within the mouth—store the sun by day and the moon by night.\n\n**Ingesting Medicines Method**\nAmong the myriad formulas for ingesting medicines, most are verbose and difficult to grasp. Here, I have selected several dozen proven methods from my studies to supplement what is lacking. The great elixirs and unproven medicines are not discussed here.\n\nFor those wishing to ingest medicines, begin with herbs, then proceed to woods, and finally to minerals—this is the general progression of medicines, moving from refined to coarse, ascending from shallow to deep. From youth to adulthood, the body is accustomed to the five grains, which cannot be abandoned in a single day. Medicines provide gradual and subtle benefits, lacking the immediate satiation of food. Only through unceasing accumulation will the bones and marrow become filled, and the five grains will naturally be forsaken.",

      "translated_text": "Among the five grains, barley is the finest, for it does not perish even in the depths of winter and thus may be consumed. Next is the acorn, neither fruit nor grain yet most beneficial to man. For those who have not yet succeeded in forsaking grains, eating it is excellent—it receives qi though it has none, receives flavor though it has none, dissolves drink and arrests dysentery, and strengthens the body without exhaustion. Next are jujubes and chestnuts, which are also fine.\n\n**Method for Constantly Ingesting While Forsaking Grains**\nFive *jin* of poria powder\nFive *jin* of raw chestnut powder\nFive *jin* of sesame, steamed and sun-dried nine times, then ground\n\nTake these three ingredients. First, boil five *dou* of large, plump dried jujubes in one *shi* of water until half the liquid remains, then grind and strain them until the skins and pits are thoroughly cold. Add another *dou* of water to wash the sweetness from the skins and pits, ensuring none is left. Simmer over a low flame until it thickens like syrup, then cool it and mix it with the other ingredients. Pound ten thousand times, seal tightly, and gradually ingest as a substitute for meals. Even if one does not eat, this does not hinder the ingestion of great medicines.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake asparagus, remove the heart and skin, grind it into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily. Whether among men or in the mountains, never cease this practice, for the longer it is done, the better. It may also be fermented into wine and consumed, treating lumps, accumulations, wind, madness, and convulsions, expelling the three worms and hidden corpses, eliminating sores, damp impediment, and numbness, lightening the body, augmenting qi, and rendering one free from hunger. After a hundred days, it restores youth and reverses aging; the earlier one begins, the better. Plant yams abundantly in good soil and steam them as a substitute for grains—this is highly effective.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Medicines Alongside Poria as a Substitute for All Foods**\nTake five *jin* of poria, process it cold, pound it, and sift. Mix with three *sheng* of white honey and place in a bronze vessel, then steam it in a double boiler, stirring frequently. If no bronze vessel is available, a fine porcelain one will also suffice. When the honey is dry, remove it and pound thirty thousand times. Take thirty pills the size of *wutong* seeds once daily, three times a day. After a hundred days, a hundred illnesses will be dispelled; after two hundred days, one will see in the dark; after two years, one will command ghosts; after four years, jade maidens will attend.\n\nWhen compounding immortal medicines, first purify oneself for three days. Simmer the medicine in a secluded place, allowing no humans or animals to see it. Only the one preparing the medicine should oversee it, covering the vessel with wood and keeping it concealed. Use only cool wood for the fire, tend it with care, and prepare as much as desired. Once the medicine is complete, store it in a sealed vessel—it will not spoil for ten thousand years.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake three *dou* of sesame, whether yellow or black, carefully select and clean it, then lightly roast it in a cauldron until fragrant. Grind it finely and sift. Mix with three *sheng* of white honey, simmer as in the poria method, and pound thirty thousand times. Take thirty pills the size of *wutong* seeds at dawn. When one dose is finished, the intestines will transform into sinews. These two methods differ slightly from common formulas. Those who are young should ingest poria, while those over forty should take sesame. Generally, poria treats the young, and sesame nourishes the old; the two may also be combined, doubling the honey and simmering them together into pills. This serves both old and young, eliminating the need for separate preparations.\n\n**Great Method for Ingesting to Attain Longevity**\nWhen ingesting medicines, first take herbal medicines until one feels their power, then proceed to mineral medicines. Medicines have their sequences—what is meant by \"a hairsbreadth’s deviation leads to a thousand *li*’s error.\" Only then may one ingest elixirs without harm.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Oil**\nWhen preparing to ingest divine medicines or mica, first consume this. Take one *dou* of sesame oil and three *jin* of wild rice stems, cut them, and place them in the oil. Simmer over a low flame until the stems turn black and charred, then remove the dregs and mix with wine. Take half a *sheng* warm, twice daily, or three *ge*. After a hundred days, the blood and vessels will be abundant; after a year, one may ingest medicines.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Sesame**\nTwo *dou* of sesame\nOne *dou* of soybeans\n\nRoast each until fragrant, then grind the soybean paste and sift. Take five *ge* three times daily, washing it down with broth or mixing it with honey. Take a piece the size of a pigeon’s egg four times daily. Gradually, one will cease to hunger, then ingest the Four Stabilizers to supplement deficiency and taxation.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Mica**\nThe *Bencao* states: Mica is a superior medicine, sweet in flavor, non-toxic, and balanced. It governs the descent of qi, firms the flesh, augments essence, removes dead skin and muscle, treats wind-cold and heat evil qi, brightens the eyes, stabilizes the five viscera, and endures cold and heat. With prolonged ingestion, one’s aspirations will soar, aging will cease, and one will attain longevity and transcendence. It grows in the stone crevices of Qiyun Mountain and the northern Ding Mountain of Langye, and is harvested in the second month. Water plantain serves as its assistant; it fears turtle shells and dew.\n\nMica has eight varieties, each with distinct names. Observe them facing the sun to distinguish them:\n- That which is yellow-white with much green is called *yunying*. Ingest it in spring to lighten the body, enter water without cold, and extend life by four thousand years.\n- That which is green-yellow, radiant, and mostly red is called *yunzhu*. Ingest it in summer to lighten the body, endure cold and heat, and extend life by three thousand years.\n- That which resembles ice and snow, now yellow, now white, is called *xuesha*. Ingest it in late summer to lighten the body, emit light, endure wind and cold, and extend life by two thousand years.\n- That which is yellow-white and crystalline is called *yunguang*. Ingest it in autumn to strengthen the sinews and bones, unblock the channels and vessels, and extend life by one thousand years.\n- That which is green-white with much black is called *linshi*. Ingest it in winter to lighten the body and enter fire without burning.\n- That which possesses all five colors is called *yunmu* and may be ingested in all seasons.\n- That which is mixed with black and toughens the flesh grows among copper and iron and is called *dizhong*—it must not be ingested, for it harms life.\n- That which is red and heavy is called *yangqishi*, the root of the five clouds. It is used separately in medicines and must not be ingested.\n\nAll mica, when one *cun* thick, has one thousand eight hundred layers. When buried with sand and soil, the finest quality will grow naturally in a basin placed in a shady spot over months and years.",

Only through unceasing accumulation will the bones and marrow become filled, and the five grains will naturally be forsaken.",

Pound and split it, then rinse in water a hundred times or more, washing thoroughly until pure. Use it promptly or store it as needed.\n\nFor delayed use, soak it in water collected from the long-term leaks of a thatched roof in a white ceramic vessel during the fifth month, and let it steep for a hundred days before straining. If any water scum remains, rinse again with flowing water several times, then strain and dry. The fine, floating particles should be collected in a separate vessel.\n\nIn the eighth month, take new cloth, with two people each holding one end—or strike a bamboo pole—then brush it over mountain grasses to gather dew. Squeeze the cloth to extract the juice, and continue until the mica is fully submerged. If insufficient, gather more dew to soak it. After fifty or sixty days of steeping, it may be used. Store it in a warm place, avoiding cold or frost.\n\nTo make powder: dry the mica, then place it in a tanned leather pouch and vigorously knead it by hand from dawn until noon. Sift the fine powder through silk, then knead the remaining residue again until fully processed. If still not fine enough, examine it with your fingers—if uneven, mix it with a small amount of water in a large wooden basin to form a paste. After a while, rinse with water and strain through fine silk. Repeat the process with the residue until fully refined, then allow it to settle.\n\nAlternatively, after kneading, sift through coarse silk or linen, then grind in a dry white basin and strain through silk as before. Another method: first grind, then strain through silk, dry, place in a leather pouch, and sift through fine silk. It may also be steeped in dew for a hundred days, then dried, pounded, and placed in a pouch to rinse in water, collecting the liquid and allowing it to settle before refining.\n\nAll such methods yield powder as fine as felt, smooth to the touch like silk, and lustrous—this is best. If still not pure, boil the powder in dew until it bubbles, then dry and pound it in a mortar, sifting again through silk.\n\nFor immediate use: after rinsing, thinly peel the mica, place it in a silk pouch, and immerse it in boiling water. Remove and cool in cold water, then repeat—dipping in hot water and cooling in cold—ten times, changing the water each time until the mica softens. Remove, dry in the sun, then press in a leather pouch to form powder.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Mica from Wei Shuqing’s *Jade Cabinet Plain Book***\nTake one *jin* of mica with all five colors, finely peel it, and soak it for a hundred days in water from a long-standing thatched roof or dew gathered from autumn grasses. Place it in a leather pouch, pound it, sift through silk, and store it in a bamboo tube, sealing the opening. Suspend it beneath steamed rice, with one *dan* of white sand layered on top, and steam for a day and night. When the steam permeates, remove it, then add one *dan* of glutinous and non-glutinous rice, steaming for another day. Repeat: steam for a day and night, let the steam permeate, remove the rice, and add another *dan* of fresh glutinous and non-glutinous rice, steaming until the steam permeates again. Then remove the mica, mix it with one *sheng* of white honey in a copper vessel, and simmer over a gentle heat until it can be formed into pills the size of sesame seeds.\n\nTake two pills when the stars appear, continuing for thirty to fifty days. Increase to three pills the size of *wutong* seeds, taking one at the call of the parrot each morning. After thirty days, the body will feel light and the eyes bright. After fifty days, the abdomen will itch. After seventy days, the three worms and corpse parasites will depart. After eighty days, the skin will become lustrous. After ninety days, one may enter water and fire without harm. After a hundred days, the sinews and bones will transform. After three hundred days, one will run as swiftly as a galloping horse. After a year, one will become a perfected person. It is also said that those over seventy must practice for four hundred days before attaining immortality.\n\nThis is the method for one *jin*; for greater quantities, increase proportionally. Some say two *jin*, others three.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake ten *jin* of cinnamon, peel and retain three *jin*, then pound and sift. Take four *jin* of green onion stalks, thoroughly pound them, and wring out the juice through cloth to mix with the cinnamon powder. Place the mixture in a fresh bamboo tube, seal the opening with a wooden lid, and suspend it to steam. Add five *dou* of glutinous rice below, and when the rice is cooked, it will turn to water. Then add one *jin* of mica powder, and after a day, it will also dissolve into water. Take a small spoonful, three times daily. After thirty days, one’s appearance will resemble that of a child.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake one *jin* of mica powder and one *jin* of white saltpeter, pound and sift them, then mix with three *sheng* of white honey. Place the mixture in a fresh bamboo tube, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it beneath a northern wall. After thirty days, remove it and store it in a copper vessel—it will gradually liquefy like water or wine. After twenty days of ingestion, the body will radiate light. After thirty days, dew will not cling to the body. After fifty days, fire will not harm it. After a hundred days, one will become an immortal.\n\n**Jade-Dissolving Method**\nTake one *jin* of fine jade, grind it into powder, and place it in mica-infused water. After ten days, it will dissolve, and half a *jin* may be ingested. All stone fragments placed within will dissolve, not just jade.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake one *jin* of mica powder and one *jin* of saltpeter, pound them into a paste, place in a jar, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it in damp earth at a depth of three *chi*, or suspend it in a well for ten days until it liquefies.

      "translated_text": "**Reversing Aging and Restoring Youth, Making the Body Radiant and Lustrous**\nI have tested these three methods, and all have proven effective.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Realgar**\nThe *Materia Medica* states: Realgar is bitter and sweet in flavor, neutral to greatly warming in nature, and toxic. It governs cold-heat rat fistula, malignant sores, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, necrotic flesh, scabies, mites, and ulcers; eye pain; nasal polyps; severed sinews and broken bones; severe wind in all joints; accumulations, gatherings, and conglomerations of *qi*; sudden afflictions with abdominal pain; ghostly infestations; and kills essence-devouring entities, malevolent ghosts, perverse *qi*, and the poisons of a hundred insects. It overcomes the five weapons, slays the poisons of all serpents and insects, and imparts a lustrous glow to the face. When refined and ingested, it lightens the body; immortals who consume it all find it ascending into the brain, surpassing ghosts and spirits, prolonging years and extending life, preserving the center and eliminating hunger.\n\nIn the days when the Master of Embracing Simplicity and Tao Hongjing dwelled south of the Yangtze, realgar was valued as highly as gold. When compounding great elixirs, they sought it in vain. Since ancient times, all the sages and immortals have lamented the scarcity of this substance, fearing their Dao could not be perfected in time—how much more so for these two worthies! In my youth, I aspired to the Dao, but only in maturity did I learn the methods. Yearning for this medicine, I devoted a year to quieting my mind and practicing ingestion.\n\nDuring the Zhenguan era, I traveled to Mount Emei and purchased over forty *jin* of Wudu realgar. The pieces were extraordinarily large, their brilliance and hue dazzling—unseen since antiquity. Without the favor of sagely virtue, how could such a treasure be obtained? Upon seeing this medicine, I felt my four limbs grow light and buoyant, as if I could ascend the clouds. Having encountered this divine substance in a sagely age, I urge those of like mind to hasten and employ it!\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: Among all stones, only cinnabar and realgar are supreme. The methods for refining and ingesting them are not difficult; they should be diligently pursued. This is the essential medicine for transcending the world, second only to the Great Elixir—all other ingested medicines fall short of it. Yet those who are sated with food and drink cannot believe in it.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Realgar**\nTake realgar powder, refine it by sublimation to obtain the \"flower,\" steam it for several days, and form pills with white honey. Ingest a pill the size of a bullet thrice daily, gradually reducing the dose. This expels the three worms and grants longevity. Blending it with refined pine resin is excellent. One may prepare a large quantity, not limited to two *jin*. Sublime it in an earthenware cauldron.\n\n**Another Method**",

      "translated_text": "**Another Method**\nTake realgar powder, blend it with clear wine, steam it, then form pills with white honey. Ingesting realgar ensures that tigers, wolves, and all poisons dare not approach; entering water repels dragons and serpents; it wards off weapons, all gu toxins, and malevolent spirits. The heart becomes enlightened, the eyes bright, and one exudes awe-inspiring might.\n\n**Another Method**\nTake equal parts realgar and mercury, grind them thoroughly together, place them in a bronze vessel, and steam for three days and nights until they transform into liquid. If not fully liquefied, steam again, repeatedly removing and replacing them. Warm them over charcoal fire, repeatedly turning, until they turn purple. Form pills with white honey, ingesting three the size of sesame seeds thrice daily. After a thousand days, one attains spiritual communion.\n\n**Another Method**\nBlend realgar with refined pine resin, forming pills the size of small beans. Ingest two daily. After ten days, the three worms descend; after twenty days, all illnesses are cured; after a hundred days, one attains spiritual communion.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Realgar must be sourced from Wudu Mountain, pure and unadulterated, its color a radiant crimson like a parrot’s crest, gleaming brilliantly—only this may be used. That which is merely pure yellow, resembling orpiment and lacking luster, is unfit for immortal elixirs and may only be used in medicinal compounds for treating illnesses. Methods for ingesting it include steaming or boiling, blending with wine, dissolving with nitre into liquid then solidifying, wrapping in pig’s bladder and steaming beneath red earth, or mixing with pine resin. Alternatively, refining it like *fawu* and drawing it into ice-like threads on cloth—all these methods grant longevity, cure all diseases, expel the three corpses, erase scars, turn white hair black, regrow fallen teeth. After a thousand days, jade maidens will attend you, ready to be commanded to summon provisions. Moreover, jade maidens always bear a yellow jade mark, the size of a millet grain, upon their noses—this is the true sign. Those without such marks are ghosts testing mortals. I have previously ingested this and witnessed it firsthand.\n\n**True Man’s Formula for Grain-Immortal Pills (also called Worm-Restraining Pills)**\nThose who study the Dao of immortality should first ingest this to fortify bones and sinews, halt aging and restore youth, and make the body radiate extraordinary light. With prolonged ingestion, one attains transcendence. In ancient times, the Right True Man Guo Shaojin transmitted this formula to Jie Xiang, who in turn passed it to Liu Gen, Zhang Ling, and others. All who followed and ingested it achieved immortality.\n\nWhen compounding the medicine, it must be prepared in a separate, clean chamber, free from the presence of many onlookers. One should bathe, fast, and maintain ritual purity for three days before grinding and processing the ingredients.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Roasted licorice root: 6 *liang*\n- Cinnabar: 3 *liang* (select the finest, lustrous variety and grind it)\n- Rhubarb: 5 *liang* (choose the patterned, dried variety)\n- Dried rehmannia root: 7 *liang*\n- Schisandra fruit: 5 *liang*\n- Poria: 3 *liang*\n- Ginseng: 5.5 *liang* (select the firm, heavy variety)\n- Wolfberry root bark: 4 *liang*\n- Chinese angelica: 3.5 *liang*\n- Asparagus root: 4 *liang*\n- Woodland stephania: 1 *liang*\n- Polyporus: 3 *liang*\n- Manchurian wild ginger: 2 *liang*\n- Cassia seed: 2 *liang*\n\n**Preparation:**\nAll fourteen ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality; do not use old or stale herbs. First, grind each finely and sift, then weigh them precisely. Place them in a mortar in the following order: begin with licorice root, pounding it a thousand times; next add cinnabar, pounding another thousand times. Proceed thus through all fourteen ingredients, totaling fourteen thousand strokes. Then blend with white honey and pound an additional sixteen thousand times, for a total of thirty thousand strokes. Once complete, store the medicine in an airtight vessel.\n\n**Dosage:**\nAfter meals, ingest ten pills the size of *wutong* seeds, starting with a small dose and gradually increasing to thirty pills. This medicine nourishes internally, eliminates illness without toxicity, and has no dietary restrictions. After a year of ingestion, its full benefits manifest—do not expect immediate results. Women who ingest it will bear many children without harm.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Primordial Unities* states: Juanzi told Su Lin, \"If you wish to become a terrestrial immortal, you must first ingest medicines to expel the three corpses and eradicate the grain worms. These worms have three names and sever three lives:\n1. **Green Maiden** severs the life of the eyes, causing wrinkles, foul breath, and tooth loss—her qi bores through the *niwan* palace.\n2. **White Maiden** severs the life of the five viscera, causing mental decline, shortness of breath, forgetfulness, and confusion—her forces pierce the fluids of the six bowels.\n3. **Blood Corpse** severs the life of the stomach, causing abdominal distension, bone desiccation, flesh emaciation, dullness of will, instability of thought, hunger upon missing meals, sorrow, grief, and spiritual disarray—her worms gnaw at the gates of the soul’s womb.\n\nWithout expelling the three corpses, even if one abstains from grains, the worms remain—this brings no benefit. Moreover, dreams will not be true, thoughts will be disordered, and evil desires will persist, all due to the worms stirring the five spirits within. To seek the true Dao and longevity, one must first ingest Worm-Restraining Pills—this is the very formula. Without this knowledge, no one has ever attained immortality.\"\n\n**Ritual for Compounding Immortal Medicines**\nBefore compounding divine medicines, one must fast and maintain ritual purity for seven days, then bathe and enter the chamber, wearing clean garments for another seven days. Once prepared, gather the ingredients on a clear, auspicious day, preferably the *kai* or *chu* day, or the *yin* day. In the courtyard, select a spot facing northwest, place the ingredients on the ground, and set up a high table. On the table, arrange a *sheng* of dates, a vessel of wine, and a portion of dried meat. The practitioner bows twice, kneels, and invokes: *\"Your servant, a child of the Celestial Perfected, a grandchild of the Supreme August, humbly offers this to the Left Jade Chamber Immortal Official of the Supreme Unity Lord. Your servant compounds this medicine to ingest and prolong life. With reverence, I present this offering and bow twice.\"*\n\nFor all methods of ingesting cinnabar, the eight minerals, mica, or herbal pills and powders to prolong life and seek immortality, one must first perform this ritual to honor the Supreme Unity Lord.",
      "overlap_context": "th food and drink cannot believe in it.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Realgar**\nTake realgar powder, refine it by sublimation to obtain the \"flower,\" steam it for several days, and form pills with white honey. Ingest a pill the size of a bullet thrice daily, gradually reducing the dose. This expels the three worms and grants longevity. Blending it with refined pine resin is excellent. One may prepare a large quantity, not limited to two *jin*. Sublime it in an earthenware cauldron.\n\n**Another Method**",

They withstand frost and sleet without withering, their color unchanged through autumn and winter, their lifespan enduring for millennia.

Those Daoists who study immortality, cultivate life, seek longevity, or aspire to eternal life may follow this formula to gather, prepare, and ingest it.
