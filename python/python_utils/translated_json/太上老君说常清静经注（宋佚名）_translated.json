  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility*\nOriginally annotated by an unknown author, likely composed during the Song dynasty. One fascicle.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\nCollated with annotated versions by Du Guangting et al.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility**\nAnnotated by an unknown author\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nThe Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThe Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\n\nThe Lord Lao expounds upon the threefold virtue of the Great Dao:\nFirst, the Great Dao is without form or substance, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nSecond, the Great Dao is without emotion or nature, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThird, the Great Dao is without name or appearance, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\n\nHow is it that the formless can give birth to Heaven and Earth?\nThe Great Dao is pure to the point of numinosity, tranquil to the point of emptiness. Its numinous emptiness is vast and boundless, the natural qi. Thus, it is without form or substance.\nThough without form or substance, it can give birth to Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the virtue of the Great Dao.\n\nThat it is without emotion or nature yet can move the sun and moon:\nThe Great Dao is also without emotion or nature, yet its natural qi moves the sun and moon, illuminating the myriad forms.\nThis is the second virtue of the Great Dao.\n\nThat it is without name or appearance yet can nurture the myriad beings:\nThe Great Dao, being without form or substance and without emotion or nature, can give birth to Heaven and Earth and move the sun and moon. Yet it has no name or designation, and its singular qi flows through all, transforming and generating the myriad beings.\nThis is the Great Dao’s inherent and operative principle.\n\nHeaven and Earth refer to the region from the *Niwan Palace* at the crown of the head down to the *Yongquan Point* at the soles of the feet.\nThe sun and moon refer to the left and right eyes above and the kidneys below.\nThe myriad beings refer to the ten thousand spirits within the body.\n\nWhen a person receives a body, it arises from the singular qi of the Dao, aligning with Heaven and Earth, harmonizing yin and yang. Through the union of father and mother, form is structured.\nThus, the first month is the celestial womb; the second, the earthly embryo; the third, the three hun-souls; the fourth, the seven po-souls; the fifth, the five viscera; the sixth, the six bowels; the seventh, the seven orifices; the eighth, the descent of the eight luminous spirits; the ninth, the descent of eighteen thousand spirits, with inner and outer combining to form thirty-six thousand essences of radiance.\nWhen the spirits descend and the form is complete, the tenth month is fulfilled, and birth is received. Thus, we know the Great Dao has no form or substance, yet its primordial qi can transform into the qi of form.\n\nThe qi of form is primordial qi, extending eight hundred and ten *zhang*.\nPreserve and cherish it. Cherishing it prevents the body’s decay, just as the Great Dao, though without form or substance, circulates its true essence.\nNurturing the essence of the kidneys prevents decay, and the eyes become clear of themselves.\n\nWe also know the Great Dao has no name, yet its true essence becomes form.\nForm is the root of receiving qi, and qi is the foundation of form.\nWhere there is qi, there is essence; where there is essence, there is spirit.\nThus, qi is the mother of spirit, and spirit is the child of qi. Mother and child do not part—this is called attaining the Dao.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nThe Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThe Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\nIf one can cherish form, nurture qi, and preserve spirit, one will comprehend the Dao of true constancy, purity, and tranquility.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"With tranquility, contemplate the Dao; with purity, cultivate the body.\"\nThose who do so can attain purity and tranquility.\n\n\"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\n\"I\" refers to the Supreme Lord’s self-designation, meaning \"myself.\"\nThe Supreme Lord states that though the Great Dao possesses the three virtues of formlessness, it naturally gives birth to Heaven and Earth; though without emotion or nature, it naturally moves the sun and moon; though without name or appearance, it naturally nurtures the myriad beings. Yet I do not know its true name. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is uniquely supreme. Thus, I provisionally call it the Dao.\n\nTherefore, it is said: \"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\nThings exist in the boundless and indistinct, where names are unknown. When they descend and manifest, names arise.\nNames are the function of the Dao.\nThe sage governs the world with the nameless simplicity.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Employing the traceless, things transform of themselves.\"\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Spiritually transform them, and the people will be fittingly ordered.\"\nIn the past, Emperor Taizong of Tang governed the world, and the myriad regions submitted. Through the transformation of the nameless, without relying on might or punishment, he adjudicated three hundred death sentences, and the world had no transgressors in the judicial courts. A peck of grain cost three coins, and travelers journeyed a thousand miles without carrying provisions.\nThe flourishing of this Dao lay in its namelessness.\n\nThus, the Supreme Lord said: \"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\nIn the beginning of human cultivation, there is no name. Through cultivation, it arises—this is the name of the perfected person.\n\nThe Dao has purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\nThe Dao reveals its greatness.\nThe Lord Lao said: \"I do not know the name of the Great Dao, so I provisionally call it the Dao.\"\nThough without form or substance, without emotion or nature, without name or appearance, it can flow as singular qi.\nWithin this singular qi, there is purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth must embody the Dao.\nThe body must be pure and return from turbidity; the spirit must be still and return from movement.\nWhen purity and turbidity, movement and stillness are properly aligned, this may be called the Dao.\n\nThus, it is said: \"There is purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\"\nMaster Wenzi said: \"When the time is pure, be pure; when turbid, be turbid; when it is time to act, act.\"\nThis is called harmonizing with the light and blending with the dust, upholding the Dao of purity and tranquility.\n\nIn the Qingyuan era of the Tang dynasty, there was a hunter named Sun Shou who lived by the sea and made his living through hunting.\n\nOne day, amidst a great marsh, wildfire suddenly swept through the grasses and trees, its flames and smoke stretching to the heavens, reducing all vegetation to ashes. Only one cluster of plants remained lush and verdant, untouched by the blaze. Sun Shou, struck by doubt, approached it and saw nestled among the greenery a Daoist hermitage. Pushing open the door and stepping inside, he found an old man of about seventy, seated at a desk unrolling a scroll of scripture to read.\n\nSun Shou bowed and inquired, \"What is it that you are reading, Master?\"\n\nThe old man started in surprise, \"Who has come here?\"\n\nSun Shou replied, \"I am but a hunter. Just now, I saw the wildfire consume all the grasses and trees, yet only your dwelling remained untouched by the flames.\"\n\nThe old man said, \"I have lived in this hermitage for over four hundred years and have never witnessed such transformations of water or fire.\"\n\nShou asked, \"What scripture were you reciting earlier, Master?\"\n\nThe old man replied, \"It is the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, Expounded by the Most High Lord Lao*.\"\n\nShou asked, \"What is meant by the *Scripture of Purity*?\"\n\nThe old man said, \"Sit, and I will tell you. Purity and tranquility are the Dao and virtue. Thus, my dwelling in purity and tranquility is my fundamental nature. Purity and tranquility conjoined with softness and harmony are my steadfast practice. Purity and tranquility that respond and transform without end are my transformations. Purity and tranquility that are serene and unadorned are my virtue. By upholding this purity and tranquility, I transform without limit—what fear have I of fire?\n\nWhen the time is pure, be pure; when turbid, be turbid; when it is time to act, act; when still, be still. By practicing this Way, what fear have I of fire?\"\n\nUpon hearing the Dao, Sun Shou cast aside his bow and arrows to pay reverence. He received the scripture, awakened to the Way, and likewise gained renown in the world.\n\nThe Great Dao encompasses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness. Heaven is pure, earth turbid; heaven moves, earth is still. The Great Dao, in its ultimate formlessness, flows through the unity of primordial qi—within it, purity and turbidity arise. Pure qi congeals and ascends to form heaven; turbid qi flows downward to become earth. Thus, heaven is yang, and yang delights in movement; earth is yin, and yin delights in stillness. Movement is the qi of heaven; stillness is the qi of earth. Hence, it is said: heaven is pure, earth turbid; heaven moves, earth is still.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven is pure and at peace; earth is turbid and solid. Solidity allows for establishment. Heaven moves and transforms; earth is still and serene. Serenity allows for adaptability.\" This is what is meant by heaven being pure and earth turbid, heaven moving and earth still.\n\nDoes reciting this scripture yield verification?\n\nIt is answered: In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Bai Renzhe, who served as magistrate of Zhuyang County. While transporting grain to Liaodong, he suddenly encountered a great storm. All around, darkness descended, and waves surged violently. Renzhe was seized by terror. Then, a voice from the void spoke: \"You have received the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility of the Most High Lord Lao*—why not recite it swiftly?\" Renzhe hastily recited it over thirty times. Suddenly, a golden light emanated from his mouth. Soon after, the wind subsided, and the waves calmed. Over three hundred fellow travelers witnessed the golden light streaming from his mouth. Upon returning home, Renzhe donated his entire salary to sponsor a grand Yellow Register Offering and an Unobstructed Great Assembly, commissioning the carving of printing blocks to distribute three thousand copies of the true scripture. Renzhe lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen before passing away in seated meditation. Such is the verification of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nMan is pure, woman turbid; man moves, woman is still. Man is yang; woman is yin. The yang of man is pure and governs movement; the yin of woman is turbid and governs stillness. These two principles fundamentally speak of yin and yang, of turbidity and purity, of movement and stillness—thus it is said: man is pure, woman turbid.\n\nThis is how the Most High further divided the Great Dao, enveloping heaven and earth within the primordial qi of the Hunyuan. Heaven governs the light and pure, giving rise to yang; yang governs movement. Earth governs the heavy and turbid, giving rise to yin; yin governs stillness. Through the interaction of yin and yang, movement and stillness intertwine, and primordial essence descends. With the descent of primordial essence, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When heaven and earth intermingle in harmony, the myriad things transform in purity.\" This is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\n\nFor those who cultivate the truth, if they can circulate the true water of the kidneys as the Infant Brother and the true fire of the heart as the Maiden, causing the true fire to descend and the true water to ascend, then the ten thousand spirits will abide long and not scatter. When the ten thousand spirits do not scatter, one attains longevity and enduring vision—this is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven is yang, earth is yin—they interact to generate the myriad things. Movement and stillness unite—this is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\"\n\nDoes reading this scripture yield verification?\n\nIn the Linde era of Emperor Gaozong’s reign during the Tang dynasty, Dou Dexuan, an official, was dispatched as an emissary to Yangzhou. As he crossed the Huai River...\n\nWhen the boat had already pulled away from the shore by several dozen paces, Dexuan saw a man on the bank, his appearance gaunt and haggard. He said to the boatman, \"That man is destitute and forlorn—let us ferry him across.\" The boatman poled the boat back to the shore, allowing the man to board. Midway across the river, seeing the man’s famished countenance, Dexuan ordered his attendants to take provisions and give them to the man, who ate his fill. Once they reached the opposite bank, Dexuan mounted his horse and departed, but the man followed closely behind for several *li* more. Perplexed, Dexuan turned and asked, \"Where are you going?\" The man replied, \"I am no mortal—I am a messenger from the Fengdu underworld. I have been sent to Yangzhou to pursue you, Dou Dexuan.\" Hearing this, Dexuan was greatly alarmed. He dismounted, bowed, and wept as he pleaded, \"I am Dexuan—what means might there be to resolve this?\" The ghostly messenger said, \"Can you recite any scriptures?\" Dexuan replied, \"Throughout my life, I have recited the *Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Ever-Clear and Tranquil True Scripture*.\" The messenger said, \"I sensed your Dao-infused *qi* and your profound compassion, your virtue of mercy and relief. In gratitude for the meal you gave me in the boat, I shall grant you a month’s reprieve. Though my superiors will punish me for this delay, within this month, recite ten thousand scrolls of scripture, and a sage will surely descend.\" With that, he vanished suddenly.\n\nDexuan forgot food and sleep, devoting himself entirely to recitation. Over thirty days, he completed the required number of recitations. Returning home, he lit incense and continued chanting the scripture. The messenger reappeared before him and said, \"You have now fulfilled the required number of recitations, and your lifespan is at its end. Previously, I was moved by your kindness in feeding me, but the underworld authorities have punished me for exceeding the time limit—thirty lashes on my back.\" He bared his back, and Dexuan saw the livid, crimson marks upon it. Dexuan then lay down upon his pillow, exhaled his final breath, and his soul departed. As he looked back, his body lay upon the bed, and his spirit followed the messenger out through the northern gate. After traveling more than ten *li*, they came upon a great city. Entering its walls, they saw nothing but brambles and thorns.\n\nAgain he saw an imposing government office, its gates sternly guarded, with a placard above reading: \"This is the Northern Bureau of Fengdu.\" The ghostly messenger said, \"I must go in first; wait here at the gate.\" Before long, the messenger emerged and said, \"The Great Emperor, upon hearing of your arrival, has issued a decree in delight. Next, an official in purple robes, holding a tablet of inquiry, came forth to express his gratitude.\" Baode Xuan was then ushered into the yamen, where he saw a magnificent hall. A kingly figure held a scepter of cold jade, and the attendants stood with solemn reverence. Upon the incense table lay a decree sealed in purple clay. The king received it, and Dexuan prostrated himself in obeisance. The decree, resplendent with golden light, was read aloud, and he rose after the final bow.\n\nIt proclaimed: \"This gentleman is a superior scholar, now in his seventies, who has long recited the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*. He is now appointed a Celestial Official. In the prisons of Fengdu, the sentences of all the condemned shall be reduced by one degree. This is a manifest reward in the world of the living, and his lifespan shall be extended by one *ji*.\" The messenger was then ordered to escort him home.\n\nDexuan bowed to the king, who returned the gesture with gratitude, and commanded the messenger to lead Dexuan to a jeweled hall.\n\nSuddenly, Dexuan awoke as if from a dream. Opening his eyes, he saw his family weeping around his bed. His kin said, \"You have been dead for three days.\" Dexuan replied, \"There was such holy business.\" Thereafter, he put his household in order, entered Jingling Abbey, and became a Daoist, devoting himself solely to the teachings of purity and stillness. Twelve years later, a purple cloud descended from the sky. A jade-clad youth led a pair of cranes before the courtyard and said to Dexuan, \"Please mount the crane’s back and depart.\" Dexuan leapt onto the crane, ascending slowly into the heavens. A rare fragrance lingered for a month. He left behind a poem:\n\nA hundred thousand threads of worldly affairs,\nThe fly’s fame, the snail’s gain—unworthy of sight.\nHow much better to awaken to this purity and stillness,\nWhen merit is full, ascend as an official of heaven.\n\nThe commentary states: Movement and stillness grind against each other, yin and yang interact, and thus the myriad things are born. Those who comprehend this Dao ascend as celestial officials. Dou Dexuan understood this. The root flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things. The root is primordial *qi*. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One is the primordial *qi* as the root. The branches are the myriad things. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the myriad things. This is the root of the Great Dao.\n\nThis passage from the Supreme Lord Lao once more expounds the principles of purity and turbidity, movement and stillness: the Dao gives birth to primordial *qi*, primordial *qi* descends as the root and flows forth, and from this flow the myriad things are born—thus, the branches. This is the descent of the root and the flow of the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven governs primordial *qi*, Earth encompasses primordial *qi*. The formless nurtures primordial *qi*, and primordial *qi*, though formless, nurtures the myriad things.\" Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things. Once primordial *qi* descends, it flows forth as the branches.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When primordial *qi* descends, in heaven it forms images, on earth it takes shape—transformation and manifestation are evident.\" In heaven, it forms images: the suspended images of the sun, moon, and stars. On earth, it takes shape: the mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees. Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The utmost yang is Heaven, the utmost yin is Earth. The reverent *qi* reaches the heart’s fire, and with water and fire in harmony, the myriad spirits are nurtured.\" Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is there proof in studying this true scripture?\"\nThe answer: \"To study this true scripture, one must save beings and deliver lives. In the Tang dynasty, there was Song Zhixuan of Fangzhou, who served as Assistant Officer in Qizhou. When he arrived, people said his residence was inauspicious, haunted by ghosts and malevolent spirits—of those who lived there, six or seven out of ten died. Zhixuan, who had always loved the Dao, was upright in heart and, from his youth, had recited the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*. He deeply understood its meaning and embodied its practice. Thus, he refused to believe: 'How could I not dwell in peace? Why heed such talk?' He resolutely took up residence in the house and composed a poem by Master Lü:\n\nA single grain of golden elixir ensures long life,\nTrue lead must refine the cyclical stems.\nFire draws the crimson phoenix’s marrow from the south,\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.\nThe crucible follows the earth at the center of the four seasons,\nThe medicine follows the three origins and eight trigrams.\nWith fasting and merit complete in nine revolutions,\nEven ghosts and spirits tremble at purity and stillness.\n\nZhixuan sat solemnly, circulating the fire-wheel to envelop his body. Red light filled the room as he silently recited the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*. Around the second watch, a woman with disheveled hair and a bloodstained face suddenly appeared before him. Zhixuan asked, 'Who are you?' The woman replied, 'I am a ghost with a grievance.' She bowed and wept, saying, 'I beg for your help. Today, I have encountered a man of the Dao and may finally voice my plight. Ten years ago, I was the wife of Liu, an Officer of Affairs. My husband was sent on a mission abroad and never returned. His younger brother forced himself upon me. When I resisted, he killed me, wrapped my body in felt, and hid it in the northwest corner of the hall, beneath the privy, where filth accumulated. Many have wished to report this, but all feared my form. Lacking the *qi* of the Dao, they died of terror upon seeing me. Your recitation of this scripture carries great merit and kindness. I beg your compassion.'\"\n\nZhixuan said, \"When I first took office, I had been in my post for only three days—I shall save you then. Now, disappear for the time being.\" The woman vanished.\n\nThree days later, when the time had elapsed, he sent men to dig in the privy, but they fell short by a foot. That night, Zhixuan once more sat upright as before, burning incense and reciting the scripture. Before the second watch had ended, the woman reappeared.\n\nZhixuan asked, \"I sent men to search for your remains, yet they were not found. Why is this?\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"Had they dug two feet farther north, they would have found my body. Search there at dawn to fulfill your kindness.\"\n\nThe woman then vanished. The next morning, men were sent to dig northward, and indeed, they uncovered an old felt wrapping containing a set of white bones. Zhixuan recited the *Scripture of Purity* once more, provided a set of clothing, and chose an auspicious site to bury her.\n\nThat night, the woman appeared again, her garments clean and her face washed. She bowed twice before the lamp.\n\nZhixuan asked, \"Since you were killed by another, why have you not sought retribution?\"\n\nShe answered, \"The man was once a Registrar in Jiangzhou. From childhood, he had recited the *Laozi’s Scripture on Constant Purity and Stillness*. For years, I petitioned the underworld authorities, but to no avail.\"\n\nZhixuan said, \"I shall report to that official, urging him to perform a fast and offer a *jiao* ritual, inscribing talismans on yellow registers and white petitions. Then you may ascend to heaven. Will you release this grievance?\"\n\nThe woman bowed twice and said, \"I am deeply grateful.\"\n\nAs the Dao was spoken, the woman vanished.\n\nZhixuan then submitted a leave request to his superior and obtained permission. He packed provisions, mounted his horse, and traveled directly to Jiangzhou, where he met the Registrar Liu.\n\nUpon meeting him, Zhixuan recounted the matter and asked, \"As a Registrar, who could have committed such a deed? I have heard you recite the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*—this shows a heart attuned to the Dao. Yet you have done this. Do you not know that while the law of officials punishes openly, the unseen spirits of ghosts and gods also exact justice? If you do not repent, how will you escape the karmic burden of this grievance?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Registrar Liu was greatly startled and said, \"I thank you, sir, for coming so far to resolve this entanglement. How dare I defy your counsel?\" He then gathered his family's wealth and held a grand *Huanglu* Offering for seven days and seven nights, inviting over a hundred Daoists to participate. He also printed ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness* to distribute as alms.\n\nAt noon that day, a woman of about thirty appeared, leading a treasure horse laden with ten thousand scrolls of scriptures. She said, \"By the power of this scripture and offering, I have received the decree of the Supreme Lord Lao to enter the Vermilion Palace and refine my true spirit, ascending as an Immortal of the Southern Palace. In my long life in the world, Military Advisor Song also became an Immortal of the Southern Palace.\" Having spoken, she slowly rose into the sky and departed.\n\nZhixuan and Registrar Liu then pledged themselves as fellow Daoists, vowing to uphold the true teachings. Zhixuan returned to Fangzhou, and upon reaching home, a green phoenix descended into his courtyard. He burned incense, and the green phoenix slowly drifted southward, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*In past lives, pure and awakened to the true scripture,*\n*Lifting sins and aiding the imperiled from punishment.*\n*Today, by this merit’s power,*\n*In the Vermilion Palace, spirit and form refine.*\n\nIt is said: The adept who cultivates the true, riding this merit, embodies the Dao and performs its works—understanding the principle of descending from root to branch, knowing the causes of the myriad things’ transformation; aiding the endangered, rescuing the distressed, and resolving grievances. With such purity and compassion, how could one not become an Immortal of the Southern Palace? The rank of Immortal of the Southern Palace was attained by Song Zhixuan, for he comprehended the descent from root to branch in the generation of the myriad things.\n\nThe pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness. The pure is the primordial *qi*; the turbid is the myriad things. Movement is spirit; stillness is form. The Supreme Lord speaks of the Dao, taking the singular *qi* as the ancestor of the myriad things—for the ancestor is the source. The human spirit takes the singular form as its abode, thus uniting as the fundamental basis. Without spirit, form cannot move; without form, spirit cannot endure. Spirit is the master; form is the abode. These two lines broadly speak of the Dao’s *qi* as the root of the myriad things, distinguishing purity and stillness. The pure is the primordial *qi*; the turbid is the form of the myriad things. If one can move with spirit while preserving and securing form, one becomes the foundation and source of the myriad things. Thus it is said: the pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: Without turbidity, purity cannot be perceived; without purity, turbidity cannot be perceived. Without the singular *qi*, the myriad things cannot be born; without the myriad things, the singular *qi* cannot be divided. Thus it is said: the pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness.\n\nMaster Wen said: In utmost purity, turbidity is seen—this is the pure as the source of the turbid. In utmost movement, stillness is contemplated—this is movement as the foundation of stillness. The adept who cultivates the true nurtures spirit with the singular *qi*, hence purity; nurtures the belly with the five flavors, hence turbidity. Thus spirit must move in accord, while form rests in stillness—this is the Dao of purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\n\nThis scripture has further verification. It is said: In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Yuan Tong from Tianshui. From childhood, he loved the Dao and devoted himself to reciting the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*, chanting it forty-nine times daily. At the age of twenty, he was conscripted by An Lushan’s army and suddenly lost in battle. Yuan Tong fled, unaware of his path, and in the mountain thickets, unable to find food, he grew so weak he could not rise. He continued reciting the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, though without strength, awaiting death.\n\nSuddenly, a youth in green robes appeared, holding a bowl of rice, and offered it to him. Yuan Tong ate, and its fragrance and flavor were beyond description. After eating his fill, the youth said, \"The perfected nurture their pure bellies with pure *qi*; ordinary people nurture their turbid bellies with external things. The perfected circulate *qi* to harmonize spirit and settle stillness; ordinary people scatter spirit and deplete essence to delight in form. From childhood, you have loved the Dao and remained steadfast, reciting the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*—you have already borne the fruit of the Dao. The Supreme Lord has sent me to bestow this upon you. From now on, let this sustain you. Use spirit for the Dao, and you will no longer need to eat. Today, your name has been stricken from the Black Register and arranged in the Vermilion Palace. The Dao of purity and stillness is not in vain.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the youth vanished. From then on, Yuan Tong no longer ate and attained the wisdom of the six penetrations. He lived until the reign of Emperor Zhezong of the Song, though the events occurred in the time of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang—five hundred years passed, yet his face remained as that of a man of thirty. He often wandered between the Luo and Ru rivers, reciting only the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, and no one ever saw him eat. People called him the Master of Purity and Stillness. If someone suffered illness, no matter how distant, he would stroke them with his hand, and there was none who did not recover. Later, people imitated his touch.\n\nOnce, outside the gates of Bianjing, he cried out loudly: \"You seek chaos—I do not. You seek turbidity—I do not. You rush about—how can you live?\"\n\nSince attaining the Dao, five hundred years have passed—he severed the demonic and rejoiced in the divine. Riding clouds and mounting cranes, he ascended to the Jade Emperor’s celestial palace, dwelling forever in the Pavilion of Carefree Roaming.\n\nAs the recitation ended, a crane descended from the heavens. The Master swiftly mounted its back, rising gently upon the clouds. All below gazed upward in awe. From the sky fluttered a sheet of paper, inscribed with the words: *\"The Dao gives birth to purity.\"*\n\nThe *Dao-Giving Birth* comprises dozens of precepts.\n\nThe treatise states: The Great Dao cannot be seen, cannot be heard, yet none under heaven know it, none practice it. Though unseen and unknown, those who cultivate it truly possess the Dao.\n\nThe Most High said: My words are easily understood, easily practiced. Thus, the Dao descends to become primordial qi, the source of purity and turbidity, the foundation of movement and stillness. Through the interplay of purity and turbidity, the Great Dao is realized. Therefore, Yuan Tong, through utmost sincerity, awakened to the *Scripture of the Most High’s Purity and Stillness* and ultimately ascended to join the immortals. How fitting indeed!\n\nIf one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will wholly return. Heaven and earth are the descendants of the Great Dao; humanity and all beings are its offspring. The Most High teaches that if one can receive the ancestral qi of the Great Dao, rendering body and mind empty and numinous, spirit and qi pure and still—thus embodying the Great Dao—one unites in virtue with heaven and earth. Therefore, heaven and earth naturally follow and submit, wholly returning in devotion.\n\nThus it is said: If one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will wholly return.\n\nThose who practice the teachings of purity and stillness—*The Book of Changes* states: *\"Resembling heaven and earth, thus nothing is contrary.\"* The adept of cultivation must also embrace purity, stillness, and non-action, embodying the true and constant teachings of the Great Dao, fathoming the nature of all things, and knowing the ways of ghosts and spirits. Thus, resembling heaven and earth, all their actions and deeds will not contravene them, and all will return in submission.\n\nThus it is said: If one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will wholly return.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: Those who can abide in purity and stillness share virtue with the Supreme Ultimate, dwell alongside heaven and earth, and walk in step with the divine Dao. Those who achieve this will see heaven and earth wholly return. Is there evidence of this?\n\nThe answer states: During the Qingli era of the Tang dynasty, there was a Han, Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, who was exiled to Yunzhou. He had a daughter, twenty-six years of age, married to Wang Gui, Vice Director of the Left Secretariat. As Wang was her superior, his wife, née Han, remained in her parents’ home during her pregnancy. One night, around the third watch, a sound arose from the northwest corner. All the maidservants were asleep, but the young mistress, née Han, remained awake. She saw a general clad in armor, holding a golden hairpin, who declared: “I am General Wei of the Jin dynasty. I have dwelled here for several hundred years. How dare you give birth in this place? The stench of blood and filth offends me. If you do not move within three days, I will kill you.” Take heed of this. Han replied: “I will move.” Then he vanished. At daybreak, she instructed her maidservants to report the matter to Vice Director Han. He said: “A woman’s *qi* is depleted and weak—how could she truly see such a thing? How could this be? He refused to move her and merely added more maidservants to keep her company.\n\nOnce more, as the third watch approached, the general reappeared. All the maidservants saw him and fled in terror. The general rebuked them, saying: “I have spoken to you of the Dao—why have you not moved her? If she remains here by tomorrow, I will kill her.” Han replied: “I beg you, General, calm your anger. I will move her tomorrow.” Then the general vanished.\n\nAt daybreak, the maidservants tearfully reported the young mistress’s words to Vice Director Han. He said: “A woman in childbirth cannot be moved before seven days have passed—how could she dare? Her *qi* and blood are depleted, and she raves in delirium.” They answered: “The maidservants saw him as well.” Han replied: “Women are all prone to believing in such omens.” He firmly refused to comply.\n\nThat night, General Wei appeared once more and said: “I have warned you three times, yet you still refuse to move her.” Seeing that she had not been moved, his anger flared. He struck Han with his hairpin, piercing her heart. With a single cry, she perished. Her father, brandishing a sword, rushed in. Overcome with grief, her parents wept bitterly and sent an urgent letter to her husband.\n\nUpon receiving the news, her husband, Wang Gui, was stricken with sorrow. Disregarding his official duties, he returned home. Ten *li* west of Sizhuang Town, he saw a woman approaching from afar. As she drew near, he recognized her as his wife. Dismounting at once, he asked: “How have you come to be here?” All his attendants saw her as well. She replied: “I was killed by General Wei of the Jin dynasty. My grievance remains unaddressed. As a man of stature, can you not avenge your wife?” She wept. Wang Gui, overcome with grief, stepped forward, but she said: “The paths of the living and the dead diverge—do not come near me. I have heard that in this town there is a Master Tian, who from childhood has recited the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue in Supreme Purity* and practiced the Way of quiescence and non-action. He possesses the power to subdue spirits and the virtue to commune with Heaven. As the text says: ‘If one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth will all return to them.’ Seek him to redress my wrong.” She told him where to find the master.\n\nWang Gui visited Master Tian and recounted the events in full. The master replied: “I shall intercede for you above with the Mysterious Heavens and below with the Earth Deity to save your wife.” He then led Wang Gui into a separate chamber. As the first watch began, Master Tian donned his court robes, took up a jade tablet, and held a censer of incense. Closing his eyes, he knelt and lit seven lamps, chanting an incantation to commence his prayer.\n\nSuddenly, a celestial warrior appeared in the chamber and declared: “By decree of Heaven, I descend into the netherworld.” The warrior presented the edict, then vanished. The master said: “I now bear the Emperor of Heaven’s decree. We shall go together to the underworld to seize General Wei.” He took a clean mat and had Wang Gui lie upon it, whereupon he fell into a stupor. The master sat beside him, projecting his spirit, and guided Wang Gui’s spirit out the door.\n\nAfter traveling several *li*, they saw a great city. The sky was dim, and armored soldiers on either side wielded halberds. Upon seeing the master, they all lowered their weapons and bowed in reverence. Entering the gate, a crimson-robed scribe hastily announced their arrival. Dozens of attendants, upon seeing the master, likewise prostrated themselves, crying out: “The Perfected Master Tian has arrived!”\n\nMoments later, green-clad youths bearing banners approached, leading a figure clad in dragon robes, wearing a *yuanyou* crown, and holding a jade tablet. They announced: “This is the Great Emperor of Fengdu.” Upon seeing the Perfected Master Tian, the emperor exchanged courtesies and invited him to proceed first, showing him the utmost deference as if they were old acquaintances.\n\nA ghostly attendant asked Wang Gui: “Who are you?” He replied: “I am an attendant of the Perfected Master Tian.” The attendant asked no further questions. Ascending the hall, the master and the emperor sat facing each other. The master presented the decree for the emperor’s inspection, and Wang Gui, along with the others, paid their respects.\n\nBefore long, a blue-robed youth announced: “The Patrol General is to swiftly apprehend the yin ghost General Wei of the Jin dynasty in the netherworld.” A warrior clad in golden chainmail, wielding a great sword, responded to the summons. Soon after, he reported: “The yin ghost General Wei has been captured.” Wang Gui said: “Bring him forth.”\n\nSeveral black-robed officials dragged a man before the steps. The emperor said: “You, a yin ghost for years, killed countless living beings in your time and even harmed an innocent woman.” General Wei replied: “I warned her repeatedly, but she refused to move. In a moment of anger, I killed her. Consider my meritorious service in the Jin dynasty.” The emperor said: “Even as a yin ghost, you dare kill the living—what merit do you claim? You shall receive three hundred strokes of the iron rod and be exiled to the Northern Yin Mountain for a thousand years.” The attendants bound him and threw him to the ground, striking his back three hundred times. His cries of agony were unbearable to hear.\n\nAfter the punishment, an official said: “By decree, he is to be sent to Yin Mountain.” Wang Gui asked about Han’s whereabouts. The attendants replied: “She is here—bring her forward.” They led her from the side corridor. Han knelt weakly before Wang Gui. He asked: “What is to be done?” The attendants said: “Her dwelling has been destroyed. She may borrow a body to be reborn.” The judge consulted the register and found that Han was fated to live sixty-six years, with forty years remaining. At present, a girl named Shouniang, daughter of a Wang family in Qingzhou, was due to die at twenty-six. They ordered Han to enter Shouniang’s body and revive, and the decree was carried out.\n\nWang Gui begged the master to depart, and he followed, still in a daze. Suddenly, he awoke. The master said: “Sir, this matter must remain secret.”\n\nWang Gui bowed repeatedly and asked, “How did you come to wander here?” The master replied: “I recite the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*. By following its teachings, I harmonize my virtue with Heaven and Earth.\n\n*When one abides in constant clarity and stillness,\nHeaven and Earth all return to them.*\n\nReturn home at once and seek your wife at the Wang household in Qingzhou.”\n\nWang Gui took leave of the master and departed. On the road, he hastened to Yunzhou, where his wife Han had already been laid to rest. He went directly to the Wang household in Qingzhou and recognized his wife’s child. The Wang family’s daughter, Shouniang, had been dead for three days when she revived and said: “I am the daughter of Han, Vice Minister of Rites. My father is now Prefect of Yunzhou.” Before she could finish explaining, Wang Gui arrived at the Wang residence. Seeing Shouniang, she immediately said: “My husband has come.” Her voice was nothing like Shouniang’s former tone. Wang Gui said: “Shouniang’s voice is now entirely Han’s.” He recounted the full story, and the Wang family then traveled to Yunzhou to meet Han’s parents. Her voice was unchanged from before. Both husband and wife suddenly awakened to the Great Dao, and they exhausted their family wealth to carve and print over one hundred thousand scrolls of scriptures, distributing them in all directions. They held a grand offering to the heavens in gratitude.\n\nAfterward, Wang Gui and his wife returned to Temple Village to thank Master Tian. Upon completing their thanks, the master said: “You and your wife may cultivate together.” Wang Gui followed his words, resigning from office. He hung up his official robes, became a Daoist, and resided at the Fude Abbey in Chang’an. Han became a Daoist nun and lived at the Jade Capital Abbey. Each lived to one hundred and twenty years before passing.\n\nThe treatise says: *Abiding in stillness, yet responsive and penetrating—clarity and non-action.* Master Tian followed the scripture of the Most High and practiced the laws of Heaven. Above, he moved the vault of heaven; below, he communicated with the earth. He caused the Northern Emperor to descend and adjudicate grievances—truly, *when one abides in constant clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return to them.*\n\nNow, the spirit delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desire pulls it away. At birth, a person’s spirit is clear and their heart is still. As they grow, they are drawn by emotions and desires—this is the nature of life. Thus, the character for *desire* (欲) is composed of *valley* (谷) and *lack* (欠). *Valley* signifies the absence of leakage, while *lack* denotes insufficiency. When the spirit clings to love, it becomes *emotion*; when the heart clings to craving, it becomes *greed.*\n\nMaster Kangcang said: “Water is naturally clear, yet it cannot remain so when muddied by earth. Human nature is naturally still, yet it cannot remain so when disturbed by affairs.” *Disturbed* (汨) means chaos. The Most High spoke of these two principles: the spirit naturally delights in clarity and stillness, yet cannot attain them because the heart fails to embody the Dao of clarity and stillness. The heart harbors emotions of attachment, which disturb and disrupt it, preventing clarity and stillness. Thus, *the spirit delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it.* The heart is fundamentally inclined toward clarity and stillness, yet it cannot attain them because it is pulled by the greed of desire. Hence, *the heart delights in stillness, yet desire pulls it away.*\n\nMaster Wenzhong said: “The contented always delight in having no wants; the greedy always worry over insufficiency.” The contented delight in having no wants, so their spirit delights in clarity and their heart in stillness. The greedy worry over insufficiency, so their heart is disturbed and pulled by desire.\n\nMaster Baiyun said: “Desire is the source of greed and attachment, the root of excess and indulgence.” If one can embrace the Dao of clarity and stillness, the spirit will be clear. When the spirit is clear, the heart cannot disturb it; when the heart is still, desire cannot pull it away.\n\nSome ask: “Can one who studies this scripture attain a spirit polished and undisturbed, a heart still and unburdened by desire? Is there proof?” The answer: In the past, Emperor Yizong of Tang had a daughter titled Princess Tongchang, who married the imperial son-in-law Wei. The princess found her official residence unsatisfactory, so the emperor bestowed upon her a mansion surpassing even the imperial palace—its halls and pavilions adorned with gold and jade. He granted her five million strings of cash from the inner treasury. Yet the princess was still not content. She petitioned again, saying she lacked treasures. The emperor emptied the inner treasury of its jewels to fill her mansion, adorning every chamber, door, and window with rare and precious gems. He had mortars and pestles, food chests, water troughs, cauldrons, and basins made of gold and silver; sieves and dustpans woven from silver thread; beds and couches fashioned from crystal, lapis lazuli, and tortoiseshell. Golden tortoises and silver cranes were placed about, and five-colored jade was carved into plates, with hundred-jeweled inlays forming patterns.\n\nStill, the princess’s desires arose anew. She petitioned for grain, so the emperor opened the inner treasury and bestowed fifty *hu* of golden wheat and silver rice. She then complained that her halls lacked curtains and drapes. The emperor presented her with curtains of linked pearls, their edges strung with gems. He also gave her a *cold-warm medicine* fan—when hung in winter, it brought warmth; in summer, coolness. He bestowed upon her a nine-phoenix hairpin, which, when worn, emitted a nine-colored radiance. Whenever she ventured out, she rode in a seven-jeweled carriage, its sides inlaid with five-colored jade. Fragrant sachets held rare incenses—warding off cold, evil, and dust—all tributes from foreign lands. Her carriage’s canopy was adorned with carved dragons of mixed jewels and camphor, gold filigree, crystal, and agate. Dragons and phoenixes of auspicious design were set upon trays of onyx and carnelian, the canopy’s edges fringed with pearls. At its peak sat a lotus of green jade, crowned with a single golden pearl, its radiance rising three feet high. Golden threads suspended jade tassels, and from within, celestial music naturally resounded.\n\nWith every outing, fragrant winds filled the roads, their scent lingering for half a year. Her pearls gleamed brilliantly, casting a dazzling light.\n\nThose who gazed upon it often saw only its brilliance, never its source. Though the princess’s wealth and nobility were boundless, her heart remained unsatisfied, her thoughts never reaching the realm of Penglai—thus she fell ill.\n\nThe princess resided within the palace, and from childhood had reverently recited the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* as spoken by the Most High Lord Lao. She summoned the imperial physician, Mi Zong, to treat her. By evening, she presented him with a two-inch candle of fragrant wax, bidding him take it home. Its scent was intensely pungent, spreading through the neighboring quarters. When visitors came to inquire, Mi Zong truthfully explained that it was the candle’s fragrance. The candle, two inches long, bore five-colored patterns; when lit, it grew warm, and by dawn its scent remained unexhausted, perceptible for three or four hundred paces. Its smoke ascended, forming the shapes of canopied pavilions and towers, with blossoms of rare and wondrous flowers.\n\nThe princess’s illness grew severe. She ordered her attendants to fetch the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* by the Most High Lord Lao, and from a green jade casket she took a precious incense called \"Heaven-Piercing Fragrance,\" burning it as she recited the sacred scripture. Before she could complete seven recitations, two crimson-robed messengers appeared, saying: \"The Prefect summons you.\" The princess replied: \"I am the daughter of an emperor—how dare you summon me?\" She commanded her attendants to seize them, but they did not obey. The messengers said: \"This concerns the affairs of the Netherworld—what does it matter that you are an imperial daughter?\" With their hands, they pulled her to her feet. The princess cried out to her attendants, but none came to her aid; the two messengers seized and dragged her away.\n\nThey seemed to exit through Chang’an’s northern gate. After traveling several *li*, the princess’s feet grew sore, and she could walk no further. One messenger said: \"I shall fetch a horse.\" In an instant, he led forth a white steed.\n\nThrough murky darkness they journeyed over a hundred *li* before arriving at a great city, where signs of human habitation appeared. The princess said, \"I am hungry.\" The attendant replied, \"The food here is all charred to the core—its stench is unbearable to see or smell.\" In an instant, the wind blew and all returned to its former state. The princess covered her eyes, unable to bear the sight.\n\nThen she saw dozens of men and women, stripped naked, their bodies seared by red-hot iron rods, blood flowing to the ground until it became a mire of gore. The princess asked the attendant, \"What crimes have these people committed to suffer such torment?\" The attendant replied, \"In the world above, these are the sins of extravagance and indulgence.\"\n\nThe princess gasped, \"And what of my fate?\" The attendant said, \"It will be the same.\" In that moment, a ghostly official appeared, two horns sprouting from his head, wielding an iron hammer. He commanded, \"Princess, remove your clothes.\" The princess said, \"I am the daughter of an emperor!\" The ghost replied, \"This court does not recognize imperial daughters—remove your clothes.\" Knowing resistance was futile, she began to remove her headdress and robes, silently reciting *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nThe ghostly official urged, \"Hurry, remove your clothes!\" As she recited, she removed another garment. The ghost then reached out to seize her clothing. The princess felt as though boiling oil had been poured into her heart, the pain unbearable. She recited more urgently, reaching the passage on the dissolution of the Three Poisons. Suddenly, a golden light appeared, and the ghostly officials all rose into the air in reverence. A perfected being descended upon purple clouds—it was the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.\n\nFrom the Palace of Great Purity came the sound of recitation: *The Scripture of Primordial Lord Lao on Constant Purity and Tranquility*. \"By reciting this scripture once, you have reached the realm of the Three Clarities. The Supreme Lord Lao has sent me to descend into the nether prison and absolve the sins of the condemned.\" The princess bowed deeply to the perfected one.\n\nThe princess said, \"It was by reciting this scripture that I came here—I am the daughter of the present Emperor Yizong.\" The perfected one asked, \"What crime have you committed to be here?\" The ghostly officials replied, \"The sin of greed and desire.\" Just then, the assembled ghostly officials exclaimed, \"It is the Great Emperor of Fengdu!\" All paid homage to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One radiated light, illuminating the nether prison. He addressed the imperial daughter: \"There is no greater sin than desire. Desire is the root of licentiousness and disorder. There is no greater sin than greed. Greed is the source of usurpation and envy. To weigh it lightly is to destroy oneself; to weigh it heavily is to ruin one’s family. Those in the world who do not awaken to the Dao do not comprehend the principle of purity and tranquility. They do not know the subtlety of contentment, only seeking fine foods to sate their mouths and wealth and honor to adorn their bodies. Yet the sweetness of such food is the axe that severs life, and the extravagance of riches and luxury is the mechanism that invites resentment. Once resentment arises, how can one avoid the hells? Why not embrace emptiness and purity, kindness and benevolence, loyalty and trust, filial piety and harmony, modesty and frugality, gentleness and humility, and cleanliness—thus aligning with the Dao? Do not cling to extravagance; uphold simplicity. Extravagance is the cause of hell; frugality is the foundation of heaven.\"\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said to the princess, \"I shall save you. In the world above, will you reform your extravagant desires?\" The princess bowed again and said, \"I will reform.\" The perfected one said, \"I have the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds, the Six Fasts and Three Assemblies, the Five Laba Festivals and Five Taboo Days—can you observe them?\" The princess replied, \"I can.\"\n\nThe perfected one said, \"If you uphold them, you will become a celestial official; if you fail, you will become a lowly ghost.\" He continued, \"The Five Precepts are: first, do not kill; second, do not indulge in desire; third, do not speak falsely with the heart; fourth, do not steal; fifth, do not engage in licentiousness. The Ten Good Deeds are: first, honor and support your parents; second, be loyal to your sovereign and teachers; third, let go of all things in your heart; fourth, restrain anger and prevent wrongdoing; fifth, cease conflict and resolve enmity; sixth, humble yourself to aid the poor; seventh, give life and succor to others; eighth, dig wells and plant trees by the roadside; ninth, benefit others and eliminate harm; tenth, praise the Three Treasures, explain the scriptures to others, and always harbor good thoughts. Those who constantly practice these Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds will have celestial beings and benevolent spirits protect them, forever free from disaster and ever blessed with good fortune—provided their resolve is steadfast.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Six Fasts?\" The perfected one replied, \"The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month.\" The princess asked, \"What are the Ten Fasts?\" The perfected one said, \"The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month. On these ten days, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Save from Suffering deliver the souls of the condemned from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Three Assemblies?\" The perfected one replied, \"The seventh day of the first month is the Upper Assembly of Ascension; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Middle Assembly of Celebration; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Lower Assembly of Establishment.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Five Laba Festivals?\" The perfected one said, \"The first day of the first month is the Heavenly Laba; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly Laba; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Laba of the Dao and Virtue; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Laba of the People’s Year; the twelfth month is the Laba of Kings and Lords.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Five Taboo Days?\" The perfected one replied, \"First, the day of Jiazi, when the True Lord Taiyi records people’s transgressions; second, the day of Gengshen, when the Three Corpses report people’s sins; third, one’s own birthday, when the Star Officials tally one’s merits and deeds; fourth, the Eight Festivals, when the Eight Spirits assess people’s good and evil; fifth, the Three Yuan days, when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water record people’s sins and blessings.\"\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said, \"On these days, you may perform rituals, observe fasts, recite scriptures, and make offerings to pray for protection.\" The princess bowed again to the perfected one and said, \"I will follow the Dao’s decrees in every detail.\" The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One then radiated light, illuminating the nether prison, and all within were reborn in heaven.\n\nThe stalwart azure-clad youth then led the princess to hasten her return. The Perfected One ascended into heaven and departed, transformed. The Great Emperor of the Northern Yin Fengdu and all the spirits and ghosts rejoiced greatly. The azure-clad youth guided the princess to a golden gate, pushed her through, and suddenly the princess awoke with a start. She found herself lying on a jade-inlaid bed, covered with brocade quilts. Opening her eyes, she saw her husband, the imperial son-in-law, and the court officials beside her, weeping as they surrounded her. The princess sat up, clutching the quilt. A palace attendant said, \"Princess, you have slept for a long time; we dared not disturb you.\" The princess replied, \"Wealth and honor are like sparks struck from stone, glory and splendor like fleeting reflections on water—time passes as in a dream of Southern Branch. Her illness was instantly cured.\n\nThe princess then entered the palace to address the emperor, returning all her treasures to the imperial treasury and begging to renounce her worldly ties to follow the Dao. The emperor asked, \"Why?\" The princess recounted in full the events of the netherworld. The emperor, overjoyed, granted her request and transformed the Golden Immortal Abbey in the Revered Immortal Precinct into the Jade Perfection Abbey. After entering the abbey, the princess never again crossed its threshold. Though nobles, relatives, and even her husband sought audience, the princess ordered the gates guarded, and none could see her. Each day, she recited only the *Supreme Venerable Lord’s Explanation of the Perfect Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*, never growing lax.\n\nThree years later, she again beheld the Perfected One within a radiance of red light, who said to her, \"Your ascension draws near; you shall attain the rank of celestial immortal. Hasten to cultivate merit and fruition.\" With these words, the Perfected One vanished. The princess then performed the great Yellow Register Retreat.\n\nOn the fifteenth night of the Upper Prime Festival, phoenixes and cranes descended from heaven. The moonlight was as bright as day, and fragrant breezes filled the air. The cranes alighted in the courtyard, and the princess mounted a phoenix’s back, ascending slowly into the sky. She left behind a *Tang Duoling* lyric:\n\n*Life and fate—how to weigh them?*\n*Lavish splendor—do not overindulge.*\n*Guard chastity, health, frugality, peace, and harmony;*\n*Measure yourself against others, and no calamity shall befall.*\n*Alas! The young grow old, the noble grow poor—*\n*Such is the way of the world.*\n\n*Shatter the nest of strife,*\n*Strike open the lock of fame and gain.*\n*Calm the heart, refine the nature, let time slip by;*\n*In silence, ponder the highs and lows, sorrow and joy.*\n*Suddenly awakened—*\n*It was all a dream of Southern Branch,*\n*Such is the way of the world.*\n\nAll who heard it spoke of it, and everyone copied the lyric. In the capital, it was revered and offerings were made. This was the verification of Princess Tongchang’s enlightenment through the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nThus it is said: The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in clarity, yet desires entangle it.\n\nIt is further stated: Those who can maintain purity and tranquility cannot be swayed by gluttony or craving, nor imperiled by peril or hardship. They are not deluded by rank or emolument, nor do poverty and lowliness alter their resolve. They are unmoved by slander or praise, nor is their spirit disordered by glory or splendor. Princess Tongchang entered the dream of Fengdu, was moved by the admonitions of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, and accepted them. She resolutely abandoned wealth and honor, embracing solitude and simplicity. Having fulfilled the Three Precepts in full, she became a perfected immortal.\n\nOne must constantly dispel desires, and the heart will naturally grow still; calm the heart, and the spirit will naturally become clear. Desire is the appearance of drifting and wandering; clarity is the appearance of still water. These two lines are the Supreme Venerable Lord’s repeated exhortation to relinquish attachment and abandon desire. If one can let go of attachment, no emotional desires arise, and no greed takes root, then the spirit will naturally grow still and the heart will naturally become clear. If one can extinguish the wandering attachments of the heart and still it, and further calm the heart to the stillness of water, then purity will remain unshaken. Unshaken purity allows the spirit to become naturally clear and tranquil. Thus it is said: Constantly dispel desires, and the heart will naturally grow still; calm the heart, and the spirit will naturally become clear.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: Abandon what others contend for, and do not contend—thus dispelling desires, the heart will naturally grow still. What all things discard, one should not covet; without covetousness, the heart will naturally become clear. One who can calm the heart will find their spirit naturally clear. Such is the awakening of the Dao of purity and tranquility for those who cultivate the truth.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: The noble person washes their heart with purity and tranquility; the petty person is swayed by avarice and attachment. Therefore, the sage constantly dispels desires, and the heart naturally grows still; calms the heart, and the spirit naturally becomes clear.\n\nMaster Liu said: The spirit is the master of the heart. Thus, when the spirit is tranquil, the heart is harmonious, and when the heart is harmonious, the body is whole. When the spirit is disordered, the heart is agitated, and when the heart is agitated, the body is harmed. First, govern the spirit. Therefore, the sage nurtures the spirit with serenity and harmony. Harmony means relinquishing cravings and desires. Thus, nurturing the spirit with harmony brings inner peace, while dwelling in pure thought and settling the heart prevents external allurements. When spirit is harmonious and heart is clear, the body is unburdened. Unburdened, one has dispelled desires. Thus it is said: Dispel desires.\n\nSomeone asked: Has anyone since ancient times been able to dispel desires?\nThe answer: Yes. In the Southern History, during the reign of Emperor Song, there was a prime minister, Yuan Tianfu, who was greedy and covetous. In all state affairs, great or small, nothing proceeded without bribes of silk and wealth. Once, two men in the street, drunk, quarreled over a licentious matter and killed one of them. Yuan Tianfu said to the killer: \"If you can produce a thousand bolts of silk, I can spare your life.\" The man offered eight hundred bolts. Yuan Tianfu said: \"That is not enough to secure your pardon.\" The family of the deceased, hearing this, offered a thousand bolts to have the killer executed. Fearing death, the killer produced twelve hundred bolts. The deceased’s family, unable to match the sum, ruled that the killing was committed in drunkenness and with negligence, and sentenced the man to sixty strokes before releasing him. The people had no recourse for grievances, and many suffered injustice. Yuan Tianfu’s exactions knew no bounds; he built pavilions and terraces in his home, using over a thousand measures of gold and jade, surpassing even the imperial palace.\n\nThe courtyard teemed with beauties, all of national renown. Each meal cost a hundred strings of cash. From dawn to dusk, he indulged in pleasure, and was fond of the arts of alchemy, profiting greatly from them. Suddenly, a Daoist appeared at the gate and declared, \"I possess the arts of alchemy.\" Hearing this, Yuan Tianfu hastily summoned him to his residence. Upon meeting, Yuan descended the steps to bow and asked, \"What arts can you teach me?\" The master replied, \"I wish only to drink my fill.\" Yuan said, \"You have not shown your arts, yet you demand wine first—are you not greedy?\" The master replied, \"You turn life into death and death into life, extorting without measure. Your halls number a thousand, your vaults overflow with gold and jade, your concubines a thousand, your lust boundless. Yet you seek the arts of alchemy. What desire could surpass yours? Do you accuse *me* of greed?\" Shamed by the master’s rebuke, Yuan grew furious and cried, \"Where is this rustic from? How dare he insult me!\" He ordered his attendants to seize him.\n\nSuddenly, he vanished without a trace. In his place, he left behind a *lyric to the tune \"Dian Jiang Chun\"*:\n\nWealth and honor, glory and splendor,\nHigh office of the first rank, mighty deeds of merit—\nAll stem from greed and craving,\nAwaiting the iron-forged halls of judgment.\nYour household affairs now settled,\nYet the King of Hell prepares his reproach.\nWhat recourse remains?\nHow to find deliverance?\nThe debts of all men are inescapable.\n\nYuan Tianfu read the words and grew sullen and displeased. He retired to his private chamber. In his sleep, he dreamed he saw a lump of gold; overjoyed, he reached to take it, only to plummet to the ground and descend into darkness. Suddenly, all grew bright. Yuan looked around and saw hundreds of men shackled in fetters, some groaning, some wailing, their bodies crushed beneath great stones. He saw a placard inscribed: *\"The Prison of Greed and Craving.\"*\n\nSuddenly, a man in white robes, his hair unbound, spoke: \"My lord, why have you come so late? We have awaited you for a long time.\" Yuan asked, \"Who are you?\" The man replied, \"I am one of those you had killed. You accepted twelve hundred bolts of silk and spared my life—yet all I ask is that you restore it. You have wrongfully taken the lives of hundreds. Now, my lord, return my gold and treasures.\" Terrified, Yuan turned to flee, but the crowd seized him, demanding repayment of his debts. Several men hoisted a massive stone, three *zhang* long and five *chi* thick, ready to crush him. Then, as they dragged him down to place the stone upon him, a voice cried out: \"Hold! Do not crush him yet—his allotted lifespan is not yet exhausted. He has six more years.\"\n\nYuan looked and saw it was the master who had offered the arts of alchemy. The master led him to a great stone within the prison and seated him there. He said, \"I am the Star Lord of Venus. Though you hold the highest rank, you have not accumulated virtue or right conduct. Your heart is consumed by greed and desire—this is the root of misfortune.\" Yuan replied, \"Today, I deeply thank you for your rescue. Even if I ground my bones to dust, I could not repay you.\" The master asked, \"Have you ever recited any scriptures?\" Yuan answered, \"I have recited the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue by the Supreme Lord Lao, on Purity and Stillness*.\" The master said, \"No wonder you bear the aura of the Dao. This scripture’s power surpasses even mine. Have you not heard its words: *If one constantly dispels desire, the heart becomes still of itself; if one settles the heart, the spirit becomes clear of itself*?\"\n\nYuan said, \"Pray, instruct me.\" The master continued: \"The ears and eyes are enticed by sounds and sights, the nose and mouth by fragrances and flavors, the body by comfort and ease—all arise from desire. If these desires are not dispelled, the spirit scatters and cannot be preserved; the will and qi dissipate, harming the five viscera and leaving them unsettled. When cravings coil within the heart and spread like wild vines through the waves of excess, lingering in the realm of right and wrong—without cultivating virtue through wealth and conduct, how can one hope to live long? Thus, the sage purifies his eyes and does not see, stills his ears and does not hear, seals his mouth and does not speak, abandons the heart and forgets harm, values the body and scorns material things. He esteems power yet forgets action, delights in the Dao and forgets greed. Thus, even great profit cannot confine him, and he roams freely in accord with his nature. With qi vast and boundless, he returns to nurturing his form, and his nature is preserved whole; his heart is not wearied, and the Dao comes to him of itself.\"\n\nThe master said, \"My lord, you must reflect on this day and night, ten thousand times over.\" Yuan then took his leave of the master.\n\nThen someone called out, \"Minister Yuan!\" As the minister looked, he saw he was being pursued by murderers—he stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nSuddenly he awoke in a cold sweat, his heart trembling without cease. At that moment, the peasant Farmer Yuan came to a sharp realization: \"Wealth is the source of disaster, and greed the root of sin.\" Thereupon he removed his official seal and resigned his post, distributing the treasures of the imperial vault to relieve the poor. He arranged for the courtesans in his inner chambers to marry respectable men, and converted his mansions entirely into Daoist abbeys. Casting off his silken robes, he donned plain cloth; his diet became coarse grains and bland fare. Each day, he recited only the *Classic of Supreme Clarity by Lord Lao*. Following its precepts for a decade, he suddenly encountered the master from his original dream.\n\nFarmer Yuan bowed in reverence. The master said, \"You have advanced on the Way for several years—has it been arduous? Now that you have released your karmic debts, nothing bars your ascent to the immortal path. Truly, one who forgets desire and relinquishes greed becomes a companion in the cultivation of a serene heart and nurtured spirit. You have now been registered in the Vermilion Numinosity and your name inscribed in the Azure Vault. Here is a divine elixir—swallow it.\"\n\nFarmer Yuan replied, \"I no longer eat.\"\n\nThe master said, \"Thus the *Inner Transmission of the Immortal Classic* states: 'If eating does not cease, the body will not become light; if sensual pleasures do not cease, the spirit will not become clear; if thoughts do not cease, the heart will not be at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the spirit will not be efficacious; if the spirit is not efficacious, the work will not be accomplished.' The essential Way does not lie in gazing at stars or worshipping the Dipper, nor in tormenting the self or exhausting the body—it lies solely in the square inch of the heart, utterly still and empty of all things. The Way of immortality is the eternal preservation of life. Thus, the Dao is nothing other than the cultivation of the heart.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Dao is attained through the heart; the heart is illuminated by the Dao. When the heart is bright, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the numinous clarity resides within the body. Like oil and flame in a lamp: light arises from fire, fire depends on oil; the vessel is moistened by oil, oil rests in the vessel. If any of these four are lacking, where is the light? Likewise, luminous spirit shines forth, spirit rests in a tranquil heart, just as form possesses heart. The Dao is complete in one thing—what else could it rely upon? This is what is called numinous clarity. Numinous clarity is seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, knowing with the mind, and perceiving with the heart—discerning the principles of things, analyzing the subtle and profound. This is numinous clarity—take heed and remember it.\"\n\nAn official from the Vermilion Numinosity Hall awaited him. Suddenly, the master vanished.\n\nThereafter, Farmer Yuan followed the interplay of dragon and tiger, the alternation of yin and yang, the separation and union of the Five Phases, and the harmonization of water and fire. He built an encircling wall and cultivated within it, refining for three more years, completing a full twelve-year cycle. On the Double Ninth Festival, Farmer Yuan ascended into the void.\n\nLater, people broke open the gate of the wall and searched, but Farmer Yuan was nowhere to be seen. They found only a copy of the *Classic of Clarity* and, on the desk, a sheet of floral stationery bearing the lyric to the tune *Remembering Tang Duo*:\n\n*How fare both life and nature?*\n*The root and origin are firmly sealed.*\n*Guard the yang soul—*\n*yin and po dissolve away.*\n*Circulate the fire through the celestial cycle,*\n*refining the great elixir.*\n*Look to the sea’s depths—*\n*behold the crimson waves.*\n*Yo-lo!*\n\n*Riches and rank pass in an instant,*\n*glory and splendor like a shuttle cast aside.*\n*Wait until the three thousand deeds are complete,*\n*the work perfected—*\n*then ride phoenix and simurgh*\n*to roam the Azure Vault.*\n*To the Jade Emperor’s court,*\n*answer the immortal’s summons.*\n*Yo-lo!*\n\nA Discourse:\n\nVast and obscure, therein lies essence;\ndim and indistinct, therein lies substance.\nEver since Master Yuan the Farmer existed, he cast off desire and his mind became still; he settled his mind and his spirit became clear. When the mind is still and the spirit clear, the Dao arrives of itself—this is called the Way.\n\nAs for the reality of cultivation without cultivation: now his body has ascended to the Azure Vault and he bows before the Jade Emperor—this may truly be called attaining the Dao. Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.\n\nThe six desires are the six thieves. What are the six thieves? They are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intent. The three poisons are the three corpses. What are the three corpses? The upper corpse is Peng Ju, who governs the upper cinnabar field and instills in people the poison of fondness for adornment; the middle corpse is Peng Zhi, who governs the middle cinnabar field and instills the poison of greed, gluttony, and craving for rich flavors; the lower corpse is Peng Jiao, who governs the lower cinnabar field and instills the poison of lust, jealousy, and malice.\n\nThe preceding lines speak of how one who embraces the Dao constantly dispels the state of drifting and restlessness, so that the mind becomes still. When the mind is settled, like still water, the spirit naturally becomes clear. The Most High has said: if one can still the mind and clarify the spirit, naturally the six desires will not arise, the three corpses will not act, and the three poisons will be extinguished. Thus it is said: the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: the learning of the noble person advances toward the Dao. One who advances toward the Dao naturally does not generate the six desires, and the three poisons are extinguished. The learning of the petty person advances toward profit. One who advances toward profit generates the six desires, and the three poisons are not extinguished.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: the noble person cultivates and examines himself with reverence and fear. Thus, when the six desires do not arise and the three poisons do not stir, they extinguish themselves. Who can ensure the six desires do not arise and further extinguish the three poisons?\n\nThe answer is: such a person exists. During the Zhenguan era of the Tang, there was a man named Shen Hui. Due to his covetous heart, he accepted bribes from the people, and when the matter was exposed, he was exiled to Zhulan. Day and night, he constantly recited the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*, prostrating toward Mount Tai at dawn and dusk, saying: \"I only wish to return to my hometown.\"\n\nThe son of the Lord of Mount Tai, the Illustrious Duke of Bingling, was traveling to the Western Marchmount for an assembly. On his return, he saw Shen Hui reciting the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness*. The Illustrious Duke spoke from the void: \"This man cannot be taken.\" He returned to the Eastern Marchmount and told the Lord of the Peak. The Lord said: \"Excellent.\" He ordered Shen Hui to be fetched from his secluded chamber. It was midday when he was sitting there. A crimson-robed officer appeared and said: \"The Lord of the Peak summons you.\"\n\nShen Hui asked: \"Which Lord of the Peak?\" The officer replied: \"The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount.\" Shen Hui was greatly startled. He quickly donned his official robes and followed the officer. When they reached the city outskirts, the officer said: \"From here to Mount Tai is over three thousand *li*.\" Shen Hui asked: \"How can I arrive?\" The officer said: \"We shall borrow a horse for this journey.\"\n\nShen Hui waited beneath a tree while the officer entered the temple. After a moment, he led out a small gray horse, no larger than a donkey. The officer said: \"Mount the horse and close your eyes tightly.\" Shen Hui mounted the horse and shut his eyes. The wind rushed past like a gale. The officer said: \"Open your eyes.\" Before him stood a city. They entered it, though the path near the city was overgrown with brambles.\n\nThey arrived at a yamen, where iron-armored guards stood on either side. The officer held the horse as Shen Hui dismounted and led him inside. A soldier asked: \"Who is this?\" The officer replied: \"By the Lord’s decree, I bring him through the third gate.\" The officer said: \"Sir, wait here while I announce you.\" The officer entered and soon returned with a herald, who said: \"The Lord summons Official Shen Hui.\"\n\nShen Hui hurriedly followed and entered a magnificent hall. Pearl curtains and crimson drapes adorned the hall, which was named the Hall of Morning Radiance. The officer halted Shen Hui at the foot of the steps, where golden-armored ghost soldiers stood guard. Two azure-robed youths rolled up the curtains. Seated within was a man wearing a far-traveling cap and a blue dragon-embroidered robe, holding a cold jade tablet. Beside him stood another man in a golden moth cap, crimson garments, and an indigo jade belt, appearing to be about thirty years old.\n\nThe azure-robed youths invited Shen Hui to ascend the hall. Trembling, he could scarcely move his feet. The youths prodded him up the steps, and Shen Hui bowed. The Lord returned the bow and ordered his attendants to bring a seat for Shen Hui.\n\nThe Lord said: \"When mortals commit evil, if they are not punished by men, they will be punished by ghosts. You were guilty of covetousness and thus received this sentence of exile. Yet you have recited the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao* over ten thousand times in a single year. Your virtue is profound, and your reverence for me carries the mandate of the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, I shall not consign you to the path of rebirth.\n\nIf you recite this scripture and comprehend its meaning, practicing and teaching it to others, converting even one person to the Dao, your merit will increase. You may ascend not merely to the rank of celestial immortal, but to that of divine immortal; not merely to divine immortal, but to earthbound immortal; not merely to earthbound immortal, but to ghost immortal. How then could you enter the path of life and death?\"\n\nWhen he finished speaking, a ghost official in scarlet robes spread documents upon the table and pointed, saying: \"Mu Rengui, holding a tablet, stands below the steps—he is Shen Hui’s uncle by marriage.\" Shen Hui turned away, not daring to look.\n\nThe Lord said: \"Though you were an official governing Donghai Prefecture, you failed to govern the people with integrity. Instead, you indulged in greed, coveting bribes and killing an innocent man named Zhao.\"\n\nMu Rengui said, \"I dare not.\"\n\nThe Lord summoned the murdered Zhao to be brought forth. From the eastern corridor, Zhao was called forward—clothed in white, hair unbound, aged about thirty.\n\nZhao said: \"There was an old woman over seventy who died of illness in her old age. Her younger sister-in-law, coveting her family wealth, schemed against the new bride. The old woman had a patron, the prefect Mu Rengui, who received a hundred taels of gold from the younger sister-in-law. Accepting her account as truth, he condemned the new bride to death. Such is my grievance—I beseech Your Lordship to render judgment.\"\n\nRengui sought to conceal the truth, saying: \"This woman indeed killed the old woman.\"\n\nThe Lord ordered his attendants to bring forth the Mirror of Past Deeds. When it was cast upon Rengui, it revealed that he had taken the gold and wrongfully condemned Zhao. Rengui could no longer deny it.\n\nThe Lord said: \"No transgression is greater than desire, no calamity greater than greed, no crime greater than taking a life. You have committed all three offenses—how could you be pardoned?\"\n\nHe commanded his attendants to seize him.\n\nTwo ghosts dragged forth an iron bed and set it before the hall, ordering Rengui to remove his clothes. Before he could finish undressing, one ghost hooked his jaw with a prong—fire caught at once, searing half his face. His body stripped itself bare and was hoisted onto the iron bed, where iron spikes pierced his flesh. Beneath the bed, flames erupted, and his cries of agony were too terrible to witness. After lying there for some time, his body was reduced to charred ash.\n\nMoments later, another ghostly officer appeared, holding a fan. \"Mu Rengui,\" he called. With a single sweep of the fan, Rengui’s body was restored. They then clamped an iron cangue around his neck.\n\nShen Hui suddenly rose from his seat and said, \"This man is my uncle by marriage. Is there any way to save him?\"\n\nThe Lord replied, \"He wrongfully seized property and took a life—how could he be pardoned?\"\n\nThe Radiant Spirit Duke said, \"Unless this woman [the sister-in-law] relents, there is no reprieve. Only by performing great meritorious deeds in the mortal realm—petitioning the myriad sages, supplicating the thousand perfected, and invoking the Most High Lord Lao’s divine edict—may the wronged be first ascended to the celestial path and attain the heavenly realms before his punishment can be lifted.\"\n\nShen Hui said, \"I will ensure Mu Rengui repents of his past transgressions, relinquishes the six desires, and uproots the three poisons. I shall sponsor the Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven of the Most High and the Rite of the Heavenly Worthy’s Absolution of Sins. If Lady Zhao ascends to heaven, may Rengui be spared his suffering?\"\n\nThe Lord said, \"This may be permitted. Rengui’s allotted years are not yet exhausted—he has five more years of life.\"\n\nOnly two of his hun-souls are seized to the Nether Bureau to suffer punishment, while one hun-soul remains in the yang realm to guard his form. His body, too, breaks out in malignant sores, ceaselessly racked with pain. When his allotted five years are fulfilled, he will die. Now, having served his sentence in the earth-prison, he will next be reborn as a pig or a sheep—or even as a human—only to meet execution under the law. Hearing this, Shen Hui swiftly recited the *Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*. The Prefect, fearing the tremors of hell, said, \"You may return for now. Do not harbor thoughts of greed, nor let the three poisons arise.\" Shen Hui bowed in gratitude, chanting his repentance, though no heavenly pardon had been granted. \"Return to your village,\" the Prefect instructed, \"and admonish Rengui to curb his covetous desires—only then may it suffice.\"\n\nAn underling said, \"Escort Shen Hui back.\" Descending the hall, Shen Hui bowed farewell to the Prefect and withdrew. The underling said, \"Follow closely behind me.\" They crossed a river, and as they did, a great roar resounded. Shen Hui awoke with a start, cold sweat drenched his body, and he found his family gathered around him, weeping. Shen Hui sat up abruptly. His kin exclaimed, \"You have been dead three days—only a faint warmth lingered in your heart, and your breath remained unbroken.\" Shen Hui raised himself, gazing upward, and murmured, \"Are the spirits of the unseen realm truly so?\" Turning to the assembly, he warned, \"Let no one indulge in covetous desires.\" He continued to recite the true scriptures diligently. Three days later, by imperial grace, a general amnesty was declared throughout the realm: all death sentences and exile to the frontier were remitted, and prisoners were permitted to return home.\n\nThereupon, Shen Hui traveled to Donghai Prefecture, where his uncle-in-law, Mu Rengui, lay gravely ill. For three months, his body had been covered in festering sores, the bed soaked with pus and blood, the pain unbearable. When Rengui saw Shen Hui, he rejoiced and said, \"A month ago, I dreamed you came to save me.\" He recounted the events of the netherworld, and every detail matched. Thus, Rengui repented of his transgressions and sponsored a grand Yellow Register Offering, enlisting twenty-one Daoist priests to produce ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on Purity and Tranquility*, which he distributed among Daoist friends in all directions. He also established a Society of Purity and Tranquility. When the merit was complete, at noon on the day the ritual feast concluded, a woman appeared in midair to express her gratitude: \"By the power of your grand offering, I have ascended to heaven and mounted the cloud-path.\" She left behind a poem:\n\nFor years my grievance remained unredressed,\nToday I owe my thanks to your ritual feast.\nThe six desires and three poisons are wholly extinguished—\nThrough your merit, I ascend to the azure heavens.\n\nShen Hui gazed upward and bowed in reverence. Within half a month, Mu Rengui’s sores and ailments vanished, and his body was restored. Shen Hui composed a *Man Ting Fang* lyric to admonish him:\n\nThe six desires are hard to dispel,\nThe three poisons refuse to fade.\nIn ceaseless toil for cunning gain,\nWhen your allotted years are spent,\nWho will stand in for impermanence?\nGold and jade amassed in vain—\nWhen the hour comes, not one thing can you take.\nThe bitterest pang:\nAll the evil karma of the past\nMust be pondered by yourself alone.\nWhat plan can spare you the torments of Fengdu?\nNo recourse remains—\nLike a winter melon struck by autumn frost.\nI urge you, awaken swiftly,\nTo the realm of purity and bliss.\nWhen merit is perfected,\nIn the Scarlet Numinous Palace,\nRefine your true yang in clarity and stillness.\n\nRengui, hearing this and witnessing the truth of the unseen realm, how could he not take heed? He composed a poem in response:\n\nTo think oneself clever is not as good as diligence;\nThe six desires and three poisons—do not force them to grow.\nBees toil to gather nectar from a hundred flowers,\nYet never know for whom their sweetness is made.\n\nShen Hui said, \"The years flash by like lightning—how can we bear not to cultivate the Way?\" He counted on his fingers and wept bitterly. The two men then abandoned their households, resigned from office, and relinquished their seals of authority. Together they journeyed to Mount Tiantai, where they gathered thatch to build a hut and sat in meditation. Each day they recited the *Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on Purity and Tranquility* three hundred times. They cultivated the Dao until they reached over ninety years of age, and both attained the Way.\n\nIt is said: The extremes of passion and desire are like water and fire. Smoke arises from fire, and water flows from ice—when smoke is faint, the fire burns fiercely; when ice floats, the water flows freely. The Perfected One said: \"People nurture their bodies with desire and attachment, but such nurturing is like a fool raising fish and birds. When the weather turns cold, the fish are placed in hot water, and the birds are set near a blazing fire. Water and fire are the very means to nurture fish and birds, yet if the nurturing is improper, it leads to harm. Sensual pleasures delight the senses, but if the delight exceeds reason, it turns to harm one’s life.\"\n\nShen Hui and Rengui, their bodies burdened with desire and attachment, one sentenced to exile and the other to death, suddenly awakened. They resigned from office, entered the mountains to cultivate the Way, and practiced the teachings of purity and tranquility. Turning from evil to embrace goodness, they attained the Dao—how could this not be verified? Those who fail to do so are those whose minds are not yet clear and whose desires are not yet dispelled.\n\nThe Most High reiterates the meaning of the above passage: \"The reason people cannot dispel their desires is that their minds are not yet clear, and thus their desires remain undispelled.\" Master Wen said: \"Those who speak without loyalty, integrity, caution, or discretion are people who have not yet clarified their minds or dispelled their desires.\" Hence it is said: The reason one cannot do so is that the mind is not yet clear and desires are not yet dispelled.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: \"Those who cannot clarify their minds or dispel their desires are like those adrift in the River of Love or tossed upon the Sea of Desire.\" Some may ask: \"Why do people fail to clarify their minds, dispel their desires, and instead give rise to deluded thoughts?\"\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Liu Huaizhen, styled Daoyu. In the second year of the Taiping era, he was appointed Governor of Le Ling in Hejian for his meritorious service. Upon taking office, he was insatiably greedy for bribes, extorting without end. Though he amassed two or three million in cash, he showed no mercy, relentlessly seizing the people’s wealth and never resolving a single case justly. The gentry and common folk lamented:\n\nBetter to be poor, poor,\nThan have your marrow drained and sinews plucked.\nBetter to meet a white-browed tiger on South Mountain\nThan to cross paths with Liu Huaizhen.\n\nSuch was the suffering he inflicted. Later, he was transferred to govern Zhongshan Prefecture, and the people there were filled with dread.\n\nHis wife then said to Huaizhen, \"Now our wealth and rank are somewhat sufficient. You hold a first-rank office and govern a region as its lord. Yet you are already several decades old and have not cultivated blessings for the life to come.\"\n\nHuaizhen asked, \"What should I do now?\"\n\nHis wife replied, \"I have heard that riding a red horse in fine attire is a reward earned through cultivation over many lifetimes. If we do not cultivate in this life, calamity will befall us in the next; if we cultivate now, we will surely enjoy wealth and nobility in the life to come.\"\n\nHuaizhen said, \"Indeed.\"\n\nHis wife continued, \"In my dressing chamber, the treasures and goods are worth over a million strings of cash. Instead of plundering the people’s wealth, it would be better to use these to restore temples and monasteries, inviting twenty or thirty monks and Daoists to hold regular vegetarian feasts. First, this would create blessings for our own family; second, it would secure the cause of wealth and nobility for the next life; third, the court would learn of it and recognize our virtuous deeds; and fourth, we would gain a reputation for goodness without harming the people. This is the fruit of preserving one’s body and enriching one’s worldly existence.\"\n\nGreatly pleased, Huaizhen took all the money from his wife’s chests—about a million strings—and chose an auspicious day to begin construction. He gathered materials and purchased over thirty *mu* of land, and after two years of work, the project was completed. He built a grand hall, a triple gate, scripture pavilions, a Dharma hall, and sacred images—everything was made whole. Huaizhen and his wife burned incense daily to seek blessings, and within two years, all was finished. He also purchased five *qing* of permanent land for the monastery’s upkeep, spending over a million strings of cash in total. Yet though he had not taken a single coin from the people, he had secretly drained their marrow and fat. Still, he could not still his heart or dispel desire.\n\nOne day, Huaizhen said to his wife, \"Now that I have built this blessed site with its grand halls and the like, without taking anything from the people, I wonder if the blessings will truly follow in the next life.\"\n\nHis wife replied, \"How could one know such things of the unseen world?\"\n\nHuaizhen remained dissatisfied, saying daily, \"I have performed such meritorious deeds and prayed with such devotion for divine reward—why have the gods shown no sign of response?\"\n\nOne afternoon, as he napped, he dreamed of a Daoist entering his chamber without ceremony. The Daoist said to him, \"Sir, you are both greedy and covetous. Though you built these halls with your own money, you have long extorted the people’s fat and marrow—how can this bring blessings? You hold a first-rank office in this life and yet still seek blessings for the next. Your greed knows no end, but the blessings you seek will go to Zhang, the old woman at the southern gate of Zhongshan Prefecture.\"\n\nHuaizhen asked, \"Why would she receive them?\"\n\nThe Daoist replied, \"When she was poor, she bought goods at a low price and sold them at the same price when they became expensive, never raising it. Moreover, she constantly recited the *Classic of Supreme Clarity by Lord Lao*, aided those in danger, saved the distressed, cherished all things, and protected life. Her merit surpasses that of building temples and monasteries.\"\n\nWith that, the Daoist vanished. Huaizhen was displeased and sent a swift messenger to summon the old couple, Zhang and his wife. Their account matched the Daoist’s words. Huaizhen was awakened. He resigned his post, retired to a secluded chamber, and cultivated the Dao of clarity and stillness. He stilled his heart, dispelled desire, and together with his wife, embraced quiet simplicity, practicing dual cultivation. He invited Daoist companions to discuss the *Zhuangzi* and the *Laozi*. He lived to the age of one hundred and twenty-nine before passing away.\n\n**Discourse:**\nThe greatness of the Dao is felt only through the heart. If one does not still the heart and dispel desire, how can one attain it? Liu Huaizhen took the people’s wealth to build temples and monasteries, hoping to erase his karma and seek blessings—was this not difficult? When the heart is released into the realm of nothingness and the spirit is nurtured in the realm of carefree wandering, that is true awakening. To still the heart, dispel desire, scatter gold and jade to relieve the poor, and thus prolong life to die a peaceful death—is this not worthy of a sage? Truly, he may be called a Perfected One.\n\nThose who can dispel the six desires and the three poisons may perceive the wondrous Dao of the Three Origins, which is explained below.\n\n**Inwardly observe the heart—**\nthe heart is without heart.\n**Outwardly observe the form—**\nthe form is without form.\n**From afar observe things—**\nthings are without things.\n\nWhen things are without things, the heart is stilled and desire vanishes of itself. Once desire is wholly extinguished, one may perceive the appearance of the great Dao’s Three Origins.\n\n**What are the Three Origins?**\nThe first origin: Inwardly observe the mind’s consciousness as the realm of emptiness, seeing all as without mind. If there is no mind, how can the thieves of the six desires arise? The corpse of the three poisons naturally perishes. Thus it is said: *Inwardly observe the heart—the heart is without heart.* When the heart is without heart, *outwardly observe the form—the form is without form.* When form is not bound by form, one gradually enters the realm of non-action, where neither heart nor form can be swayed. How then can the six desires arise? The three poisons naturally dissolve. Thus it is said: *From afar observe things—things are without things.*\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: *Inwardly observe desire—there is no desire. Outwardly observe form—there is no form. From afar observe external things—there are no external things.* When these three are without end, one may be said to have attained the Dao.\n\nMaster Wen said: *Do not cling to profit, do not cling to the mind that desires profit—thus inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart. Do not oppose harm, do not oppose the harm that injures the body’s form—thus outwardly observe the form, the form is without form. Do not force interaction, do not force exchange with external things—thus there are no external things, and from afar observe things—things are without things.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who is it that inwardly observes the heart, and the heart is without heart?*\nIn the Warring States period, there was a skilled physician named Wen Zhi. Long Shu said to him, \"I have heard of your mastery. I suffer from an illness—can you cure me?\"\nWen Zhi replied, \"I await your command.\"\n\nYet first speak of your illness, and I shall examine it.\"\nLong Shu said: \"My illness has several forms. In my village, they praise me, yet I feel no glory—this is the first. I gain without joy, lose without sorrow—the second. I neither cling to wealth nor scorn poverty—the third. I regard others as they regard me—the fourth. I dwell in my home as though it were a traveler’s inn—the fifth. I view my village as a land of barbarians—the sixth. And seven demons afflict me: first, rewards and punishments cannot move me; second, penalties cannot destroy me; third, prosperity and decline, profit and harm cannot restrain me; fourth, sorrow and joy cannot alter me; fifth, I cannot bear the name of a state; sixth, I do not befriend companions; seventh, I cannot govern my wife, children, or servants. These are the seven demons. What illness is this? What method can cure it?\"\n\nWen Zhi then commanded Long Shu to stand facing him. Wen Zhi himself turned toward the light and observed him, then said: \"Ah! I see your heart now. A space of one *cun*—how utterly empty it is! The heart of a sage has seven apertures; yours has six, with but one flowing unobstructed. This is not enlightenment—it is the illness of sagely wisdom. Thus it is said: *inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart.*\"\n\nSomeone asked: *Who is it that outwardly observes the form, and the form is without form?*\nIn ancient times, Wu Jizha served as an envoy to Yan. On the road, he suddenly saw a piece of gold lying on the path. Jizha passed it without a thought, then noticed a woodcutter ahead. He said to him: \"You are poor—here is a piece of gold.\" Jizha pointed and said: \"Take this gold and jade.\" The woodcutter frowned and rebuked him: \"Your bearing is proud, yet your intentions are base. Why do you take me for one who covets gold?\" The woodcutter turned away without a glance. Gold is the most precious of things, yet he paid it no heed—thus *from afar observe things, things are without things.*\n\nThe treatise says: Long Shu attained *inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart*; the woodcutter attained *from afar observe things, things are without things.* To awaken to these three voids is to penetrate the sagely Dao. Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. The preceding line speaks of the six desires no longer arising, so the three poisons naturally vanish. By not giving rise to the six desires and extinguishing the three poisons, one can *inwardly observe the desireless heart, outwardly observe the formless body, and from afar observe the thingless things.* These three are called *form and emptiness*—all that appears to have shape is but an illusory realm.\n\nThe *Dingguan Jing* states: *Above the settled mind, all is suddenly uncovered; below the settled mind, all is utterly still and without thing.* Those who can recognize this may *inwardly observe the heartless heart, outwardly observe the formless form, and from afar observe the thingless things.* Observing these three—*heartless, formless, thingless*—they merge with the void. Once awakened, only the true emptiness of stillness is seen. Thus it is said: *Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen.*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *Manifest the Dao, divine its virtue and power.* To awaken to the principle of the three voids is to make evident the effortless Way, and naturally to spiritually embody its virtue and power—like the great void embracing the ten thousand things, only the realm of emptiness is seen.\n\nMaster Wen said: *The virtue of the sage is the root of the Dao.* Those who embody the Dao are *heartless, formless, thingless.* Once these three are realized, only the manifest virtue of the Dao and the divine virtue of the Way are seen—the ultimate emptiness of the great void. Thus it is said: *Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who can awaken to these three voids, see emptiness, and attain the Dao?*\nIn the Tang dynasty, Liu Zichu sat for the imperial examination in the *Nangong* during the *Dali* era but failed. Instead of reflecting on himself, he indulged in reckless wandering—flowered streets and moonlit nights, seeking fleeting pleasure. Before long, his purse was empty, and people grew weary of him. He lacked even daily sustenance; his appearance withered, and each day was a struggle. One day, he left the eastern gate, walking slowly, contemplating suicide. Yet the hour of death was hard to seize, so he sat beneath an ancient willow, silently reciting the *Laojun Shuo Chang Qingjing Jing* three times. His spirit and qi nearly expired.\n\nSuddenly, a Daoist appeared—wearing a blue headscarf and white robe, straw sandals bound with black straps, carrying a bamboo basket. He too sat beneath the tree. His bearing was dignified, and he said to Zichu: \"You possess the qi of the Dao—why are you so distressed?\"\n\nZichu opened his eyes, overjoyed at the sight, and bowed in thanks: \"I am a scholar. In my prime, I twice sat for the spring examinations, yet fate was unkind, and I failed. Thus I wandered recklessly, my purse empty and resources exhausted. Each day is a struggle. My hometown in the eastern sea is too distant to return, and the western capital offers no refuge. My clothes are in tatters, my belly empty. Today’s hardship surpasses even Chen E’s plight.\"\n\nThe words faltered on his lips, his breath grew faint, his voice weak—suddenly, he collapsed. The Daoist master, seeing this, asked: \"Why has it come to this?\" He then took two jujubes from his basket, helped Zichu rise, and pressed them into his hand. Zichu ate one, and at once savored its sweetness. He bowed in gratitude to the master.\n\nThe master said: \"I observe your qi—you seem to possess an extraordinary bone-structure.\"\n\nZichu replied: \"My heart is never content.\"\n\nThe master said: \"You have attained more than enough.\"\n\nZichu said: \"For a true man, contentment lies in high rank and noble station.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Close your eyes.\"\n\nZichu complied, and at once felt himself drifting into a daze, as if falling asleep. Suddenly, he saw a man in purple sash and golden seal, bearing an ivory tablet, who presented a royal decree from the King of Fuyu, summoning him, Zichu. Zichu said: \"I am but a lowly scholar from the eastern sea, a Confucian of the Yi River—twice I failed the imperial examinations, and now I am a man of no fixed abode. How could I presume to accept the summons of a king?\"\n\nWith that, Zichu joyfully followed the messenger out the eastern gate. Beyond the gate, more than ten men in embroidered robes, jade belts, and red boots bowed to him. They led forth a peach-blossom steed, its saddle of jade and gold, its bridle adorned with dragon trappings, its canopy of kingfisher feathers and phoenix designs, its red banners gleaming in the sun. They escorted Zichu to mount. Overcome with joy, he grasped the saddle and swung into the seat. The procession set forth with solemn cries, the outriders numerous, the four steeds swift as the wind. After eight hundred li, they arrived at a city.\n\nThe streets teemed with graceful figures, the land fair and prosperous. Hundreds of officials in crimson and purple lined the way, bowing before his horse. They led him to a place of pearl towers and jeweled pavilions, jade halls rising through mist and cloud. Suddenly, a rider emerged from the throng and said: \"Let the imperial son-in-law dismount at the Eastern Radiance Lodge.\" Its windows and doors were fashioned of crystal and glass.\n\nThat night, in the lodge, red chambers and embroidered boudoirs resounded with the music of strings and pipes. Dozens of courtesans played their instruments. As Zichu rested beneath the high pavilion, the tolling of bells mingled with the clear wind and dawn moon. A courtesan arrived with a summons, inviting the imperial son-in-law to meet the princess. Zichu was overjoyed.\n\nSuddenly, a beauty presented a jeweled casket containing a robe of precious jade. At nightfall, a fine steed was led forth, and he was invited to mount. A procession of singing girls, fair as those of Wu and Yue, escorted him within. He beheld a purple hall with golden steps, jade courtyards stretching far, guards standing solemnly, officials in crimson and purple ranks, their scepters gleaming. In an instant, phoenix curtains were drawn back, drums resounded, and the mountain-shaking cries of \"Long live the king!\" filled the air.\n\nThe King of Fuyu ascended his jeweled throne, his dragon robe resplendent, his pheasant fans parting gently. Lovely maidens stood in graceful array. A herald proclaimed: \"Let the imperial son-in-law approach the emperor.\" Zichu bowed and performed the ritual dance. The king said: \"My beloved daughter, whose name is Yinfang, wishes to join her life to yours. The betrothal shall be sealed this day.\"\n\nAt the king’s command, celestial music filled the air, and a royal banquet was laid. His wealth and honor were beyond words. That evening, lamps burned with dragon-fat oil, incense of phoenix marrow filled the air, and robes of rosy clouds, brocade quilts—countless treasures—were displayed. Suddenly, from the phoenix chamber emerged a girl of sixteen, her beauty surpassing that of Xishi or Chang’e. Even Chang’e of ancient and modern times could not compare. At the sight of her, Zichu’s soul soared beyond the heavens, his spirit scattered to the nine skies.\n\nThat night, within the phoenix bed draped with coiling dragons, they lay together like paired lovebirds, with Taizhen as their companion. At dawn, the emperor issued a decree appointing him Grand Marshal of the Three Ministries, Imperial Son-in-Law, and bestowing upon him the titles of Marquis of Wu’an and Duke of the Princess of Wu’an Commandery. Upon arriving at Wu’an Commandery, Daoist masters, Buddhist monks, laypeople, and local officials all came to greet him. He governed the commandery for ten years, fathering two sons, and his reputation for good governance spread far.\n\nLater, he was summoned to lead the southern campaign against Fuyu as Grand Marshal, commanding tens of thousands of troops. With a single strike, he achieved victory, his merit and fame complete. The emperor bestowed upon him a mountain of gold. Five years later, his two sons were enfeoffed as marquises. His wealth and honor were beyond description—gold and jade lay about like tiles and pebbles, his achievements eclipsing all under heaven.\n\nYet joy, when extreme, gives way to sorrow. Three years later, his wife, the princess, passed away. Two years after that, both his sons also died. Zichu was overwhelmed with grief.\n\nThen came a report of rebellion: the King of Southern Yue, Liu Zichu, intended to betray his domain. The King of Fuyu dispatched an envoy with a royal decree. Zichu dared not defy the command and thus arrived in that kingdom. The king said: \"You, a mere commoner, could not fathom your own fate. We summoned you to be Our son-in-law, and for fifteen years, We enfeoffed you as a king and granted you lands. We have never slighted you—why then this treachery?\"\n\nZichu replied: \"Your servant was but a humble cloth-wearing man, and now I am Your Highness’s son-in-law. I am grateful for the enfeoffment and lands; I would never dare to rebel.\"\n\nThe king said: \"The accusation of treason is not false—why do you deny it?\" He ordered his attendants to boil Zichu alive. The executioners stripped him and took up their blades, preparing to carve his flesh into the seething cauldron. Zichu, terrified, begged to return to his former life as a commoner, but it was no longer possible. As the executioners raised their knives and the oil bubbled, he let out a piteous cry—then suddenly awoke.\n\nThe master said: \"Why are you so dazed?\"\n\nZichu, now fully awake, was drenched in sweat and trembling uncontrollably. He recounted the dream in full.\n\nThe master said: \"You recite the *Classic of Purity and Stillness*. Within it is written: *Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart; outwardly observe the form—there is no form; distantly observe things—there are no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness remains.* Zichu, you were once poor and alone, yet your heart was filled with desire. Now, as the emperor’s son-in-law, these three—heart, form, and things—have no true substance, like a fleeting dream. All is but emptiness. You craved high rank, so you were made King of Southern Yue. You could not distantly observe things, so you were granted a mountain of gold. Yet all is illusion.\"\n\nZichu, enlightened, sighed: \"A human life is but a fleeting illusion—what is there to praise or lament?\" He bowed to the master.\n\nThe master said: \"We shall meet again in three years on Penglai. Hold fast to this true scripture, never waver in your Dao-heart, and this shall be your vow.\" With that, he rode a cloud and departed.\n\nZichu then ate only jujubes and nothing else. Later, seeking a secluded place, he built a thatched hut, sat in silent meditation, severed all worldly ties, and steadfastly upheld the scripture for three years without faltering. One day, a white crane descended from the sky. Zichu mounted its back and soared into the heavens, leaving behind three short verses:\n\n**First:**\n*Beauty is a flower’s splendor, yet it does not last—*\n*Do not cling to the fleeting bloom of crimson hue.*\n*Flower’s glow, a floating cloud’s ephemeral gleam,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where the heart holds no heart, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Second:**\n*Form is illusion, transient and unenduring—*\n*Do not exalt the hollow shell of fleeting shape.*\n*To hoard wealth and estate is to grasp at emptiness,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where form holds no form, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Third:**\n*Things are borrowed, brief as a passing guest—*\n*White jade and yellow gold are but emptiness.*\n*Empty-handed you come, empty-handed you go,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where things hold no things, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Discourse:**\nAll things arise from nothingness, and when their existence reaches its limit, they return to nothingness. Yet people mistake the illusory realm of form for reality—are they not fools? Liu Zichu, failing in his ambitions, was consumed by desire. Moved by this, an immortal descended to transform him, making him the son-in-law of the King of Fuyu. Deluded by sensual pleasures, he forgot that *the heart holds no heart*. Dazzled by the honor of a marquisate, he forgot that *form holds no form*. Seduced by the wealth of a gold mountain, he forgot that *things hold no things*. These three are all insubstantial appearances—beauty is a fleeting blossom, form is a passing illusion, wealth is a mirage. Such attachments bring calamity, yet he later awakened. Having repented, he journeyed to the Three Isles and ascended to the Jade Capital—was this not a blessed fate?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *Without thought, without action, in stillness and unmovable, yet responsive and penetrating—who but the most divine of all under heaven could achieve this?*\n\nMaster Wenzi said: *Mountains must cling to the earth; people must cling to stillness. In profound tranquility, the Dao resides within.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who abides in constant stillness yet attains the Dao?*\n\nThe answer: *There are such people.*\n\nIn the Tianbao era of old, there was a scholar named Li Tong, over fifty years of age, who had repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. Day after day, he recited the *Classic of the Supreme Lord Lao’s Perfect Tranquility*, deeply grasping its principles, never parting from it even in sleep or at meals, his mouth never ceasing its chant. One day, his wife passed away. Li merely sighed in lament. He had but one son. A year later, his son also perished. Li said, “I am now free of my shackles.”\n\nHe spent his days in poetry and wine, finding solace therein. Some of his acquaintances admonished him, saying, “I have heard that a wife is one’s equal—shared burial is the natural sentiment of man. Yet you shed no tears for her, only sighing. You are heartless. Your son has died, and you grieve but once, forgetting the tenderness of kinship. This is to forsake the Way of father and son. How can you claim to be a man of letters?”\n\nLi replied, “I have heard that when Zhuangzi’s wife died, he drummed on a basin, and when Dongmen Wu lost his son, he did not weep. These were men who truly understood principle. Why should I grieve? Why should I grieve? The Supreme Lord says: *Look within at the heart—there is no heart; look without at form—there is no form; look afar at things—there are no things. When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen. Observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, there is only profound and constant stillness. Constant stillness is the Dao. Since the Dao is constant stillness, what have I to possess?*\n\nThereupon, he distributed his family’s wealth to those in need and relinquished his fields to his neighbors. Li Tong then took the *Classic of Perfect Tranquility* and entered Mount Hua. He pulled up reeds and piled stones to build a hut, reciting the *Classic of Perfect Tranquility* while silently consuming medicinal herbs to cultivate his resolve. For three years, his devotion remained unwavering, his heart set on the Dao. Moved by this, the Supreme Lord sent a divine being to instruct him.\n\nThe immortal entered his hut and asked, “Why do you study the Dao here in these deep mountains?” Seven times he asked, and seven times Li made no reply. The Dao is not attained by forgetting speech, nor is it grasped by mere discussion—what use are words? How can one thus attain the Dao?\n\n“One who wishes to cultivate the Dao must first set aside all external affairs. When external affairs are wholly severed, nothing will oppose the heart. Then, sit in stillness and turn inward. Should a single thought arise, swiftly extinguish it and return to tranquility. If wandering or chaotic thoughts emerge, they too must be utterly dispelled. One must not know *observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, there is only profound and constant stillness.*”\n\nUpon hearing this, Li prostrated himself in reverence and said, “I humbly receive your command. Pray, instruct me further.” He knelt before the immortal, who then imparted his teaching:\n\n“In cultivating the Dao, one must extinguish the moving heart but not the illuminating heart. Simply stabilize the empty heart, not the attached heart—this is the empty heart. Do not hastily seek wisdom in concentration, for haste injures the nature, and when the nature is injured, there is no wisdom. If in concentration one does not seek wisdom, wisdom will come of itself—this is true wisdom. Wisdom without deceit, wisdom that values truth, is like folly. This is the foundation of concentration and wisdom, an inexhaustible treasure.\n\nIf myriad thoughts arise, they will summon all manner of demons and illusions, spirits and seductions, appearing as the heart conjures them.”\n\nThe immortal then said to Li Tong, “If you can stabilize your heart in profound and constant stillness, you will achieve the Dao.”\n\nLi replied, “Your disciple is capable of this.”\n\nThe immortal said, “I shall teach you tomorrow. For now, I depart.” He then left the hut and vanished.\n\nThe next day, at the hour of Chen and Si, the immortal returned to the hut. Li Tong emerged, joyfully welcoming him inside. Li bowed and said, “Though this disciple is but a decayed scholar, ignorant of the great Dao, clinging to sudden emptiness—how is this different from tuning a zither with glued pegs?”\n\nThe immortal replied, “I wish to refine a furnace of elixir. You shall guard the furnace, maintaining profound and constant stillness through silence. Can you do this?”\n\nLi said, “Your disciple can.”\n\nThe immortal then set up a furnace in the hut. From his bag, he took a crucible and placed several grains of elixir within. Facing the sun, he drew in a breath of qi and blew it onto the furnace, igniting the fire. He then instructed Li Tong, “Sit facing due south before the furnace. This is the method of *observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, this is the practice of profound and constant stillness.* Should a thousand demons or ten thousand specters appear, regard them as nothing. If you speak, the elixir in the furnace will fail, and your Dao will not be achieved. Remember this well.\n\nIn three days, I shall return to inspect the elixir. It will surely be ripe. We shall partake of it together and ascend as immortals to the heavens. Remember this well.”\n\nLi Tong clasped his hands firmly and sat upright before the furnace. The immortal then departed the hut.\n\nBefore long, clouds arose from all directions, thunder and lightning clashed in the sky, fierce winds uprooted trees, and thunderbolts shattered mountains. Torrential rains and surging waters flooded the hut. Li Tong did not stir, sitting steadfast as the water rose to his crown. Yet his heart remained unmoved. The water rose only to a finger’s width, neither entering the furnace nor reaching his mouth. In an instant, the waters receded.\n\nThen, wildfire swept the mountain, flames stretching across the sky, engulfing the hut. The thatch was about to ignite and consume Li Tong, yet he sat motionless, his heart free of resentment. Soon, the fire extinguished itself.\n\nNext, hungry ghosts arrived. Some had blue faces and red hair, others yellow bodies and green faces, or eyes glowing red with fangs like sharp blades. “We are mountain ghosts,” they said. “Today we are ravenous. We shall eat and then depart.”\n\nShould you utter a single word, we shall not devour you; if you remain silent, we shall feast upon you.” Li Tong spoke not a word, and the ghosts vanished of their own accord.\n\nThen, dozens of ravenous tigers approached, intent on devouring Li Tong. Yet he did not look upon them, nor did fear arise in his heart. The tigers roared and snarled repeatedly, sniffed at him, then departed without harming him.\n\nNext came venomous serpents, slithering around his body, yet Li Tong’s heart remained unmoved, and the serpents left of their own accord.\n\nThen appeared a woman, fair of face and eighteen in years, her beauty unmatched. With seductive words and alluring speech, she sought to beguile Li Tong. Yet his heart did not waver, and the woman departed.\n\nAfterward, over thirty bandits arrived, clad in iron armor and wielding halberds and bows. Their leader declared, “Let us feast upon this man’s heart and liver.” They raised their blades, poised to strike, when one among them said, “If he utters but a single word, spare him.” Li Tong remained silent, and the bandits withdrew.\n\nThen came a king, crowned in lofty headdress and draped in voluminous sleeves, his feet shod in crimson slippers beneath long robes. In his hand he held a scepter of cold jade, and behind him stood fierce deities and malevolent ghosts—ox-headed hell-guards brandishing iron forks. With a great shout, they cried, “Yama, the Great King, has arrived! Why do you not rise?” The guards thrust their forks at Li Tong, but the king commanded, “Hold. If this man speaks but a word, spare him; if he remains silent, pierce him with the forks.” Li Tong felt no fear, nor did his heart stir.\n\nThe king then ordered, “Bring forth his wife.” Soon, Li Tong’s wife was brought before him. The king said, “If you make your husband speak but a word, I shall spare you from suffering.” His wife pleaded, “You and I are bound as husband and wife, our love as weighty as mountains. Today, I endure the torments of hell. If you speak but a word to relieve my suffering, I shall be spared; if not, my agony shall be unbearable.” Yet Li Tong remained silent.\n\nEnraged, the king declared, “This man is obstinate and base. Now, saw his wife asunder before his eyes.” In an instant, the hell-guards seized his wife, bound her between planks, and began to saw her in two. Blood flowed across the ground, her cries of anguish too grievous to witness. Yet her husband spoke not a word.\n\nThe king then commanded, “Summon his child.”\n\nThe child was brought forth, and the king declared, \"Tear your body into ten thousand pieces.\" The child replied, \"My father has a heart of iron and liver of stone. Because he would not speak, my mother endured the torment of being sawn asunder. If he remains silent now, I shall suffer the agony of dismemberment. The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: ‘The bond between father and child is rooted in Heaven’s nature.’ Father, show mercy—speak but a word, and spare me this suffering.\" Yet Li Tong uttered not a sound.\n\nSeeing this, the king flew into a rage and cried, \"This man is stubborn and perverse!\" He ordered the guards to seize his living soul and sever it from his body. Li Tong felt himself fall into a stupor, and his soul was reborn in the household of Wang Dalang of Qizhou as a daughter—radiant and fair beyond compare, yet mute and voiceless. At eighteen, she was called the \"Dumb Girl.\" Her parents married her to the third son of Squire Ma of the Eastern Village, who cherished her beauty and took her as his wife despite her silence. For three years, she bore him a son.\n\nOne day, her husband returned drunk and said to her, \"You’ve given birth to a fine boy, but he is mute—this is a grave affliction. What use is such a child?\" He seized the infant by the feet, inverted him, and dashed him to the ground. Blood splattered across the dumb girl’s face. Startled, she cried out in anguish, \"Oh, the cruelty! My precious child!\" At that moment, her eyes flew open, and she beheld a furnace ablaze, sparks scattering like lightning, the roar of flames filling the air.\n\nThe alchemist, who had just arrived, exclaimed, \"The elixir was nearly complete, but your cry has startled it into ruin—now the cinnabar cannot be refined. The void is void, yet the void is not void; what is voided is already nothing, and even nothingness is not nothing. Thus, this man cannot abide in the Dao of serene and constant stillness.\" He struck his chest and wept, \"Alas! A furnace of elixir lost!\"\n\nSix years hence, I shall return again.\" He then bestowed upon Li Tong a poem:\n\n*Delve but slightly into the mysteries, and ask my disciples true,*\n*The elixir ripens, true lead reveals—form dissolves into the formless view.*\n*The crane’s nature soars free through the azure skies,*\n*The Daoist heart, in stillness, perceives the work that lies.*\n*The dragon’s roar gathers auspicious mist o’er golden peaks,*\n*The tiger’s breath sends propitious winds to the jade furnace’s heat.*\n*Six years more, and your merit complete,*\n*In serene constancy, you shall ascend to the Immortal’s seat.*\n\nThe master said, \"Within six years, cultivate only this scripture, and by its virtue, you shall ascend to the Jade Capital. Strive on, strive on!\" With these words, the master vanished in a radiance of white light.\n\nThus, Li Tong sought a rope to suspend a great stone, weighing a thousand *jin*, and let it hang above the stone chamber. Beneath it, he sat in perfect stillness, unmoving. After six years of cultivation, his merit complete, his master reappeared, riding a phoenix, and called to him. Li Tong, overjoyed, bowed in reverence. After their exchange, the two ascended together, riding the phoenix as it rose gently into the sky.\n\nMidway through the heavens, the master left behind a poem:\n\n*Behold the void—void too is true emptiness,*\n*Emptiness knows no bounds, and \"no\" flows free.*\n*With \"no-desire\" comes stillness, constant, serene,*\n*Bestride the startled crane and soar to the celestial palace.*\n\nThere was also a short lyric, *\"To the Tune of Lesser Woodland Blossoms\"*:\n\n*Books I pored o’er, learning’s toil,*\n*Fifty years—my hair turned white as snow.*\n*No name on golden rolls, I knew at last*\n*The scholar’s cap had led my life astray.*\n*Wife dead, child lost, love’s bonds dissolved—*\n*At last the Way appeared before my gaze.*\n*Deep thanks to my master’s words:*\n*In stillness constant, I ascend to heaven’s height.*\n\nThe treatise states: The Great Dao is most wondrous and subtle, its numinous power awakened by resonance, like metal or stone that rings only when struck. Li Tong came to realize that even emptiness is empty—emptiness has no object, and where nothing is emptied, even \"nothing\" ceases to be. With \"nothing\" thus dissolved, the Way of constant stillness stands unshaken, undisturbed by a thousand demons or ten thousand delusions. He suspended a thousand-*jin* stone and cultivated for six years, and indeed ascended to the celestial palace—was this not fitting?\n\nStillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise? When desire does not arise, that is the true Dao. The Way of constancy is grasped by those who awaken to it. Those who awaken to the Dao abide in perpetual purity.\n\nDesire comprises the six desires, which are the six thieves:\nThe eye is the first thief, fond of gazing upon gaudy colors and seductive beauty, unaware that such allure is the axe that severs the life of one’s nature.\nThe ear is the second thief, fond of listening to lewd music and wanton sounds, unaware that such melodies are the drums that harm the spirit.\nThe mouth is the third thief, fond of rich wine and fatty meats, unaware that such indulgences are poison to the viscera.\nThe nose is the fourth thief, fond of sweet fragrances and corrupt vapors, unaware that such scents are the breath that steals one’s vitality.\nThe body is the fifth thief, fond of fragrant carriages and precious steeds, unaware that such luxuries are the mechanism of downfall.\nThe mind is the sixth thief, fond of high rank and great emolument, unaware that such ambition is the ruin of one’s form and life.\n\nThus it is said: *Shoot forth the spirit to heaven.*\n\nThe above passage means that one who, within constant stillness, harbors no notion of stillness has truly comprehended the formless emptiness of the serene and luminous void. When stillness itself vanishes, true emptiness shines forth, revealing the authentic Dao. To perceive the true Dao is to penetrate the four truths of emptiness, nothingness, serenity, and stillness—yet ultimately, even true perception and emptiness must be dissolved. Thus, how could the poison of the six desires ever take root in one’s being? Hence it is said: *Stillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise?*\n\nMaster Wenzi said: One who attains stillness with no object of stillness becomes one with the vastness of space, shares the virtue of the Great Ultimate, and walks alongside the divine Way, transforming without deliberate transformation. How could such a one harbor desire? Thus it is said: *Stillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise?*\n\nSome may ask: Who can truly know this stillness with no object of stillness, and thus prevent desire from arising? In the first year of the Xining reign of the Song dynasty, there was a physician named Nie Churen from Yizhou. Of a tranquil disposition and refined bearing, he was over thirty years of age. From childhood, he had recited the *Scripture of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*, mastering its principles. Whenever he treated patients, regardless of their status or wealth, he prescribed the same remedies without ever asking for payment. The people revered him as a true healer of lives.\n\nOnce, a family of a high official summoned him to examine a patient. Upon arriving at the residence, he found the patient’s wife young and of extraordinary beauty. As he took her pulse, she made her intentions clear. Nie Churen averted his gaze, prescribed a dose of medicine, and hastily took his leave. His perception of true emptiness was so keen that he departed at once.\n\nLater, the official’s wife feigned illness and sent for him again. Nie Churen declined, citing other engagements. The lady persisted, sending messengers three or five times. Unable to refuse further, he was compelled to attend. She urged him, saying, \"My husband is away on a distant journey. Come to me tonight, and I shall receive you.\" In her dreams, she had already welcomed him as her lover. Nie Churen, startled, grasped her meaning and fled the house. Though she called after him, he never returned.\n\nAs the night deepened, suddenly someone knocked at the door, calling out, \"A patient is gravely ill—pray, Master Physician, come take his pulse.\" Nie Churen, unaware of the ruse, opened the door and stepped out, whereupon the lady seized him. She pleaded, \"If you yield to me, I shall grant you wealth and honor. Refuse, and though I am the wife of Magistrate Huang, I shall accuse you of forcing yourself upon me here. Comply, or you shall surely die.\" With no choice, Nie Churen feigned consent. He led her to a low wall, grasped her hand, and vaulted over it, fleeing without returning home. He took refuge in the Southern Mountains, where he recited the *Scripture of Supreme Purity and Tranquility*, cultivating the Dao of quiescence beyond all quiescence. Thus, how could desire arise in him?\n\nAt that time, the city god and earth god of his prefecture, witnessing Nie Churen’s unwavering resolve against desire, reported this to the Lord of Destiny. He was granted a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years and ascended as a celestial official. The lady, however, had her years stolen, dying at fifty. Her living soul was seized and cast into hell, while her body lay abed in the mortal realm, her belly wracked as if carved by knives. Her ethereal soul was bound to an iron pillar by hell’s wardens, who sliced open her abdomen and scoured away her heart of lust. She endured this torment, her agony unbearable. The wardens addressed her: \"You have suffered for seven years; three more remain before all three souls descend to hell. Even if you are reborn, you shall enter another’s womb—what then?\" The lady asked, \"How may I be saved?\" The ghostly clerk replied, \"In the mortal realm, sponsor a grand *Huanglu* jiao ritual, turn from evil to goodness, and daily recite the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity and Tranquility of Lord Lao*. Then you may escape this suffering.\" She pressed, \"Will this truly spare me?\" The clerk assured her, \"Truly. A single word of kindness brings blessings a thousand miles away. Repent your sins of lust—how could this be false?\" At once, her ethereal soul was temporarily reunited with her living soul.\n\nShe took heed, repented, and vowed never to transgress again. Her husband, the magistrate, took pity on her and commanded Daoist priests to perform a seven-day *Huanglu* jiao ritual. They chanted a thousand scrolls of the *Nine Dark Realms Redemption Litany* and printed ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of Tranquility*, distributing them to virtuous friends far and wide for recitation. Thereupon, the August Saints of the Nine Heavens pardoned her sins, and her ailment gradually eased. Reflecting on her past lust, she realized this was her retribution. In hell, not only had she suffered alone—countless others had committed the same sin. She told her husband, \"Empress Wu Zetian, in her lifetime, fornicated with monks and endured the Serpent Hell.\" The magistrate asked, \"How was she punished?\" She replied, \"She would strip off her robes and crown, entering a pit of venomous scorpions. They stung her flesh without cease. Once her sentence was served, she would don her garments and crown again.\" The magistrate asked, \"When will her suffering end?\" His wife answered, \"Only after a hundred years—then she must serve as a prostitute.\" She urged him, \"Do good, and never repeat such evil. The consequences are real.\" Hearing this, her husband too reformed his heart.\n\nThe two then cultivated together, each following the Supreme Lord’s Teachings of Purity and Stillness, reciting this true scripture a hundred times daily. They resigned from office, relinquishing their seals, and built an encircling wall within which they erected a thatched hut to sit in meditation. After nine years of Daoist practice, they passed away together while seated, their forms vanishing into the wall.\n\nThey left behind two poems:\n\nThe hells of Fengdu are unbearable to behold,\nTheir sight chills the heart and freezes the gall.\nA thousand deaths, ten thousand rebirths—suffering anew,\nIn the world of the living, the forked paths are hard to traverse again.\n\nRetreating from desire, desire no longer arises,\nDiligently cultivating purity and stillness, clarity shines forth.\nThe realm of the Celestial True, where nothing is yet still,\nLies only in the human heart’s turn toward good conduct.\n\nCommentary: The Dao takes purity, emptiness, stillness, and quietude as its essence, while people cling to lust and sensuality as reality. Do they not know the scripture that says, \"Form is precisely emptiness, emptiness precisely form\"? A broad Way leads to the path of heaven, while excessive desire plants the seeds of hell.\n\nNie Churen, embracing \"stillness where nothing is still,\" cast out the heart of desire, thereby extending his lifespan and inscribing his name in the celestial registers. His wife, mired in the sin of lust, had her years cut short, her soul summoned to the Northern Bureau, where the filth of her lustful heart was scoured away. The agony of her affliction was healed through the rites of the jiao offering. Only when she repented and turned to goodness, resigning from office to cultivate the Teachings of Purity and Stillness alongside him—daily reciting the true scripture and severing all ties to the mundane world—did they at last pass away together in seated meditation, their souls ascending to the Northern Dipper.\n\nAre the sacred true scriptures of the Most High without proof? Let later gentlemen who cherish the Dao take heed.\n\n*Tai Shang Lao Jun’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* #1: \"Activity is the foundation of stillness\" (alternatively rendered in the annotations of Hou Shanyuan and Liu Tongwei, as well as in the *Scripture of the Pure and Still Heart*, as \"Stillness is the foundation of activity\").",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility*\nOriginally annotated by an unknown author, likely composed during the Song dynasty. One fascicle.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\nCollated with annotated versions by Du Guangting et al.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility**\nAnnotated by an unknown author\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nThe Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThe Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\n\nThe Lord Lao expounds upon the threefold virtue of the Great Dao:\nFirst, the Great Dao is without form or substance, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nSecond, the Great Dao is without emotion or nature, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThird, the Great Dao is without name or appearance, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\n\nHow is it that the formless can give birth to Heaven and Earth?\nThe Great Dao is pure to the point of numinosity, tranquil to the point of emptiness. Its numinous emptiness is vast and boundless, the natural qi. Thus, it is without form or substance.\nThough without form or substance, it can give birth to Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the virtue of the Great Dao.\n\nThat it is without emotion or nature yet can move the sun and moon:\nThe Great Dao is also without emotion or nature, yet its natural qi moves the sun and moon, illuminating the myriad forms.\nThis is the second virtue of the Great Dao.\n\nThat it is without name or appearance yet can nurture the myriad beings:\nThe Great Dao, being without form or substance and without emotion or nature, can give birth to Heaven and Earth and move the sun and moon. Yet it has no name or designation, and its singular qi flows through all, transforming and generating the myriad beings.\nThis is the Great Dao’s inherent and operative principle.\n\nHeaven and Earth refer to the region from the *Niwan Palace* at the crown of the head down to the *Yongquan Point* at the soles of the feet.\nThe sun and moon refer to the left and right eyes above and the kidneys below.\nThe myriad beings refer to the ten thousand spirits within the body.\n\nWhen a person receives a body, it arises from the singular qi of the Dao, aligning with Heaven and Earth, harmonizing yin and yang. Through the union of father and mother, form is structured.\nThus, the first month is the celestial womb; the second, the earthly embryo; the third, the three hun-souls; the fourth, the seven po-souls; the fifth, the five viscera; the sixth, the six bowels; the seventh, the seven orifices; the eighth, the descent of the eight luminous spirits; the ninth, the descent of eighteen thousand spirits, with inner and outer combining to form thirty-six thousand essences of radiance.\nWhen the spirits descend and the form is complete, the tenth month is fulfilled, and birth is received. Thus, we know the Great Dao has no form or substance, yet its primordial qi can transform into the qi of form.\n\nThe qi of form is primordial qi, extending eight hundred and ten *zhang*.\nPreserve and cherish it. Cherishing it prevents the body’s decay, just as the Great Dao, though without form or substance, circulates its true essence.\nNurturing the essence of the kidneys prevents decay, and the eyes become clear of themselves.\n\nWe also know the Great Dao has no name, yet its true essence becomes form.\nForm is the root of receiving qi, and qi is the foundation of form.\nWhere there is qi, there is essence; where there is essence, there is spirit.\nThus, qi is the mother of spirit, and spirit is the child of qi. Mother and child do not part—this is called attaining the Dao.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;\nThe Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;\nThe Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad beings.\nIf one can cherish form, nurture qi, and preserve spirit, one will comprehend the Dao of true constancy, purity, and tranquility.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"With tranquility, contemplate the Dao; with purity, cultivate the body.\"\nThose who do so can attain purity and tranquility.\n\n\"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\n\"I\" refers to the Supreme Lord’s self-designation, meaning \"myself.\"\nThe Supreme Lord states that though the Great Dao possesses the three virtues of formlessness, it naturally gives birth to Heaven and Earth; though without emotion or nature, it naturally moves the sun and moon; though without name or appearance, it naturally nurtures the myriad beings. Yet I do not know its true name. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is uniquely supreme. Thus, I provisionally call it the Dao.\n\nTherefore, it is said: \"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\nThings exist in the boundless and indistinct, where names are unknown. When they descend and manifest, names arise.\nNames are the function of the Dao.\nThe sage governs the world with the nameless simplicity.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Employing the traceless, things transform of themselves.\"\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Spiritually transform them, and the people will be fittingly ordered.\"\nIn the past, Emperor Taizong of Tang governed the world, and the myriad regions submitted. Through the transformation of the nameless, without relying on might or punishment, he adjudicated three hundred death sentences, and the world had no transgressors in the judicial courts. A peck of grain cost three coins, and travelers journeyed a thousand miles without carrying provisions.\nThe flourishing of this Dao lay in its namelessness.\n\nThus, the Supreme Lord said: \"I do not know its name, so I forcefully call it the Dao.\"\nIn the beginning of human cultivation, there is no name. Through cultivation, it arises—this is the name of the perfected person.\n\nThe Dao has purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\nThe Dao reveals its greatness.\nThe Lord Lao said: \"I do not know the name of the Great Dao, so I provisionally call it the Dao.\"\nThough without form or substance, without emotion or nature, without name or appearance, it can flow as singular qi.\nWithin this singular qi, there is purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth must embody the Dao.\nThe body must be pure and return from turbidity; the spirit must be still and return from movement.\nWhen purity and turbidity, movement and stillness are properly aligned, this may be called the Dao.\n\nThus, it is said: \"There is purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\"\nMaster Wenzi said: \"When the time is pure, be pure; when turbid, be turbid; when it is time to act, act.\"\nThis is called harmonizing with the light and blending with the dust, upholding the Dao of purity and tranquility.\n\nIn the Qingyuan era of the Tang dynasty, there was a hunter named Sun Shou who lived by the sea and made his living through hunting.",

Only one cluster of plants remained lush and verdant, untouched by the blaze. Sun Shou, struck by doubt, approached it and saw nestled among the greenery a Daoist hermitage.

      "translated_text": "Upon hearing the Dao, Sun Shou cast aside his bow and arrows to pay reverence. He received the scripture, awakened to the Way, and likewise gained renown in the world.\n\nThe Great Dao encompasses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness. Heaven is pure, earth turbid; heaven moves, earth is still. The Great Dao, in its ultimate formlessness, flows through the unity of primordial qi—within it, purity and turbidity arise. Pure qi congeals and ascends to form heaven; turbid qi flows downward to become earth. Thus, heaven is yang, and yang delights in movement; earth is yin, and yin delights in stillness. Movement is the qi of heaven; stillness is the qi of earth. Hence, it is said: heaven is pure, earth turbid; heaven moves, earth is still.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven is pure and at peace; earth is turbid and solid. Solidity allows for establishment. Heaven moves and transforms; earth is still and serene. Serenity allows for adaptability.\" This is what is meant by heaven being pure and earth turbid, heaven moving and earth still.\n\nDoes reciting this scripture yield verification?\n\nIt is answered: In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Bai Renzhe, who served as magistrate of Zhuyang County. While transporting grain to Liaodong, he suddenly encountered a great storm. All around, darkness descended, and waves surged violently. Renzhe was seized by terror. Then, a voice from the void spoke: \"You have received the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility of the Most High Lord Lao*—why not recite it swiftly?\" Renzhe hastily recited it over thirty times. Suddenly, a golden light emanated from his mouth. Soon after, the wind subsided, and the waves calmed. Over three hundred fellow travelers witnessed the golden light streaming from his mouth. Upon returning home, Renzhe donated his entire salary to sponsor a grand Yellow Register Offering and an Unobstructed Great Assembly, commissioning the carving of printing blocks to distribute three thousand copies of the true scripture. Renzhe lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen before passing away in seated meditation. Such is the verification of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nMan is pure, woman turbid; man moves, woman is still. Man is yang; woman is yin. The yang of man is pure and governs movement; the yin of woman is turbid and governs stillness. These two principles fundamentally speak of yin and yang, of turbidity and purity, of movement and stillness—thus it is said: man is pure, woman turbid.\n\nThis is how the Most High further divided the Great Dao, enveloping heaven and earth within the primordial qi of the Hunyuan. Heaven governs the light and pure, giving rise to yang; yang governs movement. Earth governs the heavy and turbid, giving rise to yin; yin governs stillness. Through the interaction of yin and yang, movement and stillness intertwine, and primordial essence descends. With the descent of primordial essence, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When heaven and earth intermingle in harmony, the myriad things transform in purity.\" This is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\n\nFor those who cultivate the truth, if they can circulate the true water of the kidneys as the Infant Brother and the true fire of the heart as the Maiden, causing the true fire to descend and the true water to ascend, then the ten thousand spirits will abide long and not scatter. When the ten thousand spirits do not scatter, one attains longevity and enduring vision—this is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven is yang, earth is yin—they interact to generate the myriad things. Movement and stillness unite—this is what is meant by man being pure and woman turbid, man moving and woman still.\"\n\nDoes reading this scripture yield verification?\n\nIn the Linde era of Emperor Gaozong’s reign during the Tang dynasty, Dou Dexuan, an official, was dispatched as an emissary to Yangzhou.

He said to the boatman, \"That man is destitute and forlorn—let us ferry him across.\" The boatman poled the boat back to the shore, allowing the man to board. Midway across the river, seeing the man’s famished countenance, Dexuan ordered his attendants to take provisions and give them to the man, who ate his fill. Once they reached the opposite bank, Dexuan mounted his horse and departed, but the man followed closely behind for several *li* more.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, Dexuan awoke as if from a dream. Opening his eyes, he saw his family weeping around his bed. His kin said, \"You have been dead for three days.\" Dexuan replied, \"There was such holy business.\" Thereafter, he put his household in order, entered Jingling Abbey, and became a Daoist, devoting himself solely to the teachings of purity and stillness. Twelve years later, a purple cloud descended from the sky. A jade-clad youth led a pair of cranes before the courtyard and said to Dexuan, \"Please mount the crane’s back and depart.\" Dexuan leapt onto the crane, ascending slowly into the heavens. A rare fragrance lingered for a month. He left behind a poem:\n\nA hundred thousand threads of worldly affairs,\nThe fly’s fame, the snail’s gain—unworthy of sight.\nHow much better to awaken to this purity and stillness,\nWhen merit is full, ascend as an official of heaven.\n\nThe commentary states: Movement and stillness grind against each other, yin and yang interact, and thus the myriad things are born. Those who comprehend this Dao ascend as celestial officials. Dou Dexuan understood this. The root flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things. The root is primordial *qi*. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One is the primordial *qi* as the root. The branches are the myriad things. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the myriad things. This is the root of the Great Dao.\n\nThis passage from the Supreme Lord Lao once more expounds the principles of purity and turbidity, movement and stillness: the Dao gives birth to primordial *qi*, primordial *qi* descends as the root and flows forth, and from this flow the myriad things are born—thus, the branches. This is the descent of the root and the flow of the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: \"Heaven governs primordial *qi*, Earth encompasses primordial *qi*. The formless nurtures primordial *qi*, and primordial *qi*, though formless, nurtures the myriad things.\" Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things. Once primordial *qi* descends, it flows forth as the branches.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When primordial *qi* descends, in heaven it forms images, on earth it takes shape—transformation and manifestation are evident.\" In heaven, it forms images: the suspended images of the sun, moon, and stars. On earth, it takes shape: the mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees. Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The utmost yang is Heaven, the utmost yin is Earth. The reverent *qi* reaches the heart’s fire, and with water and fire in harmony, the myriad spirits are nurtured.\" Thus, it is said: the root descends and flows into the branches, giving rise to the myriad things.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is there proof in studying this true scripture?\"\nThe answer: \"To study this true scripture, one must save beings and deliver lives. In the Tang dynasty, there was Song Zhixuan of Fangzhou, who served as Assistant Officer in Qizhou. When he arrived, people said his residence was inauspicious, haunted by ghosts and malevolent spirits—of those who lived there, six or seven out of ten died. Zhixuan, who had always loved the Dao, was upright in heart and, from his youth, had recited the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*. He deeply understood its meaning and embodied its practice. Thus, he refused to believe: 'How could I not dwell in peace? Why heed such talk?' He resolutely took up residence in the house and composed a poem by Master Lü:\n\nA single grain of golden elixir ensures long life,\nTrue lead must refine the cyclical stems.\nFire draws the crimson phoenix’s marrow from the south,\nWater seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.\nThe crucible follows the earth at the center of the four seasons,\nThe medicine follows the three origins and eight trigrams.\nWith fasting and merit complete in nine revolutions,\nEven ghosts and spirits tremble at purity and stillness.\n\nZhixuan sat solemnly, circulating the fire-wheel to envelop his body. Red light filled the room as he silently recited the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*. Around the second watch, a woman with disheveled hair and a bloodstained face suddenly appeared before him. Zhixuan asked, 'Who are you?' The woman replied, 'I am a ghost with a grievance.' She bowed and wept, saying, 'I beg for your help. Today, I have encountered a man of the Dao and may finally voice my plight. Ten years ago, I was the wife of Liu, an Officer of Affairs. My husband was sent on a mission abroad and never returned. His younger brother forced himself upon me. When I resisted, he killed me, wrapped my body in felt, and hid it in the northwest corner of the hall, beneath the privy, where filth accumulated. Many have wished to report this, but all feared my form. Lacking the *qi* of the Dao, they died of terror upon seeing me. Your recitation of this scripture carries great merit and kindness. I beg your compassion.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Upon hearing this, Registrar Liu was greatly startled and said, \"I thank you, sir, for coming so far to resolve this entanglement. How dare I defy your counsel?\" He then gathered his family's wealth and held a grand *Huanglu* Offering for seven days and seven nights, inviting over a hundred Daoists to participate. He also printed ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness* to distribute as alms.\n\nAt noon that day, a woman of about thirty appeared, leading a treasure horse laden with ten thousand scrolls of scriptures. She said, \"By the power of this scripture and offering, I have received the decree of the Supreme Lord Lao to enter the Vermilion Palace and refine my true spirit, ascending as an Immortal of the Southern Palace. In my long life in the world, Military Advisor Song also became an Immortal of the Southern Palace.\" Having spoken, she slowly rose into the sky and departed.\n\nZhixuan and Registrar Liu then pledged themselves as fellow Daoists, vowing to uphold the true teachings. Zhixuan returned to Fangzhou, and upon reaching home, a green phoenix descended into his courtyard. He burned incense, and the green phoenix slowly drifted southward, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*In past lives, pure and awakened to the true scripture,*\n*Lifting sins and aiding the imperiled from punishment.*\n*Today, by this merit’s power,*\n*In the Vermilion Palace, spirit and form refine.*\n\nIt is said: The adept who cultivates the true, riding this merit, embodies the Dao and performs its works—understanding the principle of descending from root to branch, knowing the causes of the myriad things’ transformation; aiding the endangered, rescuing the distressed, and resolving grievances. With such purity and compassion, how could one not become an Immortal of the Southern Palace? The rank of Immortal of the Southern Palace was attained by Song Zhixuan, for he comprehended the descent from root to branch in the generation of the myriad things.\n\nThe pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness. The pure is the primordial *qi*; the turbid is the myriad things. Movement is spirit; stillness is form. The Supreme Lord speaks of the Dao, taking the singular *qi* as the ancestor of the myriad things—for the ancestor is the source. The human spirit takes the singular form as its abode, thus uniting as the fundamental basis. Without spirit, form cannot move; without form, spirit cannot endure. Spirit is the master; form is the abode. These two lines broadly speak of the Dao’s *qi* as the root of the myriad things, distinguishing purity and stillness. The pure is the primordial *qi*; the turbid is the form of the myriad things. If one can move with spirit while preserving and securing form, one becomes the foundation and source of the myriad things. Thus it is said: the pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: Without turbidity, purity cannot be perceived; without purity, turbidity cannot be perceived. Without the singular *qi*, the myriad things cannot be born; without the myriad things, the singular *qi* cannot be divided. Thus it is said: the pure is the source of the turbid; movement is the foundation of stillness.\n\nMaster Wen said: In utmost purity, turbidity is seen—this is the pure as the source of the turbid. In utmost movement, stillness is contemplated—this is movement as the foundation of stillness. The adept who cultivates the true nurtures spirit with the singular *qi*, hence purity; nurtures the belly with the five flavors, hence turbidity. Thus spirit must move in accord, while form rests in stillness—this is the Dao of purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\n\nThis scripture has further verification. It is said: In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Yuan Tong from Tianshui. From childhood, he loved the Dao and devoted himself to reciting the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*, chanting it forty-nine times daily. At the age of twenty, he was conscripted by An Lushan’s army and suddenly lost in battle. Yuan Tong fled, unaware of his path, and in the mountain thickets, unable to find food, he grew so weak he could not rise. He continued reciting the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, though without strength, awaiting death.\n\nSuddenly, a youth in green robes appeared, holding a bowl of rice, and offered it to him. Yuan Tong ate, and its fragrance and flavor were beyond description. After eating his fill, the youth said, \"The perfected nurture their pure bellies with pure *qi*; ordinary people nurture their turbid bellies with external things. The perfected circulate *qi* to harmonize spirit and settle stillness; ordinary people scatter spirit and deplete essence to delight in form. From childhood, you have loved the Dao and remained steadfast, reciting the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao on Purity and Stillness*—you have already borne the fruit of the Dao. The Supreme Lord has sent me to bestow this upon you. From now on, let this sustain you. Use spirit for the Dao, and you will no longer need to eat. Today, your name has been stricken from the Black Register and arranged in the Vermilion Palace. The Dao of purity and stillness is not in vain.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the youth vanished. From then on, Yuan Tong no longer ate and attained the wisdom of the six penetrations. He lived until the reign of Emperor Zhezong of the Song, though the events occurred in the time of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang—five hundred years passed, yet his face remained as that of a man of thirty. He often wandered between the Luo and Ru rivers, reciting only the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, and no one ever saw him eat. People called him the Master of Purity and Stillness. If someone suffered illness, no matter how distant, he would stroke them with his hand, and there was none who did not recover. Later, people imitated his touch.\n\nOnce, outside the gates of Bianjing, he cried out loudly: \"You seek chaos—I do not. You seek turbidity—I do not. You rush about—how can you live?\"",

Riding clouds and mounting cranes, he ascended to the Jade Emperor’s celestial palace, dwelling forever in the Pavilion of Carefree Roaming.\n\nAs the recitation ended, a crane descended from the heavens. The Master swiftly mounted its back, rising gently upon the clouds. All below gazed upward in awe. From the sky fluttered a sheet of paper, inscribed with the words: *\"The Dao gives birth to purity.\"*\n\nThe *Dao-Giving Birth* comprises dozens of precepts.\n\nThe treatise states: The Great Dao cannot be seen, cannot be heard, yet none under heaven know it, none practice it. Though unseen and unknown, those who cultivate it truly possess the Dao.\n\nThe Most High said: My words are easily understood, easily practiced.

How fitting indeed!\n\nIf one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will wholly return.

He had a daughter, twenty-six years of age, married to Wang Gui, Vice Director of the Left Secretariat. As Wang was her superior, his wife, née Han, remained in her parents’ home during her pregnancy. One night, around the third watch, a sound arose from the northwest corner. All the maidservants were asleep, but the young mistress, née Han, remained awake. She saw a general clad in armor, holding a golden hairpin, who declared: “I am General Wei of the Jin dynasty.

      "translated_text": "Once more, as the third watch approached, the general reappeared. All the maidservants saw him and fled in terror. The general rebuked them, saying: “I have spoken to you of the Dao—why have you not moved her? If she remains here by tomorrow, I will kill her.” Han replied: “I beg you, General, calm your anger. I will move her tomorrow.” Then the general vanished.\n\nAt daybreak, the maidservants tearfully reported the young mistress’s words to Vice Director Han. He said: “A woman in childbirth cannot be moved before seven days have passed—how could she dare? Her *qi* and blood are depleted, and she raves in delirium.” They answered: “The maidservants saw him as well.” Han replied: “Women are all prone to believing in such omens.” He firmly refused to comply.\n\nThat night, General Wei appeared once more and said: “I have warned you three times, yet you still refuse to move her.” Seeing that she had not been moved, his anger flared. He struck Han with his hairpin, piercing her heart. With a single cry, she perished. Her father, brandishing a sword, rushed in. Overcome with grief, her parents wept bitterly and sent an urgent letter to her husband.\n\nUpon receiving the news, her husband, Wang Gui, was stricken with sorrow. Disregarding his official duties, he returned home. Ten *li* west of Sizhuang Town, he saw a woman approaching from afar. As she drew near, he recognized her as his wife. Dismounting at once, he asked: “How have you come to be here?” All his attendants saw her as well. She replied: “I was killed by General Wei of the Jin dynasty. My grievance remains unaddressed. As a man of stature, can you not avenge your wife?” She wept. Wang Gui, overcome with grief, stepped forward, but she said: “The paths of the living and the dead diverge—do not come near me. I have heard that in this town there is a Master Tian, who from childhood has recited the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue in Supreme Purity* and practiced the Way of quiescence and non-action. He possesses the power to subdue spirits and the virtue to commune with Heaven. As the text says: ‘If one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth will all return to them.’ Seek him to redress my wrong.” She told him where to find the master.\n\nWang Gui visited Master Tian and recounted the events in full. The master replied: “I shall intercede for you above with the Mysterious Heavens and below with the Earth Deity to save your wife.” He then led Wang Gui into a separate chamber. As the first watch began, Master Tian donned his court robes, took up a jade tablet, and held a censer of incense. Closing his eyes, he knelt and lit seven lamps, chanting an incantation to commence his prayer.\n\nSuddenly, a celestial warrior appeared in the chamber and declared: “By decree of Heaven, I descend into the netherworld.” The warrior presented the edict, then vanished. The master said: “I now bear the Emperor of Heaven’s decree. We shall go together to the underworld to seize General Wei.” He took a clean mat and had Wang Gui lie upon it, whereupon he fell into a stupor. The master sat beside him, projecting his spirit, and guided Wang Gui’s spirit out the door.\n\nAfter traveling several *li*, they saw a great city. The sky was dim, and armored soldiers on either side wielded halberds. Upon seeing the master, they all lowered their weapons and bowed in reverence. Entering the gate, a crimson-robed scribe hastily announced their arrival. Dozens of attendants, upon seeing the master, likewise prostrated themselves, crying out: “The Perfected Master Tian has arrived!”\n\nMoments later, green-clad youths bearing banners approached, leading a figure clad in dragon robes, wearing a *yuanyou* crown, and holding a jade tablet. They announced: “This is the Great Emperor of Fengdu.” Upon seeing the Perfected Master Tian, the emperor exchanged courtesies and invited him to proceed first, showing him the utmost deference as if they were old acquaintances.\n\nA ghostly attendant asked Wang Gui: “Who are you?” He replied: “I am an attendant of the Perfected Master Tian.” The attendant asked no further questions. Ascending the hall, the master and the emperor sat facing each other. The master presented the decree for the emperor’s inspection, and Wang Gui, along with the others, paid their respects.\n\nBefore long, a blue-robed youth announced: “The Patrol General is to swiftly apprehend the yin ghost General Wei of the Jin dynasty in the netherworld.” A warrior clad in golden chainmail, wielding a great sword, responded to the summons. Soon after, he reported: “The yin ghost General Wei has been captured.” Wang Gui said: “Bring him forth.”\n\nSeveral black-robed officials dragged a man before the steps. The emperor said: “You, a yin ghost for years, killed countless living beings in your time and even harmed an innocent woman.” General Wei replied: “I warned her repeatedly, but she refused to move. In a moment of anger, I killed her. Consider my meritorious service in the Jin dynasty.” The emperor said: “Even as a yin ghost, you dare kill the living—what merit do you claim? You shall receive three hundred strokes of the iron rod and be exiled to the Northern Yin Mountain for a thousand years.” The attendants bound him and threw him to the ground, striking his back three hundred times. His cries of agony were unbearable to hear.\n\nAfter the punishment, an official said: “By decree, he is to be sent to Yin Mountain.” Wang Gui asked about Han’s whereabouts. The attendants replied: “She is here—bring her forward.” They led her from the side corridor. Han knelt weakly before Wang Gui. He asked: “What is to be done?” The attendants said: “Her dwelling has been destroyed. She may borrow a body to be reborn.” The judge consulted the register and found that Han was fated to live sixty-six years, with forty years remaining. At present, a girl named Shouniang, daughter of a Wang family in Qingzhou, was due to die at twenty-six. They ordered Han to enter Shouniang’s body and revive, and the decree was carried out.\n\nWang Gui begged the master to depart, and he followed, still in a daze. Suddenly, he awoke. The master said: “Sir, this matter must remain secret.”",

      "translated_text": "Wang Gui bowed repeatedly and asked, “How did you come to wander here?” The master replied: “I recite the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*. By following its teachings, I harmonize my virtue with Heaven and Earth.\n\n*When one abides in constant clarity and stillness,\nHeaven and Earth all return to them.*\n\nReturn home at once and seek your wife at the Wang household in Qingzhou.”\n\nWang Gui took leave of the master and departed. On the road, he hastened to Yunzhou, where his wife Han had already been laid to rest. He went directly to the Wang household in Qingzhou and recognized his wife’s child. The Wang family’s daughter, Shouniang, had been dead for three days when she revived and said: “I am the daughter of Han, Vice Minister of Rites. My father is now Prefect of Yunzhou.” Before she could finish explaining, Wang Gui arrived at the Wang residence. Seeing Shouniang, she immediately said: “My husband has come.” Her voice was nothing like Shouniang’s former tone. Wang Gui said: “Shouniang’s voice is now entirely Han’s.” He recounted the full story, and the Wang family then traveled to Yunzhou to meet Han’s parents. Her voice was unchanged from before. Both husband and wife suddenly awakened to the Great Dao, and they exhausted their family wealth to carve and print over one hundred thousand scrolls of scriptures, distributing them in all directions. They held a grand offering to the heavens in gratitude.\n\nAfterward, Wang Gui and his wife returned to Temple Village to thank Master Tian. Upon completing their thanks, the master said: “You and your wife may cultivate together.” Wang Gui followed his words, resigning from office. He hung up his official robes, became a Daoist, and resided at the Fude Abbey in Chang’an. Han became a Daoist nun and lived at the Jade Capital Abbey. Each lived to one hundred and twenty years before passing.\n\nThe treatise says: *Abiding in stillness, yet responsive and penetrating—clarity and non-action.* Master Tian followed the scripture of the Most High and practiced the laws of Heaven. Above, he moved the vault of heaven; below, he communicated with the earth. He caused the Northern Emperor to descend and adjudicate grievances—truly, *when one abides in constant clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return to them.*\n\nNow, the spirit delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desire pulls it away. At birth, a person’s spirit is clear and their heart is still. As they grow, they are drawn by emotions and desires—this is the nature of life. Thus, the character for *desire* (欲) is composed of *valley* (谷) and *lack* (欠). *Valley* signifies the absence of leakage, while *lack* denotes insufficiency. When the spirit clings to love, it becomes *emotion*; when the heart clings to craving, it becomes *greed.*\n\nMaster Kangcang said: “Water is naturally clear, yet it cannot remain so when muddied by earth. Human nature is naturally still, yet it cannot remain so when disturbed by affairs.” *Disturbed* (汨) means chaos. The Most High spoke of these two principles: the spirit naturally delights in clarity and stillness, yet cannot attain them because the heart fails to embody the Dao of clarity and stillness. The heart harbors emotions of attachment, which disturb and disrupt it, preventing clarity and stillness. Thus, *the spirit delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it.* The heart is fundamentally inclined toward clarity and stillness, yet it cannot attain them because it is pulled by the greed of desire. Hence, *the heart delights in stillness, yet desire pulls it away.*\n\nMaster Wenzhong said: “The contented always delight in having no wants; the greedy always worry over insufficiency.” The contented delight in having no wants, so their spirit delights in clarity and their heart in stillness. The greedy worry over insufficiency, so their heart is disturbed and pulled by desire.\n\nMaster Baiyun said: “Desire is the source of greed and attachment, the root of excess and indulgence.” If one can embrace the Dao of clarity and stillness, the spirit will be clear. When the spirit is clear, the heart cannot disturb it; when the heart is still, desire cannot pull it away.\n\nSome ask: “Can one who studies this scripture attain a spirit polished and undisturbed, a heart still and unburdened by desire? Is there proof?” The answer: In the past, Emperor Yizong of Tang had a daughter titled Princess Tongchang, who married the imperial son-in-law Wei. The princess found her official residence unsatisfactory, so the emperor bestowed upon her a mansion surpassing even the imperial palace—its halls and pavilions adorned with gold and jade. He granted her five million strings of cash from the inner treasury. Yet the princess was still not content. She petitioned again, saying she lacked treasures. The emperor emptied the inner treasury of its jewels to fill her mansion, adorning every chamber, door, and window with rare and precious gems. He had mortars and pestles, food chests, water troughs, cauldrons, and basins made of gold and silver; sieves and dustpans woven from silver thread; beds and couches fashioned from crystal, lapis lazuli, and tortoiseshell. Golden tortoises and silver cranes were placed about, and five-colored jade was carved into plates, with hundred-jeweled inlays forming patterns.\n\nStill, the princess’s desires arose anew. She petitioned for grain, so the emperor opened the inner treasury and bestowed fifty *hu* of golden wheat and silver rice. She then complained that her halls lacked curtains and drapes. The emperor presented her with curtains of linked pearls, their edges strung with gems. He also gave her a *cold-warm medicine* fan—when hung in winter, it brought warmth; in summer, coolness. He bestowed upon her a nine-phoenix hairpin, which, when worn, emitted a nine-colored radiance. Whenever she ventured out, she rode in a seven-jeweled carriage, its sides inlaid with five-colored jade. Fragrant sachets held rare incenses—warding off cold, evil, and dust—all tributes from foreign lands. Her carriage’s canopy was adorned with carved dragons of mixed jewels and camphor, gold filigree, crystal, and agate. Dragons and phoenixes of auspicious design were set upon trays of onyx and carnelian, the canopy’s edges fringed with pearls. At its peak sat a lotus of green jade, crowned with a single golden pearl, its radiance rising three feet high. Golden threads suspended jade tassels, and from within, celestial music naturally resounded.\n\nWith every outing, fragrant winds filled the roads, their scent lingering for half a year. Her pearls gleamed brilliantly, casting a dazzling light.",

Though the princess’s wealth and nobility were boundless, her heart remained unsatisfied, her thoughts never reaching the realm of Penglai—thus she fell ill.\n\nThe princess resided within the palace, and from childhood had reverently recited the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* as spoken by the Most High Lord Lao. She summoned the imperial physician, Mi Zong, to treat her. By evening, she presented him with a two-inch candle of fragrant wax, bidding him take it home. Its scent was intensely pungent, spreading through the neighboring quarters. When visitors came to inquire, Mi Zong truthfully explained that it was the candle’s fragrance. The candle, two inches long, bore five-colored patterns; when lit, it grew warm, and by dawn its scent remained unexhausted, perceptible for three or four hundred paces. Its smoke ascended, forming the shapes of canopied pavilions and towers, with blossoms of rare and wondrous flowers.\n\nThe princess’s illness grew severe. She ordered her attendants to fetch the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* by the Most High Lord Lao, and from a green jade casket she took a precious incense called \"Heaven-Piercing Fragrance,\" burning it as she recited the sacred scripture. Before she could complete seven recitations, two crimson-robed messengers appeared, saying: \"The Prefect summons you.\" The princess replied: \"I am the daughter of an emperor—how dare you summon me?\" She commanded her attendants to seize them, but they did not obey. The messengers said: \"This concerns the affairs of the Netherworld—what does it matter that you are an imperial daughter?\" With their hands, they pulled her to her feet.

      "translated_text": "Through murky darkness they journeyed over a hundred *li* before arriving at a great city, where signs of human habitation appeared. The princess said, \"I am hungry.\" The attendant replied, \"The food here is all charred to the core—its stench is unbearable to see or smell.\" In an instant, the wind blew and all returned to its former state. The princess covered her eyes, unable to bear the sight.\n\nThen she saw dozens of men and women, stripped naked, their bodies seared by red-hot iron rods, blood flowing to the ground until it became a mire of gore. The princess asked the attendant, \"What crimes have these people committed to suffer such torment?\" The attendant replied, \"In the world above, these are the sins of extravagance and indulgence.\"\n\nThe princess gasped, \"And what of my fate?\" The attendant said, \"It will be the same.\" In that moment, a ghostly official appeared, two horns sprouting from his head, wielding an iron hammer. He commanded, \"Princess, remove your clothes.\" The princess said, \"I am the daughter of an emperor!\" The ghost replied, \"This court does not recognize imperial daughters—remove your clothes.\" Knowing resistance was futile, she began to remove her headdress and robes, silently reciting *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nThe ghostly official urged, \"Hurry, remove your clothes!\" As she recited, she removed another garment. The ghost then reached out to seize her clothing. The princess felt as though boiling oil had been poured into her heart, the pain unbearable. She recited more urgently, reaching the passage on the dissolution of the Three Poisons. Suddenly, a golden light appeared, and the ghostly officials all rose into the air in reverence. A perfected being descended upon purple clouds—it was the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.\n\nFrom the Palace of Great Purity came the sound of recitation: *The Scripture of Primordial Lord Lao on Constant Purity and Tranquility*. \"By reciting this scripture once, you have reached the realm of the Three Clarities. The Supreme Lord Lao has sent me to descend into the nether prison and absolve the sins of the condemned.\" The princess bowed deeply to the perfected one.\n\nThe princess said, \"It was by reciting this scripture that I came here—I am the daughter of the present Emperor Yizong.\" The perfected one asked, \"What crime have you committed to be here?\" The ghostly officials replied, \"The sin of greed and desire.\" Just then, the assembled ghostly officials exclaimed, \"It is the Great Emperor of Fengdu!\" All paid homage to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One radiated light, illuminating the nether prison. He addressed the imperial daughter: \"There is no greater sin than desire. Desire is the root of licentiousness and disorder. There is no greater sin than greed. Greed is the source of usurpation and envy. To weigh it lightly is to destroy oneself; to weigh it heavily is to ruin one’s family. Those in the world who do not awaken to the Dao do not comprehend the principle of purity and tranquility. They do not know the subtlety of contentment, only seeking fine foods to sate their mouths and wealth and honor to adorn their bodies. Yet the sweetness of such food is the axe that severs life, and the extravagance of riches and luxury is the mechanism that invites resentment. Once resentment arises, how can one avoid the hells? Why not embrace emptiness and purity, kindness and benevolence, loyalty and trust, filial piety and harmony, modesty and frugality, gentleness and humility, and cleanliness—thus aligning with the Dao? Do not cling to extravagance; uphold simplicity. Extravagance is the cause of hell; frugality is the foundation of heaven.\"\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said to the princess, \"I shall save you. In the world above, will you reform your extravagant desires?\" The princess bowed again and said, \"I will reform.\" The perfected one said, \"I have the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds, the Six Fasts and Three Assemblies, the Five Laba Festivals and Five Taboo Days—can you observe them?\" The princess replied, \"I can.\"\n\nThe perfected one said, \"If you uphold them, you will become a celestial official; if you fail, you will become a lowly ghost.\" He continued, \"The Five Precepts are: first, do not kill; second, do not indulge in desire; third, do not speak falsely with the heart; fourth, do not steal; fifth, do not engage in licentiousness. The Ten Good Deeds are: first, honor and support your parents; second, be loyal to your sovereign and teachers; third, let go of all things in your heart; fourth, restrain anger and prevent wrongdoing; fifth, cease conflict and resolve enmity; sixth, humble yourself to aid the poor; seventh, give life and succor to others; eighth, dig wells and plant trees by the roadside; ninth, benefit others and eliminate harm; tenth, praise the Three Treasures, explain the scriptures to others, and always harbor good thoughts. Those who constantly practice these Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds will have celestial beings and benevolent spirits protect them, forever free from disaster and ever blessed with good fortune—provided their resolve is steadfast.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Six Fasts?\" The perfected one replied, \"The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month.\" The princess asked, \"What are the Ten Fasts?\" The perfected one said, \"The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month. On these ten days, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Save from Suffering deliver the souls of the condemned from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Three Assemblies?\" The perfected one replied, \"The seventh day of the first month is the Upper Assembly of Ascension; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Middle Assembly of Celebration; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Lower Assembly of Establishment.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Five Laba Festivals?\" The perfected one said, \"The first day of the first month is the Heavenly Laba; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly Laba; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Laba of the Dao and Virtue; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Laba of the People’s Year; the twelfth month is the Laba of Kings and Lords.\"\n\nThe princess asked, \"What are the Five Taboo Days?\" The perfected one replied, \"First, the day of Jiazi, when the True Lord Taiyi records people’s transgressions; second, the day of Gengshen, when the Three Corpses report people’s sins; third, one’s own birthday, when the Star Officials tally one’s merits and deeds; fourth, the Eight Festivals, when the Eight Spirits assess people’s good and evil; fifth, the Three Yuan days, when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water record people’s sins and blessings.\"\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said, \"On these days, you may perform rituals, observe fasts, recite scriptures, and make offerings to pray for protection.\" The princess bowed again to the perfected one and said, \"I will follow the Dao’s decrees in every detail.\" The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One then radiated light, illuminating the nether prison, and all within were reborn in heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The stalwart azure-clad youth then led the princess to hasten her return. The Perfected One ascended into heaven and departed, transformed. The Great Emperor of the Northern Yin Fengdu and all the spirits and ghosts rejoiced greatly. The azure-clad youth guided the princess to a golden gate, pushed her through, and suddenly the princess awoke with a start. She found herself lying on a jade-inlaid bed, covered with brocade quilts. Opening her eyes, she saw her husband, the imperial son-in-law, and the court officials beside her, weeping as they surrounded her. The princess sat up, clutching the quilt. A palace attendant said, \"Princess, you have slept for a long time; we dared not disturb you.\" The princess replied, \"Wealth and honor are like sparks struck from stone, glory and splendor like fleeting reflections on water—time passes as in a dream of Southern Branch. Her illness was instantly cured.\n\nThe princess then entered the palace to address the emperor, returning all her treasures to the imperial treasury and begging to renounce her worldly ties to follow the Dao. The emperor asked, \"Why?\" The princess recounted in full the events of the netherworld. The emperor, overjoyed, granted her request and transformed the Golden Immortal Abbey in the Revered Immortal Precinct into the Jade Perfection Abbey. After entering the abbey, the princess never again crossed its threshold. Though nobles, relatives, and even her husband sought audience, the princess ordered the gates guarded, and none could see her. Each day, she recited only the *Supreme Venerable Lord’s Explanation of the Perfect Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*, never growing lax.\n\nThree years later, she again beheld the Perfected One within a radiance of red light, who said to her, \"Your ascension draws near; you shall attain the rank of celestial immortal. Hasten to cultivate merit and fruition.\" With these words, the Perfected One vanished. The princess then performed the great Yellow Register Retreat.\n\nOn the fifteenth night of the Upper Prime Festival, phoenixes and cranes descended from heaven. The moonlight was as bright as day, and fragrant breezes filled the air. The cranes alighted in the courtyard, and the princess mounted a phoenix’s back, ascending slowly into the sky. She left behind a *Tang Duoling* lyric:\n\n*Life and fate—how to weigh them?*\n*Lavish splendor—do not overindulge.*\n*Guard chastity, health, frugality, peace, and harmony;*\n*Measure yourself against others, and no calamity shall befall.*\n*Alas! The young grow old, the noble grow poor—*\n*Such is the way of the world.*\n\n*Shatter the nest of strife,*\n*Strike open the lock of fame and gain.*\n*Calm the heart, refine the nature, let time slip by;*\n*In silence, ponder the highs and lows, sorrow and joy.*\n*Suddenly awakened—*\n*It was all a dream of Southern Branch,*\n*Such is the way of the world.*\n\nAll who heard it spoke of it, and everyone copied the lyric. In the capital, it was revered and offerings were made. This was the verification of Princess Tongchang’s enlightenment through the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*.\n\nThus it is said: The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in clarity, yet desires entangle it.\n\nIt is further stated: Those who can maintain purity and tranquility cannot be swayed by gluttony or craving, nor imperiled by peril or hardship. They are not deluded by rank or emolument, nor do poverty and lowliness alter their resolve. They are unmoved by slander or praise, nor is their spirit disordered by glory or splendor. Princess Tongchang entered the dream of Fengdu, was moved by the admonitions of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, and accepted them. She resolutely abandoned wealth and honor, embracing solitude and simplicity. Having fulfilled the Three Precepts in full, she became a perfected immortal.\n\nOne must constantly dispel desires, and the heart will naturally grow still; calm the heart, and the spirit will naturally become clear. Desire is the appearance of drifting and wandering; clarity is the appearance of still water. These two lines are the Supreme Venerable Lord’s repeated exhortation to relinquish attachment and abandon desire. If one can let go of attachment, no emotional desires arise, and no greed takes root, then the spirit will naturally grow still and the heart will naturally become clear. If one can extinguish the wandering attachments of the heart and still it, and further calm the heart to the stillness of water, then purity will remain unshaken. Unshaken purity allows the spirit to become naturally clear and tranquil. Thus it is said: Constantly dispel desires, and the heart will naturally grow still; calm the heart, and the spirit will naturally become clear.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: Abandon what others contend for, and do not contend—thus dispelling desires, the heart will naturally grow still. What all things discard, one should not covet; without covetousness, the heart will naturally become clear. One who can calm the heart will find their spirit naturally clear. Such is the awakening of the Dao of purity and tranquility for those who cultivate the truth.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: The noble person washes their heart with purity and tranquility; the petty person is swayed by avarice and attachment. Therefore, the sage constantly dispels desires, and the heart naturally grows still; calms the heart, and the spirit naturally becomes clear.\n\nMaster Liu said: The spirit is the master of the heart. Thus, when the spirit is tranquil, the heart is harmonious, and when the heart is harmonious, the body is whole. When the spirit is disordered, the heart is agitated, and when the heart is agitated, the body is harmed. First, govern the spirit. Therefore, the sage nurtures the spirit with serenity and harmony. Harmony means relinquishing cravings and desires. Thus, nurturing the spirit with harmony brings inner peace, while dwelling in pure thought and settling the heart prevents external allurements. When spirit is harmonious and heart is clear, the body is unburdened. Unburdened, one has dispelled desires. Thus it is said: Dispel desires.\n\nSomeone asked: Has anyone since ancient times been able to dispel desires?\nThe answer: Yes. In the Southern History, during the reign of Emperor Song, there was a prime minister, Yuan Tianfu, who was greedy and covetous. In all state affairs, great or small, nothing proceeded without bribes of silk and wealth. Once, two men in the street, drunk, quarreled over a licentious matter and killed one of them. Yuan Tianfu said to the killer: \"If you can produce a thousand bolts of silk, I can spare your life.\" The man offered eight hundred bolts. Yuan Tianfu said: \"That is not enough to secure your pardon.\" The family of the deceased, hearing this, offered a thousand bolts to have the killer executed. Fearing death, the killer produced twelve hundred bolts. The deceased’s family, unable to match the sum, ruled that the killing was committed in drunkenness and with negligence, and sentenced the man to sixty strokes before releasing him. The people had no recourse for grievances, and many suffered injustice. Yuan Tianfu’s exactions knew no bounds; he built pavilions and terraces in his home, using over a thousand measures of gold and jade, surpassing even the imperial palace.",

Upon meeting, Yuan descended the steps to bow and asked, \"What arts can you teach me?\" The master replied, \"I wish only to drink my fill.\" Yuan said, \"You have not shown your arts, yet you demand wine first—are you not greedy?\" The master replied, \"You turn life into death and death into life, extorting without measure.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, he vanished without a trace. In his place, he left behind a *lyric to the tune \"Dian Jiang Chun\"*:\n\nWealth and honor, glory and splendor,\nHigh office of the first rank, mighty deeds of merit—\nAll stem from greed and craving,\nAwaiting the iron-forged halls of judgment.\nYour household affairs now settled,\nYet the King of Hell prepares his reproach.\nWhat recourse remains?\nHow to find deliverance?\nThe debts of all men are inescapable.\n\nYuan Tianfu read the words and grew sullen and displeased. He retired to his private chamber. In his sleep, he dreamed he saw a lump of gold; overjoyed, he reached to take it, only to plummet to the ground and descend into darkness. Suddenly, all grew bright. Yuan looked around and saw hundreds of men shackled in fetters, some groaning, some wailing, their bodies crushed beneath great stones. He saw a placard inscribed: *\"The Prison of Greed and Craving.\"*\n\nSuddenly, a man in white robes, his hair unbound, spoke: \"My lord, why have you come so late? We have awaited you for a long time.\" Yuan asked, \"Who are you?\" The man replied, \"I am one of those you had killed. You accepted twelve hundred bolts of silk and spared my life—yet all I ask is that you restore it. You have wrongfully taken the lives of hundreds. Now, my lord, return my gold and treasures.\" Terrified, Yuan turned to flee, but the crowd seized him, demanding repayment of his debts. Several men hoisted a massive stone, three *zhang* long and five *chi* thick, ready to crush him. Then, as they dragged him down to place the stone upon him, a voice cried out: \"Hold! Do not crush him yet—his allotted lifespan is not yet exhausted. He has six more years.\"\n\nYuan looked and saw it was the master who had offered the arts of alchemy. The master led him to a great stone within the prison and seated him there. He said, \"I am the Star Lord of Venus. Though you hold the highest rank, you have not accumulated virtue or right conduct. Your heart is consumed by greed and desire—this is the root of misfortune.\" Yuan replied, \"Today, I deeply thank you for your rescue. Even if I ground my bones to dust, I could not repay you.\" The master asked, \"Have you ever recited any scriptures?\" Yuan answered, \"I have recited the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue by the Supreme Lord Lao, on Purity and Stillness*.\" The master said, \"No wonder you bear the aura of the Dao. This scripture’s power surpasses even mine. Have you not heard its words: *If one constantly dispels desire, the heart becomes still of itself; if one settles the heart, the spirit becomes clear of itself*?\"\n\nYuan said, \"Pray, instruct me.\" The master continued: \"The ears and eyes are enticed by sounds and sights, the nose and mouth by fragrances and flavors, the body by comfort and ease—all arise from desire. If these desires are not dispelled, the spirit scatters and cannot be preserved; the will and qi dissipate, harming the five viscera and leaving them unsettled. When cravings coil within the heart and spread like wild vines through the waves of excess, lingering in the realm of right and wrong—without cultivating virtue through wealth and conduct, how can one hope to live long? Thus, the sage purifies his eyes and does not see, stills his ears and does not hear, seals his mouth and does not speak, abandons the heart and forgets harm, values the body and scorns material things. He esteems power yet forgets action, delights in the Dao and forgets greed. Thus, even great profit cannot confine him, and he roams freely in accord with his nature. With qi vast and boundless, he returns to nurturing his form, and his nature is preserved whole; his heart is not wearied, and the Dao comes to him of itself.\"\n\nThe master said, \"My lord, you must reflect on this day and night, ten thousand times over.\" Yuan then took his leave of the master.",
      "overlap_context": "emand wine first—are you not greedy?\" The master replied, \"You turn life into death and death into life, extorting without measure. Your halls number a thousand, your vaults overflow with gold and jade, your concubines a thousand, your lust boundless. Yet you seek the arts of alchemy. What desire could surpass yours? Do you accuse *me* of greed?\" Shamed by the master’s rebuke, Yuan grew furious and cried, \"Where is this rustic from? How dare he insult me!\" He ordered his attendants to seize him.",

      "translated_text": "Then someone called out, \"Minister Yuan!\" As the minister looked, he saw he was being pursued by murderers—he stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nSuddenly he awoke in a cold sweat, his heart trembling without cease. At that moment, the peasant Farmer Yuan came to a sharp realization: \"Wealth is the source of disaster, and greed the root of sin.\" Thereupon he removed his official seal and resigned his post, distributing the treasures of the imperial vault to relieve the poor. He arranged for the courtesans in his inner chambers to marry respectable men, and converted his mansions entirely into Daoist abbeys. Casting off his silken robes, he donned plain cloth; his diet became coarse grains and bland fare. Each day, he recited only the *Classic of Supreme Clarity by Lord Lao*. Following its precepts for a decade, he suddenly encountered the master from his original dream.\n\nFarmer Yuan bowed in reverence. The master said, \"You have advanced on the Way for several years—has it been arduous? Now that you have released your karmic debts, nothing bars your ascent to the immortal path. Truly, one who forgets desire and relinquishes greed becomes a companion in the cultivation of a serene heart and nurtured spirit. You have now been registered in the Vermilion Numinosity and your name inscribed in the Azure Vault. Here is a divine elixir—swallow it.\"\n\nFarmer Yuan replied, \"I no longer eat.\"\n\nThe master said, \"Thus the *Inner Transmission of the Immortal Classic* states: 'If eating does not cease, the body will not become light; if sensual pleasures do not cease, the spirit will not become clear; if thoughts do not cease, the heart will not be at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the spirit will not be efficacious; if the spirit is not efficacious, the work will not be accomplished.' The essential Way does not lie in gazing at stars or worshipping the Dipper, nor in tormenting the self or exhausting the body—it lies solely in the square inch of the heart, utterly still and empty of all things. The Way of immortality is the eternal preservation of life. Thus, the Dao is nothing other than the cultivation of the heart.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Dao is attained through the heart; the heart is illuminated by the Dao. When the heart is bright, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the numinous clarity resides within the body. Like oil and flame in a lamp: light arises from fire, fire depends on oil; the vessel is moistened by oil, oil rests in the vessel. If any of these four are lacking, where is the light? Likewise, luminous spirit shines forth, spirit rests in a tranquil heart, just as form possesses heart. The Dao is complete in one thing—what else could it rely upon? This is what is called numinous clarity. Numinous clarity is seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, knowing with the mind, and perceiving with the heart—discerning the principles of things, analyzing the subtle and profound. This is numinous clarity—take heed and remember it.\"\n\nAn official from the Vermilion Numinosity Hall awaited him. Suddenly, the master vanished.\n\nThereafter, Farmer Yuan followed the interplay of dragon and tiger, the alternation of yin and yang, the separation and union of the Five Phases, and the harmonization of water and fire. He built an encircling wall and cultivated within it, refining for three more years, completing a full twelve-year cycle. On the Double Ninth Festival, Farmer Yuan ascended into the void.\n\nLater, people broke open the gate of the wall and searched, but Farmer Yuan was nowhere to be seen. They found only a copy of the *Classic of Clarity* and, on the desk, a sheet of floral stationery bearing the lyric to the tune *Remembering Tang Duo*:\n\n*How fare both life and nature?*\n*The root and origin are firmly sealed.*\n*Guard the yang soul—*\n*yin and po dissolve away.*\n*Circulate the fire through the celestial cycle,*\n*refining the great elixir.*\n*Look to the sea’s depths—*\n*behold the crimson waves.*\n*Yo-lo!*\n\n*Riches and rank pass in an instant,*\n*glory and splendor like a shuttle cast aside.*\n*Wait until the three thousand deeds are complete,*\n*the work perfected—*\n*then ride phoenix and simurgh*\n*to roam the Azure Vault.*\n*To the Jade Emperor’s court,*\n*answer the immortal’s summons.*\n*Yo-lo!*",

      "translated_text": "A Discourse:\n\nVast and obscure, therein lies essence;\ndim and indistinct, therein lies substance.\nEver since Master Yuan the Farmer existed, he cast off desire and his mind became still; he settled his mind and his spirit became clear. When the mind is still and the spirit clear, the Dao arrives of itself—this is called the Way.\n\nAs for the reality of cultivation without cultivation: now his body has ascended to the Azure Vault and he bows before the Jade Emperor—this may truly be called attaining the Dao. Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.\n\nThe six desires are the six thieves. What are the six thieves? They are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intent. The three poisons are the three corpses. What are the three corpses? The upper corpse is Peng Ju, who governs the upper cinnabar field and instills in people the poison of fondness for adornment; the middle corpse is Peng Zhi, who governs the middle cinnabar field and instills the poison of greed, gluttony, and craving for rich flavors; the lower corpse is Peng Jiao, who governs the lower cinnabar field and instills the poison of lust, jealousy, and malice.\n\nThe preceding lines speak of how one who embraces the Dao constantly dispels the state of drifting and restlessness, so that the mind becomes still. When the mind is settled, like still water, the spirit naturally becomes clear. The Most High has said: if one can still the mind and clarify the spirit, naturally the six desires will not arise, the three corpses will not act, and the three poisons will be extinguished. Thus it is said: the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: the learning of the noble person advances toward the Dao. One who advances toward the Dao naturally does not generate the six desires, and the three poisons are extinguished. The learning of the petty person advances toward profit. One who advances toward profit generates the six desires, and the three poisons are not extinguished.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: the noble person cultivates and examines himself with reverence and fear. Thus, when the six desires do not arise and the three poisons do not stir, they extinguish themselves. Who can ensure the six desires do not arise and further extinguish the three poisons?\n\nThe answer is: such a person exists. During the Zhenguan era of the Tang, there was a man named Shen Hui. Due to his covetous heart, he accepted bribes from the people, and when the matter was exposed, he was exiled to Zhulan. Day and night, he constantly recited the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*, prostrating toward Mount Tai at dawn and dusk, saying: \"I only wish to return to my hometown.\"\n\nThe son of the Lord of Mount Tai, the Illustrious Duke of Bingling, was traveling to the Western Marchmount for an assembly. On his return, he saw Shen Hui reciting the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness*. The Illustrious Duke spoke from the void: \"This man cannot be taken.\" He returned to the Eastern Marchmount and told the Lord of the Peak. The Lord said: \"Excellent.\" He ordered Shen Hui to be fetched from his secluded chamber. It was midday when he was sitting there. A crimson-robed officer appeared and said: \"The Lord of the Peak summons you.\"\n\nShen Hui asked: \"Which Lord of the Peak?\" The officer replied: \"The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount.\" Shen Hui was greatly startled. He quickly donned his official robes and followed the officer. When they reached the city outskirts, the officer said: \"From here to Mount Tai is over three thousand *li*.\" Shen Hui asked: \"How can I arrive?\" The officer said: \"We shall borrow a horse for this journey.\"\n\nShen Hui waited beneath a tree while the officer entered the temple. After a moment, he led out a small gray horse, no larger than a donkey. The officer said: \"Mount the horse and close your eyes tightly.\" Shen Hui mounted the horse and shut his eyes. The wind rushed past like a gale. The officer said: \"Open your eyes.\" Before him stood a city. They entered it, though the path near the city was overgrown with brambles.\n\nThey arrived at a yamen, where iron-armored guards stood on either side. The officer held the horse as Shen Hui dismounted and led him inside. A soldier asked: \"Who is this?\" The officer replied: \"By the Lord’s decree, I bring him through the third gate.\" The officer said: \"Sir, wait here while I announce you.\" The officer entered and soon returned with a herald, who said: \"The Lord summons Official Shen Hui.\"\n\nShen Hui hurriedly followed and entered a magnificent hall. Pearl curtains and crimson drapes adorned the hall, which was named the Hall of Morning Radiance. The officer halted Shen Hui at the foot of the steps, where golden-armored ghost soldiers stood guard. Two azure-robed youths rolled up the curtains. Seated within was a man wearing a far-traveling cap and a blue dragon-embroidered robe, holding a cold jade tablet. Beside him stood another man in a golden moth cap, crimson garments, and an indigo jade belt, appearing to be about thirty years old.\n\nThe azure-robed youths invited Shen Hui to ascend the hall. Trembling, he could scarcely move his feet. The youths prodded him up the steps, and Shen Hui bowed. The Lord returned the bow and ordered his attendants to bring a seat for Shen Hui.\n\nThe Lord said: \"When mortals commit evil, if they are not punished by men, they will be punished by ghosts. You were guilty of covetousness and thus received this sentence of exile. Yet you have recited the *Classic of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao* over ten thousand times in a single year. Your virtue is profound, and your reverence for me carries the mandate of the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, I shall not consign you to the path of rebirth.\n\nIf you recite this scripture and comprehend its meaning, practicing and teaching it to others, converting even one person to the Dao, your merit will increase. You may ascend not merely to the rank of celestial immortal, but to that of divine immortal; not merely to divine immortal, but to earthbound immortal; not merely to earthbound immortal, but to ghost immortal. How then could you enter the path of life and death?\"\n\nWhen he finished speaking, a ghost official in scarlet robes spread documents upon the table and pointed, saying: \"Mu Rengui, holding a tablet, stands below the steps—he is Shen Hui’s uncle by marriage.\" Shen Hui turned away, not daring to look.\n\nThe Lord said: \"Though you were an official governing Donghai Prefecture, you failed to govern the people with integrity. Instead, you indulged in greed, coveting bribes and killing an innocent man named Zhao.\"",

Before he could finish undressing, one ghost hooked his jaw with a prong—fire caught at once, searing half his face. His body stripped itself bare and was hoisted onto the iron bed, where iron spikes pierced his flesh. Beneath the bed, flames erupted, and his cries of agony were too terrible to witness. After lying there for some time, his body was reduced to charred ash.\n\nMoments later, another ghostly officer appeared, holding a fan. \"Mu Rengui,\" he called. With a single sweep of the fan, Rengui’s body was restored. They then clamped an iron cangue around his neck.\n\nShen Hui suddenly rose from his seat and said, \"This man is my uncle by marriage. Is there any way to save him?\"\n\nThe Lord replied, \"He wrongfully seized property and took a life—how could he be pardoned?\"\n\nThe Radiant Spirit Duke said, \"Unless this woman [the sister-in-law] relents, there is no reprieve. Only by performing great meritorious deeds in the mortal realm—petitioning the myriad sages, supplicating the thousand perfected, and invoking the Most High Lord Lao’s divine edict—may the wronged be first ascended to the celestial path and attain the heavenly realms before his punishment can be lifted.\"\n\nShen Hui said, \"I will ensure Mu Rengui repents of his past transgressions, relinquishes the six desires, and uproots the three poisons. I shall sponsor the Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven of the Most High and the Rite of the Heavenly Worthy’s Absolution of Sins. If Lady Zhao ascends to heaven, may Rengui be spared his suffering?\"\n\nThe Lord said, \"This may be permitted. Rengui’s allotted years are not yet exhausted—he has five more years of life.\"",

      "translated_text": "Only two of his hun-souls are seized to the Nether Bureau to suffer punishment, while one hun-soul remains in the yang realm to guard his form. His body, too, breaks out in malignant sores, ceaselessly racked with pain. When his allotted five years are fulfilled, he will die. Now, having served his sentence in the earth-prison, he will next be reborn as a pig or a sheep—or even as a human—only to meet execution under the law. Hearing this, Shen Hui swiftly recited the *Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*. The Prefect, fearing the tremors of hell, said, \"You may return for now. Do not harbor thoughts of greed, nor let the three poisons arise.\" Shen Hui bowed in gratitude, chanting his repentance, though no heavenly pardon had been granted. \"Return to your village,\" the Prefect instructed, \"and admonish Rengui to curb his covetous desires—only then may it suffice.\"\n\nAn underling said, \"Escort Shen Hui back.\" Descending the hall, Shen Hui bowed farewell to the Prefect and withdrew. The underling said, \"Follow closely behind me.\" They crossed a river, and as they did, a great roar resounded. Shen Hui awoke with a start, cold sweat drenched his body, and he found his family gathered around him, weeping. Shen Hui sat up abruptly. His kin exclaimed, \"You have been dead three days—only a faint warmth lingered in your heart, and your breath remained unbroken.\" Shen Hui raised himself, gazing upward, and murmured, \"Are the spirits of the unseen realm truly so?\" Turning to the assembly, he warned, \"Let no one indulge in covetous desires.\" He continued to recite the true scriptures diligently. Three days later, by imperial grace, a general amnesty was declared throughout the realm: all death sentences and exile to the frontier were remitted, and prisoners were permitted to return home.\n\nThereupon, Shen Hui traveled to Donghai Prefecture, where his uncle-in-law, Mu Rengui, lay gravely ill. For three months, his body had been covered in festering sores, the bed soaked with pus and blood, the pain unbearable. When Rengui saw Shen Hui, he rejoiced and said, \"A month ago, I dreamed you came to save me.\" He recounted the events of the netherworld, and every detail matched. Thus, Rengui repented of his transgressions and sponsored a grand Yellow Register Offering, enlisting twenty-one Daoist priests to produce ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on Purity and Tranquility*, which he distributed among Daoist friends in all directions. He also established a Society of Purity and Tranquility. When the merit was complete, at noon on the day the ritual feast concluded, a woman appeared in midair to express her gratitude: \"By the power of your grand offering, I have ascended to heaven and mounted the cloud-path.\" She left behind a poem:\n\nFor years my grievance remained unredressed,\nToday I owe my thanks to your ritual feast.\nThe six desires and three poisons are wholly extinguished—\nThrough your merit, I ascend to the azure heavens.\n\nShen Hui gazed upward and bowed in reverence. Within half a month, Mu Rengui’s sores and ailments vanished, and his body was restored. Shen Hui composed a *Man Ting Fang* lyric to admonish him:\n\nThe six desires are hard to dispel,\nThe three poisons refuse to fade.\nIn ceaseless toil for cunning gain,\nWhen your allotted years are spent,\nWho will stand in for impermanence?\nGold and jade amassed in vain—\nWhen the hour comes, not one thing can you take.\nThe bitterest pang:\nAll the evil karma of the past\nMust be pondered by yourself alone.\nWhat plan can spare you the torments of Fengdu?\nNo recourse remains—\nLike a winter melon struck by autumn frost.\nI urge you, awaken swiftly,\nTo the realm of purity and bliss.\nWhen merit is perfected,\nIn the Scarlet Numinous Palace,\nRefine your true yang in clarity and stillness.\n\nRengui, hearing this and witnessing the truth of the unseen realm, how could he not take heed? He composed a poem in response:\n\nTo think oneself clever is not as good as diligence;\nThe six desires and three poisons—do not force them to grow.\nBees toil to gather nectar from a hundred flowers,\nYet never know for whom their sweetness is made.\n\nShen Hui said, \"The years flash by like lightning—how can we bear not to cultivate the Way?\" He counted on his fingers and wept bitterly. The two men then abandoned their households, resigned from office, and relinquished their seals of authority. Together they journeyed to Mount Tiantai, where they gathered thatch to build a hut and sat in meditation. Each day they recited the *Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on Purity and Tranquility* three hundred times. They cultivated the Dao until they reached over ninety years of age, and both attained the Way.\n\nIt is said: The extremes of passion and desire are like water and fire. Smoke arises from fire, and water flows from ice—when smoke is faint, the fire burns fiercely; when ice floats, the water flows freely. The Perfected One said: \"People nurture their bodies with desire and attachment, but such nurturing is like a fool raising fish and birds. When the weather turns cold, the fish are placed in hot water, and the birds are set near a blazing fire. Water and fire are the very means to nurture fish and birds, yet if the nurturing is improper, it leads to harm. Sensual pleasures delight the senses, but if the delight exceeds reason, it turns to harm one’s life.\"\n\nShen Hui and Rengui, their bodies burdened with desire and attachment, one sentenced to exile and the other to death, suddenly awakened. They resigned from office, entered the mountains to cultivate the Way, and practiced the teachings of purity and tranquility. Turning from evil to embrace goodness, they attained the Dao—how could this not be verified? Those who fail to do so are those whose minds are not yet clear and whose desires are not yet dispelled.\n\nThe Most High reiterates the meaning of the above passage: \"The reason people cannot dispel their desires is that their minds are not yet clear, and thus their desires remain undispelled.\" Master Wen said: \"Those who speak without loyalty, integrity, caution, or discretion are people who have not yet clarified their minds or dispelled their desires.\" Hence it is said: The reason one cannot do so is that the mind is not yet clear and desires are not yet dispelled.\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: \"Those who cannot clarify their minds or dispel their desires are like those adrift in the River of Love or tossed upon the Sea of Desire.\" Some may ask: \"Why do people fail to clarify their minds, dispel their desires, and instead give rise to deluded thoughts?\"\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Liu Huaizhen, styled Daoyu. In the second year of the Taiping era, he was appointed Governor of Le Ling in Hejian for his meritorious service. Upon taking office, he was insatiably greedy for bribes, extorting without end. Though he amassed two or three million in cash, he showed no mercy, relentlessly seizing the people’s wealth and never resolving a single case justly. The gentry and common folk lamented:\n\nBetter to be poor, poor,\nThan have your marrow drained and sinews plucked.\nBetter to meet a white-browed tiger on South Mountain\nThan to cross paths with Liu Huaizhen.\n\nSuch was the suffering he inflicted. Later, he was transferred to govern Zhongshan Prefecture, and the people there were filled with dread.",

      "translated_text": "His wife then said to Huaizhen, \"Now our wealth and rank are somewhat sufficient. You hold a first-rank office and govern a region as its lord. Yet you are already several decades old and have not cultivated blessings for the life to come.\"\n\nHuaizhen asked, \"What should I do now?\"\n\nHis wife replied, \"I have heard that riding a red horse in fine attire is a reward earned through cultivation over many lifetimes. If we do not cultivate in this life, calamity will befall us in the next; if we cultivate now, we will surely enjoy wealth and nobility in the life to come.\"\n\nHuaizhen said, \"Indeed.\"\n\nHis wife continued, \"In my dressing chamber, the treasures and goods are worth over a million strings of cash. Instead of plundering the people’s wealth, it would be better to use these to restore temples and monasteries, inviting twenty or thirty monks and Daoists to hold regular vegetarian feasts. First, this would create blessings for our own family; second, it would secure the cause of wealth and nobility for the next life; third, the court would learn of it and recognize our virtuous deeds; and fourth, we would gain a reputation for goodness without harming the people. This is the fruit of preserving one’s body and enriching one’s worldly existence.\"\n\nGreatly pleased, Huaizhen took all the money from his wife’s chests—about a million strings—and chose an auspicious day to begin construction. He gathered materials and purchased over thirty *mu* of land, and after two years of work, the project was completed. He built a grand hall, a triple gate, scripture pavilions, a Dharma hall, and sacred images—everything was made whole. Huaizhen and his wife burned incense daily to seek blessings, and within two years, all was finished. He also purchased five *qing* of permanent land for the monastery’s upkeep, spending over a million strings of cash in total. Yet though he had not taken a single coin from the people, he had secretly drained their marrow and fat. Still, he could not still his heart or dispel desire.\n\nOne day, Huaizhen said to his wife, \"Now that I have built this blessed site with its grand halls and the like, without taking anything from the people, I wonder if the blessings will truly follow in the next life.\"\n\nHis wife replied, \"How could one know such things of the unseen world?\"\n\nHuaizhen remained dissatisfied, saying daily, \"I have performed such meritorious deeds and prayed with such devotion for divine reward—why have the gods shown no sign of response?\"\n\nOne afternoon, as he napped, he dreamed of a Daoist entering his chamber without ceremony. The Daoist said to him, \"Sir, you are both greedy and covetous. Though you built these halls with your own money, you have long extorted the people’s fat and marrow—how can this bring blessings? You hold a first-rank office in this life and yet still seek blessings for the next. Your greed knows no end, but the blessings you seek will go to Zhang, the old woman at the southern gate of Zhongshan Prefecture.\"\n\nHuaizhen asked, \"Why would she receive them?\"\n\nThe Daoist replied, \"When she was poor, she bought goods at a low price and sold them at the same price when they became expensive, never raising it. Moreover, she constantly recited the *Classic of Supreme Clarity by Lord Lao*, aided those in danger, saved the distressed, cherished all things, and protected life. Her merit surpasses that of building temples and monasteries.\"\n\nWith that, the Daoist vanished. Huaizhen was displeased and sent a swift messenger to summon the old couple, Zhang and his wife. Their account matched the Daoist’s words. Huaizhen was awakened. He resigned his post, retired to a secluded chamber, and cultivated the Dao of clarity and stillness. He stilled his heart, dispelled desire, and together with his wife, embraced quiet simplicity, practicing dual cultivation. He invited Daoist companions to discuss the *Zhuangzi* and the *Laozi*. He lived to the age of one hundred and twenty-nine before passing away.\n\n**Discourse:**\nThe greatness of the Dao is felt only through the heart. If one does not still the heart and dispel desire, how can one attain it? Liu Huaizhen took the people’s wealth to build temples and monasteries, hoping to erase his karma and seek blessings—was this not difficult? When the heart is released into the realm of nothingness and the spirit is nurtured in the realm of carefree wandering, that is true awakening. To still the heart, dispel desire, scatter gold and jade to relieve the poor, and thus prolong life to die a peaceful death—is this not worthy of a sage? Truly, he may be called a Perfected One.\n\nThose who can dispel the six desires and the three poisons may perceive the wondrous Dao of the Three Origins, which is explained below.\n\n**Inwardly observe the heart—**\nthe heart is without heart.\n**Outwardly observe the form—**\nthe form is without form.\n**From afar observe things—**\nthings are without things.\n\nWhen things are without things, the heart is stilled and desire vanishes of itself. Once desire is wholly extinguished, one may perceive the appearance of the great Dao’s Three Origins.\n\n**What are the Three Origins?**\nThe first origin: Inwardly observe the mind’s consciousness as the realm of emptiness, seeing all as without mind. If there is no mind, how can the thieves of the six desires arise? The corpse of the three poisons naturally perishes. Thus it is said: *Inwardly observe the heart—the heart is without heart.* When the heart is without heart, *outwardly observe the form—the form is without form.* When form is not bound by form, one gradually enters the realm of non-action, where neither heart nor form can be swayed. How then can the six desires arise? The three poisons naturally dissolve. Thus it is said: *From afar observe things—things are without things.*\n\nThe Old Man of White Clouds said: *Inwardly observe desire—there is no desire. Outwardly observe form—there is no form. From afar observe external things—there are no external things.* When these three are without end, one may be said to have attained the Dao.\n\nMaster Wen said: *Do not cling to profit, do not cling to the mind that desires profit—thus inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart. Do not oppose harm, do not oppose the harm that injures the body’s form—thus outwardly observe the form, the form is without form. Do not force interaction, do not force exchange with external things—thus there are no external things, and from afar observe things—things are without things.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who is it that inwardly observes the heart, and the heart is without heart?*\nIn the Warring States period, there was a skilled physician named Wen Zhi. Long Shu said to him, \"I have heard of your mastery. I suffer from an illness—can you cure me?\"\nWen Zhi replied, \"I await your command.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet first speak of your illness, and I shall examine it.\"\nLong Shu said: \"My illness has several forms. In my village, they praise me, yet I feel no glory—this is the first. I gain without joy, lose without sorrow—the second. I neither cling to wealth nor scorn poverty—the third. I regard others as they regard me—the fourth. I dwell in my home as though it were a traveler’s inn—the fifth. I view my village as a land of barbarians—the sixth. And seven demons afflict me: first, rewards and punishments cannot move me; second, penalties cannot destroy me; third, prosperity and decline, profit and harm cannot restrain me; fourth, sorrow and joy cannot alter me; fifth, I cannot bear the name of a state; sixth, I do not befriend companions; seventh, I cannot govern my wife, children, or servants. These are the seven demons. What illness is this? What method can cure it?\"\n\nWen Zhi then commanded Long Shu to stand facing him. Wen Zhi himself turned toward the light and observed him, then said: \"Ah! I see your heart now. A space of one *cun*—how utterly empty it is! The heart of a sage has seven apertures; yours has six, with but one flowing unobstructed. This is not enlightenment—it is the illness of sagely wisdom. Thus it is said: *inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart.*\"\n\nSomeone asked: *Who is it that outwardly observes the form, and the form is without form?*\nIn ancient times, Wu Jizha served as an envoy to Yan. On the road, he suddenly saw a piece of gold lying on the path. Jizha passed it without a thought, then noticed a woodcutter ahead. He said to him: \"You are poor—here is a piece of gold.\" Jizha pointed and said: \"Take this gold and jade.\" The woodcutter frowned and rebuked him: \"Your bearing is proud, yet your intentions are base. Why do you take me for one who covets gold?\" The woodcutter turned away without a glance. Gold is the most precious of things, yet he paid it no heed—thus *from afar observe things, things are without things.*\n\nThe treatise says: Long Shu attained *inwardly observe the heart, the heart is without heart*; the woodcutter attained *from afar observe things, things are without things.* To awaken to these three voids is to penetrate the sagely Dao. Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. The preceding line speaks of the six desires no longer arising, so the three poisons naturally vanish. By not giving rise to the six desires and extinguishing the three poisons, one can *inwardly observe the desireless heart, outwardly observe the formless body, and from afar observe the thingless things.* These three are called *form and emptiness*—all that appears to have shape is but an illusory realm.\n\nThe *Dingguan Jing* states: *Above the settled mind, all is suddenly uncovered; below the settled mind, all is utterly still and without thing.* Those who can recognize this may *inwardly observe the heartless heart, outwardly observe the formless form, and from afar observe the thingless things.* Observing these three—*heartless, formless, thingless*—they merge with the void. Once awakened, only the true emptiness of stillness is seen. Thus it is said: *Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen.*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *Manifest the Dao, divine its virtue and power.* To awaken to the principle of the three voids is to make evident the effortless Way, and naturally to spiritually embody its virtue and power—like the great void embracing the ten thousand things, only the realm of emptiness is seen.\n\nMaster Wen said: *The virtue of the sage is the root of the Dao.* Those who embody the Dao are *heartless, formless, thingless.* Once these three are realized, only the manifest virtue of the Dao and the divine virtue of the Way are seen—the ultimate emptiness of the great void. Thus it is said: *Once these three are realized, only emptiness is seen.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who can awaken to these three voids, see emptiness, and attain the Dao?*\nIn the Tang dynasty, Liu Zichu sat for the imperial examination in the *Nangong* during the *Dali* era but failed. Instead of reflecting on himself, he indulged in reckless wandering—flowered streets and moonlit nights, seeking fleeting pleasure. Before long, his purse was empty, and people grew weary of him. He lacked even daily sustenance; his appearance withered, and each day was a struggle. One day, he left the eastern gate, walking slowly, contemplating suicide. Yet the hour of death was hard to seize, so he sat beneath an ancient willow, silently reciting the *Laojun Shuo Chang Qingjing Jing* three times. His spirit and qi nearly expired.\n\nSuddenly, a Daoist appeared—wearing a blue headscarf and white robe, straw sandals bound with black straps, carrying a bamboo basket. He too sat beneath the tree. His bearing was dignified, and he said to Zichu: \"You possess the qi of the Dao—why are you so distressed?\"\n\nZichu opened his eyes, overjoyed at the sight, and bowed in thanks: \"I am a scholar. In my prime, I twice sat for the spring examinations, yet fate was unkind, and I failed. Thus I wandered recklessly, my purse empty and resources exhausted. Each day is a struggle. My hometown in the eastern sea is too distant to return, and the western capital offers no refuge. My clothes are in tatters, my belly empty. Today’s hardship surpasses even Chen E’s plight.\"",

Long Shu said to him, \"I have heard of your mastery. I suffer from an illness—can you cure me?\"\nWen Zhi replied, \"I await your command.\"",

      "translated_text": "The words faltered on his lips, his breath grew faint, his voice weak—suddenly, he collapsed. The Daoist master, seeing this, asked: \"Why has it come to this?\" He then took two jujubes from his basket, helped Zichu rise, and pressed them into his hand. Zichu ate one, and at once savored its sweetness. He bowed in gratitude to the master.\n\nThe master said: \"I observe your qi—you seem to possess an extraordinary bone-structure.\"\n\nZichu replied: \"My heart is never content.\"\n\nThe master said: \"You have attained more than enough.\"\n\nZichu said: \"For a true man, contentment lies in high rank and noble station.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Close your eyes.\"\n\nZichu complied, and at once felt himself drifting into a daze, as if falling asleep. Suddenly, he saw a man in purple sash and golden seal, bearing an ivory tablet, who presented a royal decree from the King of Fuyu, summoning him, Zichu. Zichu said: \"I am but a lowly scholar from the eastern sea, a Confucian of the Yi River—twice I failed the imperial examinations, and now I am a man of no fixed abode. How could I presume to accept the summons of a king?\"\n\nWith that, Zichu joyfully followed the messenger out the eastern gate. Beyond the gate, more than ten men in embroidered robes, jade belts, and red boots bowed to him. They led forth a peach-blossom steed, its saddle of jade and gold, its bridle adorned with dragon trappings, its canopy of kingfisher feathers and phoenix designs, its red banners gleaming in the sun. They escorted Zichu to mount. Overcome with joy, he grasped the saddle and swung into the seat. The procession set forth with solemn cries, the outriders numerous, the four steeds swift as the wind. After eight hundred li, they arrived at a city.\n\nThe streets teemed with graceful figures, the land fair and prosperous. Hundreds of officials in crimson and purple lined the way, bowing before his horse. They led him to a place of pearl towers and jeweled pavilions, jade halls rising through mist and cloud. Suddenly, a rider emerged from the throng and said: \"Let the imperial son-in-law dismount at the Eastern Radiance Lodge.\" Its windows and doors were fashioned of crystal and glass.\n\nThat night, in the lodge, red chambers and embroidered boudoirs resounded with the music of strings and pipes. Dozens of courtesans played their instruments. As Zichu rested beneath the high pavilion, the tolling of bells mingled with the clear wind and dawn moon. A courtesan arrived with a summons, inviting the imperial son-in-law to meet the princess. Zichu was overjoyed.\n\nSuddenly, a beauty presented a jeweled casket containing a robe of precious jade. At nightfall, a fine steed was led forth, and he was invited to mount. A procession of singing girls, fair as those of Wu and Yue, escorted him within. He beheld a purple hall with golden steps, jade courtyards stretching far, guards standing solemnly, officials in crimson and purple ranks, their scepters gleaming. In an instant, phoenix curtains were drawn back, drums resounded, and the mountain-shaking cries of \"Long live the king!\" filled the air.\n\nThe King of Fuyu ascended his jeweled throne, his dragon robe resplendent, his pheasant fans parting gently. Lovely maidens stood in graceful array. A herald proclaimed: \"Let the imperial son-in-law approach the emperor.\" Zichu bowed and performed the ritual dance. The king said: \"My beloved daughter, whose name is Yinfang, wishes to join her life to yours. The betrothal shall be sealed this day.\"\n\nAt the king’s command, celestial music filled the air, and a royal banquet was laid. His wealth and honor were beyond words. That evening, lamps burned with dragon-fat oil, incense of phoenix marrow filled the air, and robes of rosy clouds, brocade quilts—countless treasures—were displayed. Suddenly, from the phoenix chamber emerged a girl of sixteen, her beauty surpassing that of Xishi or Chang’e. Even Chang’e of ancient and modern times could not compare. At the sight of her, Zichu’s soul soared beyond the heavens, his spirit scattered to the nine skies.\n\nThat night, within the phoenix bed draped with coiling dragons, they lay together like paired lovebirds, with Taizhen as their companion. At dawn, the emperor issued a decree appointing him Grand Marshal of the Three Ministries, Imperial Son-in-Law, and bestowing upon him the titles of Marquis of Wu’an and Duke of the Princess of Wu’an Commandery. Upon arriving at Wu’an Commandery, Daoist masters, Buddhist monks, laypeople, and local officials all came to greet him. He governed the commandery for ten years, fathering two sons, and his reputation for good governance spread far.\n\nLater, he was summoned to lead the southern campaign against Fuyu as Grand Marshal, commanding tens of thousands of troops. With a single strike, he achieved victory, his merit and fame complete. The emperor bestowed upon him a mountain of gold. Five years later, his two sons were enfeoffed as marquises. His wealth and honor were beyond description—gold and jade lay about like tiles and pebbles, his achievements eclipsing all under heaven.\n\nYet joy, when extreme, gives way to sorrow. Three years later, his wife, the princess, passed away. Two years after that, both his sons also died. Zichu was overwhelmed with grief.",

      "translated_text": "Then came a report of rebellion: the King of Southern Yue, Liu Zichu, intended to betray his domain. The King of Fuyu dispatched an envoy with a royal decree. Zichu dared not defy the command and thus arrived in that kingdom. The king said: \"You, a mere commoner, could not fathom your own fate. We summoned you to be Our son-in-law, and for fifteen years, We enfeoffed you as a king and granted you lands. We have never slighted you—why then this treachery?\"\n\nZichu replied: \"Your servant was but a humble cloth-wearing man, and now I am Your Highness’s son-in-law. I am grateful for the enfeoffment and lands; I would never dare to rebel.\"\n\nThe king said: \"The accusation of treason is not false—why do you deny it?\" He ordered his attendants to boil Zichu alive. The executioners stripped him and took up their blades, preparing to carve his flesh into the seething cauldron. Zichu, terrified, begged to return to his former life as a commoner, but it was no longer possible. As the executioners raised their knives and the oil bubbled, he let out a piteous cry—then suddenly awoke.\n\nThe master said: \"Why are you so dazed?\"\n\nZichu, now fully awake, was drenched in sweat and trembling uncontrollably. He recounted the dream in full.\n\nThe master said: \"You recite the *Classic of Purity and Stillness*. Within it is written: *Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart; outwardly observe the form—there is no form; distantly observe things—there are no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness remains.* Zichu, you were once poor and alone, yet your heart was filled with desire. Now, as the emperor’s son-in-law, these three—heart, form, and things—have no true substance, like a fleeting dream. All is but emptiness. You craved high rank, so you were made King of Southern Yue. You could not distantly observe things, so you were granted a mountain of gold. Yet all is illusion.\"\n\nZichu, enlightened, sighed: \"A human life is but a fleeting illusion—what is there to praise or lament?\" He bowed to the master.\n\nThe master said: \"We shall meet again in three years on Penglai. Hold fast to this true scripture, never waver in your Dao-heart, and this shall be your vow.\" With that, he rode a cloud and departed.\n\nZichu then ate only jujubes and nothing else. Later, seeking a secluded place, he built a thatched hut, sat in silent meditation, severed all worldly ties, and steadfastly upheld the scripture for three years without faltering. One day, a white crane descended from the sky. Zichu mounted its back and soared into the heavens, leaving behind three short verses:\n\n**First:**\n*Beauty is a flower’s splendor, yet it does not last—*\n*Do not cling to the fleeting bloom of crimson hue.*\n*Flower’s glow, a floating cloud’s ephemeral gleam,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where the heart holds no heart, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Second:**\n*Form is illusion, transient and unenduring—*\n*Do not exalt the hollow shell of fleeting shape.*\n*To hoard wealth and estate is to grasp at emptiness,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where form holds no form, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Third:**\n*Things are borrowed, brief as a passing guest—*\n*White jade and yellow gold are but emptiness.*\n*Empty-handed you come, empty-handed you go,*\n*How much better to awaken to the Mystery’s truth,*\n*Where things hold no things, and the Dao flows free.*\n\n**Discourse:**\nAll things arise from nothingness, and when their existence reaches its limit, they return to nothingness. Yet people mistake the illusory realm of form for reality—are they not fools? Liu Zichu, failing in his ambitions, was consumed by desire. Moved by this, an immortal descended to transform him, making him the son-in-law of the King of Fuyu. Deluded by sensual pleasures, he forgot that *the heart holds no heart*. Dazzled by the honor of a marquisate, he forgot that *form holds no form*. Seduced by the wealth of a gold mountain, he forgot that *things hold no things*. These three are all insubstantial appearances—beauty is a fleeting blossom, form is a passing illusion, wealth is a mirage. Such attachments bring calamity, yet he later awakened. Having repented, he journeyed to the Three Isles and ascended to the Jade Capital—was this not a blessed fate?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *Without thought, without action, in stillness and unmovable, yet responsive and penetrating—who but the most divine of all under heaven could achieve this?*\n\nMaster Wenzi said: *Mountains must cling to the earth; people must cling to stillness. In profound tranquility, the Dao resides within.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who abides in constant stillness yet attains the Dao?*\n\nThe answer: *There are such people.*",

      "translated_text": "In the Tianbao era of old, there was a scholar named Li Tong, over fifty years of age, who had repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. Day after day, he recited the *Classic of the Supreme Lord Lao’s Perfect Tranquility*, deeply grasping its principles, never parting from it even in sleep or at meals, his mouth never ceasing its chant. One day, his wife passed away. Li merely sighed in lament. He had but one son. A year later, his son also perished. Li said, “I am now free of my shackles.”\n\nHe spent his days in poetry and wine, finding solace therein. Some of his acquaintances admonished him, saying, “I have heard that a wife is one’s equal—shared burial is the natural sentiment of man. Yet you shed no tears for her, only sighing. You are heartless. Your son has died, and you grieve but once, forgetting the tenderness of kinship. This is to forsake the Way of father and son. How can you claim to be a man of letters?”\n\nLi replied, “I have heard that when Zhuangzi’s wife died, he drummed on a basin, and when Dongmen Wu lost his son, he did not weep. These were men who truly understood principle. Why should I grieve? Why should I grieve? The Supreme Lord says: *Look within at the heart—there is no heart; look without at form—there is no form; look afar at things—there are no things. When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen. Observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, there is only profound and constant stillness. Constant stillness is the Dao. Since the Dao is constant stillness, what have I to possess?*\n\nThereupon, he distributed his family’s wealth to those in need and relinquished his fields to his neighbors. Li Tong then took the *Classic of Perfect Tranquility* and entered Mount Hua. He pulled up reeds and piled stones to build a hut, reciting the *Classic of Perfect Tranquility* while silently consuming medicinal herbs to cultivate his resolve. For three years, his devotion remained unwavering, his heart set on the Dao. Moved by this, the Supreme Lord sent a divine being to instruct him.\n\nThe immortal entered his hut and asked, “Why do you study the Dao here in these deep mountains?” Seven times he asked, and seven times Li made no reply. The Dao is not attained by forgetting speech, nor is it grasped by mere discussion—what use are words? How can one thus attain the Dao?\n\n“One who wishes to cultivate the Dao must first set aside all external affairs. When external affairs are wholly severed, nothing will oppose the heart. Then, sit in stillness and turn inward. Should a single thought arise, swiftly extinguish it and return to tranquility. If wandering or chaotic thoughts emerge, they too must be utterly dispelled. One must not know *observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, there is only profound and constant stillness.*”\n\nUpon hearing this, Li prostrated himself in reverence and said, “I humbly receive your command. Pray, instruct me further.” He knelt before the immortal, who then imparted his teaching:\n\n“In cultivating the Dao, one must extinguish the moving heart but not the illuminating heart. Simply stabilize the empty heart, not the attached heart—this is the empty heart. Do not hastily seek wisdom in concentration, for haste injures the nature, and when the nature is injured, there is no wisdom. If in concentration one does not seek wisdom, wisdom will come of itself—this is true wisdom. Wisdom without deceit, wisdom that values truth, is like folly. This is the foundation of concentration and wisdom, an inexhaustible treasure.\n\nIf myriad thoughts arise, they will summon all manner of demons and illusions, spirits and seductions, appearing as the heart conjures them.”\n\nThe immortal then said to Li Tong, “If you can stabilize your heart in profound and constant stillness, you will achieve the Dao.”\n\nLi replied, “Your disciple is capable of this.”\n\nThe immortal said, “I shall teach you tomorrow. For now, I depart.” He then left the hut and vanished.\n\nThe next day, at the hour of Chen and Si, the immortal returned to the hut. Li Tong emerged, joyfully welcoming him inside. Li bowed and said, “Though this disciple is but a decayed scholar, ignorant of the great Dao, clinging to sudden emptiness—how is this different from tuning a zither with glued pegs?”\n\nThe immortal replied, “I wish to refine a furnace of elixir. You shall guard the furnace, maintaining profound and constant stillness through silence. Can you do this?”\n\nLi said, “Your disciple can.”\n\nThe immortal then set up a furnace in the hut. From his bag, he took a crucible and placed several grains of elixir within. Facing the sun, he drew in a breath of qi and blew it onto the furnace, igniting the fire. He then instructed Li Tong, “Sit facing due south before the furnace. This is the method of *observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty; what is empty is nothing, and nothingness itself is nothing. When nothingness is nothing, this is the practice of profound and constant stillness.* Should a thousand demons or ten thousand specters appear, regard them as nothing. If you speak, the elixir in the furnace will fail, and your Dao will not be achieved. Remember this well.\n\nIn three days, I shall return to inspect the elixir. It will surely be ripe. We shall partake of it together and ascend as immortals to the heavens. Remember this well.”\n\nLi Tong clasped his hands firmly and sat upright before the furnace. The immortal then departed the hut.\n\nBefore long, clouds arose from all directions, thunder and lightning clashed in the sky, fierce winds uprooted trees, and thunderbolts shattered mountains. Torrential rains and surging waters flooded the hut. Li Tong did not stir, sitting steadfast as the water rose to his crown. Yet his heart remained unmoved. The water rose only to a finger’s width, neither entering the furnace nor reaching his mouth. In an instant, the waters receded.\n\nThen, wildfire swept the mountain, flames stretching across the sky, engulfing the hut. The thatch was about to ignite and consume Li Tong, yet he sat motionless, his heart free of resentment. Soon, the fire extinguished itself.\n\nNext, hungry ghosts arrived. Some had blue faces and red hair, others yellow bodies and green faces, or eyes glowing red with fangs like sharp blades. “We are mountain ghosts,” they said. “Today we are ravenous. We shall eat and then depart.”",

In profound tranquility, the Dao resides within.*\n\nSomeone asked: *Who abides in constant stillness yet attains the Dao?*\n\nThe answer: *There are such people.*",

      "translated_text": "Should you utter a single word, we shall not devour you; if you remain silent, we shall feast upon you.” Li Tong spoke not a word, and the ghosts vanished of their own accord.\n\nThen, dozens of ravenous tigers approached, intent on devouring Li Tong. Yet he did not look upon them, nor did fear arise in his heart. The tigers roared and snarled repeatedly, sniffed at him, then departed without harming him.\n\nNext came venomous serpents, slithering around his body, yet Li Tong’s heart remained unmoved, and the serpents left of their own accord.\n\nThen appeared a woman, fair of face and eighteen in years, her beauty unmatched. With seductive words and alluring speech, she sought to beguile Li Tong. Yet his heart did not waver, and the woman departed.\n\nAfterward, over thirty bandits arrived, clad in iron armor and wielding halberds and bows. Their leader declared, “Let us feast upon this man’s heart and liver.” They raised their blades, poised to strike, when one among them said, “If he utters but a single word, spare him.” Li Tong remained silent, and the bandits withdrew.\n\nThen came a king, crowned in lofty headdress and draped in voluminous sleeves, his feet shod in crimson slippers beneath long robes. In his hand he held a scepter of cold jade, and behind him stood fierce deities and malevolent ghosts—ox-headed hell-guards brandishing iron forks. With a great shout, they cried, “Yama, the Great King, has arrived! Why do you not rise?” The guards thrust their forks at Li Tong, but the king commanded, “Hold. If this man speaks but a word, spare him; if he remains silent, pierce him with the forks.” Li Tong felt no fear, nor did his heart stir.\n\nThe king then ordered, “Bring forth his wife.” Soon, Li Tong’s wife was brought before him. The king said, “If you make your husband speak but a word, I shall spare you from suffering.” His wife pleaded, “You and I are bound as husband and wife, our love as weighty as mountains. Today, I endure the torments of hell. If you speak but a word to relieve my suffering, I shall be spared; if not, my agony shall be unbearable.” Yet Li Tong remained silent.\n\nEnraged, the king declared, “This man is obstinate and base. Now, saw his wife asunder before his eyes.” In an instant, the hell-guards seized his wife, bound her between planks, and began to saw her in two. Blood flowed across the ground, her cries of anguish too grievous to witness. Yet her husband spoke not a word.\n\nThe king then commanded, “Summon his child.”",

The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: ‘The bond between father and child is rooted in Heaven’s nature.’ Father, show mercy—speak but a word, and spare me this suffering.\" Yet Li Tong uttered not a sound.\n\nSeeing this, the king flew into a rage and cried, \"This man is stubborn and perverse!\" He ordered the guards to seize his living soul and sever it from his body. Li Tong felt himself fall into a stupor, and his soul was reborn in the household of Wang Dalang of Qizhou as a daughter—radiant and fair beyond compare, yet mute and voiceless. At eighteen, she was called the \"Dumb Girl.\" Her parents married her to the third son of Squire Ma of the Eastern Village, who cherished her beauty and took her as his wife despite her silence. For three years, she bore him a son.\n\nOne day, her husband returned drunk and said to her, \"You’ve given birth to a fine boy, but he is mute—this is a grave affliction. What use is such a child?\" He seized the infant by the feet, inverted him, and dashed him to the ground. Blood splattered across the dumb girl’s face. Startled, she cried out in anguish, \"Oh, the cruelty!

      "translated_text": "Thus, Li Tong sought a rope to suspend a great stone, weighing a thousand *jin*, and let it hang above the stone chamber. Beneath it, he sat in perfect stillness, unmoving. After six years of cultivation, his merit complete, his master reappeared, riding a phoenix, and called to him. Li Tong, overjoyed, bowed in reverence. After their exchange, the two ascended together, riding the phoenix as it rose gently into the sky.\n\nMidway through the heavens, the master left behind a poem:\n\n*Behold the void—void too is true emptiness,*\n*Emptiness knows no bounds, and \"no\" flows free.*\n*With \"no-desire\" comes stillness, constant, serene,*\n*Bestride the startled crane and soar to the celestial palace.*\n\nThere was also a short lyric, *\"To the Tune of Lesser Woodland Blossoms\"*:\n\n*Books I pored o’er, learning’s toil,*\n*Fifty years—my hair turned white as snow.*\n*No name on golden rolls, I knew at last*\n*The scholar’s cap had led my life astray.*\n*Wife dead, child lost, love’s bonds dissolved—*\n*At last the Way appeared before my gaze.*\n*Deep thanks to my master’s words:*\n*In stillness constant, I ascend to heaven’s height.*\n\nThe treatise states: The Great Dao is most wondrous and subtle, its numinous power awakened by resonance, like metal or stone that rings only when struck. Li Tong came to realize that even emptiness is empty—emptiness has no object, and where nothing is emptied, even \"nothing\" ceases to be. With \"nothing\" thus dissolved, the Way of constant stillness stands unshaken, undisturbed by a thousand demons or ten thousand delusions. He suspended a thousand-*jin* stone and cultivated for six years, and indeed ascended to the celestial palace—was this not fitting?\n\nStillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise? When desire does not arise, that is the true Dao. The Way of constancy is grasped by those who awaken to it. Those who awaken to the Dao abide in perpetual purity.\n\nDesire comprises the six desires, which are the six thieves:\nThe eye is the first thief, fond of gazing upon gaudy colors and seductive beauty, unaware that such allure is the axe that severs the life of one’s nature.\nThe ear is the second thief, fond of listening to lewd music and wanton sounds, unaware that such melodies are the drums that harm the spirit.\nThe mouth is the third thief, fond of rich wine and fatty meats, unaware that such indulgences are poison to the viscera.\nThe nose is the fourth thief, fond of sweet fragrances and corrupt vapors, unaware that such scents are the breath that steals one’s vitality.\nThe body is the fifth thief, fond of fragrant carriages and precious steeds, unaware that such luxuries are the mechanism of downfall.\nThe mind is the sixth thief, fond of high rank and great emolument, unaware that such ambition is the ruin of one’s form and life.\n\nThus it is said: *Shoot forth the spirit to heaven.*\n\nThe above passage means that one who, within constant stillness, harbors no notion of stillness has truly comprehended the formless emptiness of the serene and luminous void. When stillness itself vanishes, true emptiness shines forth, revealing the authentic Dao. To perceive the true Dao is to penetrate the four truths of emptiness, nothingness, serenity, and stillness—yet ultimately, even true perception and emptiness must be dissolved. Thus, how could the poison of the six desires ever take root in one’s being? Hence it is said: *Stillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise?*\n\nMaster Wenzi said: One who attains stillness with no object of stillness becomes one with the vastness of space, shares the virtue of the Great Ultimate, and walks alongside the divine Way, transforming without deliberate transformation. How could such a one harbor desire? Thus it is said: *Stillness with no object of stillness—how could desire arise?*\n\nSome may ask: Who can truly know this stillness with no object of stillness, and thus prevent desire from arising? In the first year of the Xining reign of the Song dynasty, there was a physician named Nie Churen from Yizhou. Of a tranquil disposition and refined bearing, he was over thirty years of age. From childhood, he had recited the *Scripture of Clarity and Stillness of the Most High Lord Lao*, mastering its principles. Whenever he treated patients, regardless of their status or wealth, he prescribed the same remedies without ever asking for payment. The people revered him as a true healer of lives.\n\nOnce, a family of a high official summoned him to examine a patient. Upon arriving at the residence, he found the patient’s wife young and of extraordinary beauty. As he took her pulse, she made her intentions clear. Nie Churen averted his gaze, prescribed a dose of medicine, and hastily took his leave. His perception of true emptiness was so keen that he departed at once.\n\nLater, the official’s wife feigned illness and sent for him again. Nie Churen declined, citing other engagements. The lady persisted, sending messengers three or five times. Unable to refuse further, he was compelled to attend. She urged him, saying, \"My husband is away on a distant journey. Come to me tonight, and I shall receive you.\" In her dreams, she had already welcomed him as her lover. Nie Churen, startled, grasped her meaning and fled the house. Though she called after him, he never returned.",

      "translated_text": "As the night deepened, suddenly someone knocked at the door, calling out, \"A patient is gravely ill—pray, Master Physician, come take his pulse.\" Nie Churen, unaware of the ruse, opened the door and stepped out, whereupon the lady seized him. She pleaded, \"If you yield to me, I shall grant you wealth and honor. Refuse, and though I am the wife of Magistrate Huang, I shall accuse you of forcing yourself upon me here. Comply, or you shall surely die.\" With no choice, Nie Churen feigned consent. He led her to a low wall, grasped her hand, and vaulted over it, fleeing without returning home. He took refuge in the Southern Mountains, where he recited the *Scripture of Supreme Purity and Tranquility*, cultivating the Dao of quiescence beyond all quiescence. Thus, how could desire arise in him?\n\nAt that time, the city god and earth god of his prefecture, witnessing Nie Churen’s unwavering resolve against desire, reported this to the Lord of Destiny. He was granted a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years and ascended as a celestial official. The lady, however, had her years stolen, dying at fifty. Her living soul was seized and cast into hell, while her body lay abed in the mortal realm, her belly wracked as if carved by knives. Her ethereal soul was bound to an iron pillar by hell’s wardens, who sliced open her abdomen and scoured away her heart of lust. She endured this torment, her agony unbearable. The wardens addressed her: \"You have suffered for seven years; three more remain before all three souls descend to hell. Even if you are reborn, you shall enter another’s womb—what then?\" The lady asked, \"How may I be saved?\" The ghostly clerk replied, \"In the mortal realm, sponsor a grand *Huanglu* jiao ritual, turn from evil to goodness, and daily recite the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity and Tranquility of Lord Lao*. Then you may escape this suffering.\" She pressed, \"Will this truly spare me?\" The clerk assured her, \"Truly. A single word of kindness brings blessings a thousand miles away. Repent your sins of lust—how could this be false?\" At once, her ethereal soul was temporarily reunited with her living soul.\n\nShe took heed, repented, and vowed never to transgress again. Her husband, the magistrate, took pity on her and commanded Daoist priests to perform a seven-day *Huanglu* jiao ritual. They chanted a thousand scrolls of the *Nine Dark Realms Redemption Litany* and printed ten thousand copies of the *Scripture of Tranquility*, distributing them to virtuous friends far and wide for recitation. Thereupon, the August Saints of the Nine Heavens pardoned her sins, and her ailment gradually eased. Reflecting on her past lust, she realized this was her retribution. In hell, not only had she suffered alone—countless others had committed the same sin. She told her husband, \"Empress Wu Zetian, in her lifetime, fornicated with monks and endured the Serpent Hell.\" The magistrate asked, \"How was she punished?\" She replied, \"She would strip off her robes and crown, entering a pit of venomous scorpions. They stung her flesh without cease. Once her sentence was served, she would don her garments and crown again.\" The magistrate asked, \"When will her suffering end?\" His wife answered, \"Only after a hundred years—then she must serve as a prostitute.\" She urged him, \"Do good, and never repeat such evil. The consequences are real.\" Hearing this, her husband too reformed his heart.",

They resigned from office, relinquishing their seals, and built an encircling wall within which they erected a thatched hut to sit in meditation. After nine years of Daoist practice, they passed away together while seated, their forms vanishing into the wall.\n\nThey left behind two poems:\n\nThe hells of Fengdu are unbearable to behold,\nTheir sight chills the heart and freezes the gall.\nA thousand deaths, ten thousand rebirths—suffering anew,\nIn the world of the living, the forked paths are hard to traverse again.\n\nRetreating from desire, desire no longer arises,\nDiligently cultivating purity and stillness, clarity shines forth.\nThe realm of the Celestial True, where nothing is yet still,\nLies only in the human heart’s turn toward good conduct.\n\nCommentary: The Dao takes purity, emptiness, stillness, and quietude as its essence, while people cling to lust and sensuality as reality. Do they not know the scripture that says, \"Form is precisely emptiness, emptiness precisely form\"? A broad Way leads to the path of heaven, while excessive desire plants the seeds of hell.\n\nNie Churen, embracing \"stillness where nothing is still,\" cast out the heart of desire, thereby extending his lifespan and inscribing his name in the celestial registers. His wife, mired in the sin of lust, had her years cut short, her soul summoned to the Northern Bureau, where the filth of her lustful heart was scoured away. The agony of her affliction was healed through the rites of the jiao offering. Only when she repented and turned to goodness, resigning from office to cultivate the Teachings of Purity and Stillness alongside him—daily reciting the true scripture and severing all ties to the mundane world—did they at last pass away together in seated meditation, their souls ascending to the Northern Dipper.\n\nAre the sacred true scriptures of the Most High without proof? Let later gentlemen who cherish the Dao take heed.\n\n*Tai Shang Lao Jun’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* #1: \"Activity is the foundation of stillness\" (alternatively rendered in the annotations of Hou Shanyuan and Liu Tongwei, as well as in the *Scripture of the Pure and Still Heart*, as \"Stillness is the foundation of activity\").",
