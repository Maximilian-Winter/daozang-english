  "full_translation": "The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Daoist Works*\n*Preface to the* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the *Way and Its Power*\n\n[We, your] ministers respectfully note: The *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* in six *juan* bears the traditional attribution to Yan Zun of the Han. The *Sui Bibliographic Treatise* records it as eleven *juan*. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of the Reading of Books* states that the *Tang Bibliographic Treatise* includes *Yan Zun’s Pointers* in forty *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Commentary on the Pointers* in thirteen *juan*. Upon examining the *Old* and *New Tang Histories*, both record *Yan Zun’s Laozi Pointers* as fourteen *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Laozi Pointers* as thirteen *juan*, with no mention of *Yan Zun’s* work in forty *juan*. It is suspected that Chao Gongwu’s record resulted from a scribal transposition of the text.\n\nThis edition was printed from the secret collection of Hu Zhenheng and later, with its woodblocks acquired by Mao Jin, incorporated into the *Jindai Secret Books*. Only six *juan* remain. Qian Zeng’s *Record of the Diligent Seeker of Books* notes that he once obtained a manuscript copy by Qian Shubao, spanning from the seventh to the thirteenth *juan*, which included a general preface followed by chapters such as *\"When People Are Starving\"* and *\"Sincere Words Are Not Fine.\"* These are now lost. He also cites the preface by Gushenzi, which states: *\"The* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power *had already lost half its text by the Chen and Sui dynasties. What remains today consists only of the* Lun De *section.\"* A modern edition printed in Jiaxing lists *juan* one through six, which diverges significantly from the preface. This edition also titles itself as *juan* one through six, suggesting that Hu Zhenheng’s printed version was based on the Jiaxing edition.\n\nCao Xuequan, in his preface to the *Yuan Yu Waibian*, claims that the recently printed *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* by Yan Junping is a forgery from Wu. Upon examination, the *Comprehensive Examination* cites Chao Gongwu’s words [though this citation differs from the current *Record of the Reading of Books*], noting that its chapters and verses differ considerably from other editions. For instance, it treats the last seventeen characters of *\"Crookedness\"* as the opening of the following chapter. This suggests that the original text included the *Classic’s* passages. Lu You’s collected works contain a postscript to the book, referring to it as the *Ancient Text of the* Daoist Pointers to the *Classic of the Way and Its Power*, also mentioning the *Classic’s* text. However, this edition omits the *Classic’s* passages, resulting in inconsistent formatting. Moreover, Chao Gongwu’s *Record* still lists Gushenzi’s commentary edition as thirteen *juan*, without noting any loss. Yet this edition’s Gushenzi preface claims that half the text was lost by the Chen and Sui dynasties, and only the *Lun De* section remains. By collating these discrepancies, it is clear that this edition, reduced to six *juan*, starkly contradicts Chao Gongwu’s record.\n\nFurthermore, of the *Zhuangzi* passages cited, sixteen or seventeen are absent from the current text. It is unlikely that Yan Zun’s selections would all be those discarded by Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang. This must be due to the dispersal of Yan Zun’s original work, after which a forger, drawing from Wu Cheng’s postscript to the *Commentary on the Classic of the Way and Its Power*—which mentions *\"Zhuang Junping’s transmitted seventy-two chapters\"*—fabricated a division into an *\"Upper Classic\"* of forty and a *\"Lower Classic\"* of thirty-two *pian*. Additionally, since the *Han Bibliographic Treatise* records *fifty-two* *pian* of the *Zhuangzi*, while the current text contains only thirty-three, the forger concocted *Zhuangzi* passages to append to the lost sections. Having failed to consult Chao Gongwu’s account, the contradictions in Gushenzi’s forged preface are glaringly evident.\n\nBased on this investigation, Cao Xuequan’s argument is not without foundation. Qian Zeng’s critique, however, pursues minor details while overlooking the core issue. Given that its content does not contradict reason and remains the work of a literate forger, it is still included in the catalog to preserve one perspective within Daoist thought.\n\nIn the third month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign, respectfully submitted after collation.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Original Preface to the *Daoist Pointers to the Return***\n\nOf the numerous commentators on the *Laozi*, none surpasses the renown of Master Heshang Gong, yet none predates Yan Junping. Junping lived during the Yuan and Cheng eras, contemporaneous with Yang Ziyun. He concealed himself in divination, his Dao lofty and his talent profound, his intellect vast and his discernment subtle. His discourse flowed with ease, nearly perceiving the transformations of the unseen, concealing the past and foreseeing the future, as if consulting with spirits, wielding yin and yang as his instruments. His defenses aligned seamlessly with the teachings of Laozi. Thus, he expounded upon its chapters to elucidate their guiding principles, asserting that the Dao’s root lies in the \"non-being of non-being,\" born of the \"non-being of the never-beginning beginning\"—this is the Great Beginning. Since its essence is formless, it cannot but be void; since it has no beginning, no trace can be discerned—only the traceless. Thus, it pervades the utmost emptiness, and what limit could it have? Therefore, the origin of all things lies in utmost softness. Softness is the inception of life, while hardness is the spirit of life. The fullness of potential must begin with emptiness, and softness is its foundation, never losing its primordial state. Hence, the Dao of Heaven descends, the Dao of Earth abides in lowliness, rivers and valleys empty themselves to gather in marshes, and kings and lords hold humility as noble, esteeming the lowly as exalted, placing the latter before the former. They discard excess, abandon pride, know the masculine but guard the feminine. By this, they govern the state and cultivate the self. Calamity departs, fortune abides, and their continuity remains unbroken, serving as the norm for all under Heaven. By acting without acting and engaging in affairs without affairs, Heaven and Earth are completed, the myriad things arise, and the world is nourished. They bestow benefit upon the four seas without claiming great merit, yet their names endure. They do not harm their spirit, yet their blessings extend for ten thousand generations. These are Junping’s pointers and the great essentials of Laozi’s teachings.\n\nPeople follow their inclinations to interpret it as they will. Some, emphasizing the triumph of softness and weakness over hardness and strength, apply it to the cunning of military strategy, appropriating its perilous and martial aspects to serve deceitful schemes. Others, likening the myriad things to straw dogs, adopt the severity of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, cutting off sagacity and abandoning wisdom to dull the people. Some, advocating stillness and non-action, echo the words of Gai Gong, cautiously upholding constancy to pacify the realm—such was the governance of Chancellor Cao in assisting the Han dynasty. Still others, fixating on the \"valley spirit never dying,\" pursue the arts of immortality and longevity, tracing the origins of the *Laozi* to the *Guan Yinzi* and making it the fountainhead of esoteric discourse. Yet all these are but offshoots of Laozi’s thought, not its entirety. Could Laozi have foreseen such extremes?\n\nEven the Six Classics have been plundered to sow disorder, as Zhuangzi remarked: \"The ancients were truly vast and great!\" Yet even he, in expounding his own Dao, never conflated it with Laozi’s. How much less could those later schools, each offering their own interpretations, be reconciled? A hair’s breadth of deviation leads to a thousand *li* of error—what use are mere glosses?\n\nJunping’s work, however, stands apart from these, much like Sima Jizhu. Both embraced the Dao and refused office, honoring the rustic life. They traced the Dao of Heaven above, recorded the principles of Earth below, and centered their inquiry on human affairs. They exhaustively examined antiquity, scrutinized later ages, and comprehensively grasped the nature of things, penetrating even the obscure and hidden, recording what had not yet taken form. Thus, when Song Zhong and Jia Yi heard his words, their hearts melted and their ambitions waned, bowing before his carriage, their vigor spent. Yet Master Yan, with divining stalks in hand and milfoil upright, debated divination in the marketplace, his integrity unbroken amid chaos, pure yet unstained by the world.\n\nHis writing is vast and profound, encompassing and harmonious, marked by clarity and coherence. Its threads are meticulously arranged, its beginnings and endings refined and elegant. Up close, it fills the senses; from afar, it does not dazzle with talent or overwhelm with rhetoric. Its principles prevail over ornamentation, transcending like a thousand-*li* steed confined to an anthill, its dust never stirring, its tracks never straying, yet traversing every inch of ground with effortless skill. Like rivers and seas, it immerses and saturates, surging and receding, gradually nourishing without one’s awareness of its benefit. Like creation bestowing form, it adapts to all, ever-renewing, its mechanism unfathomable. Though it bears the name of an exegesis, it constitutes a distinct school of thought. Of its original six *juan*, only fragments remain—yet even in this, we may regret its loss no further.\n\n**Preface by Liu Feng**\n\nI once read Junping’s *Inscription by His Seat*, which declares: \"Swift movement cannot escape one’s shadow; great sound cannot conceal its echo. In silence and seclusion, no trace or response arises. By constantly embodying humility and weakness, misfortune finds no foothold.\" I marveled at how deeply he grasped Laozi’s principles. Later, learning of his *Daoist Pointers to the Return*, I sought it in vain. In the winter of the *renyin* year, Xiaoyuan obtained a copy from Zhao Yuandu, and upon reading it once, I found it broadly encompassing the six directions, inwardly probing the myriad conditions, measuring the workings of yin and yang, and observing the transformations of things, all converging in the mysterious unity. I could not put it down. Its prose often employs rhyme shifts in succession, as if derived from the *Xici* tradition. Passages like \"without righteousness or benevolence, the six directions harmonize and Heaven becomes kin\" and \"without moderation or ritual, the four seas become brothers\" exhibit a three-line structure with rhyming beginnings and ends.\n\nIn the chapter \"Which is dearer, name or self,\" the lines on \"the nameless name\" are echoed in Wang Fusi’s commentary on the *Guigua*’s top yang, which he deemed a sublime interpretation. Alas, the text’s mutilation before and after leaves its great treasure incomplete—yet it remains a vast vessel of the Dao.\n\nThe original preface is signed by \"Gushenzi,\" whose identity is unclear. Chao Gongwu attributed it to Feng Kuo of the Tang. Noted by Shen Shilong of Xiushui:\n\nThe *Daoist Pointers to the Return* directly corresponds to the *Heshang Gong*’s division of the *Laozi* into chapters. However, Junping divided it into an \"Upper Classic\" of forty *pian* and a \"Lower Classic\" of thirty-two *pian*. Comparing this with the extant text, two *pian* remain unaccounted for. The combined chapters—\"The movement of the Dao is return\" with \"Attaining oneness,\" \"Governing the people and serving Heaven\" with \"Square yet not cutting,\" \"Excelling as a knight\" with \"Great resemblance to unworthiness,\" and \"Repeatedly pruning goodness leads to calamity\"—are appended to the *Governing the State* chapter. Upon reading, the flow of language and coherence of principles are seamless. However, the seven *pian* beginning with \"When the people starve\" are entirely missing. Upon closer examination, the two combined chapters—\"Governing the people\" and \"Excelling as a knight\"—should belong to the section beginning with \"Daily diminishing,\" while the seven missing *pian* constitute Junping’s \"Lower Classic.\" The nine *pian* preceding \"Not leaving one’s door\" remain part of the \"Upper Classic.\"\n\nIf one supplements this with the thirty-seven *pian* of the *Heshang Gong* version, Junping’s \"Upper Classic\" would comprise forty-six *pian*, likely with six *pian* merged—though he was unwilling to disclose the chapter titles.\n\nShould the theories of \"eight as yin, nine as yang\" be considered, though Lin Xiyi deemed them alien to the original purport of the Laozi, they nonetheless serve as profound channels for dredging and expanding the Daoist tradition, thus occupying a foundational position within the primordial Dao. Noted by Hu Zhenheng of Haiyan.\n\nMaster Yan Junping was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery, originally surnamed Zhuang—hence also called Zhuangzi. During the Zhanghe era of the Eastern Han, Ban Gu, in compiling the *Book of Han*, altered the surname to Yan to avoid the personal name of Emperor Ming. \"Yan\" (strict) was also a term interchangeable across antiquity and the present. Junping lived during the mid-Western Han, when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne, prompting his retreat into reclusion and eremitism—truly a perfected one of the highest antiquity. His extant work, the *Dao De Zhi Gui Lun* (Commentary on the *Dao De Jing*), originally comprised numerous *juan*. By the Chen and Sui dynasties, half had already been lost. The surviving text, now only the \"Discourse on Virtue\" section, was collated from its corrupted remnants, edited into six *juan*, and prefaced with its table of contents to preserve the overarching purport of the complete work. Preface by Gushenzi.\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Dao De Zhi Gui Lun*, Volume One\nBy Yan Zun of the Han\n\n**Table of Contents**\nZhuangzi said: In ancient times, when Laozi composed his work, transformation arose from the Dao as mother, with the warp of the classics arrayed at the forefront. Heaven and earth served as its images: the Upper Classic corresponded to heaven, the Lower Classic to earth. The eightfold path of yin and the ninefold path of yang—with yin proceeding through yang, hence seventy-two chapters; with yang proceeding through yin, hence division into upper and lower. The five phases and eight trigrams gave the Upper Classic forty chapters, beginning anew; the four phases and eight trigrams gave the Lower Classic thirty-two chapters, concluding the whole. The yang path is odd, the yin path even—thus the Upper Classic precedes the Lower. The yang path is vast, the yin path small—thus the Upper Classic is abundant while the Lower is sparse. The yang path inclines left, the yin path right—thus the Upper Classic unfolds forward while the Lower unfolds backward. Alternating and interpenetrating, they merge into one form, obscure and undifferentiated, with the Dao as their central pivot. Repeated signs and manifold proofs reveal their origins. The Lower Classic serves as the gate, the Upper as the door. Those of wisdom who perceive its warp and weft comprehend the reckonings of heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the pairings of husband and wife, the bonds of father and son, the propriety of ruler and minister—all things unfold thereby.\n\n**Chapter: \"The Power of Supreme Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"**\nHeaven and earth arise from this; the myriad things are so because of this. The Dao is their origin, virtue their beginning, spirit their ancestor, and great harmony their progenitor. The Dao has depth and shallowness; virtue, thickness and thinness; spirit, clarity and turbidity; harmony, elevation and lowness. The clear becomes heaven; the turbid, earth. The yang becomes male; the yin, female. Humans and creatures receive these endowments in varying measures: their natures differ in refinement, their lifespans in length, their dispositions in beauty and ugliness, their intentions in magnitude. Some become petty men; others, noble lords. Through differentiation and division, they are ranked into countless grades. Thus there are Daoists, virtuous ones, humane ones, righteous ones, and ritualistic ones.\n\nMay I ask: what conduct distinguishes these men, leading to such disparate names?\n\nZhuangzi said: Those who empty themselves and act without contrivance, guiding the myriad things, are called Daoists. Those who are serene and responsive, accomplishing all without obstruction, are called virtuous ones. Those who universally love the myriad things and bestow boundlessly are called humane ones. Those who rectify names, align realities, and handle affairs with propriety are called righteous ones. Those who yield, defer, and maintain harmony through reverence are called ritualistic ones. These five types of men all delight in longevity, honor profound virtue, esteem lofty renown, and employ their intelligence to pursue their strengths, returning to their places of ease. Yet their pursuits diverge, their paths conflict, their transformations vary, and their titles multiply. Virtue has its excellences and deficiencies; the world, its flourishing and decline. Customs drift apart, and the destinies of people differ. Thus some dwell in primordial obscurity, nameless; others, shrouded in vast indistinction, are called August Ones; some, vast and boundless, are called Emperors; others, expansive and luminous, are called Kings; still others, distantly connected and uneven, are called Lords. These are the designations that can be spoken.\n\nYet lords are not truly lords, kings not truly kings, emperors not truly emperors, and August Ones not truly August Ones. Being is not truly being, nor is non-being truly non-being. Myriad transformations, innumerable permutations—how can they be reckoned? How can they be named? Consider this: those who changed their surnames to become kings and were enfeoffed at Mount Tai, performing the Feng and Shan sacrifices, numbered seventy-two. Yet those whose forms and omens were indistinct, whose traces were unrecognizable—how can they be named or described? Are their natures and destinies not different, their achievements and reputations unequal? No.\n\nThus, the lord of supreme virtue embodies the Dao and preserves spirit, moving in accord with transformation. His virtue stirs in the profound obscurity; the world’s kings neither see nor hear of him. His virtue returns to the myriad things, and all declare it natural. The lord of lesser virtue embodies virtue and acts, his spirit roaming with transformation. His virtue matches August Heaven; the world’s kings sometimes see, sometimes hear of him. His virtue flows into the myriad things, returning to his lordship. Why is this?\n\nThe lord of supreme virtue receives the Dao’s subtlest essence in his nature and attains the essence of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny align with the natural; his emotions and intentions embody spirit. His actions harmonize with great harmony; his choices accord with Heaven’s will. His spirit does not ponder; his will does not deliberate. His intelligence is profoundly distant; his being, tranquil and empty. In motion, he is formless; in stillness, unborn. His achievements resemble heaven and earth; his affairs, those of an infant. He sheds form and conceals intent, merging with the Dao. Vast and indistinct, the world knows him not. Flowing and boundless, he soars beyond the farthest reaches. Yin and yang serve him; spirits counsel him. His body transforms with the Dao, ascending and descending without end, advancing and retreating with change. Thus, in serene non-action, his virtue fills the mysterious realm; in silent obscurity, his transformation flows into the infinite. His grace is immeasurable, his depth unfathomable. Embracing the great and nourishing all nations, his wisdom cannot encompass his transformations, nor his words exhaust his customs. The world hums and murmurs, all receiving his transformation and bathed in his harmony. Such is he—eternally without end. Yet who knows the doer of this?\n\nThe lord of lesser virtue receives the Dao’s upright *qi* in his nature and attains the middle grade of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny approximate the natural; his emotions and intentions approach spirit. His actions align with great harmony; his choices embody supreme virtue. He entrusts his spirit to the great void, roots his being in profound obscurity. In motion, he returns to softness; in stillness, to peace. He wears the square and treads the compass, gazing into the great clarity. His transformations are indistinct, his responses formless. Subtle and imperceptible, he is nearly nameless. Following heaven and earth, he moves with change as his constant. His virtue flourishes, his grace overflows, suffusing all directions. Before his beauty takes shape, the world is innocent, the four seas as one. Vast and silent, he moves with the people; gazing upon things, he mirrors them. At this time, the great Dao is undivided, pure virtue unsevered. Within the six directions, one man alone dwells in his task. He diminishes without adding, cultivates without contriving. His deeds are few; his holdings, minimal. The people are honest and loyal; the world, harmonious and tranquil. Water and grass suffice for sustenance; furs and coarse cloth, for fine attire. Great trees form his halls; caves and grottoes, his chambers. His rule is like heaven and earth; his people, like grass and trees. Bathed in the Dao and aligned with virtue, he is serene and desireless. Yin and yang harmonize; the myriad things flourish. Without decrees, the realm submits. Auspicious grains and red herbs grow together; peonies and herbs sprout side by side. Divine dragons and phoenixes dwell among men. Sweet dew falls ceaselessly; propitious winds blow without pause. Without benevolence or righteousness, the six directions unite in harmony; without ritual or propriety, the four seas become as brothers. Intimate yet not cloying, reverent yet not obsequious, heaven and earth, humans and creatures merge in primordial unity.\n\nThe lord of supreme benevolence possesses a nature pure and clear, luminous and expansive. His mind is empty and still; his spirit and *qi* harmonious. He governs heaven and earth, encompassing all. Perceiving the essential, he nurtures life with non-possession, cherishes the people as children, and responds to changes like echo follows sound, shadow follows form. He illuminates the divisions of heaven and the principles of earth, distinguishing the proper places of humans and things. He opens the gates of knowledge and action, initiating affairs to benefit the myriad people. Internally, he records and externally, he unites, fostering closeness. He accumulates thought and deepens virtue to attract diverse methods. His prohibitions are balanced; his commands, gentle. His actions are timely, delighting the world. Thunder does not crash; winds and rains do not arise abruptly. Grass and trees do not wither; people do not die young. Crawling and flying creatures rejoice in life; wriggling and fluttering beings find their places. The old and weak wander in groups; the strong till and weave. People have grandchildren; the yellow-haired and toothless are as children. The lord is like a parent; the people, like infants. His virtue flows to the four seas, yet he takes nothing.\n\nThe lord of supreme righteousness possesses a nature peaceful and upright, his emotions perceptive and penetrating. He discerns benefits and harms, distinguishes wisdom and intelligence. His mind is like a compass; his will, like a scale. Still as water, straight as a plumb line, he delights in great achievements to establish grand titles. He enjoys initiating blessings and detests causing misfortune. First grasping power and wielding change, he measures the times. He exalts benevolence and encourages righteousness to govern the myriad people. Following heaven and earth’s principles, he orders the myriad things’ proper places. Serving parents as if attending spirits, treading among the people as if over deep abysses, he listens to all nations and adjudicates with the mean. His might is not oppressive; his harmony, not indulgent. Stern yet not cruel, discerning yet not harsh, he examines beginnings and determines ends, establishing influence to guide the people. Advancing and retreating with the times, yielding and extending with change, his affairs transform with tasks, his rituals with customs. His commands are trustworthy; his regulations, distinct. The web of governance is tight yet not dense; laws are upright yet not indulgent. All affairs are decided by ministers; power and authority rest solely with the lord. He extends rectitude with caution, reveals goodness to expose villainy. He enacts the five punishments, carving flesh to revere the origins of governance. Ever mindful of names, he bends with moderation, cuts with principle, and wields power to expand influence, shaking the realm. Setting aside self, he follows others; benefiting the people, he avoids even the slightest harshness. He demotes the minutest beauty and elevates the inner to serve the royal house, extending outward to all beings. Inheriting decay and renewing change, reviving the perishing and restoring the broken, his benevolent virtue revives. Lands are transmitted; descendants endure.\n\nThe lord of supreme ritual possesses a nature harmonious yet emotionally yielding, his mind unconstrained yet his will desirous. In undertaking affairs, he aligns with yin and yang, issues commands in accord with the four seasons, and governs the hundred changes with a net of regulations. He honors the lord and father, humbles the minister and child, clarifies superior and inferior, distinguishes ranks and orders, separates elders and juniors, and unites husbands and wives in human relations. He follows the threads of friendship and reveres the proper sequence of affairs, ranking them by degree. He rewards the constrained and demotes the unbridled, restraining the strong and violent, enveloping customs to guide with the mean. He compels emotions and restrains desires, damming tendencies before they sprout. He binds the world to customs, preventing excess. He forces what people cannot cease and compels what they cannot do, exhausting spirit and injuring nature. Affairs multiply; expenditures swell. Order is achieved, yet peril remains; stability is attained, yet tranquility is lost. Knowledge spreads, yet the great Dao vanishes; sincerity perishes, and benevolent virtue does not arise. Heaven’s will is unharmonized; the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter; the myriad things are harmed by heaven. Father and son have resentment, yet heaven does not harmonize them. Day and night grow bleak, yet the world does not transform. Bells and chimes resound, yet customs do not change. Solemn tones are intoned, yet the wind does not shift. Yielding and deferring, the world does not trust; guarding softness and submitting, the world does not draw near. Hanging titles and setting rewards, the worthy do not descend. Brandishing jade tablets, the noble do not come. Why is this?\n\nThus, though words be abundant and appearances fair, the sincere heart is not bestowed—this is the reason. Therefore, the emperors and kings rooted their governance in the Dao as the fundamental beginning. When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows; when ritual is lost, chaos follows. These five are of one body in the Dao, yet the lords of the age take them as matters of length and shortness.\n\nHence, what they do is not what they desire; what they seek is not what they attain. They neglect the natural and pursue the petty and shallow—such is the affair of ritual. Inner and outer diverge; blossoms flourish while fruit withers. The branches thrive while the root decays. Ritual is thinner than loyalty, lighter than authority, weaker than trust, falling short of righteousness and virtue, and not reaching benevolence. It is the dregs of governance and the origin of chaos, the wellspring of deceit and the cause of strife. Thus, rituals are established, music composed, calendars reformed, and garments altered; advance and retreat, dignity and decorum, all follow fixed measures. Foreseeing affairs to discern success and failure—these are the blossoms of the Dao and the dregs of virtue, the laws of a moment and the techniques of a corner. They are not the means to govern an endless age or unite the customs of distant lands. Hence, they are the source from which calamities and disorders arise, the cause by which ignorance and delusion are wrought.\n\nHow to make this clear? Zhuangzi said: The response of heaven and earth follows affairs; affairs respond to change; change has no constant time. Thus, affairs cannot be predetermined, nor change foreseen in advance. Just as pain cannot be soothed before it is felt, nor itching scratched before it arises; the five flavors cannot be harmonized by measuring cups, nor the zither tuned by inches. Therefore, the subtlest of precautions cannot be spoken, and the most wondrous of wonders cannot be transmitted. The utmost loyalty and trust cannot be adorned by ritual, nor the harmony of seasons preserved by calculation.\n\nThus, the keen of hearing and clear of sight, the broadly learned and deeply wise, who perceive the warp of yin and grasp the weft of yang, who comprehend the divine way and penetrate the principles of the myriad things—looking up, they see the bounds of heaven; looking down, they see the depths of earth. They teach the people without ceasing, and when affairs arise, they do not halt. By this, they bring about peace—yet this is not what we have heard of.\n\nThe reliance of the myriad things upon the ruler is like the spirit’s dwelling in the body or well-water in the courtyard. Water cannot be made clear by effort, nor the spirit made tranquil by thought. Between heaven and earth, the myriad things arise together; they cannot be pacified by busyness. Therefore, the great man’s transformation is to embody the Dao, embrace virtue, and be as open and penetrating as the great void—complete yet seeming incomplete, existent yet seeming absent. In stillness, without form; in motion, without sound. Loyalty and trust, earnest and sincere, not knowing how to be artful; profound and obscure, simple and unadorned, taking precedence. Diminishing the heart and discarding intentions, without display of dignity, without striving or acting—like the dragon, like the snake, abandoning ritual and casting off righteousness, returning to non-action. Following the times and responding to change without premeditation, grasping the subtle and essential, moving with the times, taking and relinquishing, bending and extending—calamities, disasters, and faults are sought within oneself. A hundred blessings and ten thousand fortunes arise without attachment to others.\n\nAttain the One—this One is the child of the Dao, the mother of spirit and clarity, the ancestor of supreme harmony, the progenitor of heaven and earth. To the spirit, it is nothing; to the Dao, it is something. To the spirit, it is great; to the Dao, it is small. As a thing, it is empty yet full, non-existent yet existent, round yet not obstructive, square yet not rigid. Vast and indistinct, without end or thread, neither floating nor sinking, neither moving nor still. Acting without acting, bestowing without bestowal. Encompassing transformation, bearing all, distinguishing principles—from the nothingness of nothing, the beginning of beginnings. Without inside or outside, chaotic and indistinct, boundless and drifting, it may go left or right. Emptiness and non-action are its constant; clarity and stillness its master. It flows through the ten thousand heavens, courses through the hundred wilds, and the myriad things are thus. Without form or sign, it abides alone in profound mystery, dwelling in perfect secrecy, unchanging in its ease, vast and obscure as the bright sky. It possesses all yet does not share in the crafting of spirit and clarity; it creates heaven and earth yet does not dwell with them. It endows without diminishing, gathers without accumulating, neither crooked nor straight, neither first nor last. Lofty and boundless, deep and unfathomable, above and below beyond reckoning, its currents beyond measure. Expansive and serene, it generates life, yet does not change with the generated. It transforms, yet does not accompany the transformed in birth. It does not give birth, yet things are born of themselves; it does not act, yet things are completed of themselves.\n\nBeyond heaven and earth, within the tip of a hair, all receive qi differently, take different forms, and assume varied appearances—yet all obtain the One to live and are perfected by the transformation of the One. Thus, the One is what the myriad things depend upon and the essential key to all change. It is the plumb line of the ten thousand directions and the measure of a hundred transformations. \"One\" is its name; \"virtue\" its title.\n\nWithout a place of abode, without affairs to attend,\nWithout form to measure, returning to the great reckoning,\nHarmonizing its return, weak in its function—\nThus it knows the One, and a thousand changes do not exhaust it;\nTen thousand revolutions do not fail it.\nThose who cannot know the One are at times blocked, at times auspicious;\nThose who hold the state perish, those who guard the self are lost.\n\nTherefore, of old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven’s nature attained the One’s clarity,\nYet heaven’s deeds are not clarity—\nWithout thought, without intent, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nSilent and still, without form or model,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus yin and yang arise of themselves, transformations rectify themselves.\nHence it is firm and strong, ever in motion,\nReaching its height in purity, vast and penetrating,\nLuminous and bright, harmonious and upright,\nPure and unadulterated, true and flourishing,\nUnmixed with things—radiant in great ease.\nVigorous and undaunted, its light illumines the ten thousand things,\nWhich draw upon its beginning.\nClouds gather, rain descends,\nAll beings flow and move.\nAt the origin of nature and destiny,\nProfound and boundless, it covers all without exception.\n\nEarth’s nature attained the One’s tranquility,\nYet earth’s deeds are not tranquility—\nWithout knowledge, without awareness, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout measure, without reckoning, without attachment, without profit,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus mountains and rivers arise of themselves, hardness and softness rectify themselves.\nHence it is compliant and yielding, straight and square,\nHarmonious and upright, vast and boundless,\nDeep and thick, clear and still.\nThe ten thousand things draw upon it for life, and none fail to be completed.\nIt bears the numinous.\n\nThe numinous attained the One’s spirit,\nYet the numinous’ deeds are not spirit—\nWithout thought, without deliberation, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout calculation, without scheming, without direction, without head,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus growth and decline arise of themselves, life and death rectify themselves.\nHence the old regain youth, the dead return to life,\nThe distressed regain success, the ruined regain glory.\nTransformations are without limit, reversals without end.\nAll forms entrust themselves to it without losing their center.\n\nThe valley’s nature attained the One’s fullness,\nYet the valley’s deeds are not fullness—\nWithout desire, without seeking, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout benevolence, without righteousness, without giving, without bestowing,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus fullness and emptiness arise of themselves, flourishing and decline rectify themselves.\nHence it steams mountains and flows through marshes to become penetrating virtue,\nTrickling without cease, continuous without end,\nBright and vast, far-reaching and boundless.\nIt fills rivers and seas, deep and great beyond measure.\n\nThe lords and kings attained the One’s uprightness,\nYet the lords and kings’ deeds are not uprightness—\nAbandoning thought, abandoning will, without action, without affairs,\nThey follow their nature.\nAbandoning hearing, abandoning sight, emptiness and nothingness respond of themselves,\nThey preserve their mandate.\nThus peace arises of itself, the ten thousand things rectify themselves.\nHence they embody the Dao and unite with virtue, aligning with heaven’s constancy.\nEmbracing the spirit, treading harmony,\nThey envelop the ten thousand things.\nTheir voice flies, transforming things,\nFilling the six directions.\nTheir virtue joins with heaven and earth, their brightness illumines sun and moon.\nThey govern the age, guide customs, and unify the world.\n\nThese five all attained the One and practiced it:\nTheir rise was not abandoned, their completion was not lacking,\nTheir flow was not cut off, their light was not extinguished.\nWhy is this so?\nNature and destiny move of themselves, yet follow the One.\n\nThus, if heaven acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be high is to gain lowness, to be clear is to gain rupture.\nYin and yang are perverse and contrary, the warp slackens, the weft breaks.\nHarmonious qi is blocked and obstructed, the Three Luminaries fade,\nThunder and lightning act recklessly, the ten thousand things all lose their way.\n\nIf earth acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be straight is to gain crookedness, to be tranquil is to gain eruption.\nMountains and rivers collapse, hardness and softness coil and break.\nQi-transformations are cut off, the Five Phases are destroyed,\nThe hundred grains wither, the multitude of beings suffer epidemics.\n\nIf the numinous acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be successful is to gain distress, to be spirit is to gain exhaustion.\nTransformations lose their order, stagnation and dissipation arise,\nFlourishing and decline perish, tension and slackness die.\n\nIf the valley acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo have is to gain loss, to be full is to gain exhaustion.\nFullness and emptiness reverse, flowing moisture does not enter.\n\nIf lords and kings act and move, not following the One:\nTo be noble is to gain baseness, to be upright is to gain downfall.\nChaos and confusion arise, delusion and bewilderment follow,\nAffairs proceed from the self, the hundred officials lose their center,\nNames and realities diverge, the ten thousand people do not return.\nHeaven and earth are cut off.\n\nThese five—nature and destiny pure and perfect,\nTransformations and changes at their utmost,\nAdvance and retreat, bending and stretching—\nDo not depart from the model.\nAttaining the One, they endure; losing the One, they perish.\nHow much more so for those who are not sages yet rule the ten thousand people,\nAbandoning the model and following their own minds?\n\nThus the Dao of heaven and humanity:\nThings transform and change—\nThe few become many, the base become noble,\nThe high become low, the completed become ruined.\nThose who add to it lose, those who profit from it harm.\nTo dwell in its opposite is to gain its reversal;\nTo act for what is sought is to lose what is desired.\n\nTherefore, worthy lords and sage rulers,\nThough their power is above the people, their rank honored in the world,\nTheir beneficence extends to the ten thousand things, their virtue embraces the four seas,\nFavored by the Dao, assisted by heaven,\nThe ten thousand things turn to them, spirits align with them—\nYet they rise with restraint, conduct themselves with frugality,\nCalling themselves \"orphaned\" and \"widowed,\" dwelling in lowness, guarding humility.\nThey personally undergo toil and hardship,\nDiminishing their minds, subduing their wills,\nStriving to place themselves below the people.\nNot acting as noble, they thus hold the people’s lives;\nNot acting as high, they thus remain above the people.\nWithout desire, they thus possess all things without exception;\nWithout acting, they thus govern all things without exception.\nThe ten thousand things flourish, yet they have no part in it—\nThus they become the root.\n\nThis is not only the way of kingship—all affairs are so.\nWhen a craftsman builds a carriage:\nHe makes it round, square, short, long, curved, straight, vertical, horizontal.\nThough he labors all his life, he does not make a carriage—\nYet he is able to complete the carriage and make it usable.\n\nAs for jade—it is subtle and few;\nAs for stone—it is coarse and many.\nMany, thus base; few, thus noble.\nJade and stone both grow from the same source,\nYet few and many are sought or discarded differently.\nThus nobility and baseness lie in quantity,\nSuccess and failure lie in action or inaction.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts yet returns to guard it,\nHarmonizes with the times, bows and rises with things, transforms with them.\nHe does not act as stone, does not act as jade,\nAbiding between jade and stone,\nNeither many nor few, neither noble nor base.\nThe One is his guiding principle, the Dao his pillar and ridgepole.\nThus he alone governs the world, and his might is invincible;\nHe preserves and enlivens the ten thousand things, and his virtue is immeasurable.\nNoble yet without worry, base yet without harm,\nHigh yet without peril, low yet ever secure.\n\nDiscerning in reversal, returning to silence,\nIlluminating being and non-being, reverting to the Great Beginning—\nNot taking the self as substance, thus spirit and clarity are not lost;\nNot taking the world as substance, thus the world follows him as one.\nWhy is this so?\nHe moves according to the Dao, follows the One in action.\nThe Dao’s utmost reckoning, the One’s great square—\nTransformations arise from reversal,\nHarmony is the constant.\nRising from negation, abiding in affirmation,\nHeaven and earth are born of Great Harmony,\nGreat Harmony is born of emptiness and darkness.\n\nThe superior scholar, hearing the Dao’s chapters,\nKnows that the Dao of heaven and earth each has its manifestations,\nThat things have high and low, qi has short and long.\nEach delights in its own delight, suffers its own suffering,\nSees its own seeing, hears its own hearing.\nChoices and rejections diverge, fears and joys differ.\nThus the quail and the swallow fly high,\nRacing all day yet their aim is but a little.\n\nThe humble quail and the soaring swan take flight, traversing east and west, spanning thousands and tens of thousands, yet their aim remains near. The phoenix and simurgh glide above blades a myriad fathoms high, roam the Great Purity’s expanse, yet ever deem it low—stretching their necks, spreading their wings, they pierce the azure clouds, skim the sun and moon, soar far and vanish, fasting for seasons on end. Coming and going across the Nine Provinces, nesting at the Eight Extremes, only then do they find their proper place. These three differ in their paths, yet each finds its delight. Thus the boundless springs and fathomless fountains are where the spirit dragons gather, where minnows depart; the towering mountains and deep valleys, the dense forests and vast ravines, the luxuriant trees with flourishing branches are where the great birds, tigers, and leopards rejoice, yet where chickens and dogs abhor.\n\nAlas! The remnant customs of the Three Dynasties, the schools of Confucians and Mohists—reciting texts, chanting poems and books, refining rites and music, singing odes and hymns, plucking zithers and lutes, exalting benevolence and righteousness, venerating the ancients, scrutinizing the past, mastering arts and calculations, fixing right and wrong, weighing gains and losses—these bring bodily ease and reputed glory, passed down as the legacy of village scholars. Such are the ways of the middling scholar, yet the superior scholar discards them.\n\nSecluded in quietude, brooding in solitude, they strain to memorize the myriad things, fabricate falsehoods, adorn errors, utter empty words, chase names and realities, flit about in advancement and retreat, rise and fall, kneel and gather, regulating the rites of the inner chambers, conforming to the customs of the age, inclining and reclining, striving to align with the times, flattering the rich, currying favor with the noble, lowering themselves before the masses. Their ears and eyes gain esteem, they bask in favor, and the vulgar deem this right. Such are the steps of the inferior scholar, yet the middling scholar rejects them.\n\nThus, compass and square do not harm each other; disparate natures, how can they find peace? The worthy and sage do not pair; the foolish and wise do not flock. The great man delights in tranquility; the petty man is ever anxious. Grand enterprises are not understood by the masses; bustling affairs do not please the true gentleman. Birds and beasts arise together, each with its own course; scholars of the age each have their own destination. Therefore, they cast aside cleverness, abandon cunning, return to the genuine, revert to simplicity, wander in primordial purity, scorn material things, disdain the world, stand aloof and unstained. Joy and anger do not touch their hearts; profit and harm do not reach their minds. Noble and base share the same realm; life and death are as one. Acting without acting, they behold the wondrous and subtle. Their spirit is serene, nothing to display or bear; embracing virtue, containing harmony, they effortlessly revert to transformation. This is what the great sage esteems, what the superior scholar pursues, what the middling scholar dimly perceives, and what the inferior scholar utterly ridicules.\n\nThus, what the middling scholar hears is not the ultimate beauty; what the inferior scholar sees is not the ultimate goodness. What the middling scholar perceives and the inferior scholar ridicules is the very perfection of beauty and goodness.\n\nTo expound grand words, unfold supreme discourse, reveal the natural, exhaust the wondrous and subtle—this the middling scholar perceives dimly, and the inferior scholar ridicules. Yet with floating words and wandering persuasion, they breed endless changes, conjure blessings, stir up profit, achieve success, and complete affairs. Then the middling scholar debates, and the inferior scholar awakens. They do not delight in restraint but hate good fortune, prize calamity and despise blessing. Their nature is far removed, their feelings reversed—like dwelling in the Yellow Springs while listening and gazing at the Nine Heavens, so distant and cut off they cannot see or hear.\n\nThus the sage establishes the saying: \"There is that, there is that\"—speaking of the Dao’s difficulty to know. Only those who grasp the return to the natural, who unify the directions of the myriad things, can possess it. This is not something the mediocre can hear.\n\nWhy is this so? The sage’s Dao is profound and vast, immense and boundless, obscure and dim, luminous and empty, silent and still. The myriad things pass through it; the minute and the towering, the high and the great—none have form or image. Pursuing it to its utmost, one knows it cannot be grasped; distilling it to its essence, the mouth cannot speak it; tracing its shifts and dispersals, books cannot transmit it.\n\nWhat then? Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat; losing the Dao seems like possessing it. To govern the world, return and reflect upon the self. Stillness is the gate of emptiness; emptiness is the door of the Dao; stillness is the root of spirit; frugality is the vessel of qi; subtlety is the craft of affairs. Abide in the absence that comes after, be present in the presence that comes before. Discard the world, put the self first; nurture the spirit, accumulate harmony to govern the heart. The heart is the master of the body; the body is the state of the heart and the world. They respond as naturally as one’s nature.\n\nThus, level the Dao as if flawed, let the upright and mysterious arise, remove its laws and things, do away with its divisions and principles, follow the people’s hearts, heed what they possess. Eradicate ornamentation, flatten perilous paths, break down barriers, shatter locks, let villainy cease of itself. Tear down walls, disband prisons, let the people guard themselves. Rest the troops, lay down arms, make the world a marketplace. The myriad regions come like rivers to the sea; virtue flows like valleys. Without bestowing, without giving, without loving, without profiting, without abiding, without departing—acting without acting, grace flows. Without benevolence, the moisture is deep; nurturing and fostering the multitude of beings, it is the mother of the world. Vast and white, ever as if startled, without control its power rises, without reliance its authority is weighty. Virtue intermingles with creation, befriending the world. Emerging white, entering black, it does not seek beauty, pursues no merit, flees fame—thus it endures, luminous and resplendent in virtue.\n\nThe steadfast and sincere, humble and unassuming, seem as if lacking. Without form, without appearance, they simplify their emotions, ease their natures, transform into the unlearned. Without acting, without affairs, they seem dull and deaf. Their bodies dwell in unity; their spirit transforms a thousandfold, unseen. Joy and desire cannot be heard, as if closed and blocked. Alone they abide with the Dao, establishing virtue as if thieving—yet nothing is not accomplished. They guide the people’s ears and eyes, adorn the people’s spirits, sever the people’s desires to enrich their natures, extinguish the people’s pleasures to prolong their lives. They diminish the people’s adornments to prevent strife, block the people’s hearts and minds to grant them peace. Pure and genuine, as if transformed, they darken the people with the Dao, nourish them with virtue, cultivate them with spirit, harmonize them with models and standards. They dwell with heaven and earth, illuminate with sun and moon, transform with yin and yang, feed with water and grain, regulate with formlessness, bind with the infinite. The world, yearning, submits without exception; the realm enjoys peace, the myriad things flourish. Yet it is not their achievement, not their virtue. Great yet seeming small, pure yet seeming thin, the great square is not angular—nothing it does not embrace. Square yet not square, straight yet not straight, without boundaries, without edges, without laws, without models, neither square nor straight—yet the myriad things attain their own. Neither straight nor square, heaven and earth proceed on their own.\n\nIn action, it is yin; in stillness, yang. Harmony is the central master; division and principle clarify themselves. With heaven as one, with earth as constant—thus the great vessel is late in completion, yet nothing is not possessed. Transforming in formlessness, changing without trace, moving without sound, acting without body, its majesty and virtue unseen, its achievements unviewed. Misfortune arises from obscurity, fortune from profundity—so it is in stillness and silence.\n\nThis is called utmost skill. The myriad things are born from it, yet none know how. Striving and accomplishing, it endures long. Thus the great sound is rare; it instructs without words, speaks in silence. Spirit and illumination transmit in stillness; the world is greatly open. Without sound, the myriad things are startled; without tone, the myriad things sing. Heaven and earth, humans and things, without appointment, harmonize as if in echo. The great image is without form; the great shape is without appearance. Advancing, the myriad things are preserved; retreating, the myriad things are lost. Heaven and earth move with it; yin and yang bend and stretch with it. It imitates and images them, like shadow following form.\n\nThus one knows: when the Dao flourishes, it has no name; when virtue abounds, it has no title; when merit is lofty, it has no measure—yet the world does not deem it great. Virtue fills the Four Seas, yet the world does not deem it noble. Its radiance illumines the Six Directions, yet it returns to obscurity.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\nThe Dao’s transformations begin in nonbeing and end in decay, abide in what does not abide, lend without lending, move and the myriad things are completed, rest and the world is fulfilled.\n\n*Daoist Canon of the Point of Return*, Scroll One\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Library Collection*\n*Daoist Canon of the Point of Return*, Scroll Two\nBy Yan Zun of the Han\n\n**The Dao Gives Birth to the One**\n\nThere is the emptiness of emptiness—it opens and guides, bestows and receives. Yet what is so of itself cannot make itself so. There is emptiness—it molds and transforms, begins the begetting of life. Yet what lives cannot beget life. There is the nonbeing of nonbeing—spirit and light cannot alter it. What abides cannot abide. There is nonbeing—subtle and wondrous, moving and forming. Yet what is formed cannot form.\n\nThus the emptiness of emptiness gives birth to emptiness; emptiness gives birth to the nonbeing of nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to form. All that has form belongs to things. Things have their lineage, their ancestry. Heaven and earth are the greatest of things; humans come next.\n\nNow, heaven gives birth to humans: form arises from qi, qi from harmony, harmony from spirit and light, spirit and light from virtue and power, virtue and power from spontaneity. All things exist thereby. Thus what makes heaven heaven is not heaven; what makes humans human is not humans. How is this known? Zhuangzi said: When the human form decays, where does its intelligence go? When perception and response cease, where do change and renewal come from? Who governs beginning and end? From this we see: being arises from nonbeing, reality from emptiness—this too is clear.\n\nTherefore, the nonbeing of nonbeing has no beginning and cannot be made to exist; the formless and soundless cannot be heard or seen. What receives nonbeing and bestows being cannot be spoken of. The Dao is the nonbeing of nonbeing, the beginning of the unbegun, the origin of the myriad things and the source of life—yet it has no name. The Dao is the emptiness of emptiness, and thus it gives birth to the One.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic and indistinct, arising yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling, yang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior. Without above or below, without left or right, it pervades without boundary—this is the warp and woof of the Dao. It embraces the formless and nameless, vast and boundless, indistinct and obscure, beyond reckoning, vanished from sound and color, incomparable. Point to it and it has no direction; grasp it and it is not there. Vast and inexhaustible, beyond discourse, it is a great unity, without end or beginning, the dwelling of the myriad things, the Great Beginning. Thus it is called the One.\n\nThe One, being empty, gives birth to the Two. The Two things arise together, wondrously subtle, begetting and abiding, transforming with things, fluid and formless, living and unceasing, radiant and dark, without direction or abode. It envelops heaven and earth, yet none see its origin. It cannot be pursued by sound or escaped by form—this is called spirit and light. What abides when things abide, vanishes when things vanish, beyond the reach of wisdom and strength, beyond the sway of awe and virtue—this is called the Two.\n\nThe Two, being the nonbeing of nonbeing, gives birth to the Three. The Three things arise together, indistinct and obscure. Look and its form is not seen; listen and its sound is not heard; grasp and its thread is not found; gaze and its gate is not seen. It cannot be measured or fathomed, dark and deep, vast and boundless. One clear, one turbid, they move with harmony—this is the beginning of heaven and humans. Before form appears, its roots lie in the One, its mandate in spirit—this is called the Three.\n\nThe Three, being nonbeing, gives birth to the myriad things. Clear and turbid divide, high and low are arrayed, yin and yang separate, harmony flows, the Three Luminaries move, the masses of beings live. What has form and can be followed, what has sound and color and can be seen and heard—these are called the myriad things.\n\nThe birth of the myriad things all originates in emptiness, begins in nonbeing. They turn from yin toward yang, return to softness and depart from hardness. Still and unmoving, the heart-mind does not stir, yet form and appearance are cultivated and vast, life and destiny flow freely—this is because they contain harmony and softness, and the Dao is formless.\n\nThus emptiness, nonbeing, formlessness, fewness, and softness are what heaven and earth arise from and what the myriad things are born of. These are what the common people despise, yet what kings and lords name themselves. They are the source and spring of the myriad things, the root of accomplishment.\n\nTherefore, worthy rulers and sage lords, in their most honored positions and with their vast power, dwell in solitude and lowliness, pursue what cannot be pursued, flee what cannot be fled. They make the great small, the secure humble, the joyful diminished. They emerge without trace, enter without sign. In movement, they precede fortune; in stillness, they anticipate misfortune. They act without action, attend without affairs, and the world is naturally ordered. They do not see, do not listen, embrace harmony in stillness. Spirit and light arise, form and appearance are naturally rectified. Advance and retreat follow constant patterns, their conduct unchanging. Their virtue transforms like wind, their governance reaches the masses. Heaven and earth assist them; the myriad things return to them.\n\nThe common people are not so. What they see and hear becomes their affliction. Seeing and hearing become afflictions, yet they cling to completed affairs, blind to unforeseen changes. They value hardness and strength, great power and imposing force. Their many tasks are ungoverned; their deep schemes weaken softness and sever fewness. Their movements oppose the Dao; their stillness clashes with heaven. Spirit and light scatter; turbidity arises. Affairs multiply; thoughts and plans are confused. They rejoice and rage without cause. Fortune leaves their gates; calamity enters their homes. Heaven’s net is cast—there is no escape.\n\nSuddenly, disaster strikes. Too late, they awaken, humbled in speech, lowly in conduct. As death approaches, they speak of goodness. Though they wish to reform and renew, they cannot return to fewness and spontaneity. They depart from the path of life, far and irrevocably. States are broken, families destroyed; misfortune reaches their descendants.\n\nThus the common people’s teachings turn foolishness into wisdom, weakness into strength, fewness into display, concealment into prominence. They abandon humility and pursue glory, contending and perishing for fame.\n\nThe sage’s teachings reverse this: they make the wise foolish, the honored humble, the prominent concealed, the many few, the strong weak. They discard the heart-mind, release intentions, strive for namelessness, knowing nothing, recognizing nothing, returning to the dark and obscure. Though their paths differ and their aims vary, some abide, some vanish.\n\nThus mighty Qin and great Chu, with their monopolies on power, perished. The divine Han, arising in harmony and compliance, flourished. Those who are strong depart from the Dao; those who are rigid leave spirit and light. Those who seek life through retreat may find lasting peace, but those who do not seek within themselves blame fate and resent heaven. The sage pities them and makes this his teaching. First, he writes it on bamboo and silk to clearly show later generations, that they may return to it throughout their lives and avoid its misfortunes.\n\n**The Utmost Softness**\n\nThe Dao is most numinous, and spirit and light serve it. Spirit is most bright, and Great Harmony submits to it. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, the utmost softness—formless, it envelops heaven and earth, contains yin and yang, orders the myriad things, and holds all in its warp and woof. Some dwell beyond the cosmos, some within heaven. Humans and things borrow it to live, yet none see or hear it. It is too fine to be named, too weak to be called. The sage preserves it in intention—it is a thing.\n\nThus it is named \"Utmost Softness\" and called \"Formless.\" Therefore, the formless thing does not rely on hardness to be hard, nor on strength to be strong. Thus it can outlast heaven and earth, dissolve bronze and iron, race like wind, gallop like lightning, traverse the extremes of sun and moon, circulate above and below, surpass the fleeting and transient, and soar securely, submerged in nothingness. How to prove this is so?\n\nSound arises from silence, yet cannot be exhausted; shadow arises from formlessness, yet cannot be bounded. Water, through its softness and weakness, penetrates metal and stone, sinks through the myriad things, and grounds the earth. Through softness and compliance, it accomplishes great works, surpassing grasses and trees. The tongue and ears suffer no harm, while horns and teeth break and injure. From this we see: softness outlasts hardness, emptiness outpaces solidity. These are not the creations of human effort, but the natural properties of things.\n\nThus, when a land is narrow, its people few, its troops scant, its food scarce, its intentions subtle, its desires restrained, and its spirit luminous in its vigilance—then it stands peer to heaven. It regards all things as its children; its virtue flourishes, its transformation is profound, its grace is deep, its blessings are abundant. Its officials are loyal, its soldiers are faithful, its lord is anxious for their burdens, its generals fear encumbering them. Though it accumulates softness and weakness, always lagging behind its people, bearing shame and humiliation, its state is deemed feminine and inferior among the feudal lords—yet they trust it as they would an infant. The world turns to it as if returning to father and mother. All beings share its desires; its prestige and power arise of themselves. The strong cannot oppress it, the wise cannot seize it. Through all reversals of fortune, shifts between strength and weakness, heaven and earth aid it, and the spirit luminaries assist it. When the time comes, it cannot be controlled—it becomes master of the world. Why is this so? Because it embodies the Dao’s softness and weakness, its subtlety and scarcity.\n\nThus, when a land is vast, its people numerous, its state wealthy, its troops strong, its officials bold, its soldiers fierce, its lord capable, its generals strict, its rewards heavy, its punishments severe, its punishments harsh, its laws exacting, its officials trembling as if before the ruler—then its power is convenient, its terrain advantageous, and it becomes a hegemon within the seas. It scorns its enemies, delights in war, and easily mobilizes its masses. Its armies unite, its tactics adapt, its strategies generate wonders. It bullies heaven and humiliates earth; the feudal lords submit, none daring to defy its commands. Its might shakes lands beyond its borders; it is ever a fierce predator, a source of worry for people and fear for all things. Its power moves heaven and earth, yet the Dao does not abide in it, the spirit luminaries are not with it, the masses are weak, and their hearts are not as one. The myriad people do not adhere to it; its body dies, its state perishes, its clan is annihilated, its defenses collapse. Why is this so? Because it embodies hardness and rigidity, and accumulates stinginess and greed.\n\nThe Dao, through the existence of non-existence, penetrates what has no gaps, roams where there is no principle, and illuminates the chambers of human effort. It purifies the abode of non-action, enters and exits without bounds, traverses without limits, passes through pearls and jade without leaving a trace. How to prove this is so?\n\nA sharp blade cannot enter where there is no principle; the spirit luminaries reside in the body, exiting without gaps and entering without openings. In the time it takes to look up and down, they traverse thousands of miles. From this we see: the achievements of human effort are abandoned and fruitless; the accomplishments of non-action are complete and endless. Heaven and earth are its creation, the myriad beings are its arising. The sound of sound is heard for a hundred miles; the sound of silence moves beyond heaven, shaking the four seas. The words that are spoken do not communicate across different kinds; the wordless words transform yin and yang, move heaven and earth, and resonate. Moreover, the Dao’s non-action brings heaven and earth to completion; heaven and earth’s silence sets the four seasons in motion. These two are the signs of the spirit luminaries, the proofs of the natural.\n\nThus, the sage empties the mind to fathom the Dao and virtue, stills the qi to preserve the spirit luminaries, reduces hearing to listen for the soundless, and abandons sight to see the formless. Observing the changes of heaven and earth, contemplating the spontaneity of the myriad things, he perceives that human effort is the source of chaos.\n\nNon-action is the origin of governance. Speech is the door to misfortune; silence is the gate to blessing. Therefore, he cuts off sagacity, discards wisdom, removes benevolence, and abandons righteousness. He arouses the mind of the Dao, raises the intention of virtue, follows the spirit, nurtures harmony, entrusts himself to heaven, serves earth, fulfills the duties of yin and yang, and gallops through the origins of chaos to sever things. He settles their place in the world, masters tranquility, and the myriad people are without trouble. He teaches with wordless words, transforms with untransforming transformation, and demonstrates with imageless images, guiding them to the profound and subtle. He veils the people’s emotions and desires, follows their nature and destiny, so they remain unknowing, live long, and see far. Thus, I am silent, and heaven and earth are without action; heaven and earth are without action, and the Dao and virtue are without action. These three arise together, advance in concert, and their harmonious qi overflows. Great peace flourishes, beings gather and dwell within the cosmos, and all is blended as one. The gates of misfortune are closed; the world is as innocent as a child, the age is without shame, no one sees fortune or misfortune, and thus ignorance naturally becomes great understanding. Families obtain the blessings of the spirit luminaries, and people achieve the merits of sagacity and wisdom. At this time, the ruler is like heaven and earth, the people like infants. They drink the ruler’s virtue, feed on his harmony; yang emerges, yin enters, and they contract and expand with the Dao. The lord and father are above, as if present, as if absent. The world is dazed and murmuring, not knowing, like nestlings. They live without joy, die without sorrow, their nature and destiny overflowing. None seek anything, yet the myriad blessings come of themselves. Why is this so? Because the lord of men does not speak, and the Dao is without action.\n\nThe pivot of non-action, the mechanism of silence, lies in essence and subtlety, abides in the spirit’s subtlety, begins in the spirit’s defense, and originates in the root of essence and subtlety. It arises without root or stem, enters and exits without gate, and constantly dwells between action and inaction, at the origin of harmonious timing. Thus, it can be heard but not made manifest, seen but not expounded, obtained but not transmitted, used but not spoken of. Grasping its handle and pushing it forward, condensing it to its essentials—this is easy for the wise to set forth, difficult for the shallow to hear. Why? Because it is vast and deep, and the many cannot reach it over time. It is lofty yet seems lowly, and the multitude cannot enter. It is bland and overflowing, yet the world cannot hear of it. It is profound and dark, yet the vulgar rulers cannot practice it.\n\n**Which is Closer: Name or Body?**\n\nWhat I receive as my nature to become myself is the Dao and virtue. What I borrow to live is the spirit luminaries. What I rely upon to complete myself is Great Harmony. What I entrust to take form is heaven and earth. These several things constitute me, yet I cannot constitute them.\n\nThus, nothing is more exalted than the Dao and virtue for modeling and emulation; nothing is loftier than the spirit luminaries for standards and exemplars; nothing is vaster than Great Harmony for manifesting clarity; nothing is greater than heaven and earth. The Dao and virtue, the spirit luminaries, constantly give life and do not die. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, transform endlessly. The Dao of heaven and earth persists and is difficult to destroy; the affairs of yin and yang move and are difficult to end. From this we see: misfortune culminates in death, blessing culminates in life.\n\nThus, the sage above fathoms the intention of the Dao and virtue, below measures the heart of heaven and earth. He honors the lofty, displays glory, and accumulates auspicious and flourishing virtue. His depth is vast, his greatness boundless; his honor and favor reach their utmost. Nothing is greater than life. The myriad things are arrayed, strange and wondrous treasures—gold, jade, pearls, and jade disks—are of deep and immense benefit. Nothing is greater than the body. The craftsmen of the world’s misfortunes, the artisans of the state’s chaos, those who cut off heaven and earth and harm my body—nothing is greater than these.\n\nThe name arises and yet must be guarded, lest it grow and overflow, bringing constraint to the people and poverty to the state, disturbing the clarity of spirit and mind. When the heart harbors many desires, it rebels against heaven and transgresses the Dao, striving to become a thief or bandit. The world then turns against it, and wars and strife multiply—one man’s ruin brings defeat to myriad nations, and the people perish while the myriad things suffer its poison. Nothing is greater than this.\n\nWealth is acquired by fate, yet its gain or loss may bring sickness or benefit. A name gained and wealth acquired: virtue does not dwell there, nor does the luminous power remain. The great command is thus cut off, and heaven cannot save it. To lose name and wealth is to lose virtue, to lose the luminous power is to lose assistance. A name that appears naturally brings wealth, and the harmony of heaven and earth is complete. Yet, petty names and great wealth cannot be compared to the Dao.\n\nTo slight the body while burdening the state is not to be contemplated; to seek profit is folly. The nameless name is the dwelling of my life, while the named name is the defense of my ruin. The wealthless wealth nurtures my blessings, and the wealth possessed is the thief that harms me. Therefore, those who deeply love their bodies exhaust themselves in building glorious names—acting, striving, laboring, and forcing their nature to harm their spirit. They hoard wealth daily, fearing excess and loss, yet when name and wealth both end, the luminous power cannot sustain life, nor can heaven and earth preserve the body.\n\nWhy is this so? The transformation of virtue and the measure of heaven and earth—one yin and one yang—divide into the four seasons, separate into the five forms, weave like a net, and set without gaps. The nature of all things has its own degree, never encroaching upon another. The heart of creation is harmonious and upright, just and equitable, without partiality or hatred, aligning with all things. It nourishes the deficient and supplements the lacking, reduces the excess and benefits the void. Those who lack are sustained, those with abundance are restrained; the greedy and presumptuous accumulate misfortune for themselves. The deficient never cease, and the desire for profit constantly arises, using cunning to deceive and strength to seize. Nature’s balance is thus overturned: names and wealth return to their rightful owner, and their loss brings sorrow, gain brings joy. One joy, one sorrow—soul and spirit float. When one fears sorrow and rejoices in gain, the luminous power departs. The body dies, the name vanishes, and calamity extends to descendants. Thus, names and wealth are like charcoal and ice—opposite in nature, yet their forces cannot coexist. When name ends and the body is exhausted, the world flourishes. Yet none in the world attain this. Therefore, they disturb the mind, entangle the will, ensnare the emotions, and exhaust the spirit, day and night pursuing affairs, adorning their words and actions, and fretting over the multitude. They establish deeds and strive for merit, exhausting their bodies to build glorious names—this is the way to harm the body while benefiting its ruin.\n\nThey strain their sinews, endure hunger and thirst, brave cold and heat, tread upon perilous paths, wear coarse garments, eat foul foods, and neglect their own comforts—morning and night they are exposed to shame and humiliation, their spirits driven and scattered, ceaselessly laboring. They defy the Dao and provoke calamity, often inviting danger to their bodies for the sake of wealth, while their luminous power is spent and their spirits perish. Misfortune comes of its own accord. Yet when defense and restraint are both achieved, this is true fortune. To seek fortune while abandoning it, to pursue profit while fleeing it—this is the way of failure and ruin. Thus, the affairs of success and defeat lie in whether one acts or not, and the Dao of life and death lies in whether one flees or follows.\n\nThose who know sufficiency align with the Dao and virtue, their names and profits extinguished. They establish themselves in the boundless and yet do not perish, nurture things without self-preservation, and exist with all things without self-assertion. Their harmony and trust are sufficient to sustain the spirit, and their domestic affairs are sufficient to complete the year. Always in accordance with nature, they cannot be slain. They dwell in the void and cannot be pierced, their petty names and great wealth cannot be sullied, and their desires do not desire—thus they endure in glory. Those who know cessation are esteemed as sovereigns, yet do not corrupt their wills; they dwell in poverty in caves and yet do not obscure their spirits. They advance without seeking display, retreat without seeking confinement. Neither misfortune nor fortune, neither gain nor loss, neither seeking nor avoiding—this is without guilt or merit, without pursuit or rejection. Like the vast sea or a great river, they rise without seeking prominence and recede without seeking obscurity. No calamity, no fortune, no gain, no loss—this is the way of the unerring and the boundless.\n\nWhy is this so? The subtle and profound, the all-encompassing and precise, the pure and tranquil—these are the true transformations. Without form or sound, their essence opens like the sun and closes like the moon, rising like earth and moving like heaven. The actions of the sage are vast and his virtue profound, yet he does not display himself. His benevolence and righteousness are not seen, his rituals and propriety are not established, and he does not engage in artificial deeds. Though he does not desire, heaven transforms of its own accord. His simplicity and sincerity are like an infant, not knowing what to seek or where to go. His use is inexhaustible, flowing without decay.\n\nHe does not till yet has food, does not weave yet has clothing. In heat, he rests in the naked; in cold, he stirs in the fur-lined. He has no taboos, dwelling with deer and wild beasts, his hair unbound, his breast filled—he wanders with them in ease. His virtue is abundant, his people prosperous, and his influence pervades all things without hindrance. His brilliance is unseen, yet he alone possesses the strange. Heaven and earth, all things—with him they transform together. He rides the void and bears the empty, wandering with the Dao, vast and boundless. He dwells in the utmost boundlessness—why is this so?\n\nThe straight yet appearing crooked,\nThe upright yet appearing awry—\nThe sovereign is the sound, the world its echo;\nThe sovereign is the form, the world its shadow.\nThus without ancestral rites, the heart of Heaven is harmonized;\nWithout descending the throne, the Four Seas are rectified.\nHence it is said:\nGreat skill appears as clumsiness,\nThe Way of Heaven is naturally humble.\nWithout calendars, yin and yang harmonize;\nWithout fixed seasons, the Four Times align.\nWithout laws, the world is at ease;\nWithout rewards or punishments, names and realities are attained.\nHidden martial prowess and concealed might—\nThere is nothing it cannot conquer.\nAbandoning warfare, it conquers without battle;\nWithout orders, the people self-regulate.\nWithout ritual adornments, the world is self-illuminated;\nWithout seals and insignia, the world is self-trusting.\nWithout measures, all things self-balance.\nThus though victorious, it seems to yield;\nThough gaining, it seems to defend.\nWithout bells and drums, the people find joy;\nWithout the five flavors, the people find food sweet;\nWithout ceremonial dress, the people find adornment pleasing;\nWithout hoarded wealth, the people abound.\nWhy is this so?\nIt follows the Dao, entrusts to Heaven,\nAnd does not contrive with knowledge—\nThus the people act naturally.\n\nThe Way of Heaven and Earth:\nAdvancing and retreating, all things are completed.\nTransformation is unobstructed, bending and stretching unbarred.\nThus when yin reaches its peak—\nThe earth splits, ice congeals,\nCold winds howl, frost and snow descend,\nFish and turtles burrow deep,\nAll things curl in upon themselves.\nAt such times, even in heated chambers,\nBeside braziers, in fur-lined robes,\nOne cannot ward off the chill.\n\nWhen yang reaches its peak—\nSand is seared, stones crack,\nBirds flee, waters dry,\nCreatures wither, rivers vanish.\nAt such times, even in cool springs,\nIn light garments, in high pavilions,\nOne cannot endure the heat.\n\nYet when the mind is settled, the spirit refined,\nThe body labored, the form exhausted—\nThen the logic drains, sweat flows,\nClothing is cast aside, one steps outside—\nWarmth suffices the body.\n\nWhen the heart is released, the will dissolved,\nThe spirit entrusted to emptiness,\nThe form at ease beyond the Four Seas,\nThe will wandering where nothing exists—\nThen the mind is level, the qi harmonious,\nCoolness suffices the body.\n\nKnowledge, then, is the art of governance—\nTo nurture the people, cultivate the masses,\nExtend virtue, harmonize Heaven and Earth,\nAlign with yin and yang.\nYet when disorder arises—\nIt emerges from the formless, begins from the inaudible.\nPolitics unfurls like silk, transformation shifts like water.\nTo grasp the people is like grasping dampness;\nTo reach the people is like reaching shadow.\nThus, the more one governs, the more disorder grows;\nThe more one restrains, the more troublesome it becomes.\nThe wise cannot comprehend it;\nHarsh punishments cannot suppress it.\nYet the ruler of *wuwei* is the ruler of action,\nAnd the master of success.\n\nThe origin of governance and transformation—\nThe rest is like subduing heat with stillness,\nOr dispelling cold with agitation.\n\nThus the Sage discards knowledge, abandons deliberation,\nEmpties the heart, focuses the qi,\nClears and stills, responding to Heaven’s intent,\nFollowing Earth’s design.\nGovernance moves, transformation flows,\nLike sunlight’s radiance.\nDisorder dissipates like clouds dispersing;\nThe world mirrors it without end,\nAll things take it as their teacher,\nServe it without reservation.\n\nWhen the Way prevails in the world—\nLife hangs by the sovereign’s command,\nThe sovereign’s standing hangs by the people.\nIf the sovereign follows the Dao,\nThen the myriad people flourish.\nIf the sovereign loses the Dao,\nThen the myriad people resist.\nWhen the people flourish, ancestral temples shine;\nWhen the people resist, ancestral temples crumble.\nThus the sovereign is the people’s source,\nThe people are the sovereign’s root.\nIf the root is injured, flowers and fruit do not grow;\nIf the source decays, the flow does not fill.\nAbove and below preserve each other—\nThus they endure.\n\nHence when the sovereign follows the Dao,\nThe realm is undisturbed,\nThe feudal lords submit in homage,\nThe barbarian tribes rejoice,\nThe Four Seas align in wind.\nWeapons are not raised,\nThe fierce have none to emulate,\nThe bold have no field to display their strength,\nThe clever till by favor,\nSteeds and chariots labor in ease.\nThe world is at rest, each pursuing their work,\nCustoms are sincere, the people simple,\nAll weave as one, all till as one,\nHeaven’s heart is harmonized,\nAll things flourish in abundance,\nAuspicious omens descend in succession,\nFortunate signs gather—\nNot Heaven’s bestowal, but the sovereign’s virtue and power.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven loses the Dao,\nThe feudal lords do not pay homage,\nValleys differ, laws conflict,\nThe Four Quarters rebel,\nThe strong oppress the weak,\nWeapons clash for dominance.\nThus the world’s warriors sharpen blades,\nKindle beacon fires on all sides,\nDeep deceits and grand treacheries hatch in the ancestral halls,\nStrategies unfold, alliances form,\nLight cavalry scouts the enemy,\nSoldiers march to battle,\nYear after year, none return.\nAt such times,\nWarhorses are groomed without respite,\nFamilies flee to the borders,\nThe common folk eat coarse grains,\nGreedy officials sit as ministers,\nServants turn to bandits,\nThe people are exhausted, resources depleted,\nLabor never ceases.\nThey long for home, hearts aching,\nPining for parents—\nTears flow abroad,\nLoving fathers, kind mothers,\nTheir hearts shattered, their spirits broken.\nSoldiers’ heads are crushed, their bones exposed,\nScattered across the wilderness—\nCountless in number.\nThe roads are filled with orphaned children,\nWailing, leaping to their feet in grief.\nWhat crime has Heaven committed\nThat this calamity befalls them?\nWidows have no husbands,\nOrphans no fathers.\nTheir sorrow and rage gather unplanned—\nThe strong lead, the middle follow,\nAbove and below defend themselves,\nInner and outer guard each other.\nThough not bound by blood,\nThey rally like brothers,\nRaising banners, digging trenches,\nMarching in formation.\nTheir resolve is absolute,\nTheir spirits converge,\nTheir qi moves in unison.\nThus Heaven and Earth are constrained,\nYin and yang blocked,\nStars and constellations in disarray,\nThe sun and moon eclipsed,\nDeceit and rebellion sprout,\nDisasters and omens erupt—\nNot Heaven’s punishment,\nBut the sovereign’s loss of the Dao.\n\nTo inherit the great mandate of Heaven,\nTo succeed the ancient Sages,\nNoble as the Son of Heaven,\nRich with the Four Seas,\nHonored beyond compare—\nYet in coarse robes, the world calls it good;\nEating vegetables and millet gruel, the world calls it sweet.\nTo transform the age, shift customs—\nLike grass bending in the wind,\nLike fish drawn to water.\nYet not to uphold the Dao,\nNot to broaden virtue,\nNot to refine the self,\nNot to rectify one’s conduct,\nNot to labor for the people,\nTo neglect ancestral rites,\nTo dim the glory of forefathers,\nTo pass on no legacy to descendants—\nTo contend with spirits,\nTo rival Heaven and Earth,\nTo seek fame and power without end,\nTo defy Heaven, oppose Earth—\nThere is none it does not insult.\nThus the unworthy rise in rebellion,\nLightly entering, deeply striking,\nArriving first to claim victory,\nThe distant enemy unopposed.\nParties split, alliances fracture,\nInner and outer severed.\nRelying on nothing,\nThe state collapses, the ancestral temples crumble.\nThis is not the people’s fault—\nIt is the sovereign’s desire.\n\nThus, when authority, prestige, and favor reach their utmost and the people above are renowned with glory covering the land yet remain insatiable, they become the instruments of disaster and the great fate of ruin.\n\nThe Dao and virtue, divine and transformative, refine and alter—when one attains them, they become the safeguard of humanity, harmonizing spirit and form, making movement effortless and senses keen. The eyes perceive brilliance in the boundless realm, the ears listen to the patterns of Heaven and Earth, observing natural laws above and the gains and losses of antiquity below. They draw water from wells, till fields for sustenance, take wives, bear children, and fulfill their allotted span—this is true sufficiency. How much more so for the sovereign of ten thousand chariots or the lord of a thousand? It is clear they cannot find sufficiency in this.\n\nThus, it does not lie in the Dao.\n\nWhen greed arises, desiring others’ lands, coveting their wealth and treasures, merging and accumulating without end, they invite calamity and incur the greatest blame.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, no living creature—whether soaring bird, running beast, or breathing thing—has failed to seek what sustains its life. Therefore, to dwell as a sovereign is to dwell in peril; to rule like a tiger is to set traps. Fame rests above the clouds, yet the body lies beneath the Yellow Springs. Those who occupy the station of oxen and horses suffer no worse than oxen and horses; those who take their place among dogs and sheep face no greater fault. Hence, those who embody the Dao steady their hearts in sufficiency, rest their intentions in stillness, abandon authority, and dwell alone in solitude, discarding all things while holding only to the divine. They preserve their bodies and honor their names without peril, and all under Heaven submit to them without resistance—none dare oppose them without leaving their doors.\n\nThe Dao and virtue transform and refine, nurturing the original essence, receiving life and spirit. In the boundless void, in the dark and formless, all things merge into chaos. Then divine clarity separates purity from turbidity, and the Great Harmony flows. In the vast and minute, all things take shape. Heaven is round, Earth is square; humans stand upright, beasts move horizontally; grasses and trees take root, fish sink, birds fly—each kind is distinct, each group divided, and ranks are established. Thus, the *ji-fang* arises.\n\nFrom this, it is seen that Heaven, Earth, and all beings share the same origin, stem from one source. Within the six directions and beyond the cosmos, they are interconnected as one body. Qi and transformation divide and spread, horizontally and vertically, split into two, divided into five—into white and black, water and fire, sour and bitter, or feathered and winged. Among humans, male and female. All these, though differing in form and region, share the same origin, the same nature, the same heart and intent. How so?\n\nZhuangzi said: Within a single body, father and mother give life to the four limbs and nine orifices, each with its distinct function. The five viscera and six bowels each receive their allotted essence. Above and below do not know each other; inner and outer do not see each other. The head and feet are like Heaven and Earth; the elbows and knees like the four seas; the liver and gallbladder like the Hu and Yue; the eyebrows and eyes like Qi and Chu. If they did not differ in origin, how could they vary in form? If they did not differ in form, how could they not rely on one another in motion or rest?\n\nAbove the nine heavens and below the Yellow Springs, this cannot be fully described. Yet if the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk; if the chest is sick, the mouth cannot speak. When the heart finds ease, the ears grow sharp, the eyes clear, limbs flexible, and every joint light and agile—this is because of their shared form.\n\nWhen human movement stirs nearby, distant beings respond; when beings act here, Heaven and Earth respond there. Self and other resonate, entering and exiting without gates, coming and going without doors. Within the vast emptiness of Heaven and Earth, all things respond without fail—this is because they share the same body.\n\nThus, the sage does not leave the home to understand parents, nor the family to know descendants. They perceive danger and safety, gain and loss, life and death. They discern right and wrong, grasp the roots of advantage and harm, and comprehend the origins of order and chaos. They know the self to know the family, the family to know others, and thus grasp the threads of affairs and the patterns of things. They move knowing their path, remain knowing their guard.\n\nThe Dao is father, divine clarity is mother, stillness is teacher, Great Harmony is friend, the world is home, and all things are body. To regard others as oneself, and oneself as others—no thought dares arise, no intention dares act. They abandon knowledge, sever awareness, and extinguish the three five, yet nothing is undone. They dwell in caves, wear rough garments, do not kill, do not eat living things, do not pluck unripe plants, do not wear incomplete fabrics, and do not cut what is not yet grown. Heaven, Earth, and all beings each preserve their own.\n\nTo know the origin before its manifestation, the source of life and spirit, the beginning of blood and qi, the foundation of form—this is to recognize that the real arises from the void, the existent from the nonexistent. The small does not fail to enter the great; the great does not fail to contain the small.\n\nThe origin of my life lies in the Dao, nurtured yet unborn, forming shape only upon emerging from obscurity. To perceive the profound subtleties, the gentle yet resilient, the smooth yet vast—this is the great harmony.\n\nThe unknowing, the unthinking, the doing-nothing, the effortless—these yield the greatest deeds. To regard myself as an infant, growing to maturity, knowing softness giving rise to hardness, weakness to strength, smallness to greatness, shortness to length, foolishness to wisdom, obscurity to clarity—this is to observe the transformations of life.\n\nTo examine my breathing, my bending and stretching, to know that loss brings gain, that gain brings loss, that progress is retreat, that retreat is progress, that root is blessing, that blessing is ruin, that ruin is blessing, that first is last—this is to perceive the great function of stillness, emptiness, and non-action.\n\nThe four limbs and nine orifices pursue their tasks, their abilities diverse, their forms distinct—all originate from one heart. Thus, the myriad transformations of advantage and harm among all things arise from the master’s deliberation. Heaven and Earth verify this from ancient times to now; motion never contradicts itself. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete in me.\n\nTherefore, the family is the root from which to know humanity; the body is the wellspring from which to know Heaven. To observe Heaven without the body, to know humanity without the family—this is to see the near while missing the far, to know the small while losing the great. To leave the home and not see the world, to abandon the body and peer through windows, is to fail to grasp the Dao of Heaven. The farther one wanders, the more confused they become; the more they seek, the greater their delusion. The more they pursue fame and gain, the smaller their true function grows. They do not see, they do not hear—yet they seek it in themselves. At the juncture of Heaven and humanity, the great Dao is complete.\n\nThus, the sage does not perceive the likes and dislikes of a single family yet commands the affairs of ten thousand households. They do not undertake a thousand-li journey yet alter the transformations of the nine regions. Their feet do not ascend to Heaven, yet they know the heart of the nine heavens. Their bodies do not enter the Earth, yet they perceive the changes of the nine depths. The advance and retreat of yin and yang, the shifts of the four seasons, the profound and hidden—nothing escapes them. How so? They discern the inner to know the outer, the small to know the great, the self to know others, the near to illuminate the far.\n\nThe sage as ruler is like the heart to the body, the body to the self.\nThey do not know of the Dao to rely upon, nor do they wish to conform to Heaven’s will.\nThey act without action to guide the world, without affairs to nurture the people.\nSilent and tranquil, they let transformation unfold naturally—\ntheir stillness aligns with the divine, their motion with all things.\nWhen they move, they respond in harmony; when they rest, they preserve in stillness.\nEmpty and boundless, they let things arise effortlessly—\nthe Dao’s transformation is fluid and unrestrained,\nvast and formless, like the boundless void.\nObserve it, and it is unseen; listen to it, and it is unheard.\nIts guidance and instruction pervade all things without fail.\nWhen their work is done, they withdraw without regret.\nThey act without action as the root of all things—\nthus, the unknown is the origin of knowledge,\nthe uninstructed is the source of teaching.\nThey act without action as the beginning of all action,\nwithout affairs as the foundation of all affairs.\nAll these things are the divine’s reliance,\nHeaven and Earth’s return,\nthe sage’s Dao,\nand the transmission of the virtuous and refined.\n\nWhen benevolence and righteousness are shallow,\nand life’s essence is not true,\none fails to grasp the great Dao.\nThey follow their own desires and sink into ignorance,\ngradually drowning in love and affection,\ntheir thoughts entangled in endless schemes.\nThey seek what is contrary to the ears,\nand their grand theories clash with the heart—\nthis is not the Dao.\nThey exalt knowledge and prize renown,\nthus their arts and strategies multiply:\nthey compile words and compose texts,\nentrusting them to books to teach the myriad people.\nThey divide the world with rules and rites,\njudge human affairs with laws and prohibitions,\nabandon ancestral simplicity,\nand invent falsehoods to shift customs.\nThey rectify what is crooked and alter what is proper,\nmaking all things manifest—\nbells and drums, zithers and se,\nflutes and shengs,\nascending and descending,\nadvancing and retreating,\nadorned with symbols,\nsoaring in ceremony.\nThree hundred rites and three thousand threats,\ntheir divisions and rivalries flourish—\nthey twist words to argue,\ndefeat others with cleverness,\nand stir endless strife.\nYet the more they do, the more it spirals without end.\nWhy so? They embellish words to serve their ambitions.\nThus, the sage abandons benevolence and righteousness,\nreturning to the great Dao.\nThey sever wisdom and discard instruction,\nseeking it within themselves.\nTheir words are daily vigilance,\ntheir deeds ever few.\nThey extinguish and annihilate without ceasing,\nday and night,\nenveloping all in the great silence\nso that the people have no shame.\nThey abolish falsehoods and prevent affairs,\nand the world naturally aligns.\nThey diminish what harms them,\nmaking others aware without resistance,\npreserving their spirit\nand holding fast to the essence of virtue and power.\nThey are not the master of affairs,\nnor the teacher of wisdom,\nbut in stillness, as if no one exists,\nthey attain harmony with the Dao.\nHeaven and Earth act without action,\nand all creatures follow in order.\nAll things conform to their nature,\nand the myriad peoples unite with virtue and power.\nWhy so? The ruler has no fixed decrees,\nand the people have no fixed words.\nThus, to take the world,\none must always be without affairs.\nTo speak of strategy,\none must act without action and teach without instruction—\nthis is the treasure of the unknown.\nTo know what is essential,\none must follow the Dao without fail.\nTo observe the heights of Heaven,\nto fathom the depths of Earth,\nto understand the division of yin and yang,\nand to grasp the order of all things—\nto see stars by day and fish by night,\nto harmonize with the eight winds,\nto lead the creatures by their fur—\nthis is the limit of thought and reflection,\nyet it profits nothing in preserving life.\nA hundred Meng Jins and a thousand Xia Yūs\nmay display their might,\ncommanding armies to advance like radiant light\nor retreat like drifting clouds,\nstriking like thunder and lightning—\nyet they remain as still as yin.\nThis is the peak of strength,\nyet it profits nothing in victory.\nTo make the people of the land all grasp the rites,\nto easily spread poetry and books,\nto clarify laws and compare knowledge,\nto issue decrees and orders—\na household has its official,\na village its overseer,\na township its granary,\na district its watchtower—\nall keenly examined and balanced—\nthis is the height of martial prowess,\nyet it profits nothing in governance.\nThus, the world is driven toward chaos.\nThe sage’s heart is without constancy.\n\nThe Dao is formless, yet it reigns over all under Heaven—\nthis is the heart that is without heart.\nHeaven and Earth act without action, yet all creatures obey—\nthis is the thought that is without thought.\nThus, the heart without heart is the master of the heart,\nthe use without use is the mother of all use.\nFrom this we see:\nthe heart that is without heart is the master of the heart,\nthe use without use is the mother of all use.\n\nThe Way by which it is illuminated—Zhuangzi said: *\"What I am by virtue of being myself, am I myself?*\nThe self by which I am my body is not the body itself.\nThe body by which it is its body is because I exist within it.\nBut what I am by virtue of being myself is because of the numinous presence within me.\nThe numinous presence abides in me because the Dao wills it so.\nTo entrust oneself to the Dao’s method and preserve the numinous presence—\nclarity and purity are its constant,\nemptiness and stillness are its essence.\nThis is not something the heart or mind can achieve,\nnor is it something thought or deliberation can accomplish.\n\nThus, the wise person’s dwelling:\nears and eyes seeing and hearing,\nheart and mind thinking and deliberating,\ndrinking and eating at proper times,\nexhausting all paths, devising all strategies,\ndetermining the beginnings of safety and peril,\ndiscerning paths of approach and retreat—\nall to preserve the body and prolong life.\nYet if so, then the spirit is diminished,\nthe vital essence is exhausted,\nthe soul and vital breath depart,\nand life is cut short.\nWhen one sleeps, the heart and mind are inactive,\nthe senses are obscured,\nno thought or deliberation occurs,\nno eating or drinking takes place,\nthe spirit harmonizes,\nthe vital essence revives,\nthe heart finds its ease,\nthe body knows no ailments,\nthe soul avoids harm,\ngreat wounds heal,\nthe bones mend,\nall orifices receive what they desire.\n\nIf one abandons the heart, peril becomes safety;\nif one employs the heart, security becomes ruin.\nHow much more so for one who upholds the Dao and virtue,\nfollows the numinous,\nconforms to Heaven’s intent,\nand nurtures all beings?\n\nThus, the sage establishes the body without body,\nembraces the heart without heart,\npossesses the having of non-being,\nand abides in the existence of non-existence.\nAbove, he contains the transformation of Dao and virtue;\nbelow, he encompasses the hearts of all people.\nHe harbors neither evil nor good,\nneither love nor hatred.\nHe does not make enemies of the wicked,\nnor allies of the virtuous,\nnor conspire with the sincere,\nnor harbor grudges against the deceitful.\nHe bears all as the earth bears,\ncovers all as Heaven covers,\nilluminates all as the sun illuminates,\ntransforms all as the numinous transforms.\nGreat or small, he views all as his own body.\nHe acts without governance,\nand none are left ungoverned.\nHe cuts off calamity at its root,\nnurtures blessings at their origin,\nremoves his own desires,\nand takes what the people find ease in.\nHe removes his own cleverness,\nand returns to natural spontaneity.\nHe moves them with harmony,\nguides them with effortlessness.\nAbove, he contains the intent of Dao and virtue;\nbelow, he obtains the heart of the numinous.\nHis light stirs Heaven and Earth,\nhis virtue connects all people.\nWithin the four seas, no orders are given—\nyet all transform their hearts.\nThe good become utterly good,\never deepening in clarity.\nThe evil change their nature,\ngradually becoming harmonious.\nThe faithful become utterly faithful,\nreaching beyond self.\nThe deceitful change their nature,\ndaily approaching sincerity.\nThe wicked turn to goodness,\nthe perverse return to truth.\nGood and evil, faith and doubt—\nall return to their natural state.\nAt this time, the muddy merges with the boundless void,\nthe submerged are immersed in perfect harmony.\nThe people forget their hearts and minds,\ndrift like the boundless,\nlose their sense of good and evil,\nand obtain what they seek.\nThey move with Heaven,\nthey flow with the Dao.\nNot forced to abandon evil,\nnot constrained to preserve good—\neffortless action brings transformation,\nyet none know how it happens.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe ruler’s transformation is like the void,\nquiet and still,\nlike a withered tree,\nhis heart like a gourd,\nhis will like the ocean,\nhis actions like a stream,\nnot distinguishing east and west,\nnot distinguishing south and north,\nnot discerning sweet and bitter,\nnot favoring black or white,\nnot aligning with square or round,\nnot fixing crooked or straight.\nHe is subtle in his profundity,\npractices self-effacement,\nharmonizes with all things,\nfloats without limit,\nabandons his own desires,\nand attains what Heaven desires.\nAll things, in their myriad forms, enter his ears and eyes.\nThe ruler’s effortlessness is like a guest in Heaven and Earth—\nHeaven and Earth as the furnace,\nGreat Harmony as the bellows,\nthe numinous as the wind,\nall things as the metal,\nvirtue as the great artisan,\nthe Dao as the work.\nThe world, verdant and lush, is without fail nourished.\nThus, he molds the hearts of the people,\ntransforms the customs of the age.\nAbove, he encompasses all without exception;\nbelow, he accomplishes all without failure.\nHe fulfills all things with measured response,\nstirs all beings to reverence,\nand shakes the eight extremes.\nThe world, vast and indistinct,\ndoes not recognize good or evil,\nyet follows naturally.\nThe subtle and profound,\nthe obscure and formless—\nthey spontaneously establish their own patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: \"On Life and Death\"**\n\nDao and virtue are clear and luminous,\nimpurity and purity are one in Great Harmony,\nand this is their essence.\nAll things take form as their dwelling place—\nshining and flourishing, yet unseen in their names.\nThis is the thing called *generation*—\nneither yin nor yang,\nimmeasurable and boundless,\ntoo profound to be weighed,\ntoo subtle to be named.\nIts radiance is indistinct,\nits form is indistinct,\nits sound is indistinct,\nits image is indistinct.\nIts motion and stillness have no fixed pattern;\nit wanders in the void and stillness,\ndwells in the realm of non-existence.\nThose who attain it live;\nthose who lose it die.\n\nThe form’s generation is by the numinous,\nits vitality by the vital essence,\nits roots by the spirit,\nits vitality by the vital breath,\nits chambers by the nine orifices,\nits senses by clarity and insight,\nits desires by the heart and mind,\nits soul and vital breath as attendants,\nits blood and qi as soldiers.\nAdvancing with the Dao, retreating with virtue,\nexpanding and contracting, soaring and resting,\nyielding and firm—\nbending and stretching with the times,\nlight as death’s companion,\nheavy as life’s enemy.\nIf there is no benefit, it cannot be retained;\nif there is use, it cannot be abandoned.\nThus, non-action is the dwelling of life,\nand action is the house of death.\n\nTo stand is to abandon the body;\nto sit is to forget the heart.\nSerene as an infant,\nresting as formlessness—\nnot seeing, not hearing, not acting, not speaking—\ntransformation and response,\nmotion and stillness without constancy—\nwith Dao in descent and ascent,\nwith virtue in floating and sinking,\nwith the numinous in merging,\nwith Harmony in embodiment—\nbending and stretching without degradation,\nnot prized as a thing,\nnot honored as a person,\ndiffering from kings and nobles in benefit,\ndiffering from the common folk in suffering.\nLife and death are one,\nthus no distinction is made between existence and non-existence.\nThis is the non-action of self-cultivation.\n\nSpring grows, summer flourishes, autumn harvests, winter stores—\nthis is the law of the sovereign,\nconforming to Heaven’s command.\nWithin, he cherishes parents;\nwithout, he severs fame and gain.\nHe does not think, does not deliberate,\ndoes not act, does not seek.\nAlone he goes, alone he returns,\nhis body in harmony,\nhis nature following effortlessly.\nHe yields in speech to others,\ndoes not contend with the times.\nThis is the non-action of governing the family.\n\nHe venerates Heaven, respects Earth,\ndares not forget the ancestors,\nfirst cultivates himself,\nrectifies the laws,\nabandons self-interest,\ntrusts in reality,\ndetermines names,\nfollows things,\nharmonizes the numinous,\ncoordinates left and right,\nconnects front and back,\nfollows the times,\nconforms to principle,\nbends to what is fitting—\nall things act in concert,\nreturning to their natural state.\nThis is the non-action of governing the state.\n\nCrowned with the formless,\ncloaked in the void,\nembracing emptiness,\nwalking the Great Clarity,\nbearing Dao and virtue,\nfloating in the numinous,\ngrasping Great Harmony,\ndriving Heaven and Earth,\ngalloping yin and yang,\nranging the Five Phases,\nfollowing all things,\nwandering the subtle and profound—\nthis is his domain.\n\nThe Way of Nurturing Life\n\n**The Way of Non-Action in Governing the World**\nWithout merit, without name—\nthis is the non-action of governing the world.\n\n**The Way of Action in Nurturing the Self**\nGreedy for life, for profit, for longevity,\nfearing not to obtain—\nconcealing the heart, sealing the mind,\nclosing ears and eyes,\nguiding limbs, stretching steps,\nmoving joints, grasping fingers,\nexhaling the old, inhaling the new,\nbreathing in the Five Stars,\neating the sun and moon,\nbody and spirit acting in unison,\nnever resting—\nthis is the action of nurturing the self.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the Family**\nNeglecting Heaven’s timing,\nrelying solely on human effort,\ndespising the strong to seek the weak,\ndespising the poor to seek the rich,\nhungering for fame, thirsting for power,\nthe heart ever burdened with seeking—\nclothing, food, extravagance, excess,\noverindulgence in affairs—\nthis is the action of governing the family.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the State**\nEnriching the nation, expanding its lands,\nlightly waging war, delighting in arms,\nestablishing threats, displaying prestige,\nerecting boundaries, making one’s name resound,\nelevating status, sharpening laws,\nharsh punishments, severe penalties,\nstraightforward and deep,\nnet-like and cruel,\nfew mercies—\nthe lords fear and tremble,\nconstantly striving to be the foremost,\nthe strong seeking to be the great,\nthe great seeking to be the king—\nthis is the action of governing the state.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the World**\nHonoring ancestors, filial piety, fraternal duty,\ncultivating benevolence and righteousness,\nrefining rites, adorning moral teachings,\nadjusting flavors and colors to please the people,\nusing bells and chimes, qin and se,\nto harmonize their wills—\nthe ruler speaks, the ministers listen,\nthe ruler acts, the ministers follow,\ndisplaying merit, enforcing laws,\nopening with benevolence, issuing grand commands,\nmaking one’s reputation shine—\nthe people cling in devotion,\nall affairs entrusted to the sovereign,\nall directions look to the court—\nthis is the action of governing the world.\n\n**Thus, the Way of Non-Action:**\nEmpty, tranquil, subtle, few, yielding, lowly, modest,\ntimely, frugal, plain—\nthese thirteen are the companions of life.\nGreed, turmoil, arrogance, excess, extravagance, waste—\nthese thirteen are the companions of death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe Sage’s Way—\nin motion, it follows;\nin stillness, it responds.\nThe four limbs, the nine orifices—\nthese thirteen are the external tools of life and death.\nThe affairs of emptiness and fullness,\nthe shifts of hardness and softness—\nthese are the inner numbers of life and death.\n\nThus, with the thirteen,\nthe empty gives birth to the full,\nthe full returns to emptiness—\neternally preserved.\nClarity brings sharpness,\nstillness brings insight,\nsubtlety gives rise to prominence,\nfewness generates multitude,\nsoftness generates strength,\nweakness generates firmness,\nlowliness generates height,\nfrugality generates abundance,\ntimeliness brings harmony,\nharmony achieves balance,\nfrugality ensures sufficiency—\nthis is called *beneficial life*.\n\nTo practice this Way,\nalign with Heaven and Earth,\nnurturing the self as the foundation,\ngoverning the state as the extension—\nthough one may wish otherwise,\nNature’s transformation will not obey.\nThe full gives birth to emptiness,\nthe real returns to the void.\nThe turbid listens to the clear,\nthe chaotic submits to stillness,\nthe prominent reverts to subtlety,\nthe multitude dissolves into fewness,\nthe hard yields to softness,\nthe strong bends to weakness,\nthe high descends to low,\nthe full empties itself—\nexcess closes the path,\nextravagance brings ruin,\nwaste invites disaster—\nthese are all inauspicious.\n\nTo act thus,\nmoving toward exhaustion,\nharming the self,\ndisrupting the state—\nthough one may wish otherwise,\nHeaven and Earth will not comply.\nAll things are born and nurtured,\nyet their growth knows no end.\nAll beings are cherished,\nyet their love knows no limit.\nAction leads to striving,\nconstant scheming—\nthus abandoning emptiness for fullness,\nrejecting the void for substance,\nturning from stillness to turmoil,\ntransforming defense into display,\nchanging fewness into multitude,\nseparating softness from hardness,\ndiscarding weakness for strength,\nlowering the low to raise the high,\nforsaking moderation for excess—\nusing action to eliminate frugality,\nspending to deplete—\nwhy is this so?\nBecause one has forgotten the Way of Life.\n\nThus, the practitioner of nurturing life\nstands apart, vast and detached,\nlofty and distant,\nunbound by convention,\nunshackled by the world,\nreducing form to boundlessness,\nwandering the spirit in the formless,\nneither seeking life as gain\nnor death as harm.\nTo all things, great or small,\nthey extend equal care—\nno hatred, no favor.\nSpirit and vitality flourish,\nfortune and virtue align.\nThe Way is central,\nits light radiant.\nNatural transformations respond in kind—\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\ncannot defeat it.\nWalking on land, tigers and rhinos cannot harm,\nentering battle, no weapon can wound.\nNo force can overcome it,\nno strategy can subdue it—\nnot because it resists,\nbut because harm’s intent is already absent within.\nWhy is this so?\nSounds resonate in response,\nthings follow their nature—\nrhinos and tigers do not strike the formless,\nweapons do not pierce the void.\nThe practitioner of nurturing life\nhas extinguished the heart of harm within,\nand thus the form of death vanishes without.\n\n**The Chapter on the Generation of the Way**\nThe arts of the Sage and the Wise\ndo not descend from Heaven,\nnor arise from Earth—\nthey reside within the self,\nthey manifest in things.\nGuided by Nature,\nthey permeate all.\nFollowing patterns, embodying symbols,\nthey exhaust nothing.\nThus, the Way is empty,\nvirtue is without loss.\nHeaven is honored, Earth is lowly—\ntheir rhythms are not defied.\nHow so?\nWith knowledge, there is no origin;\nby human recognition, things reveal themselves.\nThe unseen generates the seen,\nthe void gives birth to the real.\nDefense becomes visible,\nthe subtle becomes manifest.\nBeginning and end—\nnone of this is contrived.\nNature’s work is effortless.\nThe Sage follows it,\nharmonizing with Heaven’s completeness.\nThus, knowing the Way through the boundless void,\none receives all things.\nKnowing virtue through the utmost nothingness,\none fulfills all things.\nThe Way acts through non-action,\nranking all under Heaven without precedence.\nVirtue acts through non-establishment,\ncompleting all forms without interference.\nThus, one can refine nature and life,\nmelt emotions and intentions,\nshape will and desire—\nhow does one define *nature and life*?\nThey are what the Way endows,\nforming body and shape.\nAll things differ in nature—\npeople, male and female,\nSages and fools,\nbrave and timid,\ngreat and small,\ntall and short,\nrenowned and obscure,\ngenerous and stingy,\nstrong and weak,\nlight and heavy,\nsound and color,\nform and substance,\nrefined and coarse,\nhigh and low—\nthis is called *nature*.\nWhat virtue bestows—\nwealth and poverty,\nnobility and humility,\nlongevity and early death,\npleasure and suffering—\nwhether one’s fate is fixed or not—\nthis is called *Heaven’s command*.\nEncounters with rulers, parents,\nHeaven and Earth’s movements—\nwhether auspicious or inauspicious,\nlife or death—\nthis is called *encountering fate*.\nAll things arrayed before me,\nI choose—\nactions, decisions, abandonment, adoption,\ntaking or leaving,\ndisaster or blessing—\nthis is called *following fate*.\n\nFrom nature, one acts;\nin contact with things, one responds—\nlove, hate, joy, anger,\nfear, surprise, grief, delight—\nthis is called *emotion*.\nFrom fate, one thinks;\ngenerating plans, resolving dangers,\nclarifying right and wrong,\ndistinguishing same and different—\nthis is called *intention*.\nFrom emotion, intention moves outward,\nconnecting with things,\never drawn to what pleases,\nsummoning fortune or misfortune,\nachieving fame or ruin—\nthis is called *will*.\nFollowing nature and fate,\nadapting emotion and intention,\nentangled in the myriad things,\nbound and difficult to untangle—\nthis is called *desire*.\n\nThese six—\nall originate from the Way and virtue,\nendless in their transformations.\nOnly those who hear of the Way and virtue\ncan follow their patterns.\nThus, if nature is refined and life is elevated,\nit can be altered, can be transformed.\nIf nature is coarse and life is lowly,\nit can be diminished, can be enhanced.\nIf one attains the root,\nunobstructed in presence and absence—\nwhy is this so?\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\ncontain the heart,\nenvelop the core—\nthose who obtain the Way to live\ndo not possess virtue.\nThose who attain the One\ndo not seek its blessings.\nAll things honor and revere them,\ncherish and love them—\nyet they do not repay virtue.\nWhy is this so?\n\nThis is the **Dao** sublime and great, profound beyond speech;\nThings cannot enrich it, titles cannot honor it.\nWithout action, it serves all things—\nNothing in things it does not embrace.\nWhen pressed, its nature remains ever spontaneous.\n\nThus, the **Dao** as a thing:\nCannot be glimpsed through doors,\nCannot be observed through gates,\nCannot be pointed at with form,\nCannot be mirrored in appearance.\nMind cannot fathom it, words cannot convey it.\n\nAll things arise from it—\nYet it does not diminish them;\nAll things return to it—\nYet it does not overflow.\nIts breadth and depth are boundless,\nIts waxing and waning unfathomable.\n\nIt does not linger in the autumn hairs,\nNor does it deem them insignificant;\nIt does not encompass the myriad heavens,\nNor does it consider them excessive.\nThe radiance of green and purple robes\nDoes not alter its **virtue**,\nThe depths of hidden resolve and withered frame\nDo not change its transformation.\n\nIts movement is harmonious yet varied—\nIt does not favor any one thing.\nIt receives life and fate,\nYet nothing it does not guide.\nIts **virtue** flows through all things,\nYet cannot be repaid;\nIts blessings and kindnesses\nCannot be traced to their source.\nIt nourishes the world without cost,\nAccomplishes deeds without exhaustion.\nWhy, then, does it do this for all things?\nSurely it is not merely to give life!\n\nIt shapes existence,\nIt forms the myriad,\nIt establishes ranks and distinctions,\nIt distributes and fulfills them,\nIt begins and ends,\nIt precedes and follows—\nYet it entrusts the future to what comes after,\nAnd what comes after is in turn within it.\n\nThe **Dao** is divine and luminous,\nThe **Dao** is the source of Heaven and Earth’s form.\nHow does one know this?\nThe **Dao** encompasses the myriad heavens.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nHeaven and Earth have form, yet the **Dao** is formless.\nThose with form are all numbered;\nThe formless has no end.\nThings with form, when entrusted to the endless,\nAre like grasses and trees separated from the soil,\nOr stars detached from the sky—\nInsufficient to illustrate it!\n\nYet if one says otherwise,\nThen one does not grasp the **Dao**.\n\nBeing and non-being interpenetrate,\nVoid and reality embrace one another—\nLike the rind and the seed of a gourd,\nOr the stems and leaves of a vine, unseen yet adjacent.\n\nFleas and lice hide in the fur,\nYet one does not know the multitude of the city.\nThus, beyond the cosmos and within the realm of existence,\nIt is bound by no constraints,\nLimited by no rules.\nSafety and danger, growth and decay—\nIt knows neither inside nor outside.\nAll things follow its guidance,\nIts will is harmonious and unified.\n\nIt nurtures life without ceasing,\nIts beauty is flawless,\nIts goodness is unending—\nNo calamity, no harm.\nTen thousand blessings, myriad joys—\nThe **Dao** covers them all.\nIts deeds are profound,\nIts functions are unseen in the world.\nThe world knows nothing of its workings.\n\nThe **Dao** is the origin of all things,\nThe mother of all affairs.\nIts subtlety is boundless,\nIts smoothness profound and still—\nNothing it does not govern.\nIt nourishes all things,\nMakes them alive and intelligent,\nSkillful and resourceful—\nNothing it does not irrigate.\nThus it is said:\nThe origin of all things is the **Dao**,\nThe mother of all affairs is **virtue**.\n\nThe Sage attains it,\nAnd reverses with the myriad—\nThus he can grasp the heart of the **Dao**,\nUnderstand the principles of Heaven,\nOpen the door of all things,\nAnd fathom the myriad’s schemes.\nHe exhausts all cleverness,\nHe depletes all arts.\nRulership and affairs,\nHe adapts with the times—\nHis transformations are sudden,\nHis responses divine.\nHe acts without form,\nHe governs without boundary—\nExtreme and profound!\n\nHe cannot be carved or refined,\nYet returns to its source.\nIt covers and returns again—\nThus it wanders in the world without peril.\nHence, the Sage can:\nSeal his ears and eyes,\nClose his gates and doors,\nLock them with his tongue,\nShut them with his mind.\nWhen the time is not right, he does not move;\nWhen it is not harmonious, he does not act.\nThus his state endures,\nHis nation is long-lasting,\nAnd his life is without danger.\nWhy is this so?\n\nHe does not listen with his ears,\nYet his hearing is as vast as Heaven’s.\nHe does not look with his eyes,\nYet his vision is as bright as Heaven’s.\nHe does not act with his words,\nYet his transformations are as wondrous as Heaven’s.\nHe does not govern with his deeds,\nYet his functions are as vast as Heaven’s.\nWhat he upholds is essential;\nWhat he follows is detailed.\nThe **Dao**’s clarity is not obscured,\nHeaven’s concerns are fully understood—\nThus he can respond in harmony,\nFollow without deviation,\nIllumine all things without end.\nHe is the source of blessings,\nThe origin of transformations,\nThe ancestor and progenitor—\nHis influence spreads far and wide.\n\nHe avoids the harm of the Three Calamities,\nFills and seals them,\nSo they cannot be recognized—\nAs if deaf, as if blind.\nHe aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nActs in perfect harmony,\nEnds all strife—\nThus he is without rival in victory,\nWithout effort in action.\nHis wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,\nHis plans do not outmaneuver the **Dao**.\nHe cannot add to its power,\nHe cannot scheme beyond its limits.\nRuling people, managing things—\nHe harmonizes with yin and yang.\nInternally, he uses its light,\nExternally, he does not oppose it.\nClothing and food, tilling and weaving—\nHe has abundance.\nBlessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve.\nPeople are content, families are nourished.\nHis heart carries no burdens,\nHe does not seek lowliness nor crave nobility.\nHe is neither unlucky nor fortunate,\nNeither proud nor humble.\nHe neither exceeds nor falls short—\nOnly to serve above and nourish below.\nHuman **Dao** is fully realized,\nYet all returns to its source.\nHis divine intelligence is not exhausted,\nHis stored **virtue** is firmly preserved.\nHe does not dare call this wisdom,\nLike the ocean, he shares Heaven’s concerns.\n\nHe extinguishes the Three Calamities,\nFills and seals them,\nSo they cannot be perceived—\nAs if mute, as if deaf.\nHe aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nActs in perfect harmony,\nEnds all strife—\nThus he is without rival in victory,\nWithout effort in action.\nHis wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,\nHis plans do not outmaneuver the **Dao**.\nHe cannot add to its power,\nHe cannot scheme beyond its limits.\nRuling people, managing things—\nHe harmonizes with yin and yang.\nInternally, he uses its light,\nExternally, he does not oppose it.\n\nClothing and food, tilling and weaving—\nHe has abundance.\nBlessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve.\nPeople are content, families are nourished.\nHis heart carries no burdens,\nHe does not seek lowliness nor crave nobility.\nHe is neither unlucky nor fortunate,\nNeither proud nor humble.\nHe neither exceeds nor falls short—\nOnly to serve above and nourish below.\nHuman **Dao** is fully realized,\nYet all returns to its source.\nHis divine intelligence is not exhausted,\nHis stored **virtue** is firmly preserved.\n\nHe does not dare call this wisdom,\nLike the ocean, he shares Heaven’s concerns.\nThus he wanders with the **Dao**,\nAnd the **Dao** wanders with him—\nWe merge as one.\n\nHe upholds stillness and attains emptiness,\nI am the **Dao**’s dwelling with all things.\nConfused and boundless,\nIt returns to its origin.\nThe **Dao** is my inheritance.\n\n**Chapter on Walking the Great Dao**\n\nThe **Dao** and **virtue** are not wrought by cleverness—\nYet they mold Heaven and Earth, shape creation,\nHarmonize yin and yang,\nAnd Heaven and Earth cannot deceive.\nHeaven and Earth do not rely on cleverness—\nYet they embrace and transform, kill and give birth,\nNurture all things,\nAnd no creature can escape.\n\nIf the **Dao** is constrained by cleverness,\nThe mind cannot endure itself—\nHow then can Heaven and Earth be shaped?\nHow can yin and yang fulfill their nature?\n\nIf Heaven and Earth are bound by cleverness,\nThe body cannot sustain itself—\nHow then can transformation enfold all?\nHow can all things remain whole?\n\nThus, emptiness, non-action, ignorance, and desirelessness—\nThis is the heart of **Dao** and **virtue**,\nThe intention of Heaven and Earth.\n\nClarity, stillness, and natural response—\nThis is the movement of **Dao** and **virtue**,\nThe transformation of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow do we know this?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Where the **Dao** arises, Heaven’s work begins—\nFrom non-beginning to generation,\nFrom non-generation to existence,\nFrom non-existence to destruction,\nFrom non-destruction to destruction.\nThese are the natural proofs,\nThe constant of transformation.*\n\nThus, when human actions do not align with the **Dao**,\nThe **Dao** does not favor them.\nWhen they do not align with **virtue**,\n**Virtue** does not aid them.\nWhen they do not align with Heaven,\nHeaven does not shelter them.\nWhen they do not align with Earth,\nEarth does not bear them.\n\nWhere the **Dao** and **virtue** do not favor,\nWhere Heaven does not shelter and Earth does not bear—\nThere, misfortune is near and blessings distant.\n\nThus, the **Dao**-endowed sage in the world\nCarries broad understanding, embraces unity,\nSharpening clarity, grasping brightness,\nFollowing the **Dao**, serving **virtue**,\nDiscarding knowledge, abandoning the self,\nStriving in earnest, fearing error—\nEver wary of stumbling,\nStriving for the cleverness of non-cleverness,\nPursuing the clarity of non-clarity,\nTrusting, yielding, soft yet strong,\nTilling the land for sustenance,\nEver content, returning to simplicity.\n\nNameless, trembling with awe,\nFearful of losing the natural—\nWhen disaster approaches, Heaven’s calamity descends,\nAnd the people suffer.\nThus, when blessings and **virtue** arrive,\nLike shadow to form, echo to sound,\nThey arise without warning, as if born together.\n\nTherefore, the Great **Dao** is smooth in its transformation—\nFormless yet near, obscure yet bright,\nLevel yet without obstruction,\nSimple yet easy to follow,\nWithout action yet achieving success,\nWithout effort yet blessings overflow.\nHeaven and Earth follow it, and all things are born.\nYet people abandon it, using their cleverness,\nDiscarding the **Dao**, defying Earth,\nOpposing Heaven, exalting knowledge,\nRelying on cleverness, deceiving the spirit,\nAdorning falsehood, abandoning truth,\nCreating, altering, scheming,\nAmassing wealth, displaying splendor—\nElaborate houses, grand halls,\nHigh gates, ornate decorations,\nMulticolored silks, embroidered brocades,\nJade and fine linen, glittering adornments,\nSharp blades, sturdy armor, strong crossbows,\nSwift chariots, fleet horses,\nMany retainers, heavy influence,\nRenown and power spreading far,\nConquering neighbors, enslaving subjects,\nResenting the virtuous, envying the modest,\nHating loyalty, poisoning trust,\nBinding deceit, fostering falsehood,\nValuing conflict, revering strength—\nNone escape their oppression.\nThey open borders to outsiders,\nPlot regicide, indulge in excess,\nHoard gold and jade like mountains,\nPossessing all treasures, rivaling rulers,\nEntering in splendor, exiting in display,\nStanding apart from the common,\nExalted in chaos as \"great men,\"\nSurpassing others in evil,\nTheir crimes deep, their calamities severe—\nEven wise fathers disown them,\nRighteous rulers refuse their service.\nWhere the **Dao** does not favor,\nWhere the spirit does not dwell,\nWhere Heaven does not shelter,\nWhere all things resent—\nSuch a one invites disaster in life,\nSuffers misfortune in birth,\nAnd their lineage perishes with them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Establishing Goodness**\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless,\nDiverse winds, varied customs,\nTeeming creatures, endless transformations—\nWhat can be controlled is not wrought,\nWhat can be wrought is not controlled.\n\nI act for the world, and the world acts for me.\nWhen we meet, they are many, I am few—\nFew against many: the many thrive, the few perish.\nThus, if one stands by knowledge, it will be seized.\nIf one stands by cleverness, it will be undermined.\nIf one stands by strength, it will be overpowered.\nOnly the one who does nothing cannot be defeated.\n\nHow do we know this?\nSilent, yet seeking an echo—\nThe echo does not respond.\nSeeking shadow in darkness—\nThe shadow does not follow.\nYet if one fears the echo and strikes metal,\nThe response grows louder.\nIf one fears the shadow and stands in sunlight,\nThe shadow clings closer.\nThus, non-action cannot evade blessing,\nAction cannot escape misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the sage abandons strength,\nAbandons cleverness,\nAbandons knowledge,\nAbandons virtue,\nEstablishes the **Dao**,\nEmbraces **virtue**,\nRestrains emotions,\nNurtures the spirit,\nHarmonizes the body,\nFollows Earth,\nSupports Heaven,\nEmptied, still, and silent—\nAs if absent, yet present,\nInner and outer both quiescent,\nTransforming in stillness,\nWithout action, without effort,\nReturning to simplicity, embracing truth,\nWithout laws, without measures,\nAligned with transformation,\nNurturing the small to sustain the great,\nShepherding the people—\nSquare and round, first and last,\nEver abiding, the body preserved,\nThe form upright, the spirit at ease,\nLineage enduring, **virtue** accumulating,\nTransformation flowing boundlessly—\nDeclining yet reviving, enduring with Heaven.\n\nThus, governing the self:\nSimplicity in nature, ease in emotion,\nClarity in mind, far-reaching will,\nNo confusion in thought,\nBalanced *qi*, harmonized blood,\nPliancy in sinew and bone,\nSharp senses, luminous skin,\nSpirit concentrated and firm,\nLife vibrant and enduring,\nBody light and agile,\nJoy in simplicity, hard to exhaust.\n\nGoverning the family:\nThe husband trustworthy, the wife chaste,\nThe father benevolent, the child filial,\nBrothers harmonious, siblings respectful,\nThe extended family in unity,\nFields tilled in season, livestock thriving,\nAbundant grain, stored wealth—\nSix kinds of livestock flourishing,\nAffairs in order, always with surplus,\nNeighbors envying their prosperity.\n\nGoverning the village:\nDiscerning order, knowing customs,\nActions in harmony with *zhonghe*,\nNames and realities aligned,\nBlack and white distinct,\nCurved and straight differentiated,\nRight and wrong self-evident—\nNo deceit arises, authority respected,\nCommands obeyed without hesitation,\nAbove and below in harmony,\nAll delighted, the people united,\nOfficials without grievance, duties fulfilled,\nRenown as *junzi*, **virtue** abundant,\nDeath without peril.\n\nGoverning the state:\nThe ruler wise, ministers loyal,\nNo obstruction in court, no envy of the worthy,\nNo corruption of the upright, no harm from slander,\nHarmony and obedience above and below,\nNo grievances among officials,\nAll affairs proceeding naturally,\nDistant lands in awe, the world in accord,\nThe state rich, the people secure—\nNo conquest yet strong,\nAncestral temples honored, altars enduring,\nHeaven and Earth in perpetual union,\nNo calamities, all things bountiful,\nThe realm at peace, neighbors entrusting their lives,\nPosterity flourishing, **Dao** and **virtue** eternal.\n\nGoverning the world:\nThe ruler embodies yin, ministers yang,\nThe ruler is still, ministers act,\nThe ruler is square, ministers are round,\nThe ruler leads, ministers follow,\nThe ruler speaks straight, ministers harmonize,\nGreat and unified, simple and easy,\nWithout action, without sound,\n**Virtue** spreading like a ripple,\nThe spirit coursing like wind,\nMovement without end, transformation like Heaven—\nNo action yet success achieved,\nIn accord with the **Dao**’s measure,\nThe world returns to truth,\nNo worries, no fears—\nGreat Peace arises naturally.\n\nThus, my body is their measure,\nTheir span is my own.\n\n「Thus, my family is their measure,\nMy village their boundary and rule,\nMy realm their standard and guide.\nThe sovereign is the vitals of the land,\nThe land the sovereign’s very form.\n\nTherefore, the land and sovereign share in prosperity and woe,\nIn corruption and rectitude—\nSovereign and realm are inseparable.\nIf one can attain self-mastery,\nThe world naturally follows suit.\nHence, those who truly know me\nCannot fail to know all things,\nThose who can govern me\nCannot fail to govern all,\nThose who benefit me\nCannot fail to benefit all,\nThose who harm me\nCannot fail to harm all.\nThere is none who can harm me\nYet benefit another.\n\n---\n\n**Containing Virtue** (卷三, from the *Children* section, *Daoist Classics* of *Morality and the Way*)\n**Imperially Approved** *Four Treasuries* (卷四)\n\n**Han Dynasty** *Yán Zūn*’s **Essay on Abundant Virtue**\n\n**Virtue** is profound, **Dao** is boundless,\nSilent and still, pure and clear—\nThe **Dao** of Great Harmony, ungraspable yet vast.\nListen, and it is empty and boundless;\nLook, and it is void yet easy.\nIts depth knows no end, its breadth no limit—\nHeaven cannot enfold it, Earth cannot contain it,\nNo boundaries can restrict it, no measures can define it,\nNo scales can weigh it, no gold can obscure it,\nNo water can drown it, no fire can consume it.\nNo thing can lead it, no calamity can arise from it.\nIt floats and soars, vast and formless,\nThe heart finds no home, the body no form.\nYet within this **Dao**, the myriad heavens act,\nAnd all things are nurtured and refined.\nObtain it, and one’s nourishment is boundless,\nOne’s wisdom is unobstructed.\nYet even with such wisdom,\nOne cannot grasp it, cannot attain it.\nThe farther one seeks, the thinner it grows;\nThe more one clings, the more it slips away.\nOnly the **Dao** of **No Desire**\nIs the sovereign’s dwelling place—\nHidden deep within the heart.\nThus it is called **Containing Virtue**.\n\nFor **virtue** in a man\nIs like a father’s and mother’s love for his body,\nYet to all things it is like pearls and jade\nCompared to tiles and lead.\nHence, the man of **Containing Virtue**\nValues his own life yet scorns the world—\nLike a kind father or filial child,\nWho would not trade his wealth for a neighbor’s.\nThe man of great body yet refined nature\nIs like a shrewd merchant,\nWho would not exchange pearls for tiles or lead.\nHis **No Desire** is not greed for cheapness,\nNor does he shun disturbance for love of quietude.\nThe world’s affairs cannot please his heart,\nIts schemes cannot move him.\nWhy so?\nBecause he weighs the world as light,\nYet holds his own spirit as heavy.\nHe understands the balance of light and heavy,\nThe shifts of benefit and harm,\nThus all things cannot enslave him,\nNor the world weary him.\n\nTherefore, he is not void yet voidness arises,\nNot still yet stillness is born,\nNot exhausted yet his spirit is at rest,\nNot harmonious yet his **qi** is balanced.\nThus, he hears without listening—\nThe sound of the unsounded,\nSees without gazing—\nThe form of the formless.\nHe does not think yet grasps right and wrong,\nDoes not ponder yet reaches accord with all.\nHis spirit sinks into Heaven and Earth,\nHis **virtue** follows yin and yang.\nHe does not invoke blessings yet Heaven and Earth protect him,\nHe does not shun calamities yet misfortunes depart.\nHe does not slaughter yet the world fears him,\nHe does not give yet the world loves him.\nHe feasts content, bows and stretches at ease,\nEats coarse grasses yet finds them sweet,\nDrinks plain water yet finds it savory.\nBeneath the trees, his spirit is whole;\nIn the caves, his mind ever joyful.\nThough poor, he is happy in his work;\nThough humble, he forgets his lowliness.\nIn want, he is serene; in peril, he is calm.\nHis deeds match Earth’s, his **virtue** aligns with Heaven—\nThe foolish return to simplicity,\nThe wise embrace the **Dao**.\n\nThus, to build one’s body as a realm,\nIf one can truly be like an infant,\nThen he is the world’s honored one,\nThe **Dao**’s revered master.\nAll revere their own bodies,\nYet scorn the world as filth.\nThe virtuous flee rank and power,\nYet gather softness and weakness.\nThey discard strength and rigidity,\nDrown in cravings, sink in pursuit—\nLife opens to danger, yet death is sealed in safety.\nThus blessings vanish like Heaven and Earth,\nYet calamities strike like thunder.\nThe world’s evils are self-made,\nIts woes self-invoked.\nThe **Dao** has no fixed methods,\n**Virtue** no set paths,\nThe spirit no constant form,\nHarmony no fixed state.\nTo see it, one must see alone;\nTo hear it, one must hear alone;\nTo act upon it, one must act alone;\nTo abide in it, one must stand alone.\n\nA father cannot teach his son,\nA subject cannot teach his lord—\nLike a mother recognizing her child,\nOr an infant its parents.\n\n---」\n\nThe **Dao**’s mother and child recognize each other—\nThis is nature’s own decree.\nYet what makes it so is knowledge beyond articulation.\n\nFive flavors dwell upon the tongue,\nFive tones resound within the ear—\nThough sweet is not sweet, bitter not bitter,\nThe *shang* not *shang*, the *yu* not *yu*,\nYet Yi Ya’s chef and the blind musician discern them.\nYet what makes them discern is speech beyond the tongue.\n\nThus, the formless form can be seen yet not be seen,\nThe shapeless shape can be imitated yet not be spoken,\nThe actionless action can be modeled yet not be described,\nThe useless use can be enacted yet not be taught.\n\nHence, those who grasp the **Dao** see it as a child recognizing its parents,\nTread it as the earth, bear it as the sky,\nClothe it as garments, embody it as flesh—\nAct upon it as if it were their own nature,\nRise and fall with it, sleep and awake with it,\nBend and stretch with it.\nTheir spirit wanders with change,\nTheir will roams with **virtue**,\nTheir insight is internal yet external as deaf and blind,\nTheir thoughts arise yet appear as madness and folly.\nThus, their mouths cannot speak,\nTheir intentions cannot be made clear.\n\nLike dreaming of being a king,\nYet standing upon perilous heights,\nOr gazing into deep abysses—\nJoy and sorrow clash within,\nYet the heart remains undisturbed.\nAwakening, one cannot convey the **Dao** to neighbors.\n\nThose who lose the **Dao** act otherwise—\nThey see its surface yet fail to perceive its depths,\nTrace its currents yet never reach its source,\nClutch its ends yet never grasp its roots.\nTheir understanding is not as it should be,\nNor is their failure to understand.\nThus, the **Dao** lies not within themselves,\nNor does it reside in their bodies.\nThe central principle is not fixed,\nThe defense is not steadfast.\nTheir resolve is like a fox’s cunning,\nTheir doubts entangle with the world.\nTheir insight is a false brilliance—\nAs if true and false, existence and nonexistence,\nWere interchangeable.\nTheir harmony is fragile, their emotions easily stirred—\nLike sickness upon a man.\nWhen they speak, their words are hollow,\nYet their hearts are filled with schemes,\nTheir minds with calculations.\nTheir brilliance shines outward,\nTheir spirit fades within.\nThey grasp externals yet lack inner substance,\nTheir **virtue** and **Dao** scatter daily,\nDrifting ever farther.\nThe more they speak, the worse they fare,\nThe more they act, the more they stray.\n\nThus, the speaker is the **Dao**’s greatest obstacle,\nThe one who distances **virtue** its most grievous error,\nThe one who opposes Heaven its most reckless artisan,\nThe one who overturns Earth its most ruinous tool.\n\nHence, those who attain the **Dao** diminish their brilliance,\nDiscard their sharpness—\nThey do not see, do not hear,\nAs if blind and deaf.\nThey seal their mouths, still their tongues,\nAs if speechless.\nThey abandon all fixed attachments,\nDispel all lingering thoughts,\nSilent as if nonexistent,\nHidden as if alone.\nThey extinguish calamities without a trace,\nReturning to the utmost simplicity.\nTheir appearance does not alter,\nTheir colors do not deceive.\nThey follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,\nConform with the world’s transformations,\nPlunge deep into the **Dao**,\nRoam with **virtue** in boundless stillness.\nThey speak without words,\nAct without doing,\nSerene in their governance,\nBalanced in their response to time.\nWith the world in perfect confusion,\nThey alone remain unchanging.\nThey dwell in the realm of near and far,\nSoar through the gates of gain and harm,\nFloat amid the fields of noble and base,\nGuarding their spirit’s essence,\nVanishing into the formless expanse,\nFree in the wild and untamed lands.\nThey do not take poverty as disgrace,\nNor wealth as honor.\nThey conceal when they wish to conceal,\nReveal when they wish to reveal.\nThey cannot harm the yin and yang,\nNor can they obscure the people’s clarity.\nThey stand alone, unassailable,\nTheir voice unchanging, their colors unalluring.\nThey do not compete with all things,\nNor do they contend with their strength.\nThey have no gains, no losses,\nNo accumulation, no depletion.\nThey close their doors, sever all ties,\nEnd all beginnings, extinguish all threads.\nTheir spirit is the measure,\nThe **Dao** the central guide.\nTheir actions align with change,\nTheir stillness with nature.\nThus, they can govern with harmony.\n\nAs for the **Dao** of kings and states—\n**Virtue** and **Dao**’s essence are constant,\nYet their forms shift between stillness and motion.\nThey encompass Heaven and Earth’s span,\nMark the cycles of yin and yang,\nNurture life as sun and moon do.\nTo oppose them brings ruin,\nTo follow them brings flourishing.\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s **Dao** is ever one:\nYin and yang in balance.\nThe yang **qi** governs **virtue**,\nThe yin **qi** governs punishment.\nPunishment and **virtue** are contrary,\nYet harmony lies at their core.\nSpring brings birth, summer growth,\nAutumn harvests, winter stores—\nEnding and beginning anew,\nDecay and renewal in turn.\nThe yang reaches its limit and turns to yin,\nThe yin reaches its limit and turns to yang,\nYin and yang in endless opposition.\nThus, the **Dao** of kings and states is ever one:\nSoftness and hardness in balance,\nCivility and martial force in unity,\nThe central principle as their guiding thread.\nSoftness and hardness, when properly aligned,\nConnect with **virtue** and **Dao**,\nYet must ultimately return to **Dao**.\n**Dao** and **virtue** protect each other,\nLaw abides at their center.\nLaw and numbers interweave,\nThus all flows in perfect accord.\n\nHence, the enlightened ruler and sage\nDiminishes desires to quiet the mind,\nQuiets the mind to grasp the **Dao**,\nGrasses the **Dao** to govern with clarity,\nGovern with clarity to steady the heart,\nSteadies the heart to rectify the body,\nRectifies the body to order the family,\nOrders the family to establish the state,\nEstablishes the state to define its laws,\nDefines the laws to name its principles,\nNames its principles to govern the land.\nWith laws and principles clear,\nThey examine the fundamental truths,\nDistinguish the primary from the secondary,\nAlign left and right,\nConnect front and back,\nArrange the five directions—\nAll things conform to their governance.\nTheir names are verified by reality,\nTheir reality confirmed by scrutiny,\nThus they oversee with precision—\nNames and facts as moon and sun,\nOne name correct, the state flourishes,\nOne name false, the state suffers.\nThey nurture the land with unwavering care,\nBending and stretching, giving and taking,\nAll in accordance with the seasons.\nThey follow disorder, yet uphold law,\nThey meet chaos, yet enforce order.\nIf order is lost, they do not restrain,\nIf order is not obeyed, they do not stop,\nIf order is not followed, they do not punish,\nIf order is not embraced, they do not strike.\nIf a small state is pressed between larger ones,\nAnd suffers a ruler without the **Dao**,\nThey cannot correct its affairs—\nThen they must depart.\nIf departure is impossible,\nThey must cede land.\nIf ceding land is not allowed,\nThey must lead their people to safety.\nIf safety cannot be found,\nThey must defend with all their might.\nIf defense fails,\nThen calamity engulfs all—\nAnd disaster falls upon themselves.\nThus, they must rise in strategy,\nAnd war must be waged.\n\nI wish to train soldiers,\nHone weapons,\nStockpile grain,\nRaise high walls,\nAnd guard my people in solitude—\nYet the common folk are scattered,\nThe state lies in ruin.\nThis is the work of war,\nThis is the path of strife—\nYet the **Dao**’s governance is the way to flourish.\n\nThe **Dao** seeks to enter through rectitude—\nYet I am few while they are many,\nI am weak while they are strong.\nTo confront them is like casting an egg against a stone;\nAs an enemy, I shall receive calamity.\nThe three armies must be defeated,\nSoldiers slain and wounded.\nHeaven’s will is not obtained,\nThe ancestral temple is destroyed,\nAnd the people below weep—\nWhile above, I fear the will of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the work of **strategy**,\nAnd the movement of **the extraordinary**.\n\nThus, I establish plans for retreat and advance,\nLure their reversals and summon their comings,\nOpen the hearts of the people,\nAwaken the schemes of the feudal lords,\nClarify the **Dao**’s virtue and power,\nAnd invoke the aid of Heaven and Earth.\nTo blend the hearts of all under the four seas,\nTo harmonize the intentions of all nations—\nThe people respond to me like echoes,\nNeighboring states follow me like shadows.\nBirds and beasts alike move with me.\nThis is the use of **strategy**,\nAnd the execution of **the extraordinary**.\n\nAbove, I align with the **Dao**’s intent,\nBelow, I merge with Heaven and Earth’s will.\nIn peril and security, in gain and loss,\nI treat the people as my own body.\nThe formless form dwells in the deepest **yin**,\nAction arises from **wuwei**,\nThe unspoken voice is exalted.\nI expose the crimes of those who extinguish transformation,\nReveal the deeds of those who defy Heaven,\nManifest what Heaven bestows,\nAnd show what Earth produces.\nThere is name without substance,\nSubstance without name—\nNames and realities contradict,\nNow upright, now tilted.\nIn shifting and reversing,\nI conform to the unseen.\nWhen Heaven’s calamities arise,\nWhen omens and portents manifest,\nI sever father from son,\nBrother from brother,\nKill their generals,\nAnd slaughter their loyal ministers.\nThe world’s resentment unites—\nNone share my heart.\nAlone and towering,\nI receive Heaven’s armies.\nVictory brings great joy,\nAnd the four seas are at peace.\nThis is the highest use of **the extraordinary**.\n\nI gather the world’s fury,\nAccumulate those skilled in **the extraordinary**.\nEars fly, eyes roam,\nHearing and sight sharpen,\nScholars spread far,\nFriends are bound,\nRelatives united,\nLife and growth flourish.\nI adapt to deceit,\nNurture power,\nAnd strengthen my people.\nI spread rumors,\nDance with schemes,\nUse humble words to subdue,\nAnd heavy rewards to open their ministers.\nWhen rifts form between lord and subject,\nI seize their resolve.\nShadows move in darkness,\nPower shifts in defense.\nI suspend their fate,\nControl their schemes,\nSo they cannot act.\nI advance and retreat with the times,\nHave no fixed rituals.\nI strike without attacking,\nAnd the enemy surrenders without battle.\nI topple their lord without harming their ministers,\nExecute their generals without touching their troops.\nVictory brings joy to the people,\nAnd the feudal lords fear me.\nThis is the secondary use of **the extraordinary**.\n\nI control their terrain,\nMaster their lord and ministers.\nWith lowly words and heavy rewards,\nI pacify their exterior,\nSpread covert plots,\nAnd sow discord among their kin.\nDeceit comes from them,\nThe path arises from me.\nI grant them cities to seal alliances,\nAnd bind states through gifts.\nDeceit arrives like a flood,\nPlans unfold like divine foresight.\nStrategies are unfathomable,\n**The extraordinary** is boundless.\nI divide their strength,\nDoubt their resolve—\nAs if rising from the earth,\nAs if born from Heaven.\nI sever their allies,\nGuard their connections.\nI generate power,\nCreate transformations,\nAnd dictate their fate.\nThey cannot trust,\nTheir strong are broken,\nTheir resolve is weakened.\nI exploit their forms,\nEstablish victory like an endless ring.\nSeizing the moment,\nI act with constancy.\nI attack their vulnerabilities,\nCut off their supplies,\nStarve and thirst them,\nBurden and weary them,\nDrown and burn them,\nExhaust and torment them,\nFreeze and parch them,\nLure and confuse them,\nPress and overwhelm them.\nFrom high, I strike low,\nWith many, I overcome few,\nAnd firm ranks hold fast—\nOfficers shield their soldiers,\nSoldiers seek their commanders.\nThe three armies defend as father and son.\n**The extraordinary** formations split and merge,\nHide and emerge,\nDeploy in front, flank, and rear,\nClimb left, collapse right,\nShine with banners,\nDeceive with drums.\nAdvancing like waves,\nRetreating like wind and rain,\nStriking like a collapse,\nFighting like a tiger—\nUnassailable in defense,\nUnbreakable in attack.\nVictory spreads,\nAnd awe rules the world.\nThis is the lowest use of **the extraordinary**.\n\nWhen chaos and calamity subside,\nAll things flourish in peace.\nHeaven’s will is fulfilled,\nAnd the world rejoices.\nI conceal **the extraordinary**,\nDiminish cunning,\nHold loyalty and sincerity as paramount,\nPursue clarity and simplicity,\nRetreat from affairs,\nAnd silence words.\nWhy so?\nThe **Dao**’s transformation gives birth to all things.\nHigh and low, all have different inclinations,\nTheir comings and goings vary.\nSome turn west, some east—\nEach follows its nature to sustain itself.\nThe virtuous rely on goodness,\nThe wicked rely on deceit.\nThe sincere rely on trust,\nThe evil rely on falsehood.\nAll display their wisdom to avoid calamity.\nYet schemes are never sufficient,\nThe clever grow deceitful,\nThe labored grow weary,\nThe loyal grow treacherous,\nThe constrained grow cruel,\nThe truthful grow exhausted.\nThe worthy become unkind.\nIf a ruler loves cleverness, the people deceive.\nIf a ruler loves profit, the people suffer.\nIf a ruler loves rewards, the people are impoverished.\nIf a ruler loves punishment, the people resent.\nWhy?\nBecause affairs stem from the ruler,\nAnd actions lie with the ministers.\nRewards come from the ruler,\nWealth comes from the people.\nLaws come from the ruler,\nObedience comes from the ministers.\nWhen the ruler has desires,\nThe world follows the wind.\nThus, a public-minded heart is not as vast as a heart without desire.\nTo restrain excess is not as effective as having no demands.\nTimely joy and anger are not as virtuous as **wuwei**’s merit.\nTo act without acting is the ultimate way.\n\n「Reflecting on governance, harmonious virtue is not as profound as the Way of non-interference.\nTo master the arts of *yuzhu*[1] and *qixiao*[2]—as intricate as the calculations of the *qique*[3]—is not as effective as cultivating the virtue of preventing illness in all.\nTo wield the stratagems of the Yellow Emperor and Duke of Zhou, grasp the essentials of Sun and Wu, and triumph through them is not as wise as letting the world exist without exerting cleverness or force.\nThus, the origin of *Dao/virtue* is love, yet love cannot bring profit;\nThe foundation of *Heaven and Earth* is action, yet action cannot achieve completion.\nOnly the one without love can bring profit,\nOnly the one without action can fulfill desires.\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign have no desires, no demands,\nNo contrivances, no creations,\nNo governance, no burdens, no laws, no decrees—\nReturning to simplicity, they let the world find its own peace.\n\n*How can this be illuminated?*\nZhuangzi said: When one creates blessings, generates profit, achieves success, fulfills tasks,\nAccumulates goods, and directs their use,\nThe people grow exceedingly wealthy,\nThe world indulges in extravagance,\nGoods and wealth are insufficient,\nThe common folk suffer want—\nBounties fill the mountains and valleys,\nGold and jade pile up,\nThe state becomes unstable,\nThe people grow fewer in fortune.\nCunning men deceive each other,\nThe wise use guile to manipulate,\nBarriers are built to guard against licentiousness and deceit,\nDistinctions are drawn between good and evil, right and wrong,\nYet the people are confused.\nThus, the state grows chaotic,\nAnd governance declines.\n\nWhen one enforces rigid rules,\nThen the people bend—\nThe people bend, and rigid rules become flexible,\nThen the wicked advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd the common folk suffer the harm.\n\nWhen one values frugality,\nThe people seek wealth—\nThe people seek wealth, and frugality becomes extravagant,\nThen the greedy flourish while the honest decline,\nLoyal ministers bear the punishment,\nAnd the common folk suffer the loss.\n\nWhen one opens disputes,\nThe people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,\nThen the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,\nLoyal ministers face ruin,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen the ruler loves fame,\nThe people feign virtue—\nThe people feign virtue, and sincerity is displayed,\nThen great virtue is obscured while petty rewards are flaunted,\nLoyal ministers risk death,\nAnd the common folk endure calamity.\n\nThus, the ruler’s policies:\nWithout filial piety, without benevolence,\nWithout generosity, without giving,\nWith constant caution—\nThe people’s affection is strained,\nTheir virtues are stifled.\nWith indiscriminate rewards and punishments,\nThe people’s good and evil are not clearly distinguished,\nTheir right and wrong are not separated—\nThus, the ruler loses what he cherishes,\nHis own life is cut short.\nBlessings arise from misfortune,\nMisfortune arises from blessings—\nBlessings and misfortunes are intertwined,\nLike shared fields where both perish and thrive,\nYet their natures differ.\nNone but the sage can grasp this truth alone.\n\nTherefore, to abandon blessings means to avoid misfortune,\nTo avoid misfortune means to abandon blessings—\nThe blessings of abandoning blessings are profound.\nTo guard against *zai*[4] and *mian*[5] in silence,\nThe world loves cleverness yet cannot exhaust its depths—\nOnly the one who acts without acting can follow its natural course.\nTo remain upright in the midst of blessings and misfortunes,\nWithout losing balance—\nIs not to be confused by good and evil,\nNor to see the upright as monsters,\nNor the wicked as sages.\nThe world falls into great confusion and cannot be rectified.\n\nWhen one enforces methods,\nThen the people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and methods are abandoned,\nThen the upright retreat while the wicked advance,\nLoyal ministers bear the brunt,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen one applies numbers,\nThen the people’s emotions are drained,\nAnd their connections are severed—\nThis is what is called *rigid rules* that are not rigid,\n*Frugality* that is not frugal,\n*Righteousness* that is not righteous,\n*Sincerity* that is not sincere.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is complete yet does not bestow,\nThus all things exist without constraint.\nIt acts without acting,\nThus all things flourish without coercion.\nThe *Dao/Way* is void and formless,\nYet all things have shape.\nIt lacks state or appearance,\nYet all things are square or round.\nIt is silent and without sound,\nYet all things have voice.\nFrom this perspective, the *Dao/Way* does not act nor does it harm,\nYet all things are preserved.\nIt does not contrive nor does it slaughter,\nYet all things come to be.\nPreservation arises from non-preservation,\nExistence arises from non-existence—\nThis is clear.\n\nThus, when a ruler raises armies and exploits profit,\nThe people grow desirous—\nThe people grow desirous, and rigid rules are enforced,\nThen rigid rules are abandoned,\nAnd the wicked advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd the common folk suffer the harm.\n\nWhen one values frugality,\nThe people seek wealth—\nThe people seek wealth, and frugality is enforced,\nThen the greedy flourish while the honest decline,\nLoyal ministers bear the punishment,\nAnd the common folk suffer the loss.\n\nWhen one opens disputes,\nThe people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,\nThen the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,\nLoyal ministers face ruin,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen the ruler loves fame,\nThe people feign virtue—\nThe people feign virtue, and sincerity is displayed,\nThen great virtue is obscured while petty rewards are flaunted,\nLoyal ministers risk death,\nAnd the common folk endure calamity.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign:\nHold this truth in solitude and do not share it,\nKnow it alone and do not teach it.\nTheir ministers stand divided,\nTheir bodies are dual,\nThey nurture the ruler’s intentions,\nThey flatter the ruler’s heart,\nThey clog the ruler’s ears,\nThey obscure the ruler’s wisdom—\nThis is why the state grows perilous\nAnd the ancestral temples are endangered.\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign possess this alone.»\n\nThe enlightened ruler and sage sovereign:\nHold this virtue alone and do not wield it,\nStand steadfast in self while not imposing upon others,\nBe frugal with all things yet not possess them,\nUphold righteousness with Heaven’s sincerity yet not rely upon it,\nShine their virtue across the four seas yet not cling to it.\n\nWhy is this so?\nRemove the Way of *fǎng* (方) to govern—let the people below abandon *fǎng* and not abandon it,\nLet affairs reach completion without litigation,\nLet all things flow without obstruction—\nThis is why none shall bring calamity,\nNone shall bring defense,\nThe world shall be vast and tranquil,\nAnd none shall speak of its constancy.\nNot that they do not abandon *fǎng*—\nThey strip and plunder, slaughter and oppress,\nExerting tyranny without restraint,\nYet leave no scars or wounds.\nRemove wealth to practice *lián* (廉)—let the people below abandon greed and not abandon it,\nLet those who hoard and covet cease,\nLet purity arise naturally—\nNone shall be muddied,\nNone shall be clear,\nThe world shall be harmonious,\nAll things shall flourish.\nNot that they do not abandon greed—\nThey excel in frugality, restrain themselves,\nDisplaying their virtue openly,\nYet no theft remains undetected.\nRemove contention to act with *zhí* (直)—let the people below abandon excess and not abandon it,\nLet those who scheme and rebel be suppressed,\nLet the crooked be rectified and disorder be quelled,\nLet customs be refined and mores corrected—\nNone shall bring calamity,\nNone shall bring fortune.\nThe world shall be desolate,\nAll things shall find their own way.\nNot that they do not abandon excess—\nThey exalt the upright, promote the straight,\nExpose faults, display evil,\nCriticize the crooked, and clarify errors—\nLet the world be entirely just,\nYet all movements remain silent.\nRemove fame to shine—let the people below abandon flaunting and not abandon it,\nLet them illuminate themselves without ostentation—\nNone shall be enlightened,\nNone shall be obscured.\nThe world shall be unified,\nAll things shall thrive.\nNot that they do not abandon flaunting—\nTheir virtue shines across the four seas,\nIlluminating all things,\nTransforming without form.\n\nAbove and below mirror each other,\nOuter and inner correspond,\nComing and going leave no trace,\nMovement and rest have no bounds.\nLike shadow to form,\nEcho to sound—\nThus the Dao of governing the state,\nThe method of nurturing the people.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe Way of *sè* (啬) is not to give,\nNot to take,\nTo be frugal and loving,\nTo guard against the subtle and prevent the wondrous.\nIf sincerity flows through their intentions,\nThey can endure for ages.\nThus, they bear the myriad things,\nAnd their virtue aligns with Heaven and the Dao.\n\nIts roots are deep, its foundation firm,\nIt dwells with the divine and enlightened—\nThe true person embodies it,\nThe sage preserves it.\n\nIn governing great states:\n\nWhen the sun declines and shadows grow,\nWhen dryness reaches its peak and wind arises,\nEven the valleys tremble—\nYet the seas surge with great waves,\nHigh above, they loom in majesty,\nA thousand *li* apart—\nThis is because their form is vast.\n\nThe cliffs of ten thousand *zhàng* (丈) rise,\nYet even the smallest creatures can traverse them,\nWhile the great beasts—rhinos, elephants, tigers, leopards—\nLie in ruin, their carcasses decaying.\nThis is because their forms are heavy.\n\nWhen gusts howl and storms rage,\nHouses collapse, trees are uprooted,\nIron and stone fly through the air,\nMountains and hills crumble—\nYet the people’s blood and pulse remain unharmed.\nThis is because their violence is excessive.\n\nWhen the wind slips through cracks,\nIt stirs not even the eyebrows of those within,\nYet it breeds a hundred ailments,\nEven unto death—\nThis is because their influence is minute.\n\nGreat states are like rivers and seas,\nRhinos and elephants—\nYet their virtue is like the wind through cracks,\nLike the gusts of a storm.\n\nThus their blessings cannot be grandly produced,\nTheir benefits cannot be violently unleashed,\nTheir goodness cannot be broadly placed,\nTheir evil cannot be grandly prevented.\n\nTo produce blessings grandly is to bring great ruin,\nTo unleash benefits violently is to bring great collapse,\nTo place goodness broadly is to bring great loss,\nTo prevent evil grandly is to bring great catastrophe.\n\nHow do we know this?\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The hungry double their food,\nThe thirsty drink deeply,\nThe hot plunge into water,\nThe cold enter the fire—\nThough the suffering is removed,\nTheir bodies must die.\nThe chest has a tumor that cannot be drilled,\nThe throat has an illness that cannot be scraped,\nMosquitoes cling to the face—\nOne cannot shoot them,\nLice and fleas cling to the skin—\nOne cannot chop them.\nWhy?\nBecause in removing small calamities,\nOne breeds great disasters.\"*\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign in governing great states...\n\nTo hold the Dao lightly as a fine handle,\nTo pass through the smallest streams as if they were great waters,\nTo discern the autumn hair as if listening to the void,\nTo make things appear as if they were not, or as if they were—\nTo act or to pause, to do or not to do,\nYet all things transform within the realm of non-action,\nAnd drift in the wilds of having and not having.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the Dao is their father, virtue their mother,\nDivine clarity their teacher, great harmony their friend,\nSerenity their constant, simplicity their master,\nThe heavens and earth their law, yin and yang their form,\nThe sun and moon their ritual, all things their model,\nResponsiveness their essence, sincerity their foundation.\n\nDistinct yet harmonious, their functions are clearly defined,\nYet silently they follow the grand threads.\nThey grasp the essentials, not the minutiae,\nAnd seek it within themselves.\n\nThus, the people are like infants in the womb,\nThe ruler like a newborn babe—\nNo falsehood arises without cause,\nAnd skill emerges from simplicity.\n\nNo beginning to their motion,\nAll things equal and balanced—\nNo excess, no deficiency,\nAll in perfect accord and compliance.\n\nThings flourish and thrive,\nIn harmony with the divine and human—\nTogether they prosper, acting naturally,\nEach fulfilling its own nature.\n\nSilent as if without a sovereign,\nStable as if without a ruler,\nAll things are born, all people live out their full span—\nNo harm, no early death.\n\nIf the ruler is not without compassion,\nIf the sage is not without discernment—\nThe ruler is not without compassion,\nYet extends boundless love, virtue reaching the four quarters,\nNo partiality, no favoritism.\n\nThe sage is not without discernment,\nYet floats in boundless clarity,\nPassing through the finest barriers,\nExperiencing all things, adapting with the times—\nDivine in all things, never harming others.\n\nNot harming others,\nThe sage stands above, aligning with the heavens—\nPeople and things follow the great transformation,\nAnd know that no artificial excess can be complete,\nNo artificial fullness can endure.\n\nThe yellowing of grass and trees,\nThe natural course of human life—\nThus, the heavens enfold them,\nThe earth contains them,\nThe One Supreme gives birth to them,\nThe One Heavenly nurtures them.\n\nThe four seasons cycle,\nThe five phases regulate,\nMinisters and subjects, each in their place—\nNo interference, all in motion,\nCirculating through all things,\nNo harm can be done.\n\nThus, divine discernment governs the hidden,\nThe sage governs the manifest.\nTo govern the hidden is to kill the unusual,\nTo govern the manifest is to kill the extraordinary.\n\nIn emptiness and stillness,\nDivine discernment nourishes it.\nIn the finest barriers,\nDivine discernment aids it.\nIn fullness and excess,\nDivine discernment harms it.\nIn extreme abundance,\nDivine discernment destroys it.\n\nWhat does not belong to the Dao,\nThe sage does not follow.\nWhat is not loyal or sincere,\nThe sage does not bestow.\n\nWhat is not compliant or virtuous,\nThe sage does not employ.\nWhat is not bold or extraordinary,\nThe sage does not observe.\n\nWhat does not act in accordance with the Dao,\nThe sage does not preserve.\n\nThus, motion from the hidden is governed by divine discernment,\nMotion from the manifest is governed by the sage.\nOnly what remains motionless cannot be defeated.\n\nThe sage stands above—\nNo strange things arise,\nNo deceit can flourish.\n\nThus, divine discernment nourishes all things in the hidden,\nThe sage nourishes all things in the manifest.\nBlessings begin with the hidden,\nVirtue ends with the manifest.\n\nDivine discernment descends its grace,\nThe sage extends his benevolence—\nAll things return in their natural course,\nAs if the Dao were deep and virtue harmonious.\n\n*Chapter on the Governance of Great States*\n\nHeaven and earth arise together,\nYin and yang are born in tandem,\nThe four seasons move in concert,\nThe five phases share a root,\nJoy and sorrow dwell in the same gate,\nFortune and misfortune share the same door.\n\nTherefore, what is called \"peace\" is also called \"danger\",\nAnd what is called \"danger\" is also called \"peace\".\nWhat is called \"preservation\" is also called \"ruin\",\nAnd what is called \"ruin\" is also called \"preservation\".\nWhat is called \"existence\" is also called \"non-existence\",\nAnd what is called \"non-existence\" is also called \"existence\".\n\nThe Way by which to clarify it:\n\nThe tiger and leopard, with their resplendent forms,\nAmple breadth and wide expanse,\nFirm claws and teeth, robust muscles and skin,\nAbundant fur and striking markings—\nThus their brilliance is manifest.\nThey grasp the hundred beasts yet are mastered by man.\n\nThe honored and fragrant grasses,\nWith their radiant hues and sweet aromas—\nThus they are beloved by the common folk,\nYet their roots are easily harmed.\n\nThe sovereign of great states,\nWith vast lands and numerous people,\nMighty prestige and favored form,\nOverwhelming might and illustrious name—\nThus he displays his neighboring states,\nYet endangers himself in doing so.\n\nIf he holds the Dao,\nHis foundation is as firm as the盤石,\nHis peace as secure as the太山.\n\nIf he loses the Dao,\nHis danger is greater than a pile of卵,\nHis weight lighter than a feather.\n\nIf both are weak,\nThe first to suffer is he.\n\nIf both are disordered,\nThe first to perish is he.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign of great states\nIs the ladder to tyranny,\nAnd the threshold to annihilation.\n\nHence, the sovereign of great states\nStands alone, without a peer,\nHis name revered like a lofty mountain,\nHis borders blocked on three sides,\nHis rivers flowing together,\nAll things beneath him—\nHe is the hub of the诸侯,\nThe treasury of膏腴,\nThe corpse of strength,\nThe master of power and prestige,\nBound by unmeasurable security,\nEncircled by narrow and perilous gates,\nAbundant yet constrained,\nVast yet limited,\nWith territories spanning thousands of miles,\nRich in treasures and marvels,\nHis people few in burdens,\nCattle and horses everywhere,\nCountless chariots and boats,\nOverwhelming stores of grain and arms—\nYet those who dwell within are at ease,\nThose who pass through are detained,\nAs if he were grass and wood,\nFilling the mountains and fields.\nThe fields are plentiful in harvest,\nThe hunts yield abundant game,\nHis taxes are tenfold greater—\nThus all beneath heaven desire to submit,\nAnd the诸侯 seek to attach themselves.\n\nThe generals and officers,\nWith their million-strong armies in battle array,\nTheir territories easily defended,\nTheir strongholds naturally advantageous,\nTheir land conforming to the will of Heaven,\nTheir strategies aligning with the earth’s advantage—\nThey suspend life and determine death,\nTo unite with them is to gain power,\nTo oppose them is to lose one’s lineage.\nThus the ancestral temples are honored,\nAnd the诸侯 fear them.\n\nIf the Dao is applied fully,\nHe can unite and dominate.\nIf prestige is sufficient,\nHe can issue commands and punish.\nIf virtue is sufficient,\nHe can exalt benevolence and govern with order.\nIf righteousness is sufficient,\nHe can clarify principles and embrace all.\nIf wealth is sufficient,\nHe can expand his lands and secure them.\nIf treasures are sufficient,\nHe can make his state rich—\nThus the诸侯 delight in him,\nAnd the generals and officers profit from him.\n\nTherefore, from ancient times to this day,\nThe passive overcomes the active—\nA truth unchanging for ten thousand generations.\nWhy is this so?\n\nBecause the void receives the full,\nThe none responds to the having.\nHe does not regard great tasks as great,\nNor elevated things as lofty,\nBut always holds them as lowly and insignificant.\n\nThus the enlightened king and sage sovereign,\nWhen ruling great states,\nBestows the Dao yet does not seek to impose it,\nActs with humility yet does not seek to humble himself,\nEnvelops the lands of the诸侯,\nYet none dare oppose him.\nHis virtue encompasses the strength of the诸侯,\nYet none dare neglect him.\nHe lowers himself in courtesy,\nYet seeks to attach others by sincerity.\nHe values loyalty, integrity, and trustworthiness,\nAnd places scholars and worthy men above all.\nHe hastens to till and weave,\nTo amass wealth and provisions.\nHe connects alliances, both vertical and horizontal,\nTo guard against unforeseen calamities.\nHe opens his granaries and treasuries,\nBestowing wealth to nourish the aged,\nTo feed the widowed and orphaned,\nTo relieve the poor and aid the destitute,\nTo honor those of humble station—\nYet takes nothing,\nGives nothing,\nMaintains simplicity and ease,\nAnd acts without force.\n\nThough the诸侯 may be greedy,\nOr cruel and deceitful,\nOr arrogant and proud,\nOr rely on brute strength,\nAnd though they may not love what is good,\nOr wish to follow what is right,\nYet when he lowers himself in quietude,\nThey mend their ways,\nReflect on their errors,\nAnd reform themselves.\nThey surrender their lands,\nOffer their treasures,\nSubmit in person—\nEven to the point of willing to die as his subjects.\nThe ministers of the ancestral altars\nAre those who dwell in small, weak states.\n\nTo follow the Dao in action,\nTo govern with moderation—\nTo be rich in chariots and boats,\nTo be strong in armor and weapons,\nTo hold loyalty and obedience in high regard,\nTo value simplicity and revere tillage,\nTo ensure that all have their due,\nTo take nothing from the people,\nTo establish clear hierarchies,\nTo unite them as if they were father and son,\nTo treat them as his own flesh and blood—\nThus he can die with them,\nAnd they will follow him willingly.\nThe sovereign of great states,\nThough he may bear the weight of many strong states,\nAnd hold the balance of power,\nThough his virtue is low and his heart is benevolent,\nAs hungry as a tiger,\nAs furious as a rushing torrent—\nYet he does not give freely,\nBut always seeks to devour others.\nHe gains the hearts of Heaven and the people,\nYet his enemies are like a spring’s source,\nHis threats are like an unpredictable tide—\nHe exhausts himself in body and spirit,\nSuspends his very life,\nIn a state of ceaseless anxiety—\nThus his spirit is scattered,\nHis mind is troubled,\nHis anger is unleashed,\nHis calamities are transferred onto himself.\n\nThe one who takes from above\nHas great form, mighty prestige,\nEncompassing virtue, and heavy influence—\nThis is what others profit from.\n\nThe one who takes from below\nHas narrow lands, few people,\nHeavy influence, and meager virtue—\nThis is what others exploit.\n\nTherefore, without battle he can destroy another’s city,\nWithout attack he can surrender another’s stronghold—\nIf his lands are vast,\nHis commands are revered,\nHis ancestral temples honored,\nHis virtue and power flowing—\nThis is the aspiration of great states.\n\nHe befriends great states,\nConnects in harmony,\nAnd forms alliances.\nWhen calamities arise,\nThe great states take pity on him.\nWhen neighboring states are distant,\nThe great states seek him out.\nHe bends beneath one,\nYet raises above many.\nHis ancestral altars are honored,\nHis state is prosperous,\nHis armies are strong,\nHis people are complete,\nHis blessings extend endlessly—\nThis is the wish of small states.\n\nThus, to border neighboring lands,\nTo hold power without movement,\nTo humble oneself first and gain first,\nTo let the lowly control the proud,\nTo let the gentle overcome the turbulent—\nThis is the way of the great,\nWho obtain what they desire.\nWhy is this so?\n\nBecause the natural Dao cannot be forced.\nWater moves and flows downward,\nPeople act and seek advantage.\nTo release what is held,\nTo assign what is done—\nWhen many are weak and united,\nIt arises unexpectedly.\nThis is how the strong perish.\n\nThus the great must humble themselves.\n\n**Pinning the Four Treasures of the Imperial Library**\n*Discourse on the Dao and Virtue, Volume Five*\n**Han Dynasty** – Compiled by **Yán Zūn**\n\n**The Mysteries of All Things**\n\nWood’s growth begins:\nIts branches arise from its boughs,\nIts boughs from its trunk,\nIts trunk from its root,\nIts root from its foundation,\nIts foundation from its roots—\nIts roots from Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth receive this from the formless.\nFlowers and fruit emerge from the presence of *qi*.\n*Qi* arises from the four seasons,\nThe four seasons from yin and yang,\nYin and yang from Heaven and Earth—\nHeaven and Earth receive this from the formless.\n\nThus, I know the Dao:\nWith the form of nothingness,\nWith the appearance of no shape,\nOpening the void,\nGuiding the spirit,\nHarmonizing Heaven and Earth,\nBalancing yin and yang,\nCalming the four seasons,\nResolving the myriad regions—\nAll differing forms and transformations,\nEach attaining its natural course,\nBeginning and end in the constant *wuwei*,\nWithout preference or aversion,\nIn great harmony with all things—\nEach thing finds its proper way.\n\nThe virtuous person attains this:\nGathering and expanding,\nPure and tranquil,\nSoft and yielding,\nSilent and indistinct,\nMuddled and undifferentiated,\nRen in its natural grace,\nHarmonious and moist,\nLuminous and vast,\nPeaceful and boundless,\nSubtle yet encompassing all things—\nAll affairs return to the Nameless,\nBeginning and end in endless cycles,\nFortune arises spontaneously.\nWhen action aligns with desire,\nStillness averts misfortune.\n\nThe harm lies in:\nExaltation above others,\nThreatening power,\nRigidity and arrogance,\nHarshness and excess,\nSwiftness and recklessness,\nOverbearing strength,\nExtreme ambition,\nGrandiose schemes,\nUnchecked dominance,\nBlinding brilliance,\nDazzling clarity,\nFlashing prominence—\nThe mighty perish in their smallness.\nWhen action strays from desire,\nStillness brings injury:\nThe mind grows troubled,\nThe will grows weary,\nThe spirit returns to normal,\n*Qi* becomes agitated,\nMovement contracts,\nExpansion withdraws,\nThe body grows constrained,\nThe posture stoops,\nThe voice grows low,\nThe manner becomes rigid,\nThe bearing humbles,\nThe words grow cautious,\nThe countenance shifts,\nThe conduct aligns—\nEven the virtuous may falter.\nSentence is passed,\nWords are justified,\nYet at death, one clings to life.\nServing Heaven’s decree,\nChanging nature,\nAltering disposition,\nFinding joy in poverty,\nEmbracing hardship,\nMaking humility constant,\nHonoring Heaven,\nRespecting the *Way*,\nViewing others as sovereigns,\nRanking oneself below cattle and dogs—\nThe Heavenly Net descends naturally.\nAlas! How clear the warning!\n\nThe two paths diverge,\nYet both stem from the Dao—\nOne persists, one fades.\nThus, conduct is the tribunal of self-cultivation,\nTiming and sequence belong to the great destiny.\n\nThe virtuous person establishes themselves\nLike the deaf, like the mute,\nLike the unadorned, like the plain—\nHolding words within the heart,\nEver in silent stillness,\nYet when speech arises, pondering deeply,\nVoices like weeping, harmonious and fitting,\nTimely and measured—\nBringing benefit to all,\nResponding with modest words,\nStraightforward yet unadorned.\nThough words fill the world, they are not excessive;\nThough they stir the four seas, they are not hasty;\nThough they connect all things, they do not possess.\nWords move the world, each finding their desire.\nIn governing the age,\nQi and spirit are obscured and hidden,\nForm and bearing concealed—\nDwelling like one in fear,\nAppearance lacking,\nDiminished and faint,\nMelting like ice dissolving,\nExtending with the times,\nRetreating with the world,\nAligning with Heaven’s sorrow,\nHeart aching with pity,\nPlans unexecuted,\nTurning with the times,\nResting in humility,\nStopping at sufficiency,\nLowering oneself,\nPasturing the self,\nTaking joy in the lowly,\nFlowing like water,\nUnerring.\nLowering further, lowering to the utmost,\nUntil reaching the boundless—\nThe world responds accordingly.\nThus, one can attain dominion.\nWhy so?\nHuman nature delights in honor and favor,\nHates humiliation and disgrace,\nYet when lowered, resentment grows;\nWhen raised, delight follows;\nWhen stopped, contempt arises.\nThis is the universal path of ancient and modern,\nThe natural principle of human hearts.\nThe worthy follow it; the petty exceed it.\nThus, in honoring virtue and conduct,\nThere is no calamity.\n\nIn ancient times, governing the people,\nNone were abandoned.\nThe ministers of Jie and Zhou could be ordered to obey;\nThe soldiers of Qin and Chu could be led to follow.\nThus, by winning their hearts,\nThe world could not fail to submit.\nWives and concubines were not forced—\nHow could this be achieved?\nNobility brings reverence from the world,\nWealth brings possession of the four seas,\nPower and might are boundless,\nDominion and authority are absolute—\nYet these are what people fear.\nTo depart on foot, leaving the ranks,\nTo rise like a great bird, like a dragon ascending,\nTo assist the Son of Heaven,\nTo spread the Way, to display virtue,\nTo enact all benefits,\nTo illuminate ancestors—\nThese are what people desire.\nUsing what people fear to seek what they desire,\nWords are unseemly, conduct disrespectful.\nThough one holds great jade and precious treasures,\nThough one rides in fine carriages with four horses,\nThe hearts of the worthy would still doubt and reject.\nThe hidden and profound would remain concealed.\nThe virtuous would not come.\nWhen inner cultivation is refined,\nQi and spirit overflow outward.\nWithout the labor of four horses,\nWithout the cost of jade and treasures,\nScholars from across the land would respond in chorus,\nRising like the wind, gathering heroes and talents,\nConverging like bees to the hive.\nThus, the ancient revered this Way—\nWhy?\n\nWords conform to Heaven and Earth,\nYet do not rely on conduct to align with human hearts.\nAchieving without display,\nCompleting without possession,\nNature acts without contrivance—\nAll things return to it as the sovereign of the world.\nThe chapter on *Wuwei* [Non-Action].\n\nThe divine patterns, the natural Way—\nNothing is not generated, nothing is not generated.\nWhat is not and what is,\nWhat is and what is not—\nAll generate.\nFrom this perspective,\nSorrow does not generate sorrow,\nJoy does not generate joy.\nNot sorrow, not joy—\nThen sorrow and joy arise.\nThus, those dwelling in calamity attain blessing,\nThose dwelling in blessing incur calamity.\nThe master of calamity and blessing lies in *wu* [non-being].\nWithout form, yet heard—\nDeep and far-reaching.\nThus, *wuwei* [non-action] is greater than action,\nAnd action is lesser than *wuwei*.\nThe virtue of *wu* is thin,\nWhile the virtue of *wuwei* is thick.\nTherefore, the Sage does not act as if acting,\nDoes not act as if not acting,\nDoes not act as if dying,\nDoes not act as if living—\nPlaying in the realm of *wu*,\nDwelling between life and death,\nChanging and responding naturally,\nEver constant.\nThus, unseen yet clear,\nUnheard yet keen,\nSupporting Heaven and Earth,\nAdorning the Way,\nNurturing the spirit,\nGuiding all things,\nRuling the empire,\nGovern the people,\nRelieving emotions,\nFreeing the mind—\nReturning to the origin,\nTrue non-action.\nNot laboring for life,\nNot undertaking deeds,\nNot applying benevolence,\nNot bestowing benefit,\nTeaching without leading,\nGuiding without knowledge,\nSevering what the people delight in to follow their nature,\nPermitting what the people hate to obtain their will.\n\nExiting the door of life’s end,\nEntering the path of eternal youth,\nSoaring in the boundless,\nAt ease in the Great Primordium,\nObscure and indistinct,\nMysterious and vast—\nNone know its origin.\nThick as twilight’s dimness,\nThe world has no affairs.\nTasting the tasteless,\nPerceiving the formless—\nThus, able to distinguish differences,\nClarify right and wrong.\nBefore there is definition,\nBefore there is inclination,\nBefore courage and reputation arise,\nBefore fortune is attained or calamity born,\nBefore blessing or misfortune is generated—\nThe blessing of *wu* arises in silence,\nThe calamity of *wu* ceases without name.\nThe ruler is at ease, the people content,\nThe world in peace.\nThus, disasters are foreseen and mourned,\nBlessings are prolonged and sought,\nTyranny over the ruler is met with death,\nInsult to parents is avenged,\nDifficulties are provoked and broken,\nRebellions are crushed and extinguished,\nDefenses are summoned and destroyed,\nTreachery is invited and punished.\nWhen courage and reputation appear, they conflict with Heaven;\nWhen cleverness and fame arise, they oppose the Way;\nWhen action brings joy, labor is great yet virtue is small;\nWhen deeds bring delight, the benefit is meager.\nThus, loyalty and trust are undermined,\nRight conduct is abandoned,\nNatural order collapses.\nThose who lurk and steal glory become evident,\nThose who usurp authority are exposed,\nThose who create chaos prosper,\nThose who deceive thrive,\nRight and wrong are inverted,\nHeaven is defied—\nThe world tilts greatly,\nThings lose their nature,\nFamilies and states fall into ruin.\nThus, the best way to eliminate disasters\nIs to have no disasters at all.\nThe best way to achieve governance\nIs to remain in silent stillness.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous act before the beginning,\nRest in the boundlessness of *wu*,\nSpreading the Way, bestowing virtue,\nChanging in silence, angering in non-anger,\nSpeaking in non-speech,\nAttacking without daring,\nDefending without end,\nThreatening without force.\nRepaying grudges before they arise,\nPlotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nSevering their roots before they manifest,\nPreventing their occurrence before they begin—\nThus, even the slightest matter is treated as a great mountain,\nAnd great affairs are treated as fine threads.\nContinuous and meticulous,\nRespectful and cautious,\nAs if at the very start,\nAs if ever new.\nNot seeking what is desired,\nNot pursuing what is convenient,\nEver opposing the conventional,\nAlone preserving the origin,\nBenefiting with the times,\nDaily progressing without force—\nThus, things naturally become great.\nTherefore, when great calamity is about to arise,\nIt is like a harmful wind entering the body—\nBefore it manifests, treat it with caution.\nWhen it is still in the skin and hair,\nUse warm compresses to drive it out.\nWhen it reaches the muscles and tendons,\nUse acupuncture to extract it.\nWhen it penetrates to the organs,\nUse medicine to purge it.\nWhen it sinks to the marrow,\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate it,\nEven transformation cannot cure it.\nWhen great affairs are about to emerge,\nThey are like water issuing from mountains—\nBeginning with dampness,\nManifesting in ripples,\nFlowing as streams,\nGathering into rivers,\nSwelling into seas—\nDeep and boundless, unfathomable.\nThus, the Sage establishes function and reputation\nThrough subtlety, achieving clarity through obscurity,\nThrough smallness, achieving greatness,\nThrough concealment, achieving prominence.\nTheir intent is beneath the people,\nYet they become sovereigns.\nTheir威 reverberates within the four seas,\nAll under Heaven align.\nTheir command is received, their authority unchallenged—\nNone can resist.\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir clarity matches the sun and moon.\nThus, those who speak much in assent,\nThough many in number, cannot be trusted.\n\nThe mind that is easily swayed is hard to accumulate,\nAnd its changes cannot be traced—\nThus, the Sage keeps the heart in stillness, unmoved,\nThe mouth in silence, unspoken,\nThe eyes in quiet, unseen,\nThe ears in repose, unheard,\nTheir actions as boundless as Heaven and Earth,\nTheir tranquility as profound as the **Taoist void** (*xūshén* 虚神).\nThey act without effort, yet all is accomplished;\nThey speak not, yet all is believed.\nAdvancing, they know no limits;\nRetreating, they find no bounds.\nTheir body bears no slight affliction,\nTheir nation suffers no minor calamity—\nWhy is this so?\n\nPeril lies in what seems not perilous,\nDestruction in what seems not destroyed.\nYet clarity comes from solitary vision,\nAnd movement from the unseen.\n\nTheir ease is simple to uphold—\nThe unfallen man is easy to heal,\nThe undangerous state is easy to strategize,\nThe budding ailment is easy to treat,\nThe slight and weak misfortune is easy to fear—\nHow might this be done?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"A cart that is not yet broken, a child who can drive it;\nWhen it tilts and overturns,\nA thousand men cannot steady it.\nBefore the egg is cracked, a single wave of the hand could stop it—\nOnce broken, even the finest nets cannot restrain it.\nA fledgling bird, before its wings are strong,\nA single tug could halt it—\nWhen it soars above the clouds,\nNo snare could bind it.\nA newborn calf, still fresh with its mother’s milk,\nA single rope could control it—\nOnce matured, even the most skilled hunter cannot restrain it.\nThe tiger.\"*\n\nThe ruler holds all beasts in check—\nThe cow and horse he feeds, the sword and shield he wields,\nYet none can hinder him.\n\nThus, a trickle of water, ceaseless and unhurried,\nBecomes the ocean’s tide.\nA small serpent, not yet slain,\nTransforms into a divine dragon.\n\nAccumulated goodness, though slight,\nReaches the heights of fortune.\nAccumulated evil, though minor,\nLeads to ruin.\n\nHence, the ruler who inherits the Way\nHas no grievances, no malevolence.\nHis ministers are harmonious, his people obedient,\nNeighboring states trade freely, and none dare to slander.\nPeaceful and undisturbed, his realm is serene,\nThe high and low in unity, all gathered in accord.\n\nAt such times, he governs without coercion,\nHolds without force—\nWithout action, without schemes,\nNone can overcome him.\n\nWhen dangers loom but signs are not yet clear,\nWhen calamities stir but roots are not yet firm,\nThe ruler’s fate lies in himself, not others.\nHis counsel need not be that of the Sage,\nNor his vigilance that of the mighty warrior.\n\nWhen he lies in bed, the disasters are already averted.\n\nYet when the ruler strays from the Way,\nHis ministers grow resentful,\nNeighboring states refuse trade,\nOfficials weaken and decay,\nDisasters arise—\nSmall and weak, like the down of a bird,\nBut not yet manifest.\n\nAt this juncture, wise men deliberate deeply,\nEvents stir but have not yet moved,\nPerils grow but do not yet overwhelm,\nDisasters deepen but do not yet destroy.\n\nWhen the ruler strays from rectitude,\nHis ministers plot in error,\nNeighboring states harbor grudges,\nThe people hesitate in doubt,\nDisasters have already taken root—\nWicked lords may rise but lack true support,\nAlliances form but do not bind,\nOr bind but are not firm.\n\nAt this time, he honors the virtuous,\nLowers the proud,\nBreaks the stubborn,\nListens to subtle advice,\nSeeks faults before they manifest,\nDoes not resent his counselors,\nAnd guards against calamities before they arise.\n\nThus, fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen,\nLife and death from the subtle.\nThese two forces intertwine—\nThe wind shifts, bending and stretching,\nWaves surge, advancing and retreating,\nChaos and order blend unseen.\nTo hear it is beyond hearing,\nTo see it is beyond sight,\nSkill cannot grasp it,\nWisdom cannot discern it.\n\nHence, the Sage cultivates the Way,\nTeaches through his own being—\nHe does not act to correct what has not yet gone awry,\nYet all things settle in ease.\nHe does not nurture,\nYet all things flourish naturally.\nHis movement aligns with fortune,\nHis stillness avoids disaster.\n\nThe heavens stretch vast and dark,\nIts source unseen—\nHe governs before chaos takes hold,\nCorrects before imbalance tilts,\nRestrains the wicked before their schemes mature,\nSeals falsehood at its inception,\nShuts the door to evil,\nBlocks the path of wrong.\n\nBefore the sprouts stir,\nBefore the signs appear,\nBefore the roots are visible,\nBefore the decay is evident—\nHe teaches without teaching,\nGuides without naming,\nKnows without knowing,\nActs without form.\n\nHe does not stir to govern,\nYet governs with effortless mastery.\nHe does not grasp to control,\nYet controls with natural precision.\n\nTo seek what is sought,\nTo desire what is desired—\nIf he could guard the end as the beginning,\nHold fast what he should not possess,\nAnd act before the first stir of chaos,\nTurning back before the first thought of error,\nThen even if it seems not to succeed,\nAll things would unfold naturally.\n\nIf he disturbs his vital essence,\nClouds his clarity,\nAnd fails to reach his true desires,\nHis movements stray from what he seeks,\nHis stillness guards what he craves—\nThen wealth and learning become his burden.\n\nOnly he who chains his passions,\nTransforms his nature,\nShifts his heart and mind,\nFinds joy in desirelessness,\nAnd takes delight in effortless action—\nThese are the Dao and virtue.\n\nThus, contemplating the Way is like cherishing a parent,\nHating wealth is like losing one’s body,\nSeeking thought beyond thought,\nDesiring desire beyond desire—\nThis is the path to clarity.\n\nTo exhaust the profound and reach the utmost,\nTo grasp what others cannot,\nTo achieve what none can,\nTo attain what no one possesses—\nHis spirit serene, his form composed,\nHe lies still as a corpse, stands rigid as withered wood,\nThinks not, considers not,\nAs if knowing nothing at all.\n\nHe lets all things be natural,\nOrders all things to act of their own accord.\nEmpty and still, his body is one with all things,\nEach creature thrives in its own way—\nLike a hillock or a mound,\nLike a vast plain or a towering height,\nHis actions are effortless yet contrary to the world,\nAll things respond accordingly.\nThus, he can be profound and far-reaching,\nCovering the world like the heavens,\nMoving with the divine—\nYet he does not dare to create goodness,\nFor goodness is the Way itself.\n\n**Chapter: The Virtue of Dao and Virtue**\n\nThe Dao and virtue are pure and clear,\nLike the mingling of yin and yang.\nAll things follow as if they were the root or the stem,\nTheir numbers endless, their transformations boundless—\nLife and death, flourishing and decline,\nAll share in fortune and defense.\n\nThe intention of the Dao is the heart of the heavens and earth,\nTo nurture life and bring ease.\nIt does not hate or harm,\nYet commands all things.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is the king of all things,\nBringing benefit to them—\nIf they are not benefited, they suffer fear.\nThe Sage fears greatly,\nFor fear comes from what may follow.\nHe delves deeply into its origins,\nFor the best medicine is naturalness itself.\n\nHow might this be made clear?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n\nThe heavens and earth do not know\nThe virtue’s workings,\nYet all things can be.\nThe myriad creatures do not see\nThe heavens and earth’s ways,\nYet they can endure.\nThe common folk do not recognize\nThe ruler’s true purpose,\nYet they can be at peace.\n\nThus, the Way is vast and boundless,\nIts source unseen.\n\nThe four limbs and nine orifices do not comprehend the heart’s guidance,\nYet they can remain complete.\n\nFor the myriad things to have a sovereign is like the form having a heart:\nThe heart, to the body, neither lags nor leads—\nIt permeates the blood and vessels,\nReaching everywhere without fail.\nWithin and without, front and back—\nIt does not err in movement or rest.\nThe vital and the subtle flow together,\nThe external and internal harmonize,\nThus all can be preserved intact.\n\nTherefore, the ancient emperors and kings\nFollowed the **Dao** and observed the **virtue/power**,\nUniting the clear and the turbid,\nLeading the **Great Harmony**,\nNot because they were born with knowledge,\nOr founded the world,\nOr guided customs,\nOr sought to enlighten the people—\nThey merely sought to paint the people.\n\nThey blocked the people’s eyes,\nSo that their hearts could not know,\nReturning them to the natural.\n\nThus, they placed the people in the **manifest**,\nWhile themselves dwelled in the **obscure**,\nTaught them with the **unspoken**,\nGuided them with the **formless**—\nFilial piety and fraternal duty were not displayed,\nRen and righteousness were not prominent,\nThe sovereign had no glory,\nThe wise had no fame.\n\nWithout teaching, the people were naturally at ease;\nWithout guidance, the people naturally understood.\nThis **harmony** spread throughout the Four Seas,\nThis **non-action** reached the Eight Directions.\nTheir movements aligned with the **Dao** of heaven and earth,\nTheir stillness followed the **virtue/power** of the **Way**.\nAll things flourished together,\nEach knew its place,\nNames and realities both arose,\nEach knew its due.\n\nThe **and-harmonizing qi** flowed through the universe,\nThe unknowing infants were without desire,\nWithout affairs, without merit,\nTheir hearts like wood and soil,\nTheir wills like dead ash—\nThey did not see differences or similarities,\nThey did not perceive fortune or misfortune.\nThus, the people were easy to govern,\nAnd the world could be made tranquil.\n\nTherefore, **ease** is the people’s benefit,\n**Life** is the people’s return.\n\nThe people strayed from **ease** and abandoned **life**, becoming hard to govern,\nFor they knew too much.\nWhen the people know, they crave **life**—\nCraving **life**, they begin affairs—\nBeginning affairs, they pursue **function** and **name**—\nPursuing **function** and **name**, they rise to **anger** and **contention**—\nRising to **anger** and **contention**, great deceit is born—\nGreat deceit born, then governance becomes difficult indeed.\n\nThus, when **knowledge** is the ruler’s **virtue/power**,\nThe world’s cleverness, cunning, deceit, and guile multiply,\nStrange creatures arise in abundance,\nPassions grow boundless,\nLuxury and excess know no end,\nWickedness and crookedness prevail,\nThe weak and the strong vie in strife,\nValleys and rivers bear different names,\nGreat calamities spring forth.\n\nSubjects deceive their lords,\nChildren disrupt their fathers,\nWhite becomes black,\nAbsence is called presence,\nNames shift, reality alters,\nAnd the age of **harmony** is shattered—\n**life** is destroyed.\n\nThe world turns chaotic—\nUnstable, it cannot be secured—\nThe armies roll, lightly armed yet reckless—\nWithin the seas, they attack each other,\nAnd countless die, their blood flowing like rivers—\nSorrow and resentment fill the land,\nThe **qi** of their suffering moves the **Heavenly**,\nStars scatter, sun and moon lose their light,\nYin and yang fall out of order,\nAll things are harmed—\nMountains wither, valleys run dry,\nThe earth turns red for thousands of miles,\nThe world is in ruin,\nAnd people resort to cannibalism—\nNot the **fault** of **Heaven**!\n\nWhen the ruler favors **knowledge** and **cleverness**,\nAnd teaches all the people,\nHe abandons **virtue/power** and **purity**,\nKnows only himself, worries only for himself—\nNot seeing what he desires,\nHe closes the people’s ears and eyes.\n\nHis eyes do not feast on the Five Colors,\nHis mouth does not taste the Five Flavors—\nThe ruler is like **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nThe people like grass and trees—\nDwelling in caves, living in holes,\nFinding **ease** in mountains and valleys,\nDrinking from streams, eating from fields,\nNot seeking the Five Grains—\nThey know not their mothers, nor recognize their fathers,\nTheir clans are lost—\nStuporous and dim-witted,\nThey do not distinguish east from west,\nMen do not love women, nor children their parents—\nWood and stone are not despised,\nGold and jade are not prized—\nJade and gold grow tangled together,\nThey dwell in mixed confusion—\nThe world unites in one heart,\nThe Eight Directions guard together—\nThe **borer** and **worm** do not act,\nPoisonous beasts do not rise—\nThe **Divine Dragon** dwells among men,\nThe **Qilin** and **Phoenix** play in the courtyard—\nThe **Zephyr** soars, the **Fragrant Wind** blows,\nThe **Jade Springs** flow sweetly,\nThe **Sweet Dew** falls abundantly,\nThe **Red Grass** flourishes,\nThe **Auspicious Rice** grows lush—\nAll things live long—\nThis is **Heaven**’s blessing,\nThe ruler **names** the **unnamed** while **knowing** the **unknown**.\n\nThus, **knowledge** and **folly** are seen as equal,\n**Knowledge** and **Wisdom** are aligned with the **Dao**—\nGovernance follows this,\nSometimes bringing **harm**, sometimes **benefit**—\nTo see **harm** clearly is to gain **Great Peace**,\nTo see **benefit** clearly is to bring **harm** to all things—\nThus, **Wisdom** and **Knowledge** cannot be avoided,\nA tranquil **Heaven** and a peaceful **Earth** are the **virtue/power**’s **favor**,\nThe common folk do not perceive it—\nTherefore, **purity** and **purity** run deep,\nImmeasurable, boundless—\nOpposite to all things,\nNo one can resist its **overflow**—\nIts **dissolution** and **dispersion** are vast,\nIts **fleeting** and **vanishing** are profound—\nIt **responds** to things without form,\nGuides the **Dao** and **virtue/power**,\nNourishes the **Divine** and **Bright**,\nEmbraces all within the Six Extremes—\nNone escape its **virtue/power**,\nNone avoid its **ren**—\nThus, **life** is preserved,\nAnd **death** comes naturally at **Heaven**’s appointed time—\n**Nature** is upheld!\n\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things **generate** themselves.\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,\nYet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.\n**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,\nYet they rule themselves.\n\nThus, **Heaven** and **Earth** endure for a hundred million years,\nAnd the **Dao** rules them all—\nThe **Yang** is resplendent, and **Heaven** rules it,\nThe **Yin** is serene, and **Earth** rules it—\nThe **naked** dwell in holes, and the **Sage** rules them,\nThe **winged** soar in the void, and the **Divine Phoenix** rules them,\nThe **furred** tread firmly, and the **Qilin** rules them,\nThe **scaled** reside in water, and the **Divine Dragon** rules them,\nThe **armored** dwell in marshes, and the **Spirit Tortoise** rules them—\nThe Nine Rivers flow together, and the **Seas** rule them.\n\nAll these nine categories do not **force** themselves to rule,\nYet the things **return** to them naturally—\nNo **schemes** are needed, yet all things are governed—\nNo **ren** and **virtue/power** are imposed, yet all things **attach**—\nNo **cleverness** is exerted, yet all things **fear**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFor they **align** with the **Dao** and **harmony**,\nAnd do not **use** things to **act**—\nThus, things **act** of themselves.\n\nTherefore, the **Seas** rule—\nNot through **accumulating** **virtue/power** and **governance**,\nNor **piling up** **ren** and **love**,\nNor **displaying** **Divine** and **Bright** **virtue/power**,\nNor **adorned** **rituals** and **justice**,\nNor **expanding** **speech** and **modesty**,\nNor **decorating** **cleverness** and **skill** to please them—\nNor through **strange actions** and **variations**,\nNor **establishing** **authority** and **power**,\nNor **brandishing** **military might** and **terror**,\nNor **prioritizing** **life** and **growth**,\nNor **exhausting** **efforts** in a hundred affairs to **control** them—\n\n**Quietude** and **stillness** in the lowly place,\n**Virtuelessness** and **non-seeking**—\nThen the myriad rivers come of themselves—\nThe myriad rivers do not **hear** of the **Seas**’ **schemes**,\nYet they are **transformed** by its **virtue/power**,\nAnd **return** in reverence—\nNor is it through **restraints** and **bindings**,\nNor **teachings** with **limits**,\nNor **drawing** **boundaries** of east and west,\nAnd **forcing** them to **conform**—\n\nYet water **pierces** gold, **shatters** stone,\n**Bores** through cliffs, **collapses** mountains,\n**Rushes** over hills and mounds—\nAll this to **attend** the **Seas**,\nAnd never **return**—\nTheir **forms** and **natures** align,\nTheir **affairs** follow **nature**—\nThus, **humility** and **lowliness** are the **Dao**’s great **virtue/power**!\n\nA hundred **harms** cannot injure it,\n**Knowledge** cannot **take** it,\nIt **strengthens** without **battle**,\nIt **rules** without **threat** or **force**—\nSilent and **virtueless**, yet **strong**—\nIt **responds** to all things in **harmony**—\nThus, **valleys** and **gorges** are lowly,\nYet they are not **bounded** by east and west,\nSo they **reach** and never **end**—\nThe **Seas** are in the lowly place,\nYet they are not **limited** by **greatness**,\nSo they **rule** and never **cease**—\n\nTherefore, the **Desires** of the **Enlightened Ruler** and **Sage Sovereign**\nAre to **cherish** the people—\nWith **nature**’s **virtue/power** and the **Sage**’s **bearing**,\nWith **humility** in speech and **reverence** in conduct,\nTo **compare** oneself to the common folk,\nTo **regard** one’s **body** as **Earth**,\nTo **honor** the people as **Heaven**—\nBrightly **knowing** yet **immeasurable**,\nLoftily **able** yet **unfathomable**,\nDeeply **perceptive** yet **unobstructed**,\nClearly **illuminated** yet **unblocked**—\nNot to **exploit** things,\nBut to **follow** the people—\nThus, the people **walk** upon it as if it were **Earth**,\nThey **lean** upon it as if it were **Divine**—\nIt is always above the people,\nRuling the **lands** and **soils**,\nMatching **Heaven** in its **virtue/power**—\nIts **desires** come before the people’s,\nIts **humility** is after the people’s—\nIt **labors** while the people **rest**,\nIt **sacrifices** while the people **gain**—\nIn the **highest** place, yet the people **live**,\nIn the **lowest** place, yet the people **find ease**—\nBecause the people **live**, it **wears** them without **burden**,\nBecause the people **find ease**, it **serves** them without **harm**—\nThus, the world **pushes** it forward,\nAnd **draws** it near—\nIt **delights** without **weariness**,\nIt **rejoices** without **satiation**—\nTherefore, the **Sage**’s **rule** is such—\nNot **seeking** the people,\nBut the people **seeking** it.\n\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things **generate** themselves.\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,\nYet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.\n**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,\nYet they rule themselves.\n\nThus, **Heaven** and **Earth** endure for a hundred million years,\nAnd the **Dao** rules them all—\nThe **Yang** is resplendent, and **Heaven** rules it,\nThe **Yin** is serene, and **Earth** rules it—\nThe **naked** dwell in holes, and the **Sage** rules them,\nThe **winged** soar in the void, and the **Divine Phoenix** rules them,\nThe **furred** tread firmly, and the **Qilin** rules them,\nThe **scaled** reside in water, and the **Divine Dragon** rules them,\nThe **armored** dwell in marshes, and the **Spirit Tortoise** rules them—\nThe Nine Rivers flow together, and the **Seas** rule them.\n\nAll these nine categories do not **force** themselves to rule,\nYet the things **return** to them naturally—\nNo **schemes** are needed, yet all things are governed—\nNo **ren** and **virtue/power** are imposed, yet all things **attach**—\nNo **cleverness** is exerted, yet all things **fear**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFor they **align** with the **Dao** and **harmony**,\nAnd do not **use** things to **act**—\nThus,

**growth**,\nNor **exhausting** **efforts** in a hundred affairs to **control** them—\n\n**Quietude** and **stillness** in the lowly place,\n**Virtuelessness** and **non-seeking**—\nThen the myriad rivers come of themselves—\nThe myriad rivers do not **hear** of the **Seas**’ **schemes**,\nYet they are **transformed** by its **virtue/power**,\nAnd **return** in reverence—\nNor is it through **restraints** and **bindings**,\nNor **teachings** with **limits**,\nNor **drawing** **boundaries** of east and west,\nAnd **forcing** them to **conform**—\n\nYet water **pierces** gold, **shatters** stone,\n**Bores** through cliffs, **collapses** mountains,\n**Rushes** over hills and mounds—\nAll this to **attend** the **Seas**,\nAnd never **return**—\nTheir **forms** and **natures** align,\nTheir **affairs** follow **nature**—\nThus, **humility** and **lowliness** are the **Dao**’s great **virtue/power**!\n\nThe **Way** is not sought for the people’s **profit**—\nThe people **profit** from it.\nIt is not **exalted** by the people—\nThe people **exalt** it.\nIt is not **prioritized** by the people—\nThe people **prioritize** it.\n\nThus, it can **exhaust** decay, **open** transformation,\n**Restore** decline, **rectify** chaos,\nAnd reach **Great Peace**—\nAbove, it aligns with **Dao/Virtue**,\nBelow, it attains **spiritual clarity**,\n**Fathomless** yet **embracing**,\n**Silent** yet **resounding**,\n**Roaming** heaven and earth,\n**Uniting** yin and yang.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause it **discards** the heart’s intentions,\nAnd **abandons** the self.\n\nThus, the **virtue** of non-contention\n**Relies** on the people’s strength,\n**Aligns** with the **Dao**’s transformations,\n**Harmonizes** with the **spiritual**,\n**Exhausts** the **extremes**—\nOnly those who **abandon** knowledge\nCan **follow** its **principles**.\n\nThus, governance **naturally** arises,\nNo **arbitrary** actions occur—\n**Preserve** the whole **life-force**,\n**Hold** to **principle**,\n**Understand** with **nature**,\n**Rule** with the **Way**—\nLose the **principle**, and governance fails;\nAbandon the **Way**, and **nature** is disordered.\n\nThus, the **Sage** trusts the **Dao**, not the self,\n**Follows** the **Dao**, not the heart,\n**Acts** not for self, but for the people—\nNot **contending** for the world as if it were his own,\nBut as a **subject** serving it.\n\nThe world calls this **paradox**—\nThings may **share** yet **differ**,\n**Differ** yet **share**,\nWhat is **not** may be **right**,\nWhat is **right** may **not** be—\nThis is why the **Noble** has no **worries**,\nWhile the **common folk** are **plagued** with **grief**.\n\nHow does one **demonstrate** this?\nZhuangzi said:\nThe **rising** and **setting** of the sun and moon—\nTheir **brightness** is the same.\nThe **death** and **birth** of people—\nTheir **forms** are the same.\nThe **seasons** of spring and autumn—\nTheir **cycles** are the same.\nThe **virtue** of the **Sage** and the **commoner**—\nTheir **nature** is the same.\nThe **flow** of the **open** and the **blocked**—\nTheir **paths** are the same.\nThe **practice** of the **Daoist** and the **infant**—\nTheir **effects** are the same.\n\nThese many things—\n**Internally** they differ,\n**Externally** they align—\nNone but the **Sage** can **clarify** them.\n\nThus, the world **distinguishes** and **flaunts**,\n**Constructs** and **confuses**,\n**Debates** right and wrong—\nHence, the **Sage** appears **unworthy**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **Dao**-attained **exteriorly** vanishes,\n**Interiorly** remains.\n**Learning** transforms **emotions**,\n**Governance** is **real** yet **seems** empty,\n**Whole** yet **seems** indistinct,\n**Silent** yet **resounding**,\n**Without** yet **containing** all—\n**Silent**, **still**, **effortless**,\nAs if **nowhere** to go,\n**Abandoning** fame, **fleeing** the world,\n**Lying** with the **spirit**, **rising** with **harmony**,\n**Walking** the **Dao**, **treading** the **Way**—\nNothing **unregulated**, nothing **out of place**,\n**Aligned** with the **common**, yet **contrary** in **action**,\n**Entering** and **exiting** through **opposite** gates—\nNot **bold** because of **boldness**,\nYet the world **fears**—\nNot **expansive** because of **expansiveness**,\nYet the world **comes**—\nNot **first** because of **being first**,\nYet the world **endures**.\n\nThus, **compassionate** in **action**, **bold** in **retreat**,\n**Frugal** in **exterior**, **expansive** in **interior**,\n**Releasing** what is **later**, **prioritizing** what is **first**,\n**Returning** to **harmony**, **inverting** the **spiritual**,\n**Moving** against **nature**—\n**Fortune** distances, **calamity** nears.\n**Severing** the **Great Command**,\n**Dividing** the **spiritual qi**,\nHeaven and earth cannot **settle** it,\n**Dao/Virtue** cannot **preserve** it—\nAt death, **unaware** of **grievance**,\n**Blaming** fate, **accusing** heaven—\nNot because fate is **meager**,\nNor because **others** are **harmful**—\nBut because they **rely** on **security**,\n**Pursue** **power**,\n**Abandon** the **Way**, and **exalt** **strength**.\n\n---\n\n**On Compassion as the Dao in Action**\n\nCompassion, when taken as **action**,\nIs supremely **harmonious**—its **true** movement wins **human** strength,\nIts **stillness** aligns with **Heaven’s** intent.\n**Lowly**, **humble**, and **weak**, it yet governs all things,\nA **lord** to the myriad beings, **rectifying** the world,\n**Saving** the common folk—\n**Harmonious** with Heaven and humankind,\nIn battle, **unconquerable**;\nIn defense, **unassailable**.\nHow so?\n\nWhen war begins, Earth **shudders** and Heaven **thunderous**,\nHeaven sends **omens** and **portents**, Earth unleashes **winds** and **blind** calamities—\n**Spiritual Qi** and **Divine Manifestations** appear as **enemies**,\n**Disasters** arise to **aid** me, **auxiliaries** assist me.\nThe **scholar-officials** rage against me,\nThe **soldiers** rise up—even the **common people** and **livestock**,\nCattle **perish** in their **plows**, horses **starve** in their **harnesses**,\nFlying birds **strike** their wings, beasts **halt** in their **paths**,\nTigers and rhinos **flee**, birds of prey **submit**—\nThe enemy, **terrified**, **accepts** battle,\n**Encased** in armor, **awaiting** arms.\nYet the **wise minister** and **sage general**,\nWhen **establishing** their **stance**,\nAre **not** **forceful**, **not** **grand**, **not** **unyielding**, **not** **unyielding** in **strength**—\n**Soft**, **weak**, and **fearing** martial might,\nThe enemy **vanishes** before they even **engage**.\nWhen war comes, they **injure** their **spirit** and **intent**,\n**Exalting** the **body** while **diminishing** the **spiritual**.\n**Peaceful** in **exterior**, **lowly** in **stance**,\nThey **release** what is **later**, **responding** to Heaven’s **stillness** and **movement**—\n**Not** **indignant** when **anger** rises,\n**Not** **reckless** in **raising** troops.\nTo **defeat** the enemy, they **counter** with **reverse** tactics,\n**Conducting** operations **without** form to **capture** the enemy’s **spirit**,\n**Moving** from their **possessions**, **changing** from their **actions**—\n**Inverting** and **covering** them to **exploit** their **strategic errors**,\n**Forcing** their **evil** while **upholding** my **right**,\n**Listening** to their **words** while **rejoicing** in their **anger**,\n**Acting** when they **move**, **remaining** **still** when they **strike**—\n**Opening** what **benefits** them to **secure** their **fate**,\n**Using** people by **placing** them **below**,\n**Instructing** them with **words**, **appealing** to their **self-interest**,\n**Laying** out **truth** to **draw** them near—\nThus, **without** **contention** or **pursuit**, they **gain** the **people’s** **intent**,\n**Align** the **people’s** **spirit**.\n**Grasping** the **essence**, **avoiding** the enemy’s **separation** and **defenses**,\nWhile I **follow** the **comparative**—\nThe enemy **wishes** not to **perish**, yet **cannot**,\nI **wish** not to **perish**, yet **cannot**.\nAt such times, the **Dao/Way** **shapes** it,\n**Virtue/Power** **begins** it,\n**Divine Manifestations** serve as the **thread**,\n**Great Harmony** as the **record**,\n**Clarity** and **Turbidity** as the **household**,\nAll **things** as the **children**,\nThe **three luminaries** as **auxiliaries**,\nThe **four seasons** as **supports**—\n**Stillness** is the **root** of **things**, **movement** the **head** of **transformation**.\n**Things** **rely** on it—**without** **harm** or **blame**—\n**Virtue** **matches** Heaven’s **power**, yet **endures** without **peril**.\nFrom **now** to **ancient times**, the **sage’s** **wise Dao**,\n**Transforming** and **completing** all **changes**,\n**Rules** from Heaven—\nAll **kings** **originate** from this!\n\n---\n\n**The Doctrine of Dao/Virtue: A Summary**\n*(Chapter Five of the \"Discussion on the Return of Dao/Virtue\")*\n**Imperially Approved: The Siku Quanshu**\n\n**The Doctrine of Dao/Virtue: A Summary**\n*(Chapter Six of the \"Discussion on the Return of Dao/Virtue\")*\n**Imperially Approved: The Siku Quanshu**\n---\n\n**Discourse on Military Affairs**\n*(Composed by Yán Zūn of the Han Dynasty)*\n\nThe Dao/Way is ever-present; presence and absence are not its essence.\nHarmony subdues the weak, embracing the great—\nYet its **威威** (*great awe*) nurtures all **things**,\nNone can defy it, none can escape its form.\nIt serves as the teacher of all **things**—\nThose who grasp it are secure; those who lose it are perilous.\nHeaven and Earth embody it—\nYet they never decay.\n\nHow then shall we emulate it?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If there is no yang in yin, all **things** would not grow;\nIf there is no yin in yang, all **things** would not flourish.\"*\nFrom this, we observe:\n**威威** (*great awe*) without **德德** (*virtue*) cannot govern the people;\n**德德** (*virtue*) without **威威** (*great awe*) will topple ancestral temples.\nWithout **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*), one invites calamity—\nDisaster, change, and death follow in turn.\nThe ruler is the **vital core** of the state,\nMilitary might is its **spiritual essence**.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, all nations rise in parallel—\nGreat and small, wise and foolish—\nAll aspire to rule, yet when their **智智** (*wisdom*) is exhausted and their strength bent,\nThey are undone—not because they lacked surplus strength,\nBut because they failed to align with the **Way**.\nThus, the enlightened ruler and sage-king\nExtends the **Way**, mirrors Heaven,\nTakes **stillness** as their foundation,\n**Harmony** as their constant,\n**Responsiveness** as their beginning,\n**Sincerity** as their core—\n**Naming and reality** as their record,\n**Rewards and punishments** as their guiding principle.\nWith **virtue** on their left and **威威** (*great awe*) on their right,\nThey meet misfortune with **无无** (*non-action*).\nAll under Heaven revere and obey them—\nNone can harm or destroy them.\nThus, the state is preserved, and the people are whole.\n\n**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are like Heaven and Earth—\nYin and yang are like **威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*).\n**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are the **外表** (*outer form*) and **内里** (*inner essence*) of the ruler,\nLike the **隐隐** (*hidden*) and **显显** (*manifest*) realms of the **域域** (*domain*).\nThus, when the **Way** is lost and war is favored,\nThe ruler weakens himself,\nNeglects proper governance,\nEngages in depravity,\nExalts strength while suppressing **威威** (*great awe*),\nLoosens discipline, indulges in luxury,\nAdorns palaces with excessive craftsmanship,\nAccumulates wealth in ornate carriages and horses,\nDelights in music and women,\nSlaughters loyal advisors,\nHolds in contempt the virtuous and the wise,\nDishonors the aged and the young,\nViolates the **三光** (*three luminaries*),\nOppresses the orphaned and the widowed,\nReverses the **天地** (*Heaven and Earth*),\nInflicts **刑戮** (*punishments and executions*),\nDisrupts **阴阳** (*yin and yang*),\nShatters **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*),\nDissolves **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **和顺** (*harmony*),\nFails to **通通** (*harmonize*) **变化** (*transformations*),\nSummons **冬雷** (*winter thunder*) and **夏霜** (*summer frost*),\nCausing all **things** to suffer greatly—\nThen the people, in their **纵横** (*wandering*) and **击抟** (*confusion*), plot in vain,\nThe great nations tremble in fear,\nThe small nations flee in terror,\nThe aged and the weak scatter in lamentation,\nAll under Heaven seethe with resentment,\nThe myriad people yearn for war,\nAnd rise in rebellion—\nI am the last to act.\nWhy is this so?\n\nOnly the ancestors possessed **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **德德** (*virtue*),\nHarmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir **圣智** (*sage-wisdom*) laboring for the myriad people.\nThus, they were granted **剖符** (*sacred tokens*) and **丹书** (*red seals*),\nReceived the land and bestowed with surnames,\nListed among the **君王** (*sovereign kings*),\nTheir glory illuminating ancestral lineages,\nTheir deeds passed down to descendants—\nThis is the **心心** (*core*) of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **功功** (*achievement*) of ten thousand years.\nYet those who inherit their legacy\nFail to humble themselves, refine their conduct,\nNurture their **精精** (*essence*), temper their **神神** (*spirit*),\nPractice the **Way**, embody **德德** (*virtue*),\nAnd serve their ancestors.\nInstead, they neglect minor virtues,\nReplace minor evils with greater ones,\nDay by day, month by month,\nThe ancestral temples crumble and fall,\nThe state becomes a ruin,\nThe people are scattered and defenseless,\nThe **神神** (*spirit*) is lost, the **魂魂** (*soul*) wanders—\nWhere shall they rest?\nAlas, is this not sorrowful?\n\nThus, I exhort the **豪俊** (*heroic and virtuous*) to rally the soldiers,\nUnroll the armor, lay down the weapons,\nAnd command them to rest.\nI awaken their **役心** (*war-weary spirits*), shifting their **幸幸** (*fortune*) to **反覆** (*repentance*),\nUrging them to change and reform,\nTo **变容易** (*adapt and adjust*)—\nThen they proceed without turning back,\nBecoming **贼贼** (*bandits*) to all under Heaven.\nThe people are impoverished, their resources exhausted,\nTheir strength bent, their worries endless—\nYet Heaven’s response is inevitable:\nDisaster gathers upon their land.\nThough they may seek divine favor or human aid,\nThey still must guard against it with caution,\nHold it with reverence,\nAvoid risks, exploit opportunities,\nPrepare their encampments, secure their resting places,\nRely on water and grass,\nFill gaps, block evils—\nYet they remain distant from the enemy,\nTheir **运运** (*fortunes*) shift unseen,\nTheir **奇奇** (*strategies*) emerge without trace,\nTheir victories are unending,\nTheir battles without deep defenses.\n**变化** (*transformations*) are endless, yet their origins are hidden—\nI draw near, yet they know not my intent,\nOnly their own strength is revealed.\nThus, those at home find ease and joy,\nThose in the military find delight and gladness—\nIf they are summoned as if for their own children,\nSent beyond borders as if to a marketplace,\nUrged to till the fields and weave with vigor,\nTo rest in the evening and rise early,\nTo march in formation with disciplined precision,\nNo one dares act alone—\nAll provide for the army as they would for their parents.\nIf they are granted authority to dispute victories,\nThe enemy does not rise before battle is joined—\nThus, all under Heaven stands in order,\nNone attack while the **诸侯** (*feudal lords*) submit.\nHeaven and Earth cover them,\nThe sun and moon shine upon them—\nAll nations stand in awe, each at peace in their own lands.\nWhy is this so?\n\n**慈哀** (*compassion and mercy*) move them—\nThis arises from Heaven’s **心心** (*intent*), not from me.\n*(From the chapter: \"Discourse on the Ease of Knowing Speech\")*\n\nThe **Way** and **神神** (*spirit*) are boundless yet transformative—\nHeaven and Earth are silent yet all-revealing.\nBoundless **Way** pervades all without limit,\nSilent **神神** (*spirit*) communicates all without sound.\n**神神** (*spirit*) and **气气** (*qi*) pass through generations,\nSensing and responding in kind—\nYet they descend into **虚无** (*emptiness*), offering no resistance.\nThus, **妙妙** (*wondrous*) **归归** (*return*) is the **自然** (*natural*),\nAll is guided without constraint—\nHence, **言言** (*speech*) is the **贼贼** (*bandit*) of **自然** (*naturalness*).\nAction is the **数数** (*measure*) of **防防** (*defense*),\nYet **无为** (*non-action*) and **无言** (*no speech*) are the ultimate **成功** (*achievement*),\nThe **要要** (*key*) to enduring **长存** (*longevity*).\n\nThus, the sage\nUses **言言** (*speech*) that is not **言言** (*speech*),\nSpeaks to **绝绝** (*cease*) **言言** (*speech*),\nTo **止止** (*halt*) **为为** (*action*).\n**绝绝** (*Ceasing*) **言言** (*speech*) is the **道道** (*Dao/Way*) of **去去** (*removing*) **心心** (*heart*) and **意意** (*intent*),\n**止止** (*Halting*) **为为** (*action*) is the **术术** (*technique*) of **去去** (*removing*) **人人** (*people*) and **智智** (*wisdom*).\nTo **为为** (*act*) without **智智** (*wisdom*) is **愚愚** (*foolishness*),\nYet to **为为** (*act*) without **知知** (*knowledge*) is **慧慧** (*enlightened*).\nWithout **知知** (*knowledge*) and **欲欲** (*desire*),\nWithout **欲欲** (*desire*), there is **静静** (*stillness*),\nWithout **静静** (*stillness*), there is **虚虚** (*emptiness*),\nWithout **虚虚** (*emptiness*), there is **实实** (*substance*),\nWithout **实实** (*substance*), there is **神神** (*spirit*).\n**动动** (*movement*) returns to **太素** (*primordial purity*),\n**静静** (*stillness*) returns to **自然** (*naturalness*).\nThus, the body is preserved, the state is secured,\nWealth and honor bring no peril,\nAll **生生** (*living beings*) fulfill their **志志** (*aspirations*),\nAnd attain **长存** (*enduring longevity*).\nThis is the **易知** (*easy-to-know*) **言言** (*speech*) and the **易行** (*easy-to-practice*) **事事** (*affairs*).\n\nWhile the world knows me not and follows me not,\nWhy is this so?\nThe rulers of the age love knowledge and seek to gratify their hearts,\nYet they do not perceive the **Dao/Way**,\nNor recognize **naturalness** (*自然*).\nThey act with **为为** (*actings*) and speak with **言言** (*speeches*),\n\nSilencing knowledge to generate affairs,\nSeeking comfort in their own inclinations,\nTaking precautions as if in a world of calamities—\nThus, throughout their lives, they suffer misfortune,\nTheir nature shifts, their emotions grow unstable,\nTheir thoughts grow confused, their minds obscured,\nTheir **qi** and **spirit** agitated,\nTheir outward strength belied by inner hollowness.\n\nForcing silence brings misfortune,\nForcing stillness breeds disaster—\nThus, though they gaze, they do not see,\nThough they are told, they do not hear,\nNot because they seek to disparage themselves,\nBut because they are indeed thus.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the Sage centers on **naturalness**,\nTakes **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) as its ancestor,\nEver dwelling in its opposite—\nIn the space between speech and silence,\nSubtle yet profound, returning to **naturalness**.\n\nBright as if unseen,\nHeard as if unheard,\nOpen yet appearing closed,\nReaching yet appearing exhausted—\nIts affairs begin in **naturalness**,\nFlow toward **spirit/virtue** (*神明*),\nEver dwelling in harmony,\nBetween action and inaction,\nBetween clarity and stillness,\nBetween softness and weakness,\nBetween motion and subtlety—\nRetreating, diminishing,\nReturning to **non-action** (*无为*), to **emptiness** (*虚无*), to align with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nSerene and content to sustain life,\nHarmonious to secure the state,\nTeaching without instruction,\nGuiding without coercion,\nNurturing without desire,\nDirecting through **naturalness**,\nGifting from **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nBlessing from mountains and rivers,\nEnriching through seasons,\nHonoring through existence,\nFree from worry,\nAt peace without peril—\nWithout desire, no deprivation,\nWithout joy, no loss.\nThe people as if leaderless,\nThe leader as if absent—\nForgotten in wisdom, relying on the **Dao/Way**,\nLeaning on **Heaven**,\nAll nations in harmony, united as one—\nThis is the height of governance,\nThe pinnacle of achievement.\n\nYet the world calls it otherwise.\nWhy do they not know me?\nNot because my **Dao/Way** is too small to comprehend,\nNor because my affairs are too trivial to undertake,\nNor because the world delights in ruin,\nRejects completion,\nSeeks disaster,\nFinds joy in calamity,\nAnd thus refuses to follow me.\n\n**Heavenly nature** opposes me,\nEmotion and desire entrap me,\nWisdom ensnares me in desire—\nThus, my wisdom cannot see,\nMy acuity cannot hear.\nTherefore, profound speech is met with slander,\nGreat deeds with reproach.\nThose who see uniquely are scorned by the world,\nThose who hear uniquely are shamed by the people.\nThose who follow **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) do not conform to custom,\nThose whose deeds match **Heaven** and **Earth** are not pleased by the masses.\n\nThe ultimate discourse, the grandest speech,\nEmbraces all transformations,\nEncompasses all paths,\nJudges the finest distinctions,\nIlluminates the void,\nPenetrates the formless—\nReturning to **obscurity** (*昧*).\nThis is what petty scholars cannot hear,\nWhat narrow-minded men cannot grasp.\n\nThe wild goose soars all day,\nYet knows not the bounds of the cosmos.\nThe lawmaker, bound by doctrine,\nThe scholar, burdened by study,\nDiscussing endlessly yet never understanding\nThe vastness of **virtue/power** (*德*).\n\nMoreover, **spirit/virtue** (*神明*) has its limits,\n**Heaven** and **Earth** their constraints—\nHow much more so the multitude’s theories,\nWhich fail to grasp the essence of the great principles?\nIs this not fitting?\n\nThus, what the common crowd despises and devalues,\nThe **Dao/Way**-attained alone uphold.\nTherefore, the Sage knows yet does not act,\nIs capable yet does not assume responsibility,\nHolds **ren** (*benevolence*) and **yi** (*righteousness*) lightly,\nDoes not name them as titles,\nIs accomplished yet does not flaunt it,\nIs strong yet does not display it,\nIs towering yet does not boast,\nIs honored yet does not revel—\nSpeech beyond hearing,\nAction beyond form,\nHeart like the ocean,\nAspiration like the sky.\n\nAbandoning **action** to establish the **Dao/Way**,\nDiminishing **virtue/power** (*善*) to nurture **nature** (*性*),\nSilent yet vast,\nClear yet unseen,\nEmotionless yet profound,\nAlone yet enduring,\nThin without, thick within,\nLowly in self, humble in name,\nAbandoning the crowd, departing custom,\nMaking the **Dao/Way** their constant—\nThis is the **\"Knowing the Unknowable\"** (*知不知篇*),\nThe teaching of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (*道德*) in **naturalness** (*自然*).\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s proof lies in **naturalness** (*自然*), its influence in **harmony** (*和*). All things have form and sound, taking and discarding, with influence—\nNot only the myriad creatures exhibit this.\n\nWhen form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.\nThere is no \"generate nothing\" but there is \"generate something,\"\nNo \"generate cover\" but there is \"generate opposition.\"\nThus, the Daoist governs with **non-action** (*無為*) as treatment,\nWhile the knowing one regards many affairs as disturbance.\n\nThe infant benefits from **not knowing** (*不知*), the aged suffer from many affairs—\nFrom this, it is seen: stupidity is the form of wisdom,\nWisdom is the shadow of stupidity.\n**Non-action** is the sound of affairs,\nAffairs are the echo of **non-action**.\n\nWisdom and cleverness are the net of disturbance,\nAction is the thread of ruin.\nHence, the myriad creatures cannot be harmonized,\nHeaven and Earth cannot be brought to **fitness** (*適*).\nHarmonizing leads to loss of harmony,\nBringing to fitness leads to loss of fitness.\nNot harmonizing, yet then able to harmonize—\nNot bringing to fitness, yet then able to fit.\n\nThus, in times of peace, one does not know danger,\nIn times of chaos, one does not know governance—\nLike shadows following forms, there is no escape.\nNot moving yet seeking echoes finds none—\nHence, knowing yet severing knowledge,\nOne is not constrained by knowing;\nNot knowing yet using knowledge,\nOne is not constrained by knowledge either.\nThis is why the **Dao/Way** is not constrained—\nBut the **Way of action** (*有為*) is constrained.\n\nTherefore, the Sage cultivates the **nature of harmony** (*通達之性*), wandering in the realm of **silent stillness** (*默*), dwelling in the land of **non-ability** (*無能*), entrusting the **body of not knowing** (*不知之體*), serene as empty space, fleeting as death.\nWith no schemes in the heart, no governance in the mind—\nBright and radiant, enlightening the four seas, yet silent,\nShowing **non-existence** (*無有*) to the eyes,\nNot stirring **form and color** (*形聲*), not raising **knowledge** (*知*)—\nThus, no calamities arise, and the people are at ease.\nNo speech yet the world is governed,\nNo governance yet the people are harmonized—\nBowing yet not oppressed, rising yet not constrained,\nSincerely upright, each guarding their pure **nature** (*性*).\nVague and boundless, all fulfill their natural lifespan—\nThe dead have no posthumous title, the living no name.\n\nLike this, in succession, countless and measureless—\nTheir emotions find no delight, their **nature** no joy,\nTheir hearts no ease, their minds no gain.\nThey do not know filial piety, nor fraternal duty,\nNor see **benevolence** (*仁*), nor recognize **righteousness** (*義*).\nWithout **rites and customs** (*典禮*), they guard their true **core** (*真干*).\nAs steadfast as the **muntjac deer** (*麋鹿*), as simple as the **wild goose** (*鸿雁*)—\nNeither joy nor sorrow, nor separation from chaos,\nLike the blind, like the deaf, with nothing to hear or see.\nNo palaces, no cities, no laws,\nNo shame or disgrace—\nThe dead are not truly dead, the living not truly alive,\nEntrusting their **Dao/Way** to the **Dao/Way** itself.\nNo speech, no action—\nYet **virtue/power** (*威德*) is naturally manifested,\nHeaven and Earth in **harmony** (*和順*), pure and chaotic,\nLike muddy waters, resplendent yet solemn—\nAll creatures, great and small, return to **stupidity** (*愚*).\nMotion without form, stillness without end—\nThus, the people all flourish, the world in **silent stillness** (*哑哑*).\nThey perish from petty gains yet enjoy great blessings—\nThe **silent stillness** (*默*) governor’s calculations cannot be calculated,\nHis measures cannot be measured—\nHow might one imitate this?\n\nWhen **virtue/power** (*德*) is lost, **naturalness** (*淳朴*) decays,\nAnd **Dao/Way**’s marvels perish, all things act in accordance.\nThus, the **Way of knowing** (*知故*) spreads,\nAnd **rites and customs** (*禮節*) arise to distinguish **fitness** (*適*).\nThe myriad creatures have order,\nThe hundred affairs have rules—\nBoundaries are marked, territories divided,\nStates and cities governed, villages and towns ordered.\nThe realm has loyal ministers, families have filial children—\nWithin, they are concise; without, they are cautious,\nTaking from one to benefit another,\nStriving to thicken their own **virtue/power** (*厚*).\nThe great perish, the small survive,\nAnd sacrificial rites to Heaven and Earth are established—\nGreat mountains, vast waters, and the **Dao/Way**’s altars.\nSacrificing at **Mount Tai** (*泰山*), bowing at **Mount Liang** (*梁父*)—\nGradually inherited, perhaps or perhaps not,\nTen thousand judgments passed, branding men filling the roads,\nSubjects killing their lords, sons killing their fathers—\nFamilies broken, states ruined, countless in number.\nThe world enjoys the **Way of knowing**’s benefits,\nYet bears the calamities of death—\nFrom this, it is clear: severing knowledge is blessing,\nLoving knowledge is ruin.\n\nThus, let those with **virtue/power** (*德*) change their **aspiration** (*志*), alter their hearts,\nGenerate and nurture all affairs to teach the people,\nPray and beseech for blessings—\nEven to the utmost governance, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not listen.\nLet those who perish their states abandon wisdom, discard desires,\nSever all affairs, cultivate the **Dao/Way**, practice **virtue/power** (*德*)—\nAnd those who seek death will not follow their form.\nHence, the **Dao/Way**’s form and sound are abandoned,\nIts influence stored and preserved.\n\nThe Sage’s ability to move aligns with Heaven,\nTo be still aligns with the **Dao/Way**—\nPreserving the self yet governing the world,\nSoaring beyond **action**’s realm,\nWandering within **non-action**’s domain—\nTaking blessings from the subtle and vast,\nAnd extending them to the four seas’ farthest reaches—\nBlinding the sharp-sighted,\nSealing the wise-mouthed,\nPlugging the keen-eared,\nSevering the clever-handed—\nFollowing the times, yet harmonized,\nBowing and rising without effort, yet naturally achieved,\nTeaching without governance, the people in order—\nThe Sage’s benevolence extends to beasts and birds,\nBecause of their **non-action** in severing knowledge and wisdom,\nAnd entrusting the **Dao/Way** instead.\n\nThus, they follow emotions, indulge desires,\nExhaust the heart’s schemes—\nMotion leads Heaven and Earth,\nStillness transforms the myriad affairs—\nDivine clarity within themselves,\nNo need to observe or burnish,\nNo lowering of the self, no raising of the seat—\nYet all nations prepare themselves.\nThough they wish not to perish, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not place them.\nThe people do not fear **virtue/power** (*威*)—\n**Dao/Way**’s defense, the divine’s governance,\nThe **Great Harmony**’s heart, Heaven and Earth’s **aspiration** (*意*).\n\nNo calamity is greater than losing **virtue/power** (*德*),\nNo blessing is greater than preserving **virtue/power** (*德*).\nThe **Way** of preserving the self is no more urgent than this—\nThe key to nurturing the **spirit** (*神*) is no greater than this.\n\nConstantly maintaining **naturalness** (*素然常体*),\nWith **fear and caution** (*忧畏*) as one’s foundation—\nTrembling and reverent, losing **spirit** (*神*) is the art of ruin.\nThe numbers of **spirit**’s defense lie in self-mastery—\nThus, the **Highest Sage** (*太上*) fears the **Dao/Way**,\nThe next fears Heaven,\nThe next fears Earth,\nThe next fears the people,\nThe next fears the self—\nFlourishing or decline, all depend on oneself.\nNot fearing in defense, yet fearing in **manifestation** (*章*)—\nSuffering great calamities, reaching even to annihilation.\n**Fear and caution** (*忧畏*) from the **beginning** (*元始*) to the **unseen** (*无形*).\nGuarding before signs appear—\nThe **Dao/Way**’s radiance is vast,\nMotion gains what is desired,\nStillness gains what is tranquil—\nBlessings and longevity are **defended** (*防*).\nDiscussing **Dao/Way** without measure,\nSpeaking as if in reverse—\nBright yet as if in darkness,\nDistant yet as if in depth—\nNone can hear it.\nListening to **Dao/Way**’s decrees within oneself,\nWhat need is there to seek Heaven’s?\nThe utmost blessing resembles calamity,\nGreat governance is like defense—\nThe world is drunk with ease, none can perceive it.\n\nThus, the common folk see what is near,\nHear what is shallow,\nDo not recognize the **Dao/Way** of **dimness** (*窅冥*),\nObscured by the **constants of subtlety** (*微妙之常*),\nBlocked by the divine’s principles—\nObserving the profit of a hair’s width,\nNot seeing the harm of a mountain’s height—\nIndulging emotions, acting without restraint,\nNo fear or caution.\nSpeaking in accordance with what is **true** (*然*),\nActing in accordance with what is **good** (*善*),\nStrength can take, yet the heart aligns with chaos—\n**Delicacy** (*防*) and **excess** (*奢*) are intertwined,\nSelf-mastery and indulgence are mingled—\nLoyalty and trust are what they love,\nYet they deceive their parents,\nInvade Heaven and Earth,\nSimplify their lords—\nFollowing emotions, desiring to fulfill Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—\nThus, they establish clever schemes, name them as their own,\nBestow favors and spread blessings to gain great calamities—\nFleeing blessings beyond Heaven, pursuing calamities across the four seas.\nSeeking **virtue/power** (*福德*) cannot be obtained—\n\nThe **calamities** rush, the **disasters** fly—\nthere is no escape.\n\nOnly when the **great power** arrives\ndoes one begin to act **good/virtuous** (*善*).\nAt this moment,\n**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (*德*) cannot be sought—\nHeaven and Earth cannot be appeased.\nThis is not Heaven’s fault.\n\nThose who delight in the lofty,\nrejoice in greatness,\nbear the **great power** yet task the weak,\nforget caution and abandon restraint—\nthey do not seek within themselves.\n\nThus, those who fear for their own lives\ndo not dread others;\nthose who guard against themselves\nare not overthrown by others.\nThose who follow the small\ndo not fear the great;\nthose who are sincere in the near\ndo not regret the distant.\n\nHence, they do not slight their station,\nyet dwell in it with **sensitivity** (*敏*);\nthey do not despise their humble position,\nyet enrich it with **thickness** (*厚*).\nThey refine their rites,\nnot wearying of **constraint** (*苦*) in lowliness,\nbut transforming the grand.\nOnly then do they not shun **困** (*困*, adversity) and **危** (*危*, peril),\nyet sever their attachments.\nThey find joy in **穷** (*穷*, destitution) as if it were **达** (*达*, fulfillment),\nand regard **安** (*安*, death) as **寿** (*寿*, longevity).\nThough they wish to linger,\nthey cannot remain.\n\nHow then can this be explained?\nZhuangzi said:\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth—\nits beginning must have an end,\nits end must have a beginning.\nThe **yang qi** (*阳气*) rests in the **潜龙** (*潜龙*, hidden dragon),\nthus able to melt gold.\nThe **yin qi** (*阴气*) abides in the **履霜** (*履霜*, stepping on frost),\nthus able to congeal ice.\nWood thrives in autumn’s **毫** (*毫*, fine hairs),\nthus grows to **百寻** (*百寻*, a hundred *zhang*).\nWater delights in **涓涓** (*涓涓*, trickling streams),\nthus becomes the sea.\nFlying birds take flight from the egg,\nthus soar high.\nBeasts prepare in the womb,\nthus run far.\n\nTherefore, the Sage\nwith boundless wisdom and insight\ncan connect with Heaven,\ntransforming and moving with the **大常** (*大常*, grand constants).\nThough they penetrate the profound,\nthey still accumulate **德** (*德*, virtue/power) with **thickness** (*厚*).\nThey release the mind,\nconceal their **聪明** (*聪明*, sharp intellect),\nand fear the **溷** (*溷*, formless).\nThey guard against the **无形** (*无形*, unseen),\nhide their **端** (*端*, beginnings),\nand flee **情** (*情*, passions).\nThey return to **虚无** (*虚无*, emptiness),\nand dwell in **防** (*防*, self-restraint).\n\nThey cherish Heaven and Earth,\nyet do not exalt themselves;\ntheir **德** (*德*, virtue/power) is vast—\nmatching **阴阳** (*阴阳*, yin and yang),\nyet they do not display it.\nThey dwell in the **微** (*微*, subtle),\nunseen by many,\nso that all people\ndrink and eat without **味** (*味*, relish),\nand wear clothes without **文** (*文*, adornment).\nOnly then do they adorn themselves.\n\nTheir **志** (*志*, will) does not dare to stray,\nand they hold fast to the **Dao/Way** (*道*).\nTheir **德** (*德*, virtue/power) aligns with all things—\nrising and falling, floating and sinking.\nThey nurture the people as their own children,\nand meet the multitude like a lord.\nTheir **德** (*德*, virtue/power) returns to Heaven,\nwhile their **功** (*功*, deeds) are bestowed upon the people.\nThe world offers **辞让** (*辞让*, humility),\nand their **恩** (*恩*, grace) is **厚** (*厚*, profound) and **深** (*深*, deep).\nThus, **祸** (*祸*, calamities) cannot harm them,\nand **患** (*患*, disasters) cannot afflict them.\n**福** (*福*, blessings) cannot escape them,\nand **德** (*德*, virtue/power) cannot be concealed—\nfor Heaven has no private inclinations,\nnor does Earth show favor.\n\n**戒** (*戒*, restraint) at the beginning,\n**慎** (*慎*, caution) in guarding,\n**和** (*和*, harmony) in weakness,\n**忠信** (*忠信*, loyalty and trust),\n**奉** (*奉*, uphold) the **Dao/Way** (*道*),\n**顺** (*顺*, align) with Heaven,\nand **参** (*参*, harmonize) with all things—\nfearing **情** (*情*, passions),\n**忧** (*忧*, anxiety) and **畏** (*畏*, dread) within oneself,\n**得意** (*得意*, contentment) in **安乐** (*安乐*, ease),\n**困** (*困*, adversity) and **穷** (*穷*, destitution) as **成败** (*成败*, success and failure),\n**存亡** (*存亡*, life and death)—\nall sought within oneself.\n\n**勇敢篇** (*The Chapter on Courage and Boldness*)\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nthe **理** (*理*, principle) of life and death—\nno going, no coming,\nno taking, no giving,\nno action, yet all things follow it naturally.\n\n**正直** (*正直*, uprightness) is like **防** (*防*, self-restraint),\n**平易** (*平易*, simplicity) is like water.\n**因应** (*因应*, responding to circumstances) and **效象** (*效象*, following omens),\nall things rise together—\nharm and benefit, taking and discarding,\nbeginning and end.\nDeep and shallow, light and heavy—\nall things take their own forms,\neach returning to their origins.\n\n**杀** (*杀*, destruction) is the **首** (*首*, head) of **生** (*生*, life),\nand **生** (*生*, life) is the **二** (*二*, second) of **杀** (*杀*, destruction).\nThese two, when compared,\n**吉防** (*吉防*, auspicious restraint) is evident.\n\nThus, to know **生** (*生*, life) yet not know **杀** (*杀*, destruction)\nis to go against Heaven’s **Dao/Way** (*道*).\nTo know **杀** (*杀*, destruction) yet not know **生** (*生*, life)\nis to defy Earth’s **要** (*要*, essence).\n\nHence, joy and anger have their divisions,\nlife and death have their measures.\nTo receive Heaven’s **殃** (*殃*, calamities)\nand obtain Earth’s **罚** (*罚*, punishments)—\nwhen anger should arise yet does not,\nyou become like **豺狼** (*豺狼*, jackals and wolves),\nyour brothers like **兕虎** (*兕虎*, rhinoceros and tigers).\nWhen fighting should occur yet does not,\nyour wives become **敌国** (*敌国*, enemy states),\nyour concubines **大防** (*大防*, great restraints).\nWhen **杀** (*杀*, destruction) should come yet does not,\nyou invite Heaven’s **害** (*害*, harm)\nand are controlled by all things.\nWhen **生** (*生*, life) should come yet does not,\ncommoners lose their lives,\nand rulers lose their kingdoms.\n\nThus, the **君子** (*君子*, noble) kills the people as they kill their own bodies,\nand spares lives as they spare their own selves.\nThey grasp **德** (*德*, virtue/power) and **体** (*体*, embody) uprightness—\nthey cannot lose themselves,\nand only then can they truly exist.\nTo preserve one’s life and secure one’s state\nlies in the balance of **生** (*生*, life) and **杀** (*杀*, destruction).\nWhen **生** (*生*, life) and **杀** (*杀*, destruction) are measured rightly,\nHeaven and Earth will aid them.\n\nJoy and anger, when measured rightly,\nall things will follow them.\nThus, **刚柔** (*刚柔*, firmness and gentleness),\n**质直** (*质直*, sincerity and straightforwardness),\n**操击** (*操击*, discipline and force),\n**深酷** (*深酷*, profound and harsh),\n**疾邪** (*疾邪*, swift and perverse),\n**养正** (*养正*, cultivate what is right)—\n**勇敢** (*勇敢*, boldness) comes first,\n**先失** (*先失*, first abandon) to **达于守** (*达于守*, attain in defense).\n**战** (*战*, battle) is clear in its **开** (*开*, opening),\n**塞长** (*塞长*, long in restraint),\n**忿羙** (*忿羙*, anger and resentment),\n**快安** (*快安*, ease and satisfaction),\n**乐杀** (*乐杀*, delight in destruction),\n**便国** (*便国*, benefit the state),\n**利民** (*利民*, benefit the people)—\nthey do not avoid the strong,\nand their **威** (*威*, might) shakes the **百蛮** (*百蛮*, myriad barbarians).\nTheir **权** (*权*, influence) extends to the **境外** (*境外*, outer lands),\nand they achieve half of what is **善** (*善*, good).\n\n**柔弱** (*柔弱*, gentleness) and **畏敬** (*畏敬*, reverence),\n**恐情** (*恐情*, fear of passions),\n**损言** (*损言*, moderate speech),\n**深思** (*深思*, profound thought),\n**远虑** (*远虑*, distant consideration),\n**临正** (*临正*, face uprightness),\n**讨怨** (*讨怨*, seek vengeance),\n**务长** (*务长*, pursue longevity),\n**寡和** (*寡和*, few in harmony),\n**博厚** (*博厚*, broad and profound)—\nthey accumulate **恩** (*恩*, grace) and benefit,\nyet do not harm,\nto make their **善** (*善*, goodness) evident.\nThey give yet do not take,\nto display their **名** (*名*, reputation).\nThey reward yet do not punish,\nto establish their **惠** (*惠*, benevolence).\nThey nurture yet do not destroy,\nto fulfill their **仁** (*仁*, kindness).\nThus, they achieve half of what is **善** (*善*, good).\n\nThese two functions—\n**勇** (*勇*, boldness) and **敌** (*敌*, daring),\n**敢** (*敢*, courage) and **计策** (*计策*, strategy)—\n**乘驰** (*乘驰*, ride and gallop),\n**射身** (*射身*, expose oneself),\n**相非** (*相非*, mutual contradiction)—\nthey differ from Heaven’s **意** (*意*, intent),\nthey differ from Earth’s **心** (*心*, essence).\nTheir **情** (*情*, passions) surge,\ntheir **志** (*志*, will) expands,\nand they each indulge in their own ease.\nSome change from **千乘** (*千乘*, a thousand chariots)\ninto **亡虏** (*亡虏*, fugitive captives),\nor from **匹夫** (*匹夫*, commoner)\ninto **君王** (*君王*, sovereign lord).\n\nThus, some things nurtured\nbecome **福** (*福*, blessings),\nwhile others nurtured\nbecome **祸** (*祸*, calamities).\nSome things destroyed\nbecome **福** (*福*, blessings),\nwhile others destroyed\nbecome **贼** (*贼*, bandits).\nThese two principles are profound and subtle,\nbeyond all measurement.\n\nThose nurtured into **福** (*福*, blessings)\nare aided by all under Heaven;\nthose nurtured into **祸** (*祸*, calamities)\nare reviled by all under Heaven.\nTo nurture what all under Heaven revile\nharms what all under Heaven aids;\nto nurture what all under Heaven aids\nharms what all under Heaven reviles.\nOne reversal, one concealment—\nbecomes **防** (*防*, restraint) or **贼** (*贼*, banditry).\nOne concealment, one reversal—\nbecomes **防** (*防*, restraint) or **贼** (*贼*, banditry).\n\n**父** (*父*, father) to Heaven and Earth,\n**子孙** (*子孙*, children and grandchildren)—\nthis is what one obtains.\n\nThus, to **长养** (*长养*, long in nurturing)\nand then prosper in later generations,\none must **生** (*生*, nurture) rightly.\nTo nurture and then perish,\none must **生** (*生*, nurture) wrongly.\nTo slaughter and yet invite blessings,\none must **杀** (*杀*, destroy) wrongly.\nTo restrain and yet suffer calamities,\none must **杀** (*杀*, destroy) rightly.\n\nWhat Heaven abhors,\none does not dare to **活** (*活*,

      "translated_text": "The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Daoist Works*\n*Preface to the* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the *Way and Its Power*\n\n[We, your] ministers respectfully note: The *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* in six *juan* bears the traditional attribution to Yan Zun of the Han. The *Sui Bibliographic Treatise* records it as eleven *juan*. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of the Reading of Books* states that the *Tang Bibliographic Treatise* includes *Yan Zun’s Pointers* in forty *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Commentary on the Pointers* in thirteen *juan*. Upon examining the *Old* and *New Tang Histories*, both record *Yan Zun’s Laozi Pointers* as fourteen *juan* and *Feng Kuo’s Laozi Pointers* as thirteen *juan*, with no mention of *Yan Zun’s* work in forty *juan*. It is suspected that Chao Gongwu’s record resulted from a scribal transposition of the text.\n\nThis edition was printed from the secret collection of Hu Zhenheng and later, with its woodblocks acquired by Mao Jin, incorporated into the *Jindai Secret Books*. Only six *juan* remain. Qian Zeng’s *Record of the Diligent Seeker of Books* notes that he once obtained a manuscript copy by Qian Shubao, spanning from the seventh to the thirteenth *juan*, which included a general preface followed by chapters such as *\"When People Are Starving\"* and *\"Sincere Words Are Not Fine.\"* These are now lost. He also cites the preface by Gushenzi, which states: *\"The* Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power *had already lost half its text by the Chen and Sui dynasties. What remains today consists only of the* Lun De *section.\"* A modern edition printed in Jiaxing lists *juan* one through six, which diverges significantly from the preface. This edition also titles itself as *juan* one through six, suggesting that Hu Zhenheng’s printed version was based on the Jiaxing edition.\n\nCao Xuequan, in his preface to the *Yuan Yu Waibian*, claims that the recently printed *Daoist Pointers to the Meaning of the Way and Its Power* by Yan Junping is a forgery from Wu. Upon examination, the *Comprehensive Examination* cites Chao Gongwu’s words [though this citation differs from the current *Record of the Reading of Books*], noting that its chapters and verses differ considerably from other editions. For instance, it treats the last seventeen characters of *\"Crookedness\"* as the opening of the following chapter. This suggests that the original text included the *Classic’s* passages. Lu You’s collected works contain a postscript to the book, referring to it as the *Ancient Text of the* Daoist Pointers to the *Classic of the Way and Its Power*, also mentioning the *Classic’s* text. However, this edition omits the *Classic’s* passages, resulting in inconsistent formatting. Moreover, Chao Gongwu’s *Record* still lists Gushenzi’s commentary edition as thirteen *juan*, without noting any loss. Yet this edition’s Gushenzi preface claims that half the text was lost by the Chen and Sui dynasties, and only the *Lun De* section remains. By collating these discrepancies, it is clear that this edition, reduced to six *juan*, starkly contradicts Chao Gongwu’s record.\n\nFurthermore, of the *Zhuangzi* passages cited, sixteen or seventeen are absent from the current text. It is unlikely that Yan Zun’s selections would all be those discarded by Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang. This must be due to the dispersal of Yan Zun’s original work, after which a forger, drawing from Wu Cheng’s postscript to the *Commentary on the Classic of the Way and Its Power*—which mentions *\"Zhuang Junping’s transmitted seventy-two chapters\"*—fabricated a division into an *\"Upper Classic\"* of forty and a *\"Lower Classic\"* of thirty-two *pian*. Additionally, since the *Han Bibliographic Treatise* records *fifty-two* *pian* of the *Zhuangzi*, while the current text contains only thirty-three, the forger concocted *Zhuangzi* passages to append to the lost sections. Having failed to consult Chao Gongwu’s account, the contradictions in Gushenzi’s forged preface are glaringly evident.\n\nBased on this investigation, Cao Xuequan’s argument is not without foundation. Qian Zeng’s critique, however, pursues minor details while overlooking the core issue. Given that its content does not contradict reason and remains the work of a literate forger, it is still included in the catalog to preserve one perspective within Daoist thought.",

      "translated_text": "In the third month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign, respectfully submitted after collation.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Original Preface to the *Daoist Pointers to the Return***\n\nOf the numerous commentators on the *Laozi*, none surpasses the renown of Master Heshang Gong, yet none predates Yan Junping. Junping lived during the Yuan and Cheng eras, contemporaneous with Yang Ziyun. He concealed himself in divination, his Dao lofty and his talent profound, his intellect vast and his discernment subtle. His discourse flowed with ease, nearly perceiving the transformations of the unseen, concealing the past and foreseeing the future, as if consulting with spirits, wielding yin and yang as his instruments. His defenses aligned seamlessly with the teachings of Laozi. Thus, he expounded upon its chapters to elucidate their guiding principles, asserting that the Dao’s root lies in the \"non-being of non-being,\" born of the \"non-being of the never-beginning beginning\"—this is the Great Beginning. Since its essence is formless, it cannot but be void; since it has no beginning, no trace can be discerned—only the traceless. Thus, it pervades the utmost emptiness, and what limit could it have? Therefore, the origin of all things lies in utmost softness. Softness is the inception of life, while hardness is the spirit of life. The fullness of potential must begin with emptiness, and softness is its foundation, never losing its primordial state. Hence, the Dao of Heaven descends, the Dao of Earth abides in lowliness, rivers and valleys empty themselves to gather in marshes, and kings and lords hold humility as noble, esteeming the lowly as exalted, placing the latter before the former. They discard excess, abandon pride, know the masculine but guard the feminine. By this, they govern the state and cultivate the self. Calamity departs, fortune abides, and their continuity remains unbroken, serving as the norm for all under Heaven. By acting without acting and engaging in affairs without affairs, Heaven and Earth are completed, the myriad things arise, and the world is nourished. They bestow benefit upon the four seas without claiming great merit, yet their names endure. They do not harm their spirit, yet their blessings extend for ten thousand generations. These are Junping’s pointers and the great essentials of Laozi’s teachings.\n\nPeople follow their inclinations to interpret it as they will. Some, emphasizing the triumph of softness and weakness over hardness and strength, apply it to the cunning of military strategy, appropriating its perilous and martial aspects to serve deceitful schemes. Others, likening the myriad things to straw dogs, adopt the severity of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, cutting off sagacity and abandoning wisdom to dull the people. Some, advocating stillness and non-action, echo the words of Gai Gong, cautiously upholding constancy to pacify the realm—such was the governance of Chancellor Cao in assisting the Han dynasty. Still others, fixating on the \"valley spirit never dying,\" pursue the arts of immortality and longevity, tracing the origins of the *Laozi* to the *Guan Yinzi* and making it the fountainhead of esoteric discourse. Yet all these are but offshoots of Laozi’s thought, not its entirety. Could Laozi have foreseen such extremes?\n\nEven the Six Classics have been plundered to sow disorder, as Zhuangzi remarked: \"The ancients were truly vast and great!\" Yet even he, in expounding his own Dao, never conflated it with Laozi’s. How much less could those later schools, each offering their own interpretations, be reconciled? A hair’s breadth of deviation leads to a thousand *li* of error—what use are mere glosses?\n\nJunping’s work, however, stands apart from these, much like Sima Jizhu. Both embraced the Dao and refused office, honoring the rustic life. They traced the Dao of Heaven above, recorded the principles of Earth below, and centered their inquiry on human affairs. They exhaustively examined antiquity, scrutinized later ages, and comprehensively grasped the nature of things, penetrating even the obscure and hidden, recording what had not yet taken form. Thus, when Song Zhong and Jia Yi heard his words, their hearts melted and their ambitions waned, bowing before his carriage, their vigor spent. Yet Master Yan, with divining stalks in hand and milfoil upright, debated divination in the marketplace, his integrity unbroken amid chaos, pure yet unstained by the world.\n\nHis writing is vast and profound, encompassing and harmonious, marked by clarity and coherence. Its threads are meticulously arranged, its beginnings and endings refined and elegant. Up close, it fills the senses; from afar, it does not dazzle with talent or overwhelm with rhetoric. Its principles prevail over ornamentation, transcending like a thousand-*li* steed confined to an anthill, its dust never stirring, its tracks never straying, yet traversing every inch of ground with effortless skill. Like rivers and seas, it immerses and saturates, surging and receding, gradually nourishing without one’s awareness of its benefit. Like creation bestowing form, it adapts to all, ever-renewing, its mechanism unfathomable. Though it bears the name of an exegesis, it constitutes a distinct school of thought. Of its original six *juan*, only fragments remain—yet even in this, we may regret its loss no further.\n\n**Preface by Liu Feng**\n\nI once read Junping’s *Inscription by His Seat*, which declares: \"Swift movement cannot escape one’s shadow; great sound cannot conceal its echo. In silence and seclusion, no trace or response arises. By constantly embodying humility and weakness, misfortune finds no foothold.\" I marveled at how deeply he grasped Laozi’s principles. Later, learning of his *Daoist Pointers to the Return*, I sought it in vain. In the winter of the *renyin* year, Xiaoyuan obtained a copy from Zhao Yuandu, and upon reading it once, I found it broadly encompassing the six directions, inwardly probing the myriad conditions, measuring the workings of yin and yang, and observing the transformations of things, all converging in the mysterious unity. I could not put it down. Its prose often employs rhyme shifts in succession, as if derived from the *Xici* tradition. Passages like \"without righteousness or benevolence, the six directions harmonize and Heaven becomes kin\" and \"without moderation or ritual, the four seas become brothers\" exhibit a three-line structure with rhyming beginnings and ends.\n\nIn the chapter \"Which is dearer, name or self,\" the lines on \"the nameless name\" are echoed in Wang Fusi’s commentary on the *Guigua*’s top yang, which he deemed a sublime interpretation. Alas, the text’s mutilation before and after leaves its great treasure incomplete—yet it remains a vast vessel of the Dao.\n\nThe original preface is signed by \"Gushenzi,\" whose identity is unclear. Chao Gongwu attributed it to Feng Kuo of the Tang. Noted by Shen Shilong of Xiushui:\n\nThe *Daoist Pointers to the Return* directly corresponds to the *Heshang Gong*’s division of the *Laozi* into chapters. However, Junping divided it into an \"Upper Classic\" of forty *pian* and a \"Lower Classic\" of thirty-two *pian*. Comparing this with the extant text, two *pian* remain unaccounted for. The combined chapters—\"The movement of the Dao is return\" with \"Attaining oneness,\" \"Governing the people and serving Heaven\" with \"Square yet not cutting,\" \"Excelling as a knight\" with \"Great resemblance to unworthiness,\" and \"Repeatedly pruning goodness leads to calamity\"—are appended to the *Governing the State* chapter. Upon reading, the flow of language and coherence of principles are seamless. However, the seven *pian* beginning with \"When the people starve\" are entirely missing. Upon closer examination, the two combined chapters—\"Governing the people\" and \"Excelling as a knight\"—should belong to the section beginning with \"Daily diminishing,\" while the seven missing *pian* constitute Junping’s \"Lower Classic.\" The nine *pian* preceding \"Not leaving one’s door\" remain part of the \"Upper Classic.\"\n\nIf one supplements this with the thirty-seven *pian* of the *Heshang Gong* version, Junping’s \"Upper Classic\" would comprise forty-six *pian*, likely with six *pian* merged—though he was unwilling to disclose the chapter titles.",

      "translated_text": "Should the theories of \"eight as yin, nine as yang\" be considered, though Lin Xiyi deemed them alien to the original purport of the Laozi, they nonetheless serve as profound channels for dredging and expanding the Daoist tradition, thus occupying a foundational position within the primordial Dao. Noted by Hu Zhenheng of Haiyan.\n\nMaster Yan Junping was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery, originally surnamed Zhuang—hence also called Zhuangzi. During the Zhanghe era of the Eastern Han, Ban Gu, in compiling the *Book of Han*, altered the surname to Yan to avoid the personal name of Emperor Ming. \"Yan\" (strict) was also a term interchangeable across antiquity and the present. Junping lived during the mid-Western Han, when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne, prompting his retreat into reclusion and eremitism—truly a perfected one of the highest antiquity. His extant work, the *Dao De Zhi Gui Lun* (Commentary on the *Dao De Jing*), originally comprised numerous *juan*. By the Chen and Sui dynasties, half had already been lost. The surviving text, now only the \"Discourse on Virtue\" section, was collated from its corrupted remnants, edited into six *juan*, and prefaced with its table of contents to preserve the overarching purport of the complete work. Preface by Gushenzi.\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Dao De Zhi Gui Lun*, Volume One\nBy Yan Zun of the Han\n\n**Table of Contents**\nZhuangzi said: In ancient times, when Laozi composed his work, transformation arose from the Dao as mother, with the warp of the classics arrayed at the forefront. Heaven and earth served as its images: the Upper Classic corresponded to heaven, the Lower Classic to earth. The eightfold path of yin and the ninefold path of yang—with yin proceeding through yang, hence seventy-two chapters; with yang proceeding through yin, hence division into upper and lower. The five phases and eight trigrams gave the Upper Classic forty chapters, beginning anew; the four phases and eight trigrams gave the Lower Classic thirty-two chapters, concluding the whole. The yang path is odd, the yin path even—thus the Upper Classic precedes the Lower. The yang path is vast, the yin path small—thus the Upper Classic is abundant while the Lower is sparse. The yang path inclines left, the yin path right—thus the Upper Classic unfolds forward while the Lower unfolds backward. Alternating and interpenetrating, they merge into one form, obscure and undifferentiated, with the Dao as their central pivot. Repeated signs and manifold proofs reveal their origins. The Lower Classic serves as the gate, the Upper as the door. Those of wisdom who perceive its warp and weft comprehend the reckonings of heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the pairings of husband and wife, the bonds of father and son, the propriety of ruler and minister—all things unfold thereby.\n\n**Chapter: \"The Power of Supreme Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"**\nHeaven and earth arise from this; the myriad things are so because of this. The Dao is their origin, virtue their beginning, spirit their ancestor, and great harmony their progenitor. The Dao has depth and shallowness; virtue, thickness and thinness; spirit, clarity and turbidity; harmony, elevation and lowness. The clear becomes heaven; the turbid, earth. The yang becomes male; the yin, female. Humans and creatures receive these endowments in varying measures: their natures differ in refinement, their lifespans in length, their dispositions in beauty and ugliness, their intentions in magnitude. Some become petty men; others, noble lords. Through differentiation and division, they are ranked into countless grades. Thus there are Daoists, virtuous ones, humane ones, righteous ones, and ritualistic ones.\n\nMay I ask: what conduct distinguishes these men, leading to such disparate names?\n\nZhuangzi said: Those who empty themselves and act without contrivance, guiding the myriad things, are called Daoists. Those who are serene and responsive, accomplishing all without obstruction, are called virtuous ones. Those who universally love the myriad things and bestow boundlessly are called humane ones. Those who rectify names, align realities, and handle affairs with propriety are called righteous ones. Those who yield, defer, and maintain harmony through reverence are called ritualistic ones. These five types of men all delight in longevity, honor profound virtue, esteem lofty renown, and employ their intelligence to pursue their strengths, returning to their places of ease. Yet their pursuits diverge, their paths conflict, their transformations vary, and their titles multiply. Virtue has its excellences and deficiencies; the world, its flourishing and decline. Customs drift apart, and the destinies of people differ. Thus some dwell in primordial obscurity, nameless; others, shrouded in vast indistinction, are called August Ones; some, vast and boundless, are called Emperors; others, expansive and luminous, are called Kings; still others, distantly connected and uneven, are called Lords. These are the designations that can be spoken.\n\nYet lords are not truly lords, kings not truly kings, emperors not truly emperors, and August Ones not truly August Ones. Being is not truly being, nor is non-being truly non-being. Myriad transformations, innumerable permutations—how can they be reckoned? How can they be named? Consider this: those who changed their surnames to become kings and were enfeoffed at Mount Tai, performing the Feng and Shan sacrifices, numbered seventy-two. Yet those whose forms and omens were indistinct, whose traces were unrecognizable—how can they be named or described? Are their natures and destinies not different, their achievements and reputations unequal? No.\n\nThus, the lord of supreme virtue embodies the Dao and preserves spirit, moving in accord with transformation. His virtue stirs in the profound obscurity; the world’s kings neither see nor hear of him. His virtue returns to the myriad things, and all declare it natural. The lord of lesser virtue embodies virtue and acts, his spirit roaming with transformation. His virtue matches August Heaven; the world’s kings sometimes see, sometimes hear of him. His virtue flows into the myriad things, returning to his lordship. Why is this?\n\nThe lord of supreme virtue receives the Dao’s subtlest essence in his nature and attains the essence of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny align with the natural; his emotions and intentions embody spirit. His actions harmonize with great harmony; his choices accord with Heaven’s will. His spirit does not ponder; his will does not deliberate. His intelligence is profoundly distant; his being, tranquil and empty. In motion, he is formless; in stillness, unborn. His achievements resemble heaven and earth; his affairs, those of an infant. He sheds form and conceals intent, merging with the Dao. Vast and indistinct, the world knows him not. Flowing and boundless, he soars beyond the farthest reaches. Yin and yang serve him; spirits counsel him. His body transforms with the Dao, ascending and descending without end, advancing and retreating with change. Thus, in serene non-action, his virtue fills the mysterious realm; in silent obscurity, his transformation flows into the infinite. His grace is immeasurable, his depth unfathomable. Embracing the great and nourishing all nations, his wisdom cannot encompass his transformations, nor his words exhaust his customs. The world hums and murmurs, all receiving his transformation and bathed in his harmony. Such is he—eternally without end. Yet who knows the doer of this?\n\nThe lord of lesser virtue receives the Dao’s upright *qi* in his nature and attains the middle grade of unity in his destiny. His nature and destiny approximate the natural; his emotions and intentions approach spirit. His actions align with great harmony; his choices embody supreme virtue. He entrusts his spirit to the great void, roots his being in profound obscurity. In motion, he returns to softness; in stillness, to peace. He wears the square and treads the compass, gazing into the great clarity. His transformations are indistinct, his responses formless. Subtle and imperceptible, he is nearly nameless. Following heaven and earth, he moves with change as his constant. His virtue flourishes, his grace overflows, suffusing all directions. Before his beauty takes shape, the world is innocent, the four seas as one. Vast and silent, he moves with the people; gazing upon things, he mirrors them. At this time, the great Dao is undivided, pure virtue unsevered. Within the six directions, one man alone dwells in his task. He diminishes without adding, cultivates without contriving. His deeds are few; his holdings, minimal. The people are honest and loyal; the world, harmonious and tranquil. Water and grass suffice for sustenance; furs and coarse cloth, for fine attire. Great trees form his halls; caves and grottoes, his chambers. His rule is like heaven and earth; his people, like grass and trees. Bathed in the Dao and aligned with virtue, he is serene and desireless. Yin and yang harmonize; the myriad things flourish. Without decrees, the realm submits. Auspicious grains and red herbs grow together; peonies and herbs sprout side by side. Divine dragons and phoenixes dwell among men. Sweet dew falls ceaselessly; propitious winds blow without pause. Without benevolence or righteousness, the six directions unite in harmony; without ritual or propriety, the four seas become as brothers. Intimate yet not cloying, reverent yet not obsequious, heaven and earth, humans and creatures merge in primordial unity.\n\nThe lord of supreme benevolence possesses a nature pure and clear, luminous and expansive. His mind is empty and still; his spirit and *qi* harmonious. He governs heaven and earth, encompassing all. Perceiving the essential, he nurtures life with non-possession, cherishes the people as children, and responds to changes like echo follows sound, shadow follows form. He illuminates the divisions of heaven and the principles of earth, distinguishing the proper places of humans and things. He opens the gates of knowledge and action, initiating affairs to benefit the myriad people. Internally, he records and externally, he unites, fostering closeness. He accumulates thought and deepens virtue to attract diverse methods. His prohibitions are balanced; his commands, gentle. His actions are timely, delighting the world. Thunder does not crash; winds and rains do not arise abruptly. Grass and trees do not wither; people do not die young. Crawling and flying creatures rejoice in life; wriggling and fluttering beings find their places. The old and weak wander in groups; the strong till and weave. People have grandchildren; the yellow-haired and toothless are as children. The lord is like a parent; the people, like infants. His virtue flows to the four seas, yet he takes nothing.\n\nThe lord of supreme righteousness possesses a nature peaceful and upright, his emotions perceptive and penetrating. He discerns benefits and harms, distinguishes wisdom and intelligence. His mind is like a compass; his will, like a scale. Still as water, straight as a plumb line, he delights in great achievements to establish grand titles. He enjoys initiating blessings and detests causing misfortune. First grasping power and wielding change, he measures the times. He exalts benevolence and encourages righteousness to govern the myriad people. Following heaven and earth’s principles, he orders the myriad things’ proper places. Serving parents as if attending spirits, treading among the people as if over deep abysses, he listens to all nations and adjudicates with the mean. His might is not oppressive; his harmony, not indulgent. Stern yet not cruel, discerning yet not harsh, he examines beginnings and determines ends, establishing influence to guide the people. Advancing and retreating with the times, yielding and extending with change, his affairs transform with tasks, his rituals with customs. His commands are trustworthy; his regulations, distinct. The web of governance is tight yet not dense; laws are upright yet not indulgent. All affairs are decided by ministers; power and authority rest solely with the lord. He extends rectitude with caution, reveals goodness to expose villainy. He enacts the five punishments, carving flesh to revere the origins of governance. Ever mindful of names, he bends with moderation, cuts with principle, and wields power to expand influence, shaking the realm. Setting aside self, he follows others; benefiting the people, he avoids even the slightest harshness. He demotes the minutest beauty and elevates the inner to serve the royal house, extending outward to all beings. Inheriting decay and renewing change, reviving the perishing and restoring the broken, his benevolent virtue revives. Lands are transmitted; descendants endure.\n\nThe lord of supreme ritual possesses a nature harmonious yet emotionally yielding, his mind unconstrained yet his will desirous. In undertaking affairs, he aligns with yin and yang, issues commands in accord with the four seasons, and governs the hundred changes with a net of regulations. He honors the lord and father, humbles the minister and child, clarifies superior and inferior, distinguishes ranks and orders, separates elders and juniors, and unites husbands and wives in human relations. He follows the threads of friendship and reveres the proper sequence of affairs, ranking them by degree. He rewards the constrained and demotes the unbridled, restraining the strong and violent, enveloping customs to guide with the mean. He compels emotions and restrains desires, damming tendencies before they sprout. He binds the world to customs, preventing excess. He forces what people cannot cease and compels what they cannot do, exhausting spirit and injuring nature. Affairs multiply; expenditures swell. Order is achieved, yet peril remains; stability is attained, yet tranquility is lost. Knowledge spreads, yet the great Dao vanishes; sincerity perishes, and benevolent virtue does not arise. Heaven’s will is unharmonized; the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter; the myriad things are harmed by heaven. Father and son have resentment, yet heaven does not harmonize them. Day and night grow bleak, yet the world does not transform. Bells and chimes resound, yet customs do not change. Solemn tones are intoned, yet the wind does not shift. Yielding and deferring, the world does not trust; guarding softness and submitting, the world does not draw near. Hanging titles and setting rewards, the worthy do not descend. Brandishing jade tablets, the noble do not come. Why is this?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, though words be abundant and appearances fair, the sincere heart is not bestowed—this is the reason. Therefore, the emperors and kings rooted their governance in the Dao as the fundamental beginning. When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows; when ritual is lost, chaos follows. These five are of one body in the Dao, yet the lords of the age take them as matters of length and shortness.\n\nHence, what they do is not what they desire; what they seek is not what they attain. They neglect the natural and pursue the petty and shallow—such is the affair of ritual. Inner and outer diverge; blossoms flourish while fruit withers. The branches thrive while the root decays. Ritual is thinner than loyalty, lighter than authority, weaker than trust, falling short of righteousness and virtue, and not reaching benevolence. It is the dregs of governance and the origin of chaos, the wellspring of deceit and the cause of strife. Thus, rituals are established, music composed, calendars reformed, and garments altered; advance and retreat, dignity and decorum, all follow fixed measures. Foreseeing affairs to discern success and failure—these are the blossoms of the Dao and the dregs of virtue, the laws of a moment and the techniques of a corner. They are not the means to govern an endless age or unite the customs of distant lands. Hence, they are the source from which calamities and disorders arise, the cause by which ignorance and delusion are wrought.\n\nHow to make this clear? Zhuangzi said: The response of heaven and earth follows affairs; affairs respond to change; change has no constant time. Thus, affairs cannot be predetermined, nor change foreseen in advance. Just as pain cannot be soothed before it is felt, nor itching scratched before it arises; the five flavors cannot be harmonized by measuring cups, nor the zither tuned by inches. Therefore, the subtlest of precautions cannot be spoken, and the most wondrous of wonders cannot be transmitted. The utmost loyalty and trust cannot be adorned by ritual, nor the harmony of seasons preserved by calculation.\n\nThus, the keen of hearing and clear of sight, the broadly learned and deeply wise, who perceive the warp of yin and grasp the weft of yang, who comprehend the divine way and penetrate the principles of the myriad things—looking up, they see the bounds of heaven; looking down, they see the depths of earth. They teach the people without ceasing, and when affairs arise, they do not halt. By this, they bring about peace—yet this is not what we have heard of.\n\nThe reliance of the myriad things upon the ruler is like the spirit’s dwelling in the body or well-water in the courtyard. Water cannot be made clear by effort, nor the spirit made tranquil by thought. Between heaven and earth, the myriad things arise together; they cannot be pacified by busyness. Therefore, the great man’s transformation is to embody the Dao, embrace virtue, and be as open and penetrating as the great void—complete yet seeming incomplete, existent yet seeming absent. In stillness, without form; in motion, without sound. Loyalty and trust, earnest and sincere, not knowing how to be artful; profound and obscure, simple and unadorned, taking precedence. Diminishing the heart and discarding intentions, without display of dignity, without striving or acting—like the dragon, like the snake, abandoning ritual and casting off righteousness, returning to non-action. Following the times and responding to change without premeditation, grasping the subtle and essential, moving with the times, taking and relinquishing, bending and extending—calamities, disasters, and faults are sought within oneself. A hundred blessings and ten thousand fortunes arise without attachment to others.\n\nAttain the One—this One is the child of the Dao, the mother of spirit and clarity, the ancestor of supreme harmony, the progenitor of heaven and earth. To the spirit, it is nothing; to the Dao, it is something. To the spirit, it is great; to the Dao, it is small. As a thing, it is empty yet full, non-existent yet existent, round yet not obstructive, square yet not rigid. Vast and indistinct, without end or thread, neither floating nor sinking, neither moving nor still. Acting without acting, bestowing without bestowal. Encompassing transformation, bearing all, distinguishing principles—from the nothingness of nothing, the beginning of beginnings. Without inside or outside, chaotic and indistinct, boundless and drifting, it may go left or right. Emptiness and non-action are its constant; clarity and stillness its master. It flows through the ten thousand heavens, courses through the hundred wilds, and the myriad things are thus. Without form or sign, it abides alone in profound mystery, dwelling in perfect secrecy, unchanging in its ease, vast and obscure as the bright sky. It possesses all yet does not share in the crafting of spirit and clarity; it creates heaven and earth yet does not dwell with them. It endows without diminishing, gathers without accumulating, neither crooked nor straight, neither first nor last. Lofty and boundless, deep and unfathomable, above and below beyond reckoning, its currents beyond measure. Expansive and serene, it generates life, yet does not change with the generated. It transforms, yet does not accompany the transformed in birth. It does not give birth, yet things are born of themselves; it does not act, yet things are completed of themselves.\n\nBeyond heaven and earth, within the tip of a hair, all receive qi differently, take different forms, and assume varied appearances—yet all obtain the One to live and are perfected by the transformation of the One. Thus, the One is what the myriad things depend upon and the essential key to all change. It is the plumb line of the ten thousand directions and the measure of a hundred transformations. \"One\" is its name; \"virtue\" its title.",

      "translated_text": "Without a place of abode, without affairs to attend,\nWithout form to measure, returning to the great reckoning,\nHarmonizing its return, weak in its function—\nThus it knows the One, and a thousand changes do not exhaust it;\nTen thousand revolutions do not fail it.\nThose who cannot know the One are at times blocked, at times auspicious;\nThose who hold the state perish, those who guard the self are lost.\n\nTherefore, of old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven’s nature attained the One’s clarity,\nYet heaven’s deeds are not clarity—\nWithout thought, without intent, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nSilent and still, without form or model,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus yin and yang arise of themselves, transformations rectify themselves.\nHence it is firm and strong, ever in motion,\nReaching its height in purity, vast and penetrating,\nLuminous and bright, harmonious and upright,\nPure and unadulterated, true and flourishing,\nUnmixed with things—radiant in great ease.\nVigorous and undaunted, its light illumines the ten thousand things,\nWhich draw upon its beginning.\nClouds gather, rain descends,\nAll beings flow and move.\nAt the origin of nature and destiny,\nProfound and boundless, it covers all without exception.\n\nEarth’s nature attained the One’s tranquility,\nYet earth’s deeds are not tranquility—\nWithout knowledge, without awareness, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout measure, without reckoning, without attachment, without profit,\nIt preserves its

boundless,\nDeep and thick, clear and still.\nThe ten thousand things draw upon it for life, and none fail to be completed.\nIt bears the numinous.\n\nThe numinous attained the One’s spirit,\nYet the numinous’ deeds are not spirit—\nWithout thought, without deliberation, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout calculation, without scheming, without direction, without head,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus growth and decline arise of themselves, life and death rectify themselves.\nHence the old regain youth, the dead return to life,\nThe distressed regain success, the ruined regain glory.\nTransformations are without limit, reversals without end.\nAll forms entrust themselves to it without losing their center.\n\nThe valley’s nature attained the One’s fullness,\nYet the valley’s deeds are not fullness—\nWithout desire, without seeking, without action, without affairs,\nIt follows its nature.\nWithout benevolence, without righteousness, without giving, without bestowing,\nIt preserves its mandate.\nThus fullness and emptiness arise of themselves, flourishing and decline rectify themselves.\nHence it steams mountains and flows through marshes to become penetrating virtue,\nTrickling without cease, continuous without end,\nBright and vast, far-reaching and boundless.\nIt fills rivers and seas, deep and great beyond measure.\n\nThe lords and kings attained the One’s uprightness,\nYet the lords and kings’ deeds are not uprightness—\nAbandoning thought, abandoning will, without action, without affairs,\nThey follow their nature.\nAbandoning hearing, abandoning sight, emptiness and nothingness respond of themselves,\nThey preserve their mandate.\nThus peace arises of itself, the ten thousand things rectify themselves.\nHence they embody the Dao and unite with virtue, aligning with heaven’s constancy.\nEmbracing the spirit, treading harmony,\nThey envelop the ten thousand things.\nTheir voice flies, transforming things,\nFilling the six directions.\nTheir virtue joins with heaven and earth, their brightness illumines sun and moon.\nThey govern the age, guide customs, and unify the world.\n\nThese five all attained the One and practiced it:\nTheir rise was not abandoned, their completion was not lacking,\nTheir flow was not cut off, their light was not extinguished.\nWhy is this so?\nNature and destiny move of themselves, yet follow the One.\n\nThus, if heaven acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be high is to gain lowness, to be clear is to gain rupture.\nYin and yang are perverse and contrary, the warp slackens, the weft breaks.\nHarmonious qi is blocked and obstructed, the Three Luminaries fade,\nThunder and lightning act recklessly, the ten thousand things all lose their way.\n\nIf earth acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be straight is to gain crookedness, to be tranquil is to gain eruption.\nMountains and rivers collapse, hardness and softness coil and break.\nQi-transformations are cut off, the Five Phases are destroyed,\nThe hundred grains wither, the multitude of beings suffer epidemics.\n\nIf the numinous acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo be successful is to gain distress, to be spirit is to gain exhaustion.\nTransformations lose their order, stagnation and dissipation arise,\nFlourishing and decline perish, tension and slackness die.\n\nIf the valley acts and moves, not following the One:\nTo have is to gain loss, to be full is to gain exhaustion.\nFullness and emptiness reverse, flowing moisture does not enter.\n\nIf lords and kings act and move, not following the One:\nTo be noble is to gain baseness, to be upright is to gain downfall.\nChaos and confusion arise, delusion and bewilderment follow,\nAffairs proceed from the self, the hundred officials lose their center,\nNames and realities diverge, the ten thousand people do not return.\nHeaven and earth are cut off.\n\nThese five—nature and destiny pure and perfect,\nTransformations and changes at their utmost,\nAdvance and retreat, bending and stretching—\nDo not depart from the model.\nAttaining the One, they endure; losing the One, they perish.\nHow much more so for those who are not sages yet rule the ten thousand people,\nAbandoning the model and following their own minds?\n\nThus the Dao of heaven and humanity:\nThings transform and change—\nThe few become many, the base become noble,\nThe high become low, the completed become ruined.\nThose who add to it lose, those who profit from it harm.\nTo dwell in its opposite is to gain its reversal;\nTo act for what is sought is to lose what is desired.\n\nTherefore, worthy lords and sage rulers,\nThough their power is above the people, their rank honored in the world,\nTheir beneficence extends to the ten thousand things,

      "translated_text": "The humble quail and the soaring swan take flight, traversing east and west, spanning thousands and tens of thousands, yet their aim remains near. The phoenix and simurgh glide above blades a myriad fathoms high, roam the Great Purity’s expanse, yet ever deem it low—stretching their necks, spreading their wings, they pierce the azure clouds, skim the sun and moon, soar far and vanish, fasting for seasons on end. Coming and going across the Nine Provinces, nesting at the Eight Extremes, only then do they find their proper place. These three differ in their paths, yet each finds its delight. Thus the boundless springs and fathomless fountains are where the spirit dragons gather, where minnows depart; the towering mountains and deep valleys, the dense forests and vast ravines, the luxuriant trees with flourishing branches are where the great birds, tigers, and leopards rejoice, yet where chickens and dogs abhor.\n\nAlas! The remnant customs of the Three Dynasties, the schools of Confucians and Mohists—reciting texts, chanting poems and books, refining rites and music, singing odes and hymns, plucking zithers and lutes, exalting benevolence and righteousness, venerating the ancients, scrutinizing the past, mastering arts and calculations, fixing right and wrong, weighing gains and losses—these bring bodily ease and reputed glory, passed down as the legacy of village scholars. Such are the ways of the middling scholar, yet the superior scholar discards them.\n\nSecluded in quietude, brooding in solitude, they strain to memorize the myriad things, fabricate falsehoods, adorn errors, utter empty words, chase names and realities, flit about in advancement and retreat, rise and fall, kneel and gather, regulating the rites of the inner chambers, conforming to the customs of the age, inclining and reclining, striving to align with the times, flattering the rich, currying favor with the noble, lowering themselves before the masses. Their ears and eyes gain esteem, they bask in favor, and the vulgar deem this right. Such are the steps of the inferior scholar, yet the middling scholar rejects them.\n\nThus, compass and square do not harm each other; disparate natures, how can they find peace? The worthy and sage do not pair; the foolish and wise do not flock. The great man delights in tranquility; the petty man is ever anxious. Grand enterprises are not understood by the masses; bustling affairs do not please the true gentleman. Birds and beasts arise together, each with its own course; scholars of the age each have their own destination. Therefore, they cast aside cleverness, abandon cunning, return to the genuine, revert to simplicity, wander in primordial purity, scorn material things, disdain the world, stand aloof and unstained. Joy and anger do not touch their hearts; profit and harm do not reach their minds. Noble and base share the same realm; life and death are as one. Acting without acting, they behold the wondrous and subtle. Their spirit is serene, nothing to display or bear; embracing virtue, containing harmony, they effortlessly revert to transformation. This is what the great sage esteems, what the superior scholar pursues, what the middling scholar dimly perceives, and what the inferior scholar utterly ridicules.\n\nThus, what the middling scholar hears is not the ultimate beauty; what the inferior scholar sees is not the ultimate goodness. What the middling scholar perceives and the inferior scholar ridicules is the very perfection of beauty and goodness.\n\nTo expound grand words, unfold supreme discourse, reveal the natural, exhaust the wondrous and subtle—this the middling scholar perceives dimly, and the inferior scholar ridicules. Yet with floating words and wandering persuasion, they breed endless changes, conjure blessings, stir up profit, achieve success, and complete affairs. Then the middling scholar debates, and the inferior scholar awakens. They do not delight in restraint but hate good fortune, prize calamity and despise blessing. Their nature is far removed, their feelings reversed—like dwelling in the Yellow Springs while listening and gazing at the Nine Heavens, so distant and cut off they cannot see or hear.\n\nThus the sage establishes the saying: \"There is that, there is that\"—speaking of the Dao’s difficulty to know. Only those who grasp the return to the natural, who unify the directions of the myriad things, can possess it. This is not something the mediocre can hear.\n\nWhy is this so? The sage’s Dao is profound and vast, immense and boundless, obscure and dim, luminous and empty, silent and still. The myriad things pass through it; the minute and the towering, the high and the great—none have form or image. Pursuing it to its utmost, one knows it cannot be grasped; distilling it to its essence, the mouth cannot speak it; tracing its shifts and dispersals, books cannot transmit it.\n\nWhat then? Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat; losing the Dao seems like possessing it. To govern the world, return and reflect upon the self. Stillness is the gate of emptiness; emptiness is the door of the Dao; stillness is the root of spirit; frugality is the vessel of qi; subtlety is the craft of affairs. Abide in the absence that comes after, be present in the presence that comes before. Discard the world, put the self first; nurture the spirit, accumulate harmony to govern the heart. The heart is the master of the body; the body is the state of the heart and the world. They respond as naturally as one’s nature.\n\nThus, level the Dao as if flawed, let the upright and mysterious arise, remove its laws and things, do away with its divisions and principles, follow the people’s hearts, heed what they possess. Eradicate ornamentation, flatten perilous paths, break down barriers, shatter locks, let villainy cease of itself. Tear down walls, disband prisons, let the people guard themselves. Rest the troops, lay down arms, make the world a marketplace. The myriad regions come like rivers to the sea; virtue flows like valleys. Without bestowing, without giving, without loving, without profiting, without abiding, without departing—acting without acting, grace flows. Without benevolence, the moisture is deep; nurturing and fostering the multitude of beings, it is the mother of the world. Vast and white, ever as if startled, without control its power rises, without reliance its authority is weighty. Virtue intermingles with creation, befriending the world. Emerging white, entering black, it does not seek beauty, pursues no merit, flees fame—thus it endures, luminous and resplendent in virtue.\n\nThe steadfast and sincere, humble and unassuming, seem as if lacking. Without form, without appearance, they simplify their emotions, ease their natures, transform into the unlearned. Without acting, without affairs, they seem dull and deaf. Their bodies dwell in unity; their spirit transforms a thousandfold, unseen. Joy and desire cannot be heard, as if closed and blocked. Alone they abide with the Dao, establishing virtue as if thieving—yet nothing is not accomplished. They guide the people’s ears and eyes, adorn the people’s spirits, sever the people’s desires to enrich their natures, extinguish the people’s pleasures to prolong their lives. They diminish the people’s adornments to prevent strife, block the people’s hearts and minds to grant them peace. Pure and genuine, as if transformed, they darken the people with the Dao, nourish them with virtue, cultivate them with spirit, harmonize them with models and standards. They dwell with heaven and earth, illuminate with sun and moon, transform with yin and yang, feed with water and grain, regulate with formlessness, bind with the infinite. The world, yearning, submits without exception; the realm enjoys peace, the myriad things flourish. Yet it is not their achievement, not their virtue. Great yet seeming small, pure yet seeming thin, the great square is not angular—nothing it does not embrace. Square yet not square, straight yet not straight, without boundaries, without edges, without laws, without models, neither square nor straight—yet the myriad things attain their own. Neither straight nor square, heaven and earth proceed on their own.\n\nIn action, it is yin; in stillness, yang. Harmony is the central master; division and principle clarify themselves. With heaven as one, with earth as constant—thus the great vessel is late in completion, yet nothing is not possessed. Transforming in formlessness, changing without trace, moving without sound, acting without body, its majesty and virtue unseen, its achievements unviewed. Misfortune arises from obscurity, fortune from profundity—so it is in stillness and silence.\n\nThis is called utmost skill. The myriad things are born from it, yet none know how. Striving and accomplishing, it endures long. Thus the great sound is rare; it instructs without words, speaks in silence. Spirit and illumination transmit in stillness; the world is greatly open. Without sound, the myriad things are startled; without tone, the myriad things sing. Heaven and earth, humans and things, without appointment, harmonize as if in echo. The great image is without form; the great shape is without appearance. Advancing, the myriad things are preserved; retreating, the myriad things are lost. Heaven and earth move with it; yin and yang bend and stretch with it. It imitates and images them, like shadow following form.\n\nThus one knows: when the Dao flourishes, it has no name; when virtue abounds, it has no title; when merit is lofty, it has no measure—yet the world does not deem it great. Virtue fills the Four Seas, yet the world does not deem it noble. Its radiance illumines the Six Directions, yet it returns to obscurity.\n\nWhy is this so?",

      "translated_text": "The Dao’s transformations begin in nonbeing and end in decay, abide in what does not abide, lend without lending, move and the myriad things are completed, rest and the world is fulfilled.\n\n*Daoist Canon of the Point of Return*, Scroll One\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Library Collection*\n*Daoist Canon of the Point of Return*, Scroll Two\nBy Yan Zun of the Han\n\n**The Dao Gives Birth to the One**\n\nThere is the emptiness of emptiness—it opens and guides, bestows and receives. Yet what is so of itself cannot make itself so. There is emptiness—it molds and transforms, begins the begetting of life. Yet what lives cannot beget life. There is the nonbeing of nonbeing—spirit and light cannot alter it. What abides cannot abide. There is nonbeing—subtle and wondrous, moving and forming. Yet what is formed cannot form.\n\nThus the emptiness of emptiness gives birth to emptiness; emptiness gives birth to the nonbeing of nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to nonbeing; nonbeing gives birth to form. All that has form belongs to things. Things have their lineage, their ancestry. Heaven and earth are the greatest of things; humans come next.\n\nNow, heaven gives birth to humans: form arises from qi, qi from harmony, harmony from spirit and light, spirit and light from virtue and power, virtue and power from spontaneity. All things exist thereby. Thus what makes heaven heaven is not heaven; what makes humans human is not humans. How is this known? Zhuangzi said: When the human form decays, where does its intelligence go? When perception and response cease, where do change and renewal come from? Who governs beginning and end? From this we see: being arises from nonbeing, reality from emptiness—this too is clear.\n\nTherefore, the nonbeing of nonbeing has no beginning and cannot be made to exist; the formless and soundless cannot be heard or seen. What receives nonbeing and bestows being cannot be spoken of. The Dao is the nonbeing of nonbeing, the beginning of the unbegun, the origin of the myriad things and the source of life—yet it has no name. The Dao is the emptiness of emptiness, and thus it gives birth to the One.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic and indistinct, arising yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling, yang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior. Without above or below, without left or right, it pervades without boundary—this is the warp and woof of the Dao. It embraces the formless and nameless, vast and boundless, indistinct and obscure, beyond reckoning, vanished from sound and color, incomparable. Point to it and it has no direction; grasp it and it is not there. Vast and inexhaustible, beyond discourse, it is a great unity, without end or beginning, the dwelling of the myriad things, the Great Beginning. Thus it is called the One.\n\nThe One, being empty, gives birth to the Two. The Two things arise together, wondrously subtle, begetting and abiding, transforming with things, fluid and formless, living and unceasing, radiant and dark, without direction or abode. It envelops heaven and earth, yet none see its origin. It cannot be pursued by sound or escaped by form—this is called spirit and light. What abides when things abide, vanishes when things vanish, beyond the reach of wisdom and strength, beyond the sway of awe and virtue—this is called the Two.\n\nThe Two, being the nonbeing of nonbeing, gives birth to the Three. The Three things arise together, indistinct and obscure. Look and its form is not seen; listen and its sound is not heard; grasp and its thread is not found; gaze and its gate is not seen. It cannot be measured or fathomed, dark and deep, vast and boundless. One clear, one turbid, they move with harmony—this is the beginning of heaven and humans. Before form appears, its roots lie in the One, its mandate in spirit—this is called the Three.\n\nThe Three, being nonbeing, gives birth to the myriad things. Clear and turbid divide, high and low are arrayed, yin and yang separate, harmony flows, the Three Luminaries move, the masses of beings live. What has form and can be followed, what has sound and color and can be seen and heard—these are called the myriad things.\n\nThe birth of the myriad things all originates in emptiness, begins in nonbeing. They turn from yin toward yang, return to softness and depart from hardness. Still and unmoving, the heart-mind does not stir, yet form and appearance are cultivated and vast, life and destiny flow freely—this is because they contain harmony and softness, and the Dao is formless.\n\nThus emptiness, nonbeing, formlessness, fewness, and softness are what heaven and earth arise from and what the myriad things are born of. These are what the common people despise, yet what kings and lords name themselves. They are the source and spring of the myriad things, the root of accomplishment.\n\nTherefore, worthy rulers and sage lords, in their most honored positions and with their vast power, dwell in solitude and lowliness, pursue what cannot be pursued, flee what cannot be fled. They make the great small, the secure humble, the joyful diminished. They emerge without trace, enter without sign. In movement, they precede fortune; in stillness, they anticipate misfortune. They act without action, attend without affairs, and the world is naturally ordered. They do not see, do not listen, embrace harmony in stillness. Spirit and light arise, form and appearance are naturally rectified. Advance and retreat follow constant patterns, their conduct unchanging. Their virtue transforms like wind, their governance reaches the masses. Heaven and earth assist them; the myriad things return to them.\n\nThe common people are not so. What they see and hear becomes their affliction. Seeing and hearing become afflictions, yet they cling to completed affairs, blind to unforeseen changes. They value hardness and strength, great power and imposing force. Their many tasks are ungoverned; their deep schemes weaken softness and sever fewness. Their movements oppose the Dao; their stillness clashes with heaven. Spirit and light scatter; turbidity arises. Affairs multiply; thoughts and plans are confused. They rejoice and rage without cause. Fortune leaves their gates; calamity enters their homes. Heaven’s net is cast—there is no escape.\n\nSuddenly, disaster strikes. Too late, they awaken, humbled in speech, lowly in conduct. As death approaches, they speak of goodness. Though they wish to reform and renew, they cannot return to fewness and spontaneity. They depart from the path of life, far and irrevocably. States are broken, families destroyed; misfortune reaches their descendants.\n\nThus the common people’s teachings turn foolishness into wisdom, weakness into strength, fewness into display, concealment into prominence. They abandon humility and pursue glory, contending and perishing for fame.\n\nThe sage’s teachings reverse this: they make the wise foolish, the honored humble, the prominent concealed, the many few, the strong weak. They discard the heart-mind, release intentions, strive for namelessness, knowing nothing, recognizing nothing, returning to the dark and obscure. Though their paths differ and their aims vary, some abide, some vanish.\n\nThus mighty Qin and great Chu, with their monopolies on power, perished. The divine Han, arising in harmony and compliance, flourished. Those who are strong depart from the Dao; those who are rigid leave spirit and light. Those who seek life through retreat may find lasting peace, but those who do not seek within themselves blame fate and resent heaven. The sage pities them and makes this his teaching. First, he writes it on bamboo and silk to clearly show later generations, that they may return to it throughout their lives and avoid its misfortunes.\n\n**The Utmost Softness**\n\nThe Dao is most numinous, and spirit and light serve it. Spirit is most bright, and Great Harmony submits to it. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, the utmost softness—formless, it envelops heaven and earth, contains yin and yang, orders the myriad things, and holds all in its warp and woof. Some dwell beyond the cosmos, some within heaven. Humans and things borrow it to live, yet none see or hear it. It is too fine to be named, too weak to be called. The sage preserves it in intention—it is a thing.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is named \"Utmost Softness\" and called \"Formless.\" Therefore, the formless thing does not rely on hardness to be hard, nor on strength to be strong. Thus it can outlast heaven and earth, dissolve bronze and iron, race like wind, gallop like lightning, traverse the extremes of sun and moon, circulate above and below, surpass the fleeting and transient, and soar securely, submerged in nothingness. How to prove this is so?\n\nSound arises from silence, yet cannot be exhausted; shadow arises from formlessness, yet cannot be bounded. Water, through its softness and weakness, penetrates metal and stone, sinks through the myriad things, and grounds the earth. Through softness and compliance, it accomplishes great works, surpassing grasses and trees. The tongue and ears suffer no harm, while horns and teeth break and injure. From this we see: softness outlasts hardness, emptiness outpaces solidity. These are not the creations of human effort, but the natural properties of things.\n\nThus, when a land is narrow, its people few, its troops scant, its food scarce, its intentions subtle, its desires restrained, and its spirit luminous in its vigilance—then it stands peer to heaven. It regards all things as its children; its virtue flourishes, its transformation is profound, its grace is deep, its blessings are abundant. Its officials are loyal, its soldiers are faithful, its lord is anxious for their burdens, its generals fear encumbering them. Though it accumulates softness and weakness, always lagging behind its people, bearing shame and humiliation, its state is deemed feminine and inferior among the feudal lords—yet they trust it as they would an infant. The world turns to it as if returning to father and mother. All beings share its desires; its prestige and power arise of themselves. The strong cannot oppress it, the wise cannot seize it. Through all reversals of fortune, shifts between strength and weakness, heaven and earth aid it, and the spirit luminaries assist it. When the time comes, it cannot be controlled—it becomes master of the world. Why is this so? Because it embodies the Dao’s softness and weakness, its subtlety and scarcity.\n\nThus, when a land is vast, its people numerous, its state wealthy, its troops strong, its officials bold, its soldiers fierce, its lord capable, its generals strict, its rewards heavy, its punishments severe, its punishments harsh, its laws exacting, its officials trembling as if before the ruler—then its power is convenient, its terrain advantageous, and it becomes a hegemon within the seas. It scorns its enemies, delights in war, and easily mobilizes its masses. Its armies unite, its tactics adapt, its strategies generate wonders. It bullies heaven and humiliates earth; the feudal lords submit, none daring to defy its commands. Its might shakes lands beyond its borders; it is ever a fierce predator, a source of worry for people and fear for all things. Its power moves heaven and earth, yet the Dao does not abide in it, the spirit luminaries are not with it, the masses are weak, and their hearts are not as one. The myriad people do not adhere to it; its body dies, its state perishes, its clan is annihilated, its defenses collapse. Why is this so? Because it embodies hardness and rigidity, and accumulates stinginess and greed.\n\nThe Dao, through the existence of non-existence, penetrates what has no gaps, roams where there is no principle, and illuminates the chambers of human effort. It purifies the abode of non-action, enters and exits without bounds, traverses without limits, passes through pearls and jade without leaving a trace. How to prove this is so?\n\nA sharp blade cannot enter where there is no principle; the spirit luminaries reside in the body, exiting without gaps and entering without openings. In the time it takes to look up and down, they traverse thousands of miles. From this we see: the achievements of human effort are abandoned and fruitless; the accomplishments of non-action are complete and endless. Heaven and earth are its creation, the myriad beings are its arising. The sound of sound is heard for a hundred miles; the sound of silence moves beyond heaven, shaking the four seas. The words that are spoken do not communicate across different kinds; the wordless words transform yin and yang, move heaven and earth, and resonate. Moreover, the Dao’s non-action brings heaven and earth to completion; heaven and earth’s silence sets the four seasons in motion. These two are the signs of the spirit luminaries, the proofs of the natural.\n\nThus, the sage empties the mind to fathom the Dao and virtue, stills the qi to preserve the spirit luminaries, reduces hearing to listen for the soundless, and abandons sight to see the formless. Observing the changes of heaven and earth, contemplating the spontaneity of the myriad things, he perceives that human effort is the source of chaos.\n\nNon-action is the origin of governance. Speech is the door to misfortune; silence is the gate to blessing. Therefore, he cuts off sagacity, discards wisdom, removes benevolence, and abandons righteousness. He arouses the mind of the Dao, raises the intention of virtue, follows the spirit, nurtures harmony, entrusts himself to heaven, serves earth, fulfills the duties of yin and yang, and gallops through the origins of chaos to sever things. He settles their place in the world, masters tranquility, and the myriad people are without trouble. He teaches with wordless words, transforms with untransforming transformation, and demonstrates with imageless images, guiding them to the profound and subtle. He veils the people’s emotions and desires, follows their nature and destiny, so they remain unknowing, live long, and see far. Thus, I am silent, and heaven and earth are without action; heaven and earth are without action, and the Dao and virtue are without action. These three arise together, advance in concert, and their harmonious qi overflows. Great peace flourishes, beings gather and dwell within the cosmos, and all is blended as one. The gates of misfortune are closed; the world is as innocent as a child, the age is without shame, no one sees fortune or misfortune, and thus ignorance naturally becomes great understanding. Families obtain the blessings of the spirit luminaries, and people achieve the merits of sagacity and wisdom. At this time, the ruler is like heaven and earth, the people like infants. They drink the ruler’s virtue, feed on his harmony; yang emerges, yin enters, and they contract and expand with the Dao. The lord and father are above, as if present, as if absent. The world is dazed and murmuring, not knowing, like nestlings. They live without joy, die without sorrow, their nature and destiny overflowing. None seek anything, yet the myriad blessings come of themselves. Why is this so? Because the lord of men does not speak, and the Dao is without action.\n\nThe pivot of non-action, the mechanism of silence, lies in essence and subtlety, abides in the spirit’s subtlety, begins in the spirit’s defense, and originates in the root of essence and subtlety. It arises without root or stem, enters and exits without gate, and constantly dwells between action and inaction, at the origin of harmonious timing. Thus, it can be heard but not made manifest, seen but not expounded, obtained but not transmitted, used but not spoken of. Grasping its handle and pushing it forward, condensing it to its essentials—this is easy for the wise to set forth, difficult for the shallow to hear. Why? Because it is vast and deep, and the many cannot reach it over time. It is lofty yet seems lowly, and the multitude cannot enter. It is bland and overflowing, yet the world cannot hear of it. It is profound and dark, yet the vulgar rulers cannot practice it.\n\n**Which is Closer: Name or Body?**\n\nWhat I receive as my nature to become myself is the Dao and virtue. What I borrow to live is the spirit luminaries. What I rely upon to complete myself is Great Harmony. What I entrust to take form is heaven and earth. These several things constitute me, yet I cannot constitute them.\n\nThus, nothing is more exalted than the Dao and virtue for modeling and emulation; nothing is loftier than the spirit luminaries for standards and exemplars; nothing is vaster than Great Harmony for manifesting clarity; nothing is greater than heaven and earth. The Dao and virtue, the spirit luminaries, constantly give life and do not die. Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, transform endlessly. The Dao of heaven and earth persists and is difficult to destroy; the affairs of yin and yang move and are difficult to end. From this we see: misfortune culminates in death, blessing culminates in life.\n\nThus, the sage above fathoms the intention of the Dao and virtue, below measures the heart of heaven and earth. He honors the lofty, displays glory, and accumulates auspicious and flourishing virtue. His depth is vast, his greatness boundless; his honor and favor reach their utmost. Nothing is greater than life. The myriad things are arrayed, strange and wondrous treasures—gold, jade, pearls, and jade disks—are of deep and immense benefit. Nothing is greater than the body. The craftsmen of the world’s misfortunes, the artisans of the state’s chaos, those who cut off heaven and earth and harm my body—nothing is greater than these.",

Clarity and turbidity, Great Harmony, the utmost softness—formless, it envelops heaven and earth, contains yin and yang, orders the myriad things, and holds all in its warp and woof. Some dwell beyond the cosmos, some within heaven. Humans and things borrow it to live, yet none see or hear it. It is too fine to be named, too weak to be called. The sage preserves it in intention—it is a thing.",

      "translated_text": "The name arises and yet must be guarded, lest it grow and overflow, bringing constraint to the people and poverty to the state, disturbing the clarity of spirit and mind. When the heart harbors many desires, it rebels against heaven and transgresses the Dao, striving to become a thief or bandit. The world then turns against it, and wars and strife multiply—one man’s ruin brings defeat to myriad nations, and the people perish while the myriad things suffer its poison. Nothing is greater than this.\n\nWealth is acquired by fate, yet its gain or loss may bring sickness or benefit. A name gained and wealth acquired: virtue does not dwell there, nor does the luminous power remain. The great command is thus cut off, and heaven cannot save it. To lose name and wealth is to lose virtue, to lose the luminous power is to lose assistance. A name that appears naturally brings wealth, and the harmony of heaven and earth is complete. Yet, petty names and great wealth cannot be compared to the Dao.\n\nTo slight the body while burdening the state is not to be contemplated; to seek profit is folly. The nameless name is the dwelling of my life, while the named name is the defense of my ruin. The wealthless wealth nurtures my blessings, and the wealth possessed is the thief that harms me. Therefore, those who deeply love their bodies exhaust themselves in building glorious names—acting, striving, laboring, and forcing their nature to harm their spirit. They hoard wealth daily, fearing excess and loss, yet when name and wealth both end, the luminous power cannot sustain life, nor can heaven and earth preserve the body.\n\nWhy is this so? The transformation of virtue and the measure of heaven and earth—one yin and one yang—divide into the four seasons, separate into the five forms, weave like a net, and set without gaps. The nature of all things has its own degree, never encroaching upon another. The heart of creation is harmonious and upright, just and equitable, without partiality or hatred, aligning with all things. It nourishes the deficient and supplements the lacking, reduces the excess and benefits the void. Those who lack are sustained, those with abundance are restrained; the greedy and presumptuous accumulate misfortune for themselves. The deficient never cease, and the desire for profit constantly arises, using cunning to deceive and strength to seize. Nature’s balance is thus overturned: names and wealth return to their rightful owner, and their loss brings sorrow, gain brings joy. One joy, one sorrow—soul and spirit float. When one fears sorrow and rejoices in gain, the luminous power departs. The body dies, the name vanishes, and calamity extends to descendants. Thus, names and wealth are like charcoal and ice—opposite in nature, yet their forces cannot coexist. When name ends and the body is exhausted, the world flourishes. Yet none in the world attain this. Therefore, they disturb the mind, entangle the will, ensnare the emotions, and exhaust the spirit, day and night pursuing affairs, adorning their words and actions, and fretting over the multitude. They establish deeds and strive for merit, exhausting their bodies to build glorious names—this is the way to harm the body while benefiting its ruin.\n\nThey strain their sinews, endure hunger and thirst, brave cold and heat, tread upon perilous paths, wear coarse garments, eat foul foods, and neglect their own comforts—morning and night they are exposed to shame and humiliation, their spirits driven and scattered, ceaselessly laboring. They defy the Dao and provoke calamity, often inviting danger to their bodies for the sake of wealth, while their luminous power is spent and their spirits perish. Misfortune comes of its own accord. Yet when defense and restraint are both achieved, this is true fortune. To seek fortune while abandoning it, to pursue profit while fleeing it—this is the way of failure and ruin. Thus, the affairs of success and defeat lie in whether one acts or not, and the Dao of life and death lies in whether one flees or follows.\n\nThose who know sufficiency align with the Dao and virtue, their names and profits extinguished. They establish themselves in the boundless and yet do not perish, nurture things without self-preservation, and exist with all things without self-assertion. Their harmony and trust are sufficient to sustain the spirit, and their domestic affairs are sufficient to complete the year. Always in accordance with nature, they cannot be slain. They dwell in the void and cannot be pierced, their petty names and great wealth cannot be sullied, and their desires do not desire—thus they endure in glory. Those who know cessation are esteemed as sovereigns, yet do not corrupt their wills; they dwell in poverty in caves and yet do not obscure their spirits. They advance without seeking display, retreat without seeking confinement. Neither misfortune nor fortune, neither gain nor loss, neither seeking nor avoiding—this is without guilt or merit, without pursuit or rejection. Like the vast sea or a great river, they rise without seeking prominence and recede without seeking obscurity. No calamity, no fortune, no gain, no loss—this is the way of the unerring and the boundless.\n\nWhy is this so? The subtle and profound, the all-encompassing and precise, the pure and tranquil—these are the true transformations. Without form or sound, their essence opens like the sun and closes like the moon, rising like earth and moving like heaven. The actions of the sage are vast and his virtue profound, yet he does not display himself. His benevolence and righteousness are not seen, his rituals and propriety are not established, and he does not engage in artificial deeds. Though he does not desire, heaven transforms of its own accord. His simplicity and sincerity are like an infant, not knowing what to seek or where to go. His use is inexhaustible, flowing without decay.\n\nHe does not till yet has food, does not weave yet has clothing. In heat, he rests in the naked; in cold, he stirs in the fur-lined. He has no taboos, dwelling with deer and wild beasts, his hair unbound, his breast filled—he wanders with them in ease. His virtue is abundant, his people prosperous, and his influence pervades all things without hindrance. His brilliance is unseen, yet he alone possesses the strange. Heaven and earth, all things—with him they transform together. He rides the void and bears the empty, wandering with the Dao, vast and boundless. He dwells in the utmost boundlessness—why is this so?",

Heaven and Earth:\nAdvancing and retreating, all things are completed.\nTransformation is unobstructed, bending and stretching unbarred.\nThus when yin reaches its peak—\nThe earth splits, ice congeals,\nCold winds howl, frost and snow descend,\nFish and turtles burrow deep,\nAll things curl in upon themselves.\nAt such times, even in heated chambers,\nBeside braziers, in fur-lined robes,\nOne cannot ward off the chill.\n\nWhen yang reaches its peak—\nSand is seared, stones crack,\nBirds flee, waters dry,\nCreatures wither, rivers vanish.\nAt such times, even in cool springs,\nIn light garments, in high pavilions,\nOne cannot endure the heat.\n\nYet when the mind is settled, the spirit refined,\nThe body labored, the form exhausted—\nThen the logic drains, sweat flows,\nClothing is cast aside, one steps outside—\nWarmth suffices the body.\n\nWhen the heart is released, the will dissolved,\nThe spirit entrusted to emptiness,\nThe form at ease beyond the Four Seas,\nThe will wandering where nothing exists—\nThen the mind is level, the qi harmonious,\nCoolness suffices the body.\n\nKnowledge, then, is the art of governance—\nTo nurture the people, cultivate the masses,\nExtend virtue, harmonize Heaven and Earth,\nAlign with yin and yang.\nYet when disorder arises—\nIt emerges from the formless, begins from the inaudible.\nPolitics unfurls like silk, transformation shifts like water.\nTo grasp the people is like grasping dampness;\nTo reach the people is like reaching shadow.\nThus, the more one governs, the more disorder grows;\nThe more one restrains, the more troublesome it becomes.\nThe wise cannot comprehend it;\nHarsh punishments cannot suppress it.\nYet the ruler of *wuwei* is the ruler of action,\nAnd the master of success.\n\nThe origin of governance and transformation—\nThe rest is like subduing heat with stillness,\nOr dispelling cold with agitation.\n\nThus the Sage discards knowledge, abandons deliberation,\nEmpties the heart, focuses the qi,\nClears and stills, responding to Heaven’s intent,\nFollowing Earth’s design.\nGovernance moves, transformation flows,\nLike sunlight’s radiance.\nDisorder dissipates like clouds dispersing;\nThe world mirrors it without end,\nAll things take it as their teacher,\nServe it without reservation.\n\nWhen the Way prevails in the world—\nLife hangs by the sovereign’s command,\nThe sovereign’s standing hangs by the people.\nIf the sovereign follows the Dao,\nThen the myriad people flourish.\nIf the sovereign loses the Dao,\nThen the myriad people resist.\nWhen the people flourish, ancestral temples shine;\nWhen the people resist, ancestral temples crumble.\nThus the sovereign is the people’s source,\nThe people are the sovereign’s root.\nIf the root is injured, flowers and fruit do not grow;\nIf the source decays, the flow does not fill.\nAbove and below preserve each other—\nThus they endure.\n\nHence when the sovereign follows the Dao,\nThe realm is undisturbed,\nThe feudal lords submit in homage,\nThe barbarian tribes rejoice,\nThe Four Seas align in wind.\nWeapons are not raised,\nThe fierce have none to emulate,\nThe bold have no field to display their strength,\nThe clever till by favor,\nSteeds and chariots labor in ease.\nThe world is at rest, each pursuing their work,\nCustoms are sincere, the people simple,\nAll weave as one, all till as one,\nHeaven’s heart is harmonized,\nAll things flourish in abundance,\nAuspicious omens descend in succession,\nFortunate signs gather—\nNot Heaven’s bestowal, but the sovereign’s virtue and power.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven loses the Dao,\nThe feudal lords do not pay homage,\nValleys differ, laws conflict,\nThe Four Quarters rebel,\nThe strong oppress the weak,\nWeapons clash for dominance.\nThus the world’s warriors sharpen blades,\nKindle beacon fires on all sides,\nDeep deceits and grand treacheries hatch in the ancestral halls,\nStrategies unfold, alliances form,\nLight cavalry scouts the enemy,\nSoldiers march to battle,\nYear after year, none return.\nAt such times,\nWarhorses are groomed without respite,\nFamilies flee to the borders,\nThe common folk eat coarse grains,\nGreedy officials sit as ministers,\nServants turn to bandits,\nThe people are exhausted, resources depleted,\nLabor never ceases.\nThey long for home, hearts aching,\nPining for parents—\nTears flow abroad,\nLoving fathers, kind mothers,\nTheir hearts shattered, their spirits broken.\nSoldiers’ heads are crushed, their bones exposed,\nScattered across the wilderness—\nCountless in number.\nThe roads are filled with orphaned children,\nWailing, leaping to their feet in grief.\nWhat crime has Heaven committed\nThat this calamity befalls them?\nWidows have no husbands,\nOrphans no fathers.\nTheir sorrow and rage gather unplanned—\nThe strong lead, the middle follow,\nAbove and below defend themselves,\nInner and outer guard each other.\nThough not bound by blood,\nThey rally like brothers,\nRaising banners, digging trenches,\nMarching in formation.\nTheir resolve is absolute,\nTheir spirits converge,\nTheir qi moves in unison.\nThus Heaven and Earth are constrained,\nYin and yang blocked,\nStars and constellations in disarray,\nThe sun and moon eclipsed,\nDeceit and rebellion sprout,\nDisasters and omens erupt—\nNot Heaven’s punishment,\nBut the sovereign’s loss of the Dao.\n\nTo inherit the great mandate of Heaven,\nTo succeed the ancient Sages,\nNoble as the Son of Heaven,\nRich with the Four Seas,\nHonored beyond compare—\nYet in coarse robes, the world calls it good;\nEating vegetables and millet gruel, the world calls it sweet.\nTo transform the age, shift customs—\nLike grass bending in the wind,\nLike fish drawn to water.\nYet not to uphold the Dao,\nNot to broaden virtue,\nNot to refine the self,\nNot to rectify one’s conduct,\nNot to labor for the people,\nTo neglect ancestral rites,\nTo dim the glory of forefathers,\nTo pass on no legacy to descendants—\nTo contend with spirits,\nTo rival Heaven and Earth,\nTo seek fame and power without end,\nTo defy Heaven, oppose Earth—\nThere is none it does not insult.\nThus the unworthy rise in rebellion,\nLightly entering, deeply striking,\nArriving first to claim victory,\nThe distant enemy unopposed.\nParties split, alliances fracture,\nInner and outer severed.\nRelying on nothing,\nThe state collapses, the ancestral temples crumble.\nThis is not the people’s fault—\nIt is the sovereign’s desire.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when authority, prestige, and favor reach their utmost and the people above are renowned with glory covering the land yet remain insatiable, they become the instruments of disaster and the great fate of ruin.\n\nThe Dao and virtue, divine and transformative, refine and alter—when one attains them, they become the safeguard of humanity, harmonizing spirit and form, making movement effortless and senses keen. The eyes perceive brilliance in the boundless realm, the ears listen to the patterns of Heaven and Earth, observing natural laws above and the gains and losses of antiquity below. They draw water from wells, till fields for sustenance, take wives, bear children, and fulfill their allotted span—this is true sufficiency. How much more so for the sovereign of ten thousand chariots or the lord of a thousand? It is clear they cannot find sufficiency in this.\n\nThus, it does not lie in the Dao.\n\nWhen greed arises, desiring others’ lands, coveting their wealth and treasures, merging and accumulating without end, they invite calamity and incur the greatest blame.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, no living creature—whether soaring bird, running beast, or breathing thing—has failed to seek what sustains its life. Therefore, to dwell as a sovereign is to dwell in peril; to rule like a tiger is to set traps. Fame rests above the clouds, yet the body lies beneath the Yellow Springs. Those who occupy the station of oxen and horses suffer no worse than oxen and horses; those who take their place among dogs and sheep face no greater fault. Hence, those who embody the Dao steady their hearts in sufficiency, rest their intentions in stillness, abandon authority, and dwell alone in solitude, discarding all things while holding only to the divine. They preserve their bodies and honor their names without peril, and all under Heaven submit to them without resistance—none dare oppose them without leaving their doors.\n\nThe Dao and virtue transform and refine, nurturing the original essence, receiving life and spirit. In the boundless void, in the dark and formless, all things merge into chaos. Then divine clarity separates purity from turbidity, and the Great Harmony flows. In the vast and minute, all things take shape. Heaven is round, Earth is square; humans stand upright, beasts move horizontally; grasses and trees take root, fish sink, birds fly—each kind is distinct, each group divided, and ranks are established. Thus, the *ji-fang* arises.\n\nFrom this, it is seen that Heaven, Earth, and all beings share the same origin, stem from one source. Within the six directions and beyond the cosmos, they are interconnected as one body. Qi and transformation divide and spread, horizontally and vertically, split into two, divided into five—into white and black, water and fire, sour and bitter, or feathered and winged. Among humans, male and female. All these, though differing in form and region, share the same origin, the same nature, the same heart and intent. How so?\n\nZhuangzi said: Within a single body, father and mother give life to the four limbs and nine orifices, each with its distinct function. The five viscera and six bowels each receive their allotted essence. Above and below do not know each other; inner and outer do not see each other. The head and feet are like Heaven and Earth; the elbows and knees like the four seas; the liver and gallbladder like the Hu and Yue; the eyebrows and eyes like Qi and Chu. If they did not differ in origin, how could they vary in form? If they did not differ in form, how could they not rely on one another in motion or rest?\n\nAbove the nine heavens and below the Yellow Springs, this cannot be fully described. Yet if the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk; if the chest is sick, the mouth cannot speak. When the heart finds ease, the ears grow sharp, the eyes clear, limbs flexible, and every joint light and agile—this is because of their shared form.\n\nWhen human movement stirs nearby, distant beings respond; when beings act here, Heaven and Earth respond there. Self and other resonate, entering and exiting without gates, coming and going without doors. Within the vast emptiness of Heaven and Earth, all things respond without fail—this is because they share the same body.\n\nThus, the sage does not leave the home to understand parents, nor the family to know descendants. They perceive danger and safety, gain and loss, life and death. They discern right and wrong, grasp the roots of advantage and harm, and comprehend the origins of order and chaos. They know the self to know the family, the family to know others, and thus grasp the threads of affairs and the patterns of things. They move knowing their path, remain knowing their guard.\n\nThe Dao is father, divine clarity is mother, stillness is teacher, Great Harmony is friend, the world is home, and all things are body. To regard others as oneself, and oneself as others—no thought dares arise, no intention dares act. They abandon knowledge, sever awareness, and extinguish the three five, yet nothing is undone. They dwell in caves, wear rough garments, do not kill, do not eat living things, do not pluck unripe plants, do not wear incomplete fabrics, and do not cut what is not yet grown. Heaven, Earth, and all beings each preserve their own.\n\nTo know the origin before its manifestation, the source of life and spirit, the beginning of blood and qi, the foundation of form—this is to recognize that the real arises from the void, the existent from the nonexistent. The small does not fail to enter the great; the great does not fail to contain the small.\n\nThe origin of my life lies in the Dao, nurtured yet unborn, forming shape only upon emerging from obscurity. To perceive the profound subtleties, the gentle yet resilient, the smooth yet vast—this is the great harmony.\n\nThe unknowing, the unthinking, the doing-nothing, the effortless—these yield the greatest deeds. To regard myself as an infant, growing to maturity, knowing softness giving rise to hardness, weakness to strength, smallness to greatness, shortness to length, foolishness to wisdom, obscurity to clarity—this is to observe the transformations of life.\n\nTo examine my breathing, my bending and stretching, to know that loss brings gain, that gain brings loss, that progress is retreat, that retreat is progress, that root is blessing, that blessing is ruin, that ruin is blessing, that first is last—this is to perceive the great function of stillness, emptiness, and non-action.\n\nThe four limbs and nine orifices pursue their tasks, their abilities diverse, their forms distinct—all originate from one heart. Thus, the myriad transformations of advantage and harm among all things arise from the master’s deliberation. Heaven and Earth verify this from ancient times to now; motion never contradicts itself. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete in me.\n\nTherefore, the family is the root from which to know humanity; the body is the wellspring from which to know Heaven. To observe Heaven without the body, to know humanity without the family—this is to see the near while missing the far, to know the small while losing the great. To leave the home and not see the world, to abandon the body and peer through windows, is to fail to grasp the Dao of Heaven. The farther one wanders, the more confused they become; the more they seek, the greater their delusion. The more they pursue fame and gain, the smaller their true function grows. They do not see, they do not hear—yet they seek it in themselves. At the juncture of Heaven and humanity, the great Dao is complete.\n\nThus, the sage does not perceive the likes and dislikes of a single family yet commands the affairs of ten thousand households. They do not undertake a thousand-li journey yet alter the transformations of the nine regions. Their feet do not ascend to Heaven, yet they know the heart of the nine heavens. Their bodies do not enter the Earth, yet they perceive the changes of the nine depths. The advance and retreat of yin and yang, the shifts of the four seasons, the profound and hidden—nothing escapes them. How so? They discern the inner to know the outer, the small to know the great, the self to know others, the near to illuminate the far.",

      "translated_text": "The Way by which it is illuminated—Zhuangzi said: *\"What I am by virtue of being myself, am I myself?*\nThe self by which I am my body is not the body itself.\nThe body by which it is its body is because I exist within it.\nBut what I am by virtue of being myself is because of the numinous presence within me.\nThe numinous presence abides in me because the Dao wills it so.\nTo entrust oneself to the Dao’s method and preserve the numinous presence—\nclarity and purity are its constant,\nemptiness and stillness are its essence.\nThis is not something the heart or mind can achieve,\nnor is it something thought or deliberation can accomplish.\n\nThus, the wise person’s dwelling:\nears and eyes seeing and hearing,\nheart and mind thinking and deliberating,\ndrinking and eating at proper times,\nexhausting all paths, devising all strategies,\ndetermining the beginnings of safety and peril,\ndiscerning paths of approach and retreat—\nall to preserve the body and prolong life.\nYet if so, then the spirit is diminished,\nthe vital essence is exhausted,\nthe soul and vital breath depart,\nand life is cut short.\nWhen one sleeps, the heart and mind are inactive,\nthe senses are obscured,\nno thought or deliberation occurs,\nno eating or drinking takes place,\nthe spirit harmonizes,\nthe vital essence revives,\nthe heart finds its ease,\nthe body knows no ailments,\nthe soul avoids harm,\ngreat wounds heal,\nthe bones mend,\nall orifices receive what they desire.\n\nIf one abandons the heart, peril becomes safety;\nif one employs the heart, security becomes ruin.\nHow much more so for one who upholds the Dao and virtue,\nfollows the numinous,\nconforms to Heaven’s intent,\nand nurtures all beings?\n\nThus, the sage establishes the body without body,\nembraces the heart without heart,\npossesses the having of non-being,\nand abides in the existence of non-existence.\nAbove, he contains the transformation of Dao and virtue;\nbelow, he encompasses the hearts of all people.\nHe harbors neither evil nor good,\nneither love nor hatred.\nHe does not make enemies of the wicked,\nnor allies of the virtuous,\nnor conspire with the sincere,\nnor harbor grudges against the deceitful.\nHe bears all as the earth bears,\ncovers all as Heaven covers,\nilluminates all as the sun illuminates,\ntransforms all as the numinous transforms.\nGreat or small, he views all as his own body.\nHe acts without governance,\nand none are left ungoverned.\nHe cuts off calamity at its root,\nnurtures blessings at their origin,\nremoves his own desires,\nand takes what the people find ease in.\nHe removes his own cleverness,\nand returns to natural spontaneity.\nHe moves them with harmony,\nguides them with effortlessness.\nAbove, he contains the intent of Dao and virtue;\nbelow, he obtains the heart of the numinous.\nHis light stirs Heaven and Earth,\nhis virtue connects all people.\nWithin the four seas, no orders are given—\nyet all transform their hearts.\nThe good become utterly good,\never deepening in clarity.\nThe evil change their nature,\ngradually becoming harmonious.\nThe faithful become utterly faithful,\nreaching beyond self.\nThe deceitful change their nature,\ndaily approaching sincerity.\nThe wicked turn to goodness,\nthe perverse return to truth.\nGood and evil, faith and doubt—\nall return to their natural state.\nAt this time, the muddy merges with the boundless void,\nthe submerged are immersed in perfect harmony.\nThe people forget their hearts and minds,\ndrift like the boundless,\nlose their sense of good and evil,\nand obtain what they seek.\nThey move with Heaven,\nthey flow with the Dao.\nNot forced to abandon evil,\nnot constrained to preserve good—\neffortless action brings transformation,\nyet none know how it happens.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe ruler’s transformation is like the void,\nquiet and still,\nlike a withered tree,\nhis heart like a gourd,\nhis will like the ocean,\nhis actions like a stream,\nnot distinguishing east and west,\nnot distinguishing south and north,\nnot discerning sweet and bitter,\nnot favoring black or white,\nnot aligning with square or round,\nnot fixing crooked or straight.\nHe is subtle in his profundity,\npractices self-effacement,\nharmonizes with all things,\nfloats without limit,\nabandons his own desires,\nand attains what Heaven desires.\nAll things, in their myriad forms, enter his ears and eyes.\nThe ruler’s effortlessness is like a guest in Heaven and Earth—\nHeaven and Earth as the furnace,\nGreat Harmony as the bellows,\nthe numinous as the wind,\nall things as the metal,\nvirtue as the great artisan,\nthe Dao as the work.\nThe world, verdant and lush, is without fail nourished.\nThus, he molds the hearts of the people,\ntransforms the customs of the age.\nAbove, he encompasses all without exception;\nbelow, he accomplishes all without failure.\nHe fulfills all things with measured response,\nstirs all beings to reverence,\nand shakes the eight extremes.\nThe world, vast and indistinct,\ndoes not recognize good or evil,\nyet follows naturally.\nThe subtle and profound,\nthe obscure and formless—\nthey spontaneously establish their own patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: \"On Life and Death\"**\n\nDao and virtue are clear and luminous,\nimpurity and purity are one in Great Harmony,\nand this is their essence.\nAll things take form as their dwelling place—\nshining and flourishing, yet unseen in their names.\nThis is the thing called *generation*—\nneither yin nor yang,\nimmeasurable and boundless,\ntoo profound to be weighed,\ntoo subtle to be named.\nIts radiance is indistinct,\nits form is indistinct,\nits sound is indistinct,\nits image is indistinct.\nIts motion and stillness have no fixed pattern;\nit wanders in the void and stillness,\ndwells in the realm of non-existence.\nThose who attain it live;\nthose who lose it die.\n\nThe form’s generation is by the numinous,\nits vitality by the vital essence,\nits roots by the spirit,\nits vitality by the vital breath,\nits chambers by the nine orifices,\nits senses by clarity and insight,\nits desires by the heart and mind,\nits soul and vital breath as attendants,\nits blood and qi as soldiers.\nAdvancing with the Dao, retreating with virtue,\nexpanding and contracting, soaring and resting,\nyielding and firm—\nbending and stretching with the times,\nlight as death’s companion,\nheavy as life’s enemy.\nIf there is no benefit, it cannot be retained;\nif there is use, it cannot be abandoned.\nThus, non-action is the dwelling of life,\nand action is the house of death.\n\nTo stand is to abandon the body;\nto sit is to forget the heart.\nSerene as an infant,\nresting as formlessness—\nnot seeing, not hearing, not acting, not speaking—\ntransformation and response,\nmotion and stillness without constancy—\nwith Dao in descent and ascent,\nwith virtue in floating and sinking,\nwith the numinous in merging,\nwith Harmony in embodiment—\nbending and stretching without degradation,\nnot prized as a thing,\nnot honored as a person,\ndiffering from kings and nobles in benefit,\ndiffering from the common folk in suffering.\nLife and death are one,\nthus no distinction is made between existence and non-existence.\nThis is the non-action of self-cultivation.\n\nSpring grows, summer flourishes, autumn harvests, winter stores—\nthis is the law of the sovereign,\nconforming to Heaven’s command.\nWithin, he cherishes parents;\nwithout, he severs fame and gain.\nHe does not think, does not deliberate,\ndoes not act, does not seek.\nAlone he goes, alone he returns,\nhis body in harmony,\nhis nature following effortlessly.\nHe yields in speech to others,\ndoes not contend with the times.\nThis is the non-action of governing the family.\n\nHe venerates Heaven, respects Earth,\ndares not forget the ancestors,\nfirst cultivates himself,\nrectifies the laws,\nabandons self-interest,\ntrusts in reality,\ndetermines names,\nfollows things,\nharmonizes the numinous,\ncoordinates left and right,\nconnects front and back,\nfollows the times,\nconforms to principle,\nbends to what is fitting—\nall things act in concert,\nreturning to their natural state.\nThis is the non-action of governing the state.\n\nCrowned with the formless,\ncloaked in the void,\nembracing emptiness,\nwalking the Great Clarity,\nbearing Dao and virtue,\nfloating in the numinous,\ngrasping Great Harmony,\ndriving Heaven and Earth,\ngalloping yin and yang,\nranging the Five Phases,\nfollowing all things,\nwandering the subtle and profound—\nthis is his domain.",

      "translated_text": "The Way of Nurturing Life\n\n**The Way of Non-Action in Governing the World**\nWithout merit, without name—\nthis is the non-action of governing the world.\n\n**The Way of Action in Nurturing the Self**\nGreedy for life, for profit, for longevity,\nfearing not to obtain—\nconcealing the heart, sealing the mind,\nclosing ears and eyes,\nguiding limbs, stretching steps,\nmoving joints, grasping fingers,\nexhaling the old, inhaling the new,\nbreathing in the Five Stars,\neating the sun and moon,\nbody and spirit acting in unison,\nnever resting—\nthis is the action of nurturing the self.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the Family**\nNeglecting Heaven’s timing,\nrelying solely on human effort,\ndespising the strong to seek the weak,\ndespising the poor to seek the rich,\nhungering for fame, thirsting for power,\nthe heart ever burdened with seeking—\nclothing, food, extravagance, excess,\noverindulgence in affairs—\nthis is the action of governing the family.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the State**\nEnriching the nation, expanding its lands,\nlightly waging war, delighting in arms,\nestablishing threats, displaying prestige,\nerecting boundaries, making one’s name resound,\nelevating status, sharpening laws,\nharsh punishments, severe penalties,\nstraightforward and deep,\nnet-like and cruel,\nfew mercies—\nthe lords fear and tremble,\nconstantly striving to be the foremost,\nthe strong seeking to be the great,\nthe great seeking to be the king—\nthis is the action of governing the state.\n\n**The Way of Action in Governing the World**\nHonoring ancestors, filial piety, fraternal duty,\ncultivating benevolence and righteousness,\nrefining rites, adorning moral teachings,\nadjusting flavors and colors to please the people,\nusing bells and chimes, qin and se,\nto harmonize their wills—\nthe ruler speaks, the ministers listen,\nthe ruler acts, the ministers follow,\ndisplaying merit, enforcing laws,\nopening with benevolence, issuing grand commands,\nmaking one’s reputation shine—\nthe people cling in devotion,\nall affairs entrusted to the sovereign,\nall directions look to the court—\nthis is the action of governing the world.\n\n**Thus, the Way of Non-Action:**\nEmpty, tranquil, subtle, few, yielding, lowly, modest,\ntimely, frugal, plain—\nthese thirteen are the companions of life.\nGreed, turmoil, arrogance, excess, extravagance, waste—\nthese thirteen are the companions of death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe Sage’s Way—\nin motion, it follows;\nin stillness, it responds.\nThe four limbs, the nine orifices—\nthese thirteen are the external tools of life and death.\nThe affairs of emptiness and fullness,\nthe shifts of hardness and softness—\nthese are the inner numbers of life and death.\n\nThus, with the thirteen,\nthe empty gives birth to the full,\nthe full returns to emptiness—\neternally preserved.\nClarity brings sharpness,\nstillness brings insight,\nsubtlety gives rise to prominence,\nfewness generates multitude,\nsoftness generates strength,\nweakness generates firmness,\nlowliness generates height,\nfrugality generates abundance,\ntimeliness brings harmony,\nharmony achieves balance,\nfrugality ensures sufficiency—\nthis is called *beneficial life*.\n\nTo practice this Way,\nalign with Heaven and Earth,\nnurturing the self as the foundation,\ngoverning the state as the extension—\nthough one may wish otherwise,\nNature’s transformation will not obey.\nThe full gives birth to emptiness,\nthe real returns to the void.\nThe turbid listens to the clear,\nthe chaotic submits to stillness,\nthe prominent reverts to subtlety,\nthe multitude dissolves into fewness,\nthe hard yields to softness,\nthe strong bends to weakness,\nthe high descends to low,\nthe full empties itself—\nexcess closes the path,\nextravagance brings ruin,\nwaste invites disaster—\nthese are all inauspicious.\n\nTo act thus,\nmoving toward exhaustion,\nharming the self,\ndisrupting the state—\nthough one may wish otherwise,\nHeaven and Earth will not comply.\nAll things are born and nurtured,\nyet their growth knows no end.\nAll beings are cherished,\nyet their love knows no limit.\nAction leads to striving,\nconstant scheming—\nthus abandoning emptiness for fullness,\nrejecting the void for substance,\nturning from stillness to turmoil,\ntransforming defense into display,\nchanging fewness into multitude,\nseparating softness from hardness,\ndiscarding weakness for strength,\nlowering the low to raise the high,\nforsaking moderation for excess—\nusing action to eliminate frugality,\nspending to deplete—\nwhy is this so?\nBecause one has forgotten the Way of Life.\n\nThus, the practitioner of nurturing life\nstands apart, vast and detached,\nlofty and distant,\nunbound by convention,\nunshackled by the world,\nreducing form to boundlessness,\nwandering the spirit in the formless,\nneither seeking life as gain\nnor death as harm.\nTo all things, great or small,\nthey extend equal care—\nno hatred, no favor.\nSpirit and vitality flourish,\nfortune and virtue align.\nThe Way is central,\nits light radiant.\nNatural transformations respond in kind—\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\ncannot defeat it.\nWalking on land, tigers and rhinos cannot harm,\nentering battle, no weapon can wound.\nNo force can overcome it,\nno strategy can subdue it—\nnot because it resists,\nbut because harm’s intent is already absent within.\nWhy is this so?\nSounds resonate in response,\nthings follow their nature—\nrhinos and tigers do not strike the formless,\nweapons do not pierce the void.\nThe practitioner of nurturing life\nhas extinguished the heart of harm within,\nand thus the form of death vanishes without.\n\n**The Chapter on the Generation of the Way**\nThe arts of the Sage and the Wise\ndo not descend from Heaven,\nnor arise from Earth—\nthey reside within the self,\nthey manifest in things.\nGuided by Nature,\nthey permeate all.\nFollowing patterns, embodying symbols,\nthey exhaust nothing.\nThus, the Way is empty,\nvirtue is without loss.\nHeaven is honored, Earth is lowly—\ntheir rhythms are not defied.\nHow so?\nWith knowledge, there is no origin;\nby human recognition, things reveal themselves.\nThe unseen generates the seen,\nthe void gives birth to the real.\nDefense becomes visible,\nthe subtle becomes manifest.\nBeginning and end—\nnone of this is contrived.\nNature’s work is effortless.\nThe Sage follows it,\nharmonizing with Heaven’s completeness.\nThus, knowing the Way through the boundless void,\none receives all things.\nKnowing virtue through the utmost nothingness,\none fulfills all things.\nThe Way acts through non-action,\nranking all under Heaven without precedence.\nVirtue acts through non-establishment,\ncompleting all forms without interference.\nThus, one can refine nature and life,\nmelt emotions and intentions,\nshape will and desire—\nhow does one define *nature and life*?\nThey are what the Way endows,\nforming body and shape.\nAll things differ in nature—\npeople, male and female,\nSages and fools,\nbrave and timid,\ngreat and small,\ntall and short,\nrenowned and obscure,\ngenerous and stingy,\nstrong and weak,\nlight and heavy,\nsound and color,\nform and substance,\nrefined and coarse,\nhigh and low—\nthis is called *nature*.\nWhat virtue bestows—\nwealth and poverty,\nnobility and humility,\nlongevity and early death,\npleasure and suffering—\nwhether one’s fate is fixed or not—\nthis is called *Heaven’s command*.\nEncounters with rulers, parents,\nHeaven and Earth’s movements—\nwhether auspicious or inauspicious,\nlife or death—\nthis is called *encountering fate*.\nAll things arrayed before me,\nI choose—\nactions, decisions, abandonment, adoption,\ntaking or leaving,\ndisaster or blessing—\nthis is called *following fate*.\n\nFrom nature, one acts;\nin contact with things, one responds—\nlove, hate, joy, anger,\nfear, surprise, grief, delight—\nthis is called *emotion*.\nFrom fate, one thinks;\ngenerating plans, resolving dangers,\nclarifying right and wrong,\ndistinguishing same and different—\nthis is called *intention*.\nFrom emotion, intention moves outward,\nconnecting with things,\never drawn to what pleases,\nsummoning fortune or misfortune,\nachieving fame or ruin—\nthis is called *will*.\nFollowing nature and fate,\nadapting emotion and intention,\nentangled in the myriad things,\nbound and difficult to untangle—\nthis is called *desire*.\n\nThese six—\nall originate from the Way and virtue,\nendless in their transformations.\nOnly those who hear of the Way and virtue\ncan follow their patterns.\nThus, if nature is refined and life is elevated,\nit can be altered, can be transformed.\nIf nature is coarse and life is lowly,\nit can be diminished, can be enhanced.\nIf one attains the root,\nunobstructed in presence and absence—\nwhy is this so?\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\ncontain the heart,\nenvelop the core—\nthose who obtain the Way to live\ndo not possess virtue.\nThose who attain the One\ndo not seek its blessings.\nAll things honor and revere them,\ncherish and love them—\nyet they do not repay virtue.\nWhy is this so?",

      "translated_text": "This is the **Dao** sublime and great, profound beyond speech;\nThings cannot enrich it, titles cannot honor it.\nWithout action, it serves all things—\nNothing in things it does not embrace.\nWhen pressed, its nature remains ever spontaneous.\n\nThus, the **Dao** as a thing:\nCannot be glimpsed through doors,\nCannot be observed through gates,\nCannot be pointed at with form,\nCannot be mirrored in appearance.\nMind cannot fathom it, words cannot convey it.\n\nAll things arise from it—\nYet it does not diminish them;\nAll things return to it—\nYet it does not overflow.\nIts breadth and depth are boundless,\nIts waxing and waning unfathomable.\n\nIt does not linger in the autumn hairs,\nNor does it deem them insignificant;\nIt does not encompass the myriad heavens,\nNor does it consider them excessive.\nThe radiance of green and purple robes\nDoes not alter its **virtue**,\nThe depths of hidden resolve and withered frame\nDo not change its transformation.\n\nIts movement is harmonious yet varied—\nIt does not favor any one thing.\nIt receives life and fate,\nYet nothing it does not guide.\nIts **virtue** flows through all things,\nYet cannot be repaid;\nIts blessings and kindnesses\nCannot be traced to their source.\nIt nourishes the world without cost,\nAccomplishes deeds without exhaustion.\nWhy, then, does it do this for all things?\nSurely it is not merely to give life!\n\nIt shapes existence,\nIt forms the myriad,\nIt establishes ranks and distinctions,\nIt distributes and fulfills them,\nIt begins and ends,\nIt precedes and follows—\nYet it entrusts the future to what comes after,\nAnd what comes after is in turn within it.\n\nThe **Dao** is divine and luminous,\nThe **Dao** is the source of Heaven and Earth’s form.\nHow does one know this?\nThe **Dao** encompasses the myriad heavens.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nHeaven and Earth have form, yet the **Dao** is formless.\nThose with form are all numbered;\nThe formless has no end.\nThings with form, when entrusted to the endless,\nAre like grasses and trees separated from the soil,\nOr stars detached from the sky—\nInsufficient to illustrate it!\n\nYet if one says otherwise,\nThen one does not grasp the **Dao**.\n\nBeing and non-being interpenetrate,\nVoid and reality embrace one another—\nLike the rind and the seed of a gourd,\nOr the stems and leaves of a vine, unseen yet adjacent.\n\nFleas and lice hide in the fur,\nYet one does not know the multitude of the city.\nThus, beyond the cosmos and within the realm of existence,\nIt is bound by no constraints,\nLimited by no rules.\nSafety and danger, growth and decay—\nIt knows neither inside nor outside.\nAll things follow its guidance,\nIts will is harmonious and unified.\n\nIt nurtures life without ceasing,\nIts beauty is flawless,\nIts goodness is unending—\nNo calamity, no harm.\nTen thousand blessings, myriad joys—\nThe **Dao** covers them all.\nIts deeds are profound,\nIts functions are unseen in the world.\nThe world knows nothing of its workings.\n\nThe **Dao** is the origin of all things,\nThe mother of all affairs.\nIts subtlety is boundless,\nIts smoothness profound and still—\nNothing it does not govern.\nIt nourishes all things,\nMakes them alive and intelligent,\nSkillful and resourceful—\nNothing it does not irrigate.\nThus it is said:\nThe origin of all things is the **Dao**,\nThe mother of all affairs is **virtue**.\n\nThe Sage attains it,\nAnd reverses with the myriad—\nThus he can grasp the heart of the **Dao**,\nUnderstand the principles of Heaven,\nOpen the door of all things,\nAnd fathom the myriad’s schemes.\nHe exhausts all cleverness,\nHe depletes all arts.\nRulership and affairs,\nHe adapts with the times—\nHis transformations are sudden,\nHis responses divine.\nHe acts without form,\nHe governs without boundary—\nExtreme and profound!\n\nHe cannot be carved or refined,\nYet returns to its source.\nIt covers and returns again—\nThus it wanders in the world without peril.\nHence, the Sage can:\nSeal his ears and eyes,\nClose his gates and doors,\nLock them with his tongue,\nShut them with his mind.\nWhen the time is not right, he does not move;\nWhen it is not harmonious, he does not act.\nThus his state endures,\nHis nation is long-lasting,\nAnd his life is without danger.\nWhy is this so?\n\nHe does not listen with his ears,\nYet his hearing is as vast as Heaven’s.\nHe does not look with his eyes,\nYet his vision is as bright as Heaven’s.\nHe does not act with his words,\nYet his transformations are as wondrous as Heaven’s.\nHe does not govern with his deeds,\nYet his functions are as vast as Heaven’s.\nWhat he upholds is essential;\nWhat he follows is detailed.\nThe **Dao**’s clarity is not obscured,\nHeaven’s concerns are fully understood—\nThus he can respond in harmony,\nFollow without deviation,\nIllumine all things without end.\nHe is the source of blessings,\nThe origin of transformations,\nThe ancestor and progenitor—\nHis influence spreads far and wide.\n\nHe avoids the harm of the Three Calamities,\nFills and seals them,\nSo they cannot be recognized—\nAs if deaf, as if blind.\nHe aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nActs in perfect harmony,\nEnds all strife—\nThus he is without rival in victory,\nWithout effort in action.\nHis wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,\nHis plans do not outmaneuver the **Dao**.\nHe cannot add to its power,\nHe cannot scheme beyond its limits.\nRuling people, managing things—\nHe harmonizes with yin and yang.\nInternally, he uses its light,\nExternally, he does not oppose it.\nClothing and food, tilling and weaving—\nHe has abundance.\nBlessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve.\nPeople are content, families are nourished.\nHis heart carries no burdens,\nHe does not seek lowliness nor crave nobility.\nHe is neither unlucky nor fortunate,\nNeither proud nor humble.\nHe neither exceeds nor falls short—\nOnly to serve above and nourish below.\nHuman **Dao** is fully realized,\nYet all returns to its source.\nHis divine intelligence is not exhausted,\nHis stored **virtue** is firmly preserved.\nHe does not dare call this wisdom,\nLike the ocean, he shares Heaven’s concerns.\n\nHe extinguishes the Three Calamities,\nFills and seals them,\nSo they cannot be perceived—\nAs if mute, as if deaf.\nHe aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nActs in perfect harmony,\nEnds all strife—\nThus he is without rival in victory,\nWithout effort in action.\nHis wisdom does not exceed Heaven’s,\nHis plans do not outmaneuver the **Dao**.\nHe

Heaven’s concerns.\nThus he wanders with the **Dao**,\nAnd the **Dao** wanders with him—\nWe merge as one.\n\nHe upholds stillness and attains emptiness,\nI am the **Dao**’s dwelling with all things.\nConfused and boundless,\nIt returns to its origin.\nThe **Dao** is my inheritance.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Walking the Great Dao**\n\nThe **Dao** and **virtue** are not wrought by cleverness—\nYet they mold Heaven and Earth, shape creation,\nHarmonize yin and yang,\nAnd Heaven and Earth cannot deceive.\nHeaven and Earth do not rely on cleverness—\nYet they embrace and transform, kill and give birth,\nNurture all things,\nAnd no creature can escape.\n\nIf the **Dao** is constrained by cleverness,\nThe mind cannot endure itself—\nHow then can Heaven and Earth be shaped?\nHow can yin and yang fulfill their nature?\n\nIf Heaven and Earth are bound by cleverness,\nThe body cannot sustain itself—\nHow then can transformation enfold all?\nHow can all things remain whole?\n\nThus, emptiness, non-action, ignorance, and desirelessness—\nThis is the heart of **Dao** and **virtue**,\nThe intention of Heaven and Earth.\n\nClarity, stillness, and natural response—\nThis is the movement of **Dao** and **virtue**,\nThe transformation of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow do we know this?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Where the **Dao** arises, Heaven’s work begins—\nFrom non-beginning to generation,\nFrom non-generation to existence,\nFrom non-existence to destruction,\nFrom non-destruction to destruction.\nThese are the natural proofs,\nThe constant of transformation.*\n\nThus, when human actions do not align with the **Dao**,\nThe **Dao** does not favor them.\nWhen they do not align with **virtue**,\n**Virtue** does not aid them.\nWhen they do not align with Heaven,\nHeaven does not shelter them.\nWhen they do not align with Earth,\nEarth does not bear them.\n\nWhere the **Dao** and **virtue** do not favor,\nWhere Heaven does not shelter and Earth does not bear—\nThere, misfortune is near and blessings distant.\n\nThus, the **Dao**-endowed sage in the world\nCarries broad understanding, embraces unity,\nSharpening clarity, grasping brightness,\nFollowing the **Dao**, serving **virtue**,\nDiscarding knowledge, abandoning the self,\nStriving in earnest, fearing error—\nEver wary of stumbling,\nStriving for the cleverness of non-cleverness,\nPursuing the clarity of non-clarity,\nTrusting, yielding, soft yet strong,\nTilling the land for sustenance,\nEver content, returning to simplicity.\n\nNameless, trembling with awe,\nFearful of losing the natural—\nWhen disaster approaches, Heaven’s calamity descends,\nAnd the people suffer.\nThus, when blessings and **virtue** arrive,\nLike shadow to form, echo to sound,\nThey arise without warning, as if born together.\n\nTherefore, the Great **Dao** is smooth in its transformation—\nFormless yet near, obscure yet bright,\nLevel yet without obstruction,\nSimple yet easy to follow,\nWithout action yet achieving success,\nWithout effort yet blessings overflow.\nHeaven and Earth follow it, and all things are born.\nYet people abandon it, using their cleverness,\nDiscarding the **Dao**, defying Earth,\nOpposing Heaven, exalting knowledge,\nRelying on cleverness, deceiving the spirit,\nAdorning falsehood, abandoning truth,\nCreating, altering, scheming,\nAmassing wealth, displaying splendor—\nElaborate houses, grand halls,\nHigh gates, ornate decorations,\nMulticolored silks, embroidered brocades,\nJade and fine linen, glittering adornments,\nSharp blades, sturdy armor, strong crossbows,\nSwift chariots, fleet horses,\nMany retainers, heavy influence,\nRenown and power spreading far,\nConquering neighbors, enslaving subjects,\nResenting the virtuous, envying the modest,\nHating loyalty, poisoning trust,\nBinding deceit, fostering falsehood,\nValuing conflict, revering strength—\nNone escape their oppression.\nThey open borders to outsiders,\nPlot regicide, indulge in excess,\nHoard gold and jade like mountains,\nPossessing all treasures, rivaling rulers,\nEntering in splendor, exiting in display,\nStanding apart from the common,\nExalted in chaos as \"great men,\"\nSurpassing others in evil,\nTheir crimes deep, their calamities severe—\nEven wise fathers disown them,\nRighteous rulers refuse their service.\nWhere the **Dao** does not favor,\nWhere the spirit does not dwell,\nWhere Heaven does not shelter,\nWhere all things resent—\nSuch a one invites disaster in life,\nSuffers misfortune in birth,\nAnd their lineage perishes with them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Establishing Goodness**\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless,\nDiverse winds, varied customs,\nTeeming creatures, endless transformations—\nWhat can be controlled is not wrought,\nWhat can be wrought is not controlled.\n\nI act for the world, and the world acts for me.\nWhen we meet, they are many, I am few—\nFew against many: the many thrive, the few perish.\nThus, if one stands by knowledge, it will be seized.\nIf one stands by cleverness, it will be undermined.\nIf one stands by strength, it will be overpowered.\nOnly the one who does nothing cannot be defeated.\n\nHow do we know this?\nSilent, yet seeking an echo—\nThe echo does not respond.\nSeeking shadow in darkness—\nThe shadow does not follow.\nYet if one fears the echo and strikes metal,\nThe response grows louder.\nIf one fears the shadow and stands in sunlight,\nThe shadow clings closer.\nThus, non-action cannot evade blessing,\nAction cannot escape misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the sage abandons strength,\nAbandons cleverness,\nAbandons knowledge,\nAbandons virtue,\nEstablishes the **Dao**,\nEmbraces **virtue**,\nRestrains emotions,\nNurtures the spirit,\nHarmonizes the body,\nFollows Earth,\nSupports Heaven,\nEmptied, still, and silent—\nAs if absent, yet present,\nInner and outer both quiescent,\nTransforming in stillness,\nWithout action, without effort,\nReturning to simplicity, embracing truth,\nWithout laws, without measures,\nAligned with transformation,\nNurturing the small to sustain the great,\nShepherding the people—\nSquare and round, first and last,\nEver abiding, the body preserved,\nThe form upright, the spirit at ease,\nLineage enduring, **virtue** accumulating,\nTransformation flowing boundlessly—\nDeclining yet reviving, enduring with Heaven.\n\nThus, governing the self:\nSimplicity in nature, ease in emotion,\nClarity in mind, far-reaching will,\nNo confusion in thought,\nBalanced *qi*, harmonized blood,\nPliancy in sinew and bone,\nSharp senses, luminous skin,\nSpirit concentrated and firm,\nLife vibrant and enduring,\nBody light and agile,\nJoy in simplicity, hard to exhaust.\n\nGoverning the family:\nThe husband trustworthy, the wife chaste,\nThe father benevolent, the child filial,\nBrothers harmonious, siblings respectful,\nThe extended family in unity,\nFields tilled in season, livestock thriving,\nAbundant grain, stored wealth—\nSix kinds of livestock flourishing,\nAffairs in order, always with surplus,\nNeighbors envying their prosperity.\n\nGoverning the village:\nDiscerning order, knowing customs,\nActions in harmony with *zhonghe*,\nNames and realities aligned,\nBlack and white distinct,\nCurved and straight differentiated,\nRight and wrong self-evident—\nNo deceit arises, authority respected,\nCommands obeyed without hesitation,\nAbove and below in harmony,\nAll delighted, the people united,\nOfficials without grievance, duties fulfilled,\nRenown as *junzi*, **virtue** abundant,\nDeath without peril.\n\nGoverning the state:\nThe ruler wise, ministers loyal,\nNo obstruction in court, no envy of the worthy,\nNo corruption of the upright, no harm from slander,\nHarmony and obedience above and below,\nNo grievances among officials,\nAll affairs proceeding naturally,\nDistant lands in awe, the world in accord,\nThe state rich, the people secure—\nNo conquest yet strong,\nAncestral temples honored, altars enduring,\nHeaven and Earth in perpetual union,\nNo calamities, all things bountiful,\nThe realm at peace, neighbors entrusting their lives,\nPosterity flourishing, **Dao** and **virtue** eternal.\n\nGoverning the world:\nThe ruler embodies yin, ministers yang,\nThe ruler is still, ministers act,\nThe ruler is square, ministers are round,\nThe ruler leads, ministers follow,\nThe ruler speaks straight, ministers harmonize,\nGreat and unified, simple and easy,\nWithout action, without sound,\n**Virtue** spreading like a ripple,\nThe spirit coursing like wind,\nMovement without end, transformation like Heaven—\nNo action yet success achieved,\nIn accord with the **Dao**’s measure,\nThe world returns to truth,\nNo worries, no fears—\nGreat Peace arises naturally.\n\nThus, my body is their measure,\nTheir span is my own.",

      "translated_text": "The **Dao**’s mother and child recognize each other—\nThis is nature’s own decree.\nYet what makes it so is knowledge beyond articulation.\n\nFive flavors dwell upon the tongue,\nFive tones resound within the ear—\nThough sweet is not sweet, bitter not bitter,\nThe *shang* not *shang*, the *yu* not *yu*,\nYet Yi Ya’s chef and the blind musician discern them.\nYet what makes them discern is speech beyond the tongue.\n\nThus, the formless form can be seen yet not be seen,\nThe shapeless shape can be imitated yet not be spoken,\nThe actionless action can be modeled yet not be described,\nThe useless use can be enacted yet not be taught.\n\nHence, those who grasp the **Dao** see it as a child recognizing its parents,\nTread it as the earth, bear it as the sky,\nClothe it as garments, embody it as flesh—\nAct upon it as if it were their own nature,\nRise and fall with it, sleep and awake with it,\nBend and stretch with it.\nTheir spirit wanders with change,\nTheir will roams with **virtue**,\nTheir insight is internal yet external as deaf and blind,\nTheir thoughts arise yet appear as madness and folly.\nThus, their mouths cannot speak,\nTheir intentions cannot be made clear.\n\nLike dreaming of being a king,\nYet standing upon perilous heights,\nOr gazing into deep abysses—\nJoy and sorrow clash within,\nYet the heart remains undisturbed.\nAwakening, one cannot convey the **Dao** to neighbors.\n\nThose who lose the **Dao** act otherwise—\nThey see its surface yet fail to perceive its depths,\nTrace its currents yet never reach its source,\nClutch its ends yet never grasp its roots.\nTheir understanding is not as it should be,\nNor is their failure to understand.\nThus, the **Dao** lies not within themselves,\nNor does it reside in their bodies.\nThe central principle is not fixed,\nThe defense is not steadfast.\nTheir resolve is like a fox’s cunning,\nTheir doubts entangle with the world.\nTheir insight is a false brilliance—\nAs if true and false, existence and nonexistence,\nWere interchangeable.\nTheir harmony is fragile, their emotions easily stirred—\nLike sickness upon a man.\nWhen they speak, their words are hollow,\nYet their hearts are filled with schemes,\nTheir minds with calculations.\nTheir brilliance shines outward,\nTheir spirit fades within.\nThey grasp externals yet lack inner substance,\nTheir **virtue** and **Dao** scatter daily,\nDrifting ever farther.\nThe more they speak, the worse they fare,\nThe more they act, the more they stray.\n\nThus, the speaker is the **Dao**’s greatest obstacle,\nThe one who distances **virtue** its most grievous error,\nThe one who opposes Heaven its most reckless artisan,\nThe one who overturns Earth its most ruinous tool.\n\nHence, those who attain the **Dao** diminish their brilliance,\nDiscard their sharpness—\nThey do not see, do not hear,\nAs if blind and deaf.\nThey seal their mouths, still their tongues,\nAs if speechless.\nThey abandon all fixed attachments,\nDispel all lingering thoughts,\nSilent as if nonexistent,\nHidden as if alone.\nThey extinguish calamities without a trace,\nReturning to the utmost simplicity.\nTheir appearance does not alter,\nTheir colors do not deceive.\nThey follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,\nConform with the world’s transformations,\nPlunge deep into the **Dao**,\nRoam with **virtue** in boundless stillness.\nThey speak without words,\nAct without doing,\nSerene in their governance,\nBalanced in their response to time.\nWith the world in perfect confusion,\nThey alone remain unchanging.\nThey dwell in the realm of near and far,\nSoar through the gates of gain and harm,\nFloat amid the fields of noble and base,\nGuarding their spirit’s essence,\nVanishing into the formless expanse,\nFree in the wild and untamed lands.\nThey do not take poverty as disgrace,\nNor wealth as honor.\nThey conceal when they wish to conceal,\nReveal when they wish to reveal.\nThey cannot harm the yin and yang,\nNor can they obscure the people’s clarity.\nThey stand alone, unassailable,\nTheir voice unchanging, their colors unalluring.\nThey do not compete with all things,\nNor do they contend with their strength.\nThey have no gains, no losses,\nNo accumulation, no depletion.\nThey close their doors, sever all ties,\nEnd all beginnings, extinguish all threads.\nTheir spirit is the measure,\nThe **Dao** the central guide.\nTheir actions align with change,\nTheir stillness with nature.\nThus, they can govern with harmony.\n\nAs for the **Dao** of kings and states—\n**Virtue** and **Dao**’s essence are constant,\nYet their forms shift between stillness and motion.\nThey encompass Heaven and Earth’s span,\nMark the cycles of yin and yang,\nNurture life as sun and moon do.\nTo oppose them brings ruin,\nTo follow them brings flourishing.\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s **Dao** is ever one:\nYin and yang in balance.\nThe yang **qi** governs **virtue**,\nThe yin **qi** governs punishment.\nPunishment and **virtue** are contrary,\nYet harmony lies at their core.\nSpring brings birth, summer growth,\nAutumn harvests, winter stores—\nEnding and beginning anew,\nDecay and renewal in turn.\nThe yang reaches its limit and turns to yin,\nThe yin reaches its limit and turns to yang,\nYin and yang in endless opposition.\nThus, the **Dao** of kings and states is ever one:\nSoftness and hardness in balance,\nCivility and martial force in unity,\nThe central principle as their guiding thread.\nSoftness and hardness, when properly aligned,\nConnect with **virtue** and **Dao**,\nYet must ultimately return to **Dao**.\n**Dao** and **virtue** protect each other,\nLaw abides at their center.\nLaw and numbers interweave,\nThus all flows in perfect accord.\n\nHence, the enlightened ruler and sage\nDiminishes desires to quiet the mind,\nQuiets the mind to grasp the **Dao**,\nGrasses the **Dao** to govern with clarity,\nGovern with clarity to steady the heart,\nSteadies the heart to rectify the body,\nRectifies the body to order the family,\nOrders the family to establish the state,\nEstablishes the state to define its laws,\nDefines the laws to name its principles,\nNames its principles to govern the land.\nWith laws and principles clear,\nThey examine the fundamental truths,\nDistinguish the primary from the secondary,\nAlign left and right,\nConnect front and back,\nArrange the five directions—\nAll things conform to their governance.\nTheir names are verified by reality,\nTheir reality confirmed by scrutiny,\nThus they oversee with precision—\nNames and facts as moon and sun,\nOne name correct, the state flourishes,\nOne name false, the state suffers.\nThey nurture the land with unwavering care,\nBending and stretching, giving and taking,\nAll in accordance with the seasons.\nThey follow disorder, yet uphold law,\nThey meet chaos, yet enforce order.\nIf order is lost, they do not restrain,\nIf order is not obeyed, they do not stop,\nIf order is not followed, they do not punish,\nIf order is not embraced, they do not strike.\nIf a small state is pressed between larger ones,\nAnd suffers a ruler without the **Dao**,\nThey cannot correct its affairs—\nThen they must depart.\nIf departure is impossible,\nThey must cede land.\nIf ceding land is not allowed,\nThey must lead their people to safety.\nIf safety cannot be found,\nThey must defend with all their might.\nIf defense fails,\nThen calamity engulfs all—\nAnd disaster falls upon themselves.\nThus, they must rise in strategy,\nAnd war must be waged.\n\nI wish to train soldiers,\nHone weapons,\nStockpile grain,\nRaise high walls,\nAnd guard my people in solitude—\nYet the common folk are scattered,\nThe state lies in ruin.\nThis is the work of war,\nThis is the path of strife—\nYet the **Dao**’s governance is the way to flourish.",

      "translated_text": "「Reflecting on governance, harmonious virtue is not as profound as the Way of non-interference.\nTo master the arts of *yuzhu*[1] and *qixiao*[2]—as intricate as the calculations of the *qique*[3]—is not as effective as cultivating the virtue of preventing illness in all.\nTo wield the stratagems of the Yellow Emperor and Duke of Zhou, grasp the essentials of Sun and Wu, and triumph through them is not as wise as letting the world exist without exerting cleverness or force.\nThus, the origin of *Dao/virtue* is love, yet love cannot bring profit;\nThe foundation of *Heaven and Earth* is action, yet action cannot achieve completion.\nOnly the one without love can bring profit,\nOnly the one without action can fulfill desires.\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign have no desires, no demands,\nNo contrivances, no creations,\nNo governance, no burdens, no laws, no decrees—\nReturning to simplicity, they let the world find its own peace.\n\n*How can this be illuminated?*\nZhuangzi said: When one creates blessings, generates profit, achieves success, fulfills tasks,\nAccumulates goods, and directs their use,\nThe people grow exceedingly wealthy,\nThe world indulges in extravagance,\nGoods and wealth are insufficient,\nThe common folk suffer want—\nBounties fill the mountains and valleys,\nGold and jade pile up,\nThe state becomes unstable,\nThe people grow fewer in fortune.\nCunning men deceive each other,\nThe wise use guile to manipulate,\nBarriers are built to guard against licentiousness and deceit,\nDistinctions are drawn between good and evil, right and wrong,\nYet the people are confused.\nThus, the state grows chaotic,\nAnd governance declines.\n\nWhen one enforces rigid rules,\nThen the people bend—\nThe people bend, and rigid rules become flexible,\nThen the wicked advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd the common folk suffer the harm.\n\nWhen one values frugality,\nThe people seek wealth—\nThe people seek wealth, and frugality becomes extravagant,\nThen the greedy flourish while the honest decline,\nLoyal ministers bear the punishment,\nAnd the common folk suffer the loss.\n\nWhen one opens disputes,\nThe people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,\nThen the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,\nLoyal ministers face ruin,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen the ruler loves fame,\nThe people feign virtue—\nThe people feign virtue, and sincerity is displayed,\nThen great virtue is obscured while petty rewards are flaunted,\nLoyal ministers risk death,\nAnd the common folk endure calamity.\n\nThus, the ruler’s policies:\nWithout filial piety, without benevolence,\nWithout generosity, without giving,\nWith constant caution—\nThe people’s affection is strained,\nTheir virtues are stifled.\nWith indiscriminate rewards and punishments,\nThe people’s good and evil are not clearly distinguished,\nTheir right and wrong are not separated—\nThus, the ruler loses what he cherishes,\nHis own life is cut short.\nBlessings arise from misfortune,\nMisfortune arises from blessings—\nBlessings and misfortunes are intertwined,\nLike shared fields where both perish and thrive,\nYet their natures differ.\nNone but the sage can grasp this truth alone.\n\nTherefore, to abandon blessings means to avoid misfortune,\nTo avoid misfortune means to abandon blessings—\nThe blessings of abandoning blessings are profound.\nTo guard against *zai*[4] and *mian*[5] in silence,\nThe world loves cleverness yet cannot exhaust its depths—\nOnly the one who acts without acting can follow its natural course.\nTo remain upright in the midst of blessings and misfortunes,\nWithout losing balance—\nIs not to be confused by good and evil,\nNor to see the upright as monsters,\nNor the wicked as sages.\nThe world falls into great confusion and cannot be rectified.\n\nWhen one enforces methods,\nThen the people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and methods are abandoned,\nThen the upright retreat while the wicked advance,\nLoyal ministers bear the brunt,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen one applies numbers,\nThen the people’s emotions are drained,\nAnd their connections are severed—\nThis is what is called *rigid rules* that are not rigid,\n*Frugality* that is not frugal,\n*Righteousness* that is not righteous,\n*Sincerity* that is not sincere.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is complete yet does not bestow,\nThus all things exist without constraint.\nIt acts without acting,\nThus all things flourish without coercion.\nThe *Dao/Way* is void and formless,\nYet all things have shape.\nIt lacks state or appearance,\nYet all things are square or round.\nIt is silent and without sound,\nYet all things have voice.\nFrom this perspective, the *Dao/Way* does not act nor does it harm,\nYet all things are preserved.\nIt does not contrive nor does it slaughter,\nYet all things come to be.\nPreservation arises from non-preservation,\nExistence arises from non-existence—\nThis is clear.\n\nThus, when a ruler raises armies and exploits profit,\nThe people grow desirous—\nThe people grow desirous, and rigid rules are enforced,\nThen rigid rules are abandoned,\nAnd the wicked advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd the common folk suffer the harm.\n\nWhen one values frugality,\nThe people seek wealth—\nThe people seek wealth, and frugality is enforced,\nThen the greedy flourish while the honest decline,\nLoyal ministers bear the punishment,\nAnd the common folk suffer the loss.\n\nWhen one opens disputes,\nThe people become perverse—\nThe people become perverse, and righteousness is enforced,\nThen the crooked soar while the just are suppressed,\nLoyal ministers face ruin,\nAnd the common folk suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen the ruler loves

endure calamity.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler and sage sovereign:\nHold this truth in solitude and do not share it,\nKnow it alone and do not teach it.\nTheir ministers stand divided,\nTheir bodies are dual,\nThey nurture the ruler’s intentions,\nThey flatter the ruler’s heart,\nThey clog the ruler’s ears,\nThey obscure the ruler’s wisdom—\nThis is why the state grows perilous\nAnd the

seas,\nRhinos and elephants—\nYet their virtue is like the wind through cracks,\nLike the gusts of a storm.\n\nThus their blessings cannot be grandly produced,\nTheir benefits cannot be violently unleashed,\nTheir goodness cannot be broadly placed,\nTheir evil cannot be grandly prevented.\n\nTo produce blessings grandly is to bring great ruin,\nTo unleash benefits violently is to bring great collapse,\nTo place goodness broadly is to bring great loss,\nTo prevent evil grandly is to bring great catastrophe.\n\nHow do we know this?\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"The hungry double their food,\nThe

      "translated_text": "The Way by which to clarify it:\n\nThe tiger and leopard, with their resplendent forms,\nAmple breadth and wide expanse,\nFirm claws and teeth, robust muscles and skin,\nAbundant fur and striking markings—\nThus their brilliance is manifest.\nThey grasp the hundred beasts yet are mastered by man.\n\nThe honored and fragrant grasses,\nWith their radiant hues and sweet aromas—\nThus they are beloved by the common folk,\nYet their roots are easily harmed.\n\nThe sovereign of great states,\nWith vast lands and numerous people,\nMighty prestige and favored form,\nOverwhelming might and illustrious name—\nThus he displays his neighboring states,\nYet endangers himself in doing so.\n\nIf he holds the Dao,\nHis foundation is as firm as the盤石,\nHis peace as secure as the太山.\n\nIf he loses the Dao,\nHis danger is greater than a pile of卵,\nHis weight lighter than a feather.\n\nIf both are weak,\nThe first to suffer is he.\n\nIf both are disordered,\nThe first to perish is he.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign of great states\nIs the ladder to tyranny,\nAnd the threshold to annihilation.\n\nHence, the sovereign of great states\nStands alone, without a peer,\nHis name revered like a lofty mountain,\nHis borders blocked on three sides,\nHis rivers flowing together,\nAll things beneath him—\nHe is the hub of the诸侯,\nThe treasury of膏腴,\nThe corpse of strength,\nThe master of power and prestige,\nBound by unmeasurable security,\nEncircled by narrow and perilous gates,\nAbundant yet constrained,\nVast yet limited,\nWith territories spanning thousands of miles,\nRich in treasures and marvels,\nHis people few in burdens,\nCattle and horses everywhere,\nCountless chariots and boats,\nOverwhelming stores of grain and arms—\nYet those who dwell within are at ease,\nThose who pass through are detained,\nAs if he were grass and wood,\nFilling the mountains and fields.\nThe fields are plentiful in harvest,\nThe hunts yield abundant game,\nHis taxes are tenfold greater—\nThus all beneath heaven desire to submit,\nAnd the诸侯 seek to attach themselves.\n\nThe generals and officers,\nWith their million-strong armies in battle array,\nTheir territories easily defended,\nTheir strongholds naturally advantageous,\nTheir land conforming to the will of Heaven,\nTheir strategies aligning with the earth’s advantage—\nThey suspend life and determine death,\nTo unite with them is to gain power,\nTo oppose them is to lose one’s lineage.\nThus the ancestral temples are honored,\nAnd the诸侯 fear them.\n\nIf the Dao is applied fully,\nHe can unite and dominate.\nIf prestige is sufficient,\nHe can issue commands and punish.\nIf virtue is sufficient,\nHe can exalt benevolence and govern with order.\nIf righteousness is sufficient,\nHe can clarify principles and embrace all.\nIf wealth is sufficient,\nHe can expand his lands and secure them.\nIf treasures are sufficient,\nHe can make his state rich—\nThus the诸侯 delight in him,\nAnd the generals and officers profit from him.\n\nTherefore, from ancient times to this day,\nThe passive overcomes the active—\nA truth unchanging for ten thousand generations.\nWhy is this so?\n\nBecause the void receives the full,\nThe none responds to the having.\nHe does not regard great tasks as great,\nNor elevated things as lofty,\nBut always holds them as lowly and insignificant.\n\nThus the enlightened king and sage sovereign,\nWhen ruling great states,\nBestows the Dao yet does not seek to impose it,\nActs with humility yet does not seek to humble himself,\nEnvelops the lands of the诸侯,\nYet none dare oppose him.\nHis virtue encompasses the strength of the诸侯,\nYet none dare neglect him.\nHe lowers himself in courtesy,\nYet seeks to attach others by sincerity.\nHe values loyalty, integrity, and trustworthiness,\nAnd places scholars and worthy men above all.\nHe hastens to till and weave,\nTo amass wealth and provisions.\nHe connects alliances, both vertical and horizontal,\nTo guard against unforeseen calamities.\nHe opens his granaries and treasuries,\nBestowing wealth to nourish the aged,\nTo feed the widowed and orphaned,\nTo relieve the poor and aid the destitute,\nTo honor those of humble station—\nYet takes nothing,\nGives nothing,\nMaintains simplicity and ease,\nAnd acts without force.\n\nThough the诸侯 may be greedy,\nOr cruel and deceitful,\nOr arrogant and proud,\nOr rely on brute strength,\nAnd though they may not love what is good,\nOr wish to follow what is right,\nYet when he lowers himself in quietude,\nThey mend their ways,\nReflect on their errors,\nAnd reform themselves.\nThey surrender their lands,\nOffer their treasures,\nSubmit in person—\nEven to the point of willing to die as his subjects.\nThe ministers of the ancestral altars\nAre those who dwell in small, weak states.\n\nTo follow the Dao in action,\nTo govern with moderation—\nTo be rich in chariots and boats,\nTo be strong in armor and weapons,\nTo hold loyalty and obedience in high regard,\nTo value simplicity and revere tillage,\nTo ensure that all have their due,\nTo take nothing from the people,\nTo establish clear hierarchies,\nTo unite them as if they were father and son,\nTo treat them as his own flesh and blood—\nThus he can die with them,\nAnd they will follow him willingly.\nThe sovereign of great states,\nThough he may bear the weight of many strong states,\nAnd hold the balance of power,\nThough his virtue is low and his heart is benevolent,\nAs hungry as a tiger,\nAs furious as a rushing torrent—\nYet he does not give freely,\nBut always seeks to devour others.\nHe gains the hearts of Heaven and the people,\nYet his enemies are like a spring’s source,\nHis threats are like an unpredictable tide—\nHe exhausts himself in body and spirit,\nSuspends his very life,\nIn a state of ceaseless anxiety—\nThus his spirit is scattered,\nHis mind is troubled,\nHis anger is unleashed,\nHis calamities are transferred onto himself.\n\nThe one who takes from above\nHas great form, mighty prestige,\nEncompassing virtue, and heavy influence—\nThis is what others profit from.\n\nThe one who takes from below\nHas narrow lands, few people,\nHeavy influence, and meager virtue—\nThis is what others exploit.\n\nTherefore, without battle he can destroy another’s city,\nWithout attack he can surrender another’s stronghold—\nIf his lands are vast,\nHis commands are revered,\nHis ancestral temples honored,\nHis virtue and power flowing—\nThis is the aspiration of great states.\n\nHe befriends great states,\nConnects in harmony,\nAnd forms alliances.\nWhen calamities arise,\nThe great states take pity on him.\nWhen neighboring states are distant,\nThe great states seek him out.\nHe bends beneath one,\nYet raises above many.\nHis ancestral altars are honored,\nHis state is prosperous,\nHis armies are strong,\nHis people are complete,\nHis blessings extend endlessly—\nThis is the wish of small states.\n\nThus, to border neighboring lands,\nTo hold power without movement,\nTo humble oneself first and gain first,\nTo let the lowly control the proud,\nTo let the gentle overcome the turbulent—\nThis is the way of the great,\nWho obtain what they desire.\nWhy is this so?\n\nBecause the natural Dao cannot be forced.\nWater moves and flows downward,\nPeople act and seek advantage.\nTo release what is held,\nTo assign what is done—\nWhen many are weak and united,\nIt arises unexpectedly.\nThis is how the strong perish.\n\nThus the great must humble themselves.",

humility,\nStopping at sufficiency,\nLowering oneself,\nPasturing the self,\nTaking joy in the lowly,\nFlowing like water,\nUnerring.\nLowering further, lowering to the utmost,\nUntil reaching the boundless—\nThe world responds accordingly.\nThus, one can attain dominion.\nWhy so?\nHuman nature delights in honor and favor,\nHates humiliation and disgrace,\nYet when lowered, resentment grows;\nWhen raised, delight follows;\nWhen stopped, contempt arises.\nThis is the universal path of ancient and modern,\nThe natural principle of human hearts.\nThe worthy follow it; the petty exceed it.\nThus, in honoring virtue and conduct,\nThere is no calamity.\n\nIn ancient times, governing the people,\nNone were abandoned.\nThe ministers of Jie and Zhou could be ordered to obey;\nThe soldiers of Qin and Chu could be led to follow.\nThus, by winning their hearts,\nThe world could not fail to submit.\nWives and concubines were not forced—\nHow could this be achieved?\nNobility brings reverence from the world,\nWealth brings possession of the four seas,\nPower and might are boundless,\nDominion and authority are absolute—\nYet these are what people fear.\nTo depart on foot, leaving the ranks,\nTo rise like a great bird, like a dragon ascending,\nTo assist the Son of Heaven,\nTo spread the Way, to display virtue,\nTo enact all benefits,\nTo illuminate ancestors—\nThese are what people desire.\nUsing what people fear to seek what they desire,\nWords are unseemly, conduct disrespectful.\nThough one holds great jade and precious treasures,\nThough one rides in fine carriages with four horses,\nThe hearts of the worthy would still doubt and reject.\nThe hidden and profound would remain concealed.\nThe virtuous would not come.\nWhen inner cultivation is refined,\nQi and spirit overflow outward.\nWithout the labor of four horses,\nWithout the cost of jade and treasures,\nScholars from across the land would respond in chorus,\nRising like the wind, gathering heroes and talents,\nConverging like bees to the hive.\nThus, the ancient revered this Way—\nWhy?\n\nWords conform to Heaven and Earth,\nYet do not rely on conduct to align with human hearts.\nAchieving without display,\nCompleting without possession,\nNature acts without contrivance—\nAll things return to it as the sovereign of the world.\nThe chapter on *Wuwei* [Non-Action].\n\nThe divine patterns, the natural Way—\nNothing is not generated, nothing is not generated.\nWhat is not and what is,\nWhat is and what is not—\nAll generate.\nFrom this perspective,\nSorrow does not generate sorrow,\nJoy does not generate joy.\nNot sorrow, not joy—\nThen sorrow and joy arise.\nThus, those dwelling in calamity attain blessing,\nThose dwelling in blessing incur calamity.\nThe master of calamity and blessing lies in *wu* [non-being].\nWithout form, yet heard—\nDeep and far-reaching.\nThus, *wuwei* [non-action] is greater than action,\nAnd action is lesser than *wuwei*.\nThe virtue of *wu* is thin,\nWhile the virtue of *wuwei* is thick.\nTherefore, the Sage does not act as if acting,\nDoes not act as if not acting,\nDoes not act as if dying,\nDoes not act as if living—\nPlaying in the realm of *wu*,\nDwelling between life and death,\nChanging and responding naturally,\nEver constant.\nThus, unseen yet clear,\nUnheard yet keen,\nSupporting Heaven and Earth,\nAdorning the Way,\nNurturing the spirit,\nGuiding all things,\nRuling the empire,\nGovern the people,\nRelieving emotions,\nFreeing the mind—\nReturning to the origin,\nTrue non-action.\nNot laboring for life,\nNot undertaking deeds,\nNot applying benevolence,\nNot bestowing benefit,\nTeaching without leading,\nGuiding without knowledge,\nSevering what the people delight in to follow their nature,\nPermitting what the people hate to obtain their will.\n\nExiting the door of life’s end,\nEntering the path of eternal youth,\nSoaring in the boundless,\nAt ease in the Great Primordium,\nObscure and indistinct,\nMysterious and vast—\nNone know its origin.\nThick as twilight’s dimness,\nThe world has no affairs.\nTasting the tasteless,\nPerceiving the formless—\nThus, able to distinguish differences,\nClarify right and wrong.\nBefore there is definition,\nBefore there is inclination,\nBefore courage and reputation arise,\nBefore fortune is attained or calamity born,\nBefore blessing or misfortune is generated—\nThe blessing of *wu* arises in silence,\nThe calamity of *wu* ceases without name.\nThe ruler is at ease, the people content,\nThe world in peace.\nThus, disasters are foreseen and mourned,\nBlessings are prolonged and sought,\nTyranny over the ruler is met with death,\nInsult to parents is avenged,\nDifficulties are provoked and broken,\nRebellions are crushed and extinguished,\nDefenses are summoned and destroyed,\nTreachery is invited and punished.\nWhen courage and reputation appear, they conflict with Heaven;\nWhen cleverness and fame arise, they oppose the Way;\nWhen action brings joy, labor is great yet virtue is small;\nWhen deeds bring delight, the benefit is meager.\nThus, loyalty and trust are undermined,\nRight conduct is abandoned,\nNatural order collapses.\nThose who lurk and steal glory become evident,\nThose who usurp authority are exposed,\nThose who create chaos prosper,\nThose who deceive thrive,\nRight and wrong are inverted,\nHeaven is defied—\nThe world tilts greatly,\nThings lose their nature,\nFamilies and states fall into ruin.\nThus, the best way to eliminate disasters\nIs to have no disasters at all.\nThe best way to achieve governance\nIs to remain in silent stillness.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous act before the beginning,\nRest in the boundlessness of *wu*,\nSpreading the Way, bestowing virtue,\nChanging in silence, angering in non-anger,\nSpeaking in non-speech,\nAttacking without daring,\nDefending without end,\nThreatening without force.\nRepaying grudges before they arise,\nPlotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nSevering their roots before they manifest,\nPreventing their occurrence before they begin—\nThus, even the slightest matter is treated as a great mountain,\nAnd great affairs are treated as fine threads.\nContinuous and meticulous,\nRespectful and cautious,\nAs if at the very start,\nAs if ever new.\nNot seeking what is desired,\nNot pursuing what is convenient,\nEver opposing the conventional,\nAlone preserving the origin,\nBenefiting with the times,\nDaily progressing without force—\nThus, things naturally become great.\nTherefore, when great calamity is about to arise,\nIt is like a harmful wind entering the body—\nBefore it manifests, treat it with caution.\nWhen it is still in the skin and hair,\nUse warm compresses to drive it out.\nWhen it reaches the muscles and tendons,\nUse acupuncture to extract it.\nWhen it penetrates to the organs,\nUse medicine to purge it.\nWhen it sinks to the marrow,\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate it,\nEven transformation cannot cure it.\nWhen great affairs are about to emerge,\nThey are like water issuing from mountains—\nBeginning with dampness,\nManifesting in ripples,\nFlowing as streams,\nGathering into rivers,\nSwelling into seas—\nDeep and boundless, unfathomable.\nThus, the Sage establishes function and reputation\nThrough subtlety, achieving clarity through obscurity,\nThrough smallness, achieving greatness,\nThrough concealment, achieving prominence.\nTheir intent is beneath the people,\nYet they become sovereigns.\nTheir威 reverberates within the four seas,\nAll under Heaven align.\nTheir command is received, their authority unchallenged—\nNone can resist.\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir clarity matches the sun and moon.\nThus, those who speak much in assent,\nThough many in number, cannot be trusted.",

      "translated_text": "The ruler holds all beasts in check—\nThe cow and horse he feeds, the sword and shield he wields,\nYet none can hinder him.\n\nThus, a trickle of water, ceaseless and unhurried,\nBecomes the ocean’s tide.\nA small serpent, not yet slain,\nTransforms into a divine dragon.\n\nAccumulated goodness, though slight,\nReaches the heights of fortune.\nAccumulated evil, though minor,\nLeads to ruin.\n\nHence, the ruler who inherits the Way\nHas no grievances, no malevolence.\nHis ministers are harmonious, his people obedient,\nNeighboring states trade freely, and none dare to slander.\nPeaceful and undisturbed, his realm is serene,\nThe high and low in unity, all gathered in accord.\n\nAt such times, he governs without coercion,\nHolds without force—\nWithout action, without schemes,\nNone can overcome him.\n\nWhen dangers loom but signs are not yet clear,\nWhen calamities stir but roots are not yet firm,\nThe ruler’s fate lies in himself, not others.\nHis counsel need not be that of the Sage,\nNor his vigilance that of the mighty warrior.\n\nWhen he lies in bed, the disasters are already averted.\n\nYet when the ruler strays from the Way,\nHis ministers grow resentful,\nNeighboring states refuse trade,\nOfficials weaken and decay,\nDisasters arise—\nSmall and weak, like the down of a bird,\nBut not yet manifest.\n\nAt this juncture, wise men deliberate deeply,\nEvents stir but have not yet moved,\nPerils grow but do not yet overwhelm,\nDisasters deepen but do not yet destroy.\n\nWhen the ruler strays from rectitude,\nHis ministers plot in error,\nNeighboring states harbor grudges,\nThe people hesitate in doubt,\nDisasters have already taken root—\nWicked lords may rise but lack true support,\nAlliances form but do not bind,\nOr bind but are not firm.\n\nAt this time, he honors the virtuous,\nLowers the proud,\nBreaks the stubborn,\nListens to subtle advice,\nSeeks faults before they manifest,\nDoes not resent his counselors,\nAnd guards against calamities before they arise.\n\nThus, fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen,\nLife and death from the subtle.\nThese two forces intertwine—\nThe wind shifts, bending and stretching,\nWaves surge, advancing and retreating,\nChaos and order blend unseen.\nTo hear it is beyond hearing,\nTo see it is beyond sight,\nSkill cannot grasp it,\nWisdom cannot discern it.\n\nHence, the Sage cultivates the Way,\nTeaches through his own being—\nHe does not act to correct what has not yet gone awry,\nYet all things settle in ease.\nHe does not nurture,\nYet all things flourish naturally.\nHis movement aligns with fortune,\nHis stillness avoids disaster.\n\nThe heavens stretch vast and dark,\nIts source unseen—\nHe governs before chaos takes hold,\nCorrects before imbalance tilts,\nRestrains the wicked before their schemes mature,\nSeals falsehood at its inception,\nShuts the door to evil,\nBlocks the path of wrong.\n\nBefore the sprouts stir,\nBefore the signs appear,\nBefore the roots are visible,\nBefore the decay is evident—\nHe teaches without teaching,\nGuides without naming,\nKnows without knowing,\nActs without form.\n\nHe does not stir to govern,\nYet governs with effortless mastery.\nHe does not grasp to control,\nYet controls with natural precision.\n\nTo seek what is sought,\nTo desire what is desired—\nIf he could guard the end as the beginning,\nHold fast what he should not possess,\nAnd act before the first stir of chaos,\nTurning back before the first thought of error,\nThen even if it seems not to succeed,\nAll things would unfold naturally.\n\nIf he disturbs his vital essence,\nClouds his clarity,\nAnd fails to reach his true desires,\nHis movements stray from what he seeks,\nHis stillness guards what he craves—\nThen wealth and learning become his burden.\n\nOnly he who chains his passions,\nTransforms his nature,\nShifts his heart and mind,\nFinds joy in desirelessness,\nAnd takes delight in effortless action—\nThese are the Dao and virtue.\n\nThus, contemplating the Way is like cherishing a parent,\nHating wealth is like losing one’s body,\nSeeking thought beyond thought,\nDesiring desire beyond desire—\nThis is the path to clarity.\n\nTo exhaust the profound and reach the utmost,\nTo grasp what others cannot,\nTo achieve what none can,\nTo attain what no one possesses—\nHis spirit serene, his form composed,\nHe lies still as a corpse, stands rigid as withered wood,\nThinks not, considers not,\nAs if knowing nothing at all.\n\nHe lets all things be natural,\nOrders all things to act of their own accord.\nEmpty and still, his body is one with all things,\nEach creature thrives in its own way—\nLike a hillock or a mound,\nLike a vast plain or a towering height,\nHis actions are effortless yet contrary to the world,\nAll things respond accordingly.\nThus, he can be profound and far-reaching,\nCovering the world like the heavens,\nMoving with the divine—\nYet he does not dare to create goodness,\nFor goodness is the Way itself.\n\n**Chapter: The Virtue of Dao and Virtue**\n\nThe Dao and virtue are pure and clear,\nLike the mingling of yin and yang.\nAll things follow as if they were the root or the stem,\nTheir numbers endless, their transformations boundless—\nLife and death, flourishing and decline,\nAll share in fortune and defense.\n\nThe intention of the Dao is the heart of the heavens and earth,\nTo nurture life and bring ease.\nIt does not hate or harm,\nYet commands all things.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is the king of all things,\nBringing benefit to them—\nIf they are not benefited, they suffer fear.\nThe Sage fears greatly,\nFor fear comes from what may follow.\nHe delves deeply into its origins,\nFor the best medicine is naturalness itself.\n\nHow might this be made clear?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n\nThe heavens and earth do not know\nThe virtue’s workings,\nYet all things can be.\nThe myriad creatures do not see\nThe heavens and earth’s ways,\nYet they can endure.\nThe common folk do not recognize\nThe ruler’s true purpose,\nYet they can be at peace.\n\nThus, the Way is vast and boundless,\nIts source unseen.",

      "translated_text": "The people strayed from **ease** and abandoned **life**, becoming hard to govern,\nFor they knew too much.\nWhen the people know, they crave **life**—\nCraving **life**, they begin affairs—\nBeginning affairs, they pursue **function** and **name**—\nPursuing **function** and **name**, they rise to **anger** and **contention**—\nRising to **anger** and **contention**, great deceit is born—\nGreat deceit born, then governance becomes difficult indeed.\n\nThus, when **knowledge** is the ruler’s **virtue/power**,\nThe world’s cleverness, cunning, deceit, and guile multiply,\nStrange creatures arise in abundance,\nPassions grow boundless,\nLuxury and excess know no end,\nWickedness and crookedness prevail,\nThe weak and the strong vie in strife,\nValleys and rivers bear different names,\nGreat calamities spring forth.\n\nSubjects deceive their lords,\nChildren disrupt their fathers,\nWhite becomes black,\nAbsence is called presence,\nNames shift, reality alters,\nAnd the age of **harmony** is shattered—\n**life** is destroyed.\n\nThe world turns chaotic—\nUnstable, it cannot be secured—\nThe armies roll, lightly armed yet reckless—\nWithin the seas, they attack each other,\nAnd countless die, their blood flowing like rivers—\nSorrow and resentment fill the land,\nThe **qi** of their suffering moves the **Heavenly**,\nStars scatter, sun and moon lose their light,\nYin and yang fall out of order,\nAll things are harmed—\nMountains wither, valleys run dry,\nThe earth turns red for thousands of miles,\nThe world is in ruin,\nAnd people resort to cannibalism—\nNot the **fault** of **Heaven**!\n\nWhen the ruler favors **knowledge** and **cleverness**,\nAnd teaches all the people,\nHe abandons **virtue/power** and **purity**,\nKnows only himself, worries only for himself—\nNot seeing what he desires,\nHe closes the people’s ears and eyes.\n\nHis eyes do not feast on the Five Colors,\nHis mouth does not taste the Five Flavors—\nThe ruler is like **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nThe people like grass and trees—\nDwelling in caves, living in holes,\nFinding **ease** in mountains and valleys,\nDrinking from streams, eating from fields,\nNot seeking the Five Grains—\nThey know not their mothers, nor recognize their fathers,\nTheir clans are lost—\nStuporous and dim-witted,\nThey do not distinguish east from west,\nMen do not love women, nor children their parents—\nWood and stone are not despised,\nGold and jade are not prized—\nJade and gold grow tangled together,\nThey dwell in mixed confusion—\nThe world unites in one heart,\nThe Eight Directions guard together—\nThe **borer** and **worm** do not act,\nPoisonous beasts do not rise—\nThe **Divine Dragon** dwells among men,\nThe **Qilin** and **Phoenix** play in the courtyard—\nThe **Zephyr** soars, the **Fragrant Wind** blows,\nThe **Jade Springs** flow sweetly,\nThe **Sweet Dew** falls abundantly,\nThe **Red Grass** flourishes,\nThe **Auspicious Rice** grows lush—\nAll things live long—\nThis is **Heaven**’s blessing,\nThe ruler **names** the **unnamed** while **knowing** the **unknown**.\n\nThus, **knowledge** and **folly** are seen as equal,\n**Knowledge** and **Wisdom** are aligned with the **Dao**—\nGovernance follows this,\nSometimes bringing **harm**, sometimes **benefit**—\nTo see **harm** clearly is to gain **Great Peace**,\nTo see **benefit** clearly is to bring **harm** to all things—\nThus, **Wisdom** and **Knowledge** cannot be avoided,\nA tranquil **Heaven** and a peaceful **Earth** are the **virtue/power**’s **favor**,\nThe common folk do not perceive it—\nTherefore, **purity** and **purity** run deep,\nImmeasurable, boundless—\nOpposite to all things,\nNo one can resist its **overflow**—\nIts **dissolution** and **dispersion** are vast,\nIts **fleeting** and **vanishing** are profound—\nIt **responds** to things without form,\nGuides the **Dao** and **virtue/power**,\nNourishes the **Divine** and **Bright**,\nEmbraces all within the Six Extremes—\nNone escape its **virtue/power**,\nNone avoid its **ren**—\nThus, **life** is preserved,\nAnd **death** comes naturally at **Heaven**’s appointed time—\n**Nature** is upheld!\n\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things **generate** themselves.\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,\nYet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.\n**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,\nYet they rule themselves.\n\nThus, **Heaven** and **Earth** endure for a hundred million years,\nAnd the **Dao** rules them all—\nThe **Yang** is resplendent, and **Heaven** rules it,\nThe **Yin** is serene, and **Earth** rules it—\nThe **naked** dwell in holes, and the **Sage** rules them,\nThe **winged** soar in the void, and the **Divine Phoenix** rules them,\nThe **furred** tread firmly, and the **Qilin** rules them,\nThe **scaled** reside in water, and the **Divine Dragon** rules them,\nThe **armored** dwell in marshes, and the **Spirit Tortoise** rules them—\nThe Nine Rivers flow together, and the **Seas** rule them.\n\nAll these nine categories do not **force** themselves to rule,\nYet the things **return** to them naturally—\nNo **schemes** are needed, yet all things are governed—\nNo **ren** and **virtue/power** are imposed, yet all things **attach**—\nNo **cleverness** is exerted, yet all things **fear**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFor they **align** with the **Dao** and **harmony**,\nAnd do not **use** things to **act**—\nThus, things **act** of themselves.\n\nTherefore, the **Seas** rule—\nNot through **accumulating** **virtue/power** and **governance**,\nNor **piling up** **ren** and **love**,\nNor **displaying** **Divine** and **Bright** **virtue/power**,\nNor **adorned** **rituals** and **justice**,\nNor **expanding** **speech** and **modesty**,\nNor **decorating** **cleverness** and **skill** to please them—\nNor through **strange actions** and **variations**,\nNor **establishing** **authority** and **power**,\nNor **brandishing** **military might** and **terror**,\nNor **prioritizing** **life** and **growth**,\nNor **exhausting** **efforts** in a hundred affairs to **control** them—\n\n**Quietude** and **stillness** in the lowly place,\n**Virtuelessness** and **non-seeking**—\nThen the myriad rivers come of themselves—\nThe myriad rivers do not **hear** of the **Seas**’ **schemes**,\nYet they are **transformed** by its **virtue/power**,\nAnd **return** in reverence—\nNor is it through **restraints** and **bindings**,\nNor **teachings** with **limits**,\nNor **drawing** **boundaries** of east and west,\nAnd **forcing** them to **conform**—\n\nYet water **pierces** gold, **shatters** stone,\n**Bores** through cliffs, **collapses** mountains,\n**Rushes** over hills and mounds—\nAll this to **attend** the **Seas**,\nAnd never **return**—\nTheir **forms** and **natures** align,\nTheir **affairs** follow **nature**—\nThus, **humility** and **lowliness** are the **Dao**’s great **virtue/power**!\n\nA hundred **harms** cannot injure it,\n**Knowledge** cannot **take** it,\nIt **strengthens** without **battle**,\nIt **rules** without **threat** or **force**—\nSilent and **virtueless**, yet **strong**—\nIt **responds** to all things in **harmony**—\nThus, **valleys** and **gorges** are lowly,\nYet they are not **bounded** by east and west,\nSo they **reach** and never **end**—\nThe **Seas** are in the lowly place,\nYet they are not **limited** by **greatness**,\nSo they **rule** and never **cease**—\n\nTherefore, the **Desires** of the **Enlightened Ruler** and **Sage Sovereign**\nAre to **cherish** the people—\nWith **nature**’s **virtue/power** and the **Sage**’s **bearing**,\nWith **humility** in speech and **reverence** in conduct,\nTo **compare** oneself to the common folk,\nTo **regard** one’s **body** as **Earth**,\nTo **honor** the people as **Heaven**—\nBrightly **knowing** yet **immeasurable**,\nLoftily **able** yet **unfathomable**,\nDeeply **perceptive** yet **unobstructed**,\nClearly **illuminated** yet **unblocked**—\nNot to **exploit** things,\nBut to **follow** the people—\nThus, the people **walk** upon it as if it were **Earth**,\nThey **lean** upon it as if it were **Divine**—\nIt is always above the people,\nRuling the **lands** and **soils**,\nMatching **Heaven** in its **virtue/power**—\nIts **desires** come before the people’s,\nIts **humility** is after the people’s—\nIt **labors** while the people **rest**,\nIt **sacrifices** while the people **gain**—\nIn the **highest** place, yet the people **live**,\nIn the **lowest** place, yet the people **find ease**—\nBecause the people **live**, it **wears** them without **burden**,\nBecause the people **find ease**, it **serves** them without **harm**—\nThus, the world **pushes** it forward,\nAnd **draws** it near—\nIt **delights** without **weariness**,\nIt **rejoices** without **satiation**—\nTherefore, the **Sage**’s **rule** is such—\nNot **seeking** the people,\nBut the people **seeking** it.\n\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **generate** the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things **generate** themselves.\n**Heaven** and **Earth** do not **nurture** the myriad creatures,\nYet the myriad creatures **nurture** themselves.\n**Nature**’s things do not seek to rule,\nYet they rule themselves.\n\nThus, **Heaven** and

      "translated_text": "**The Doctrine of Dao/Virtue: A Summary**\n*(Chapter Six of the \"Discussion on the Return of Dao/Virtue\")*\n**Imperially Approved: The Siku Quanshu**\n---\n\n**Discourse on Military Affairs**\n*(Composed by Yán Zūn of the Han Dynasty)*\n\nThe Dao/Way is ever-present; presence and absence are not its essence.\nHarmony subdues the weak, embracing the great—\nYet its **威威** (*great awe*) nurtures all **things**,\nNone can defy it, none can escape its form.\nIt serves as the teacher of all **things**—\nThose who grasp it are secure; those who lose it are perilous.\nHeaven and Earth embody it—\nYet they never decay.\n\nHow then shall we emulate it?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If there is no yang in yin, all **things** would not grow;\nIf there is no yin in yang, all **things** would not flourish.\"*\nFrom this, we observe:\n**威威** (*great awe*) without **德德** (*virtue*) cannot govern the people;\n**德德** (*virtue*) without **威威** (*great awe*) will topple ancestral temples.\nWithout **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*), one invites calamity—\nDisaster, change, and death follow in turn.\nThe ruler is the **vital core** of the state,\nMilitary might is its **spiritual essence**.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, all nations rise in parallel—\nGreat and small, wise and foolish—\nAll aspire to rule, yet when their **智智** (*wisdom*) is exhausted and their strength bent,\nThey are undone—not because they lacked surplus strength,\nBut because they failed to align with the **Way**.\nThus, the enlightened ruler and sage-king\nExtends the **Way**, mirrors Heaven,\nTakes **stillness** as their foundation,\n**Harmony** as their constant,\n**Responsiveness** as their beginning,\n**Sincerity** as their core—\n**Naming and reality** as their record,\n**Rewards and punishments** as their guiding principle.\nWith **virtue** on their left and **威威** (*great awe*) on their right,\nThey meet misfortune with **无无** (*non-action*).\nAll under Heaven revere and obey them—\nNone can harm or destroy them.\nThus, the state is preserved, and the people are whole.\n\n**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are like Heaven and Earth—\nYin and yang are like **威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*).\n**威威** (*great awe*) and **德德** (*virtue*) are the **外表** (*outer form*) and **内里** (*inner essence*) of the ruler,\nLike the **隐隐** (*hidden*) and **显显** (*manifest*) realms of the **域域** (*domain*).\nThus, when the **Way** is lost and war is favored,\nThe ruler weakens himself,\nNeglects proper governance,\nEngages in depravity,\nExalts strength while suppressing **威威** (*great awe*),\nLoosens discipline, indulges in luxury,\nAdorns palaces with excessive craftsmanship,\nAccumulates wealth in ornate carriages and horses,\nDelights in music and women,\nSlaughters loyal advisors,\nHolds in contempt the virtuous and the wise,\nDishonors the aged and the young,\nViolates the **三光** (*three luminaries*),\nOppresses the orphaned and the widowed,\nReverses the **天地** (*Heaven and Earth*),\nInflicts **刑戮** (*punishments and executions*),\nDisrupts **阴阳** (*yin and yang*),\nShatters **德德** (*virtue*) and **威威** (*great awe*),\nDissolves **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **和顺** (*harmony*),\nFails to **通通** (*harmonize*) **变化** (*transformations*),\nSummons **冬雷** (*winter thunder*) and **夏霜** (*summer frost*),\nCausing all **things** to suffer greatly—\nThen the people, in their **纵横** (*wandering*) and **击抟** (*confusion*), plot in vain,\nThe great nations tremble in fear,\nThe small nations flee in terror,\nThe aged and the weak scatter in lamentation,\nAll under Heaven seethe with resentment,\nThe myriad people yearn for war,\nAnd rise in rebellion—\nI am the last to act.\nWhy is this so?\n\nOnly the ancestors possessed **神明** (*divine clarity*) and **德德** (*virtue*),\nHarmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir **圣智** (*sage-wisdom*) laboring for the myriad people.\nThus, they were granted **剖符** (*sacred tokens*) and **丹书** (*red seals*),\nReceived the land and bestowed with surnames,\nListed among the **君王** (*sovereign kings*),\nTheir glory illuminating ancestral lineages,\nTheir deeds passed down to descendants—\nThis is the **心心** (*core*) of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **功功** (*achievement*) of ten thousand years.\nYet those who inherit their legacy\nFail to humble themselves, refine their conduct,\nNurture their **精精** (*essence*), temper their **神神** (*spirit*),\nPractice the **Way**, embody **德德** (*virtue*),\nAnd serve their ancestors.\nInstead, they neglect minor virtues,\nReplace minor evils with greater ones,\nDay by day, month by month,\nThe ancestral temples crumble and fall,\nThe state becomes a ruin,\nThe people are scattered and defenseless,\nThe **神神** (*spirit*) is lost, the **魂魂** (*soul*) wanders—\nWhere shall they rest?\nAlas, is this not sorrowful?\n\nThus, I exhort the **豪俊** (*heroic and virtuous*) to rally the soldiers,\nUnroll the armor, lay down the weapons,\nAnd command them to rest.\nI awaken their **役心** (*war-weary spirits*), shifting their **幸幸** (*fortune*) to **反覆** (*repentance*),\nUrging them to change and reform,\nTo **变容易** (*adapt and adjust*)—\nThen they proceed without turning back,\nBecoming **贼贼** (*bandits*) to all under Heaven.\nThe people are impoverished, their resources exhausted,\nTheir strength bent, their worries endless—\nYet Heaven’s response is inevitable:\nDisaster gathers upon their land.\nThough they may seek divine favor or human aid,\nThey still must guard against it with caution,\nHold it with reverence,\nAvoid risks, exploit opportunities,\nPrepare their encampments, secure their resting places,\nRely on water and grass,\nFill gaps, block evils—\nYet they remain distant from the enemy,\nTheir **运运** (*fortunes*) shift unseen,\nTheir **奇奇** (*strategies*) emerge without trace,\nTheir victories are unending,\nTheir battles without deep defenses.\n**变化** (*transformations*) are endless, yet their origins are hidden—\nI draw near, yet they know not my intent,\nOnly their own strength is revealed.\nThus, those at home find ease and joy,\nThose in the military find delight and gladness—\nIf they are summoned as if for their own children,\nSent beyond borders as if to a marketplace,\nUrged to till the fields and weave with vigor,\nTo rest in the evening and rise early,\nTo march in formation with disciplined precision,\nNo one dares act alone—\nAll provide for the army as they would for their parents.\nIf they are granted authority to dispute victories,\nThe enemy does not rise before battle is joined—\nThus, all under Heaven stands in order,\nNone attack while the **诸侯** (*feudal lords*) submit.\nHeaven and Earth cover them,\nThe sun and moon shine upon them—\nAll nations stand in awe, each at peace in their own lands.\nWhy is this so?\n\n**慈哀** (*compassion and mercy*) move them—\nThis arises from Heaven’s **心心** (*intent*), not from me.\n*(From the chapter: \"Discourse on the Ease of Knowing Speech\")*\n\nThe **Way** and **神神** (*spirit*) are boundless yet transformative—\nHeaven and Earth are silent yet all-revealing.\nBoundless **Way** pervades all without limit,\nSilent **神神** (*spirit*) communicates all without sound.\n**神神** (*spirit*) and **气气** (*qi*) pass through generations,\nSensing and responding in kind—\nYet they descend into **虚无** (*emptiness*), offering no resistance.\nThus, **妙妙** (*wondrous*) **归归** (*return*) is the **自然** (*natural*),\nAll is guided without constraint—\nHence, **言言** (*speech*) is the **贼贼** (*bandit*) of **自然** (*naturalness*).\nAction is the **数数** (*measure*) of **防防** (*defense*),\nYet **无为** (*non-action*) and **无言** (*no speech*) are the ultimate **成功** (*achievement*),\nThe **要要** (*key*) to enduring **长存** (*longevity*).\n\nThus, the sage\nUses **言言** (*speech*) that is not **言言** (*speech*),\nSpeaks to **绝绝** (*cease*) **言言** (*speech*),\nTo **止止** (*halt*) **为为** (*action*).\n**绝绝** (*Ceasing*) **言言** (*speech*) is the **道道** (*Dao/Way*) of **去去** (*removing*) **心心** (*heart*) and **意意** (*intent*),\n**止止** (*Halting*) **为为** (*action*) is the **术术** (*technique*) of **去去** (*removing*) **人人** (*people*) and **智智** (*wisdom*).\nTo **为为** (*act*) without **智智** (*wisdom*) is **愚愚** (*foolishness*),\nYet to **为为** (*act*) without **知知** (*knowledge*) is **慧慧** (*enlightened*).\nWithout **知知** (*knowledge*) and **欲欲** (*desire*),\nWithout **欲欲** (*desire*), there is **静静** (*stillness*),\nWithout **静静** (*stillness*), there is **虚虚** (*emptiness*),\nWithout **虚虚** (*emptiness*), there is **实实** (*substance*),\nWithout **实实** (*substance*), there is **神神** (*spirit*).\n**动动** (*movement*) returns to **太素** (*primordial purity*),\n**静静** (*stillness*) returns to **自然** (*naturalness*).\nThus, the body is preserved, the state is secured,\nWealth and honor bring no peril,\nAll **生生** (*living beings*) fulfill their **志志** (*aspirations*),\nAnd attain **长存** (*enduring longevity*).\nThis is the **易知** (*easy-to-know*) **言言** (*speech*) and the **易行**

      "translated_text": "The **Dao/Way**’s proof lies in **naturalness** (*自然*), its influence in **harmony** (*和*). All things have form and sound, taking and discarding, with influence—\nNot only the myriad creatures exhibit this.\n\nWhen form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.\nThere is no \"generate nothing\" but there is \"generate something,\"\nNo \"generate cover\" but there is \"generate opposition.\"\nThus, the Daoist governs with **non-action** (*無為*) as treatment,\nWhile the knowing one regards many affairs as disturbance.\n\nThe infant benefits from **not knowing** (*不知*), the aged suffer from many affairs—\nFrom this, it is seen: stupidity is the form of wisdom,\nWisdom is the shadow of stupidity.\n**Non-action** is the sound of affairs,\nAffairs are the echo of **non-action**.\n\nWisdom and cleverness are the net of disturbance,\nAction is the thread of ruin.\nHence, the myriad creatures cannot be harmonized,\nHeaven and Earth cannot be brought to **fitness** (*適*).\nHarmonizing leads to loss of harmony,\nBringing to fitness leads to loss of fitness.\nNot harmonizing, yet then able to harmonize—\nNot bringing to fitness, yet then able to fit.\n\nThus, in times of peace, one does not know danger,\nIn times of chaos, one does not know governance—\nLike shadows following forms, there is no escape.\nNot moving yet seeking echoes finds none—\nHence, knowing yet severing knowledge,\nOne is not constrained by knowing;\nNot knowing yet using knowledge,\nOne is not constrained by knowledge either.\nThis is why the **Dao/Way** is not constrained—\nBut the **Way of action** (*有為*) is constrained.\n\nTherefore, the Sage cultivates the **nature of harmony** (*通達之性*), wandering in the realm of **silent stillness** (*默*), dwelling in the land of **non-ability** (*無能*), entrusting the **body of not knowing** (*不知之體*), serene as empty space, fleeting as death.\nWith no schemes in the heart, no governance in the mind—\nBright and radiant, enlightening the four seas, yet silent,\nShowing **non-existence** (*無有*) to the eyes,\nNot stirring **form and color** (*形聲*), not raising **knowledge** (*知*)—\nThus, no calamities arise, and the people are at ease.\nNo speech yet the world is governed,\nNo governance yet the people are harmonized—\nBowing yet not oppressed, rising yet not constrained,\nSincerely upright, each guarding their pure **nature** (*性*).\nVague and boundless, all fulfill their natural lifespan—\nThe dead have no posthumous title, the living no name.\n\nLike this, in succession, countless and measureless—\nTheir emotions find no delight, their **nature** no joy,\nTheir hearts no ease, their minds no gain.\nThey do not know filial piety, nor fraternal duty,\nNor see **benevolence** (*仁*), nor recognize **righteousness** (*義*).\nWithout **rites and customs** (*典禮*), they guard their true **core** (*真干*).\nAs steadfast as the **muntjac deer** (*麋鹿*), as simple as the **wild goose** (*鸿雁*)—\nNeither joy nor sorrow, nor separation from chaos,\nLike the blind, like the deaf, with nothing to hear or see.\nNo palaces, no cities, no laws,\nNo shame or disgrace—\nThe dead are not truly dead, the living not truly alive,\nEntrusting their **Dao/Way** to the **Dao/Way** itself.\nNo speech, no action—\nYet **virtue/power** (*威德*) is naturally manifested,\nHeaven and Earth in **harmony** (*和順*), pure and chaotic,\nLike muddy waters, resplendent yet solemn—\nAll creatures, great and small, return to **stupidity** (*愚*).\nMotion without form, stillness without end—\nThus, the people all flourish, the world in **silent stillness** (*哑哑*).\nThey perish from petty gains yet enjoy great blessings—\nThe **silent stillness** (*默*) governor’s calculations cannot be calculated,\nHis measures cannot be measured—\nHow might one imitate this?\n\nWhen **virtue/power** (*德*) is lost, **naturalness** (*淳朴*) decays,\nAnd **Dao/Way**’s marvels perish, all things act in accordance.\nThus, the **Way of knowing** (*知故*) spreads,\nAnd **rites and customs** (*禮節*) arise to distinguish **fitness** (*適*).\nThe myriad creatures have order,\nThe hundred affairs have rules—\nBoundaries are marked, territories divided,\nStates and cities governed, villages and towns ordered.\nThe realm has loyal ministers, families have filial children—\nWithin, they are concise; without, they are cautious,\nTaking from one to benefit another,\nStriving to thicken their own **virtue/power** (*厚*).\nThe great perish, the small survive,\nAnd sacrificial rites to Heaven and Earth are established—\nGreat mountains, vast waters, and the **Dao/Way**’s altars.\nSacrificing at **Mount Tai** (*泰山*), bowing at **Mount Liang** (*梁父*)—\nGradually inherited, perhaps or perhaps not,\nTen thousand judgments passed, branding men filling the roads,\nSubjects killing their lords, sons killing their fathers—\nFamilies broken, states ruined, countless in number.\nThe world enjoys the **Way of knowing**’s benefits,\nYet bears the calamities of death—\nFrom this, it is clear: severing knowledge is blessing,\nLoving knowledge is ruin.\n\nThus, let those with **virtue/power** (*德*) change their **aspiration** (*志*), alter their hearts,\nGenerate and nurture all affairs to teach the people,\nPray and beseech for blessings—\nEven to the utmost governance, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not listen.\nLet those who perish their states abandon wisdom, discard desires,\nSever all affairs, cultivate the **Dao/Way**, practice **virtue/power** (*德*)—\nAnd those who seek death will not follow their form.\nHence, the **Dao/Way**’s form and sound are abandoned,\nIts influence stored and preserved.\n\nThe Sage’s ability to move aligns with Heaven,\nTo be still aligns with the **Dao/Way**—\nPreserving the self yet governing the world,\nSoaring beyond **action**’s realm,\nWandering within **non-action**’s domain—\nTaking blessings from the subtle and vast,\nAnd extending them to the four seas’ farthest reaches—\nBlinding the sharp-sighted,\nSealing the wise-mouthed,\nPlugging the keen-eared,\nSevering the clever-handed—\nFollowing the times, yet harmonized,\nBowing and rising without effort, yet naturally achieved,\nTeaching without governance, the people in order—\nThe Sage’s benevolence extends to beasts and birds,\nBecause of their **non-action** in severing knowledge and wisdom,\nAnd entrusting the **Dao/Way** instead.\n\nThus, they follow emotions, indulge desires,\nExhaust the heart’s schemes—\nMotion leads Heaven and Earth,\nStillness transforms the myriad affairs—\nDivine clarity within themselves,\nNo need to observe or burnish,\nNo lowering of the self, no raising of the seat—\nYet all nations prepare themselves.\nThough they wish not to perish, **naturalness** (*自然*) will not place them.\nThe people do not fear **virtue/power** (*威*)—\n**Dao/Way**’s defense, the divine’s governance,\nThe **Great Harmony**’s heart, Heaven and Earth’s **aspiration** (*意*).\n\nNo calamity is greater than losing **virtue/power** (*德*),\nNo blessing is greater than preserving **virtue/power** (*德*).\nThe **Way** of preserving the self is no more urgent than this—\nThe key to nurturing the **spirit** (*神*) is no greater than this.\n\nConstantly maintaining **naturalness** (*素然常体*),\nWith **fear and caution** (*忧畏*) as one’s foundation—\nTrembling and reverent, losing **spirit** (*神*) is the art of ruin.\nThe numbers of **spirit**’s defense lie in self-mastery—\nThus, the **Highest Sage** (*太上*) fears the **Dao/Way**,\nThe next fears Heaven,\nThe next fears Earth,\nThe next fears the people,\nThe next fears the self—\nFlourishing or decline, all depend on oneself.\nNot fearing in defense, yet fearing in **manifestation** (*章*)—\nSuffering great calamities, reaching even to annihilation.\n**Fear and caution** (*忧畏*) from the **beginning** (*元始*) to the **unseen** (*无形*).\nGuarding before signs appear—\nThe **Dao/Way**’s radiance is vast,\nMotion gains what is desired,\nStillness gains what is tranquil—\nBlessings and longevity are **defended** (*防*).\nDiscussing **Dao/Way** without measure,\nSpeaking as if in reverse—\nBright yet as if in darkness,\nDistant yet as if in depth—\nNone can hear it.\nListening to **Dao/Way**’s decrees within oneself,\nWhat need is there to seek Heaven’s?\nThe utmost blessing resembles calamity,\nGreat governance is like defense—\nThe world is drunk with ease, none can perceive it.\n\nThus, the common folk see what is near,\nHear what is shallow,\nDo not recognize the **Dao/Way** of **dimness** (*窅冥*),\nObscured by the **constants of subtlety** (*微妙之常*),\nBlocked by the divine’s principles—\nObserving the profit of a hair’s width,\nNot seeing the harm of a mountain’s height—\nIndulging emotions, acting without restraint,\nNo fear or caution.\nSpeaking in accordance with what is **true** (*然*),\nActing in accordance with what is **good** (*善*),\nStrength can take, yet the heart aligns with chaos—\n**Delicacy** (*防*) and **excess** (*奢*) are intertwined,\nSelf-mastery and indulgence are mingled—\nLoyalty and trust are what they love,\nYet they deceive their parents,\nInvade Heaven and Earth,\nSimplify their lords—\nFollowing emotions, desiring to fulfill Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—\nThus, they establish clever schemes, name them as their own,\nBestow favors and spread blessings to gain great calamities—\nFleeing blessings beyond Heaven, pursuing calamities across the four seas.\nSeeking **virtue/power** (*福德*) cannot be obtained—",
