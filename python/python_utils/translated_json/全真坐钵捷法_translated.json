One scroll.\n*Source Text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**Expedient Method for the Quanzhen Seated Alms-Bowl**\n\nObserving the living, all rely upon the sundials and water clocks of Xuandongyang City. From this year’s winter solstice to the next, the reckoning of the celestial cycle is complete—one day and one night for each movement of the Dipper. In total, one hundred *ke* are counted, with each *shi* comprising eight *ke* and twenty *fen*. Only the hours of *yin-shen* and *ji-hai* contain nine *ke*, and the division of day and night is fixed by *zi* and *wu*.\n\nYet now, the clepsydras in use vary wildly, no longer adhering to ancient methods. Driven by cunning and artifice, each craftsman indulges in blind conjecture, their designs lacking any standard measure. Thus, the timing is inevitably errant, either exceeding or falling short.\n\nHerein, I have devised a method for a circulating water clock, refined over years. It requires no human labor, expends no resources, and operates with subtle marvels—so simple and swift that even if carried in a traveler’s case beyond ten thousand *li*, it may rest upon a desk’s corner. Truly, the turning of the celestial sphere is captured within the sun’s midst.\n\nI have witnessed well-meaning gentlemen employ sundials, incense seals, or smoke patterns. Yet dry incense burns too swiftly, while damp incense smolders too slowly. A sundial serves only on clear days; in gloom, it cannot be trusted. None of these three endure as lasting methods.\n\nBy following this design, though it appears simple, it penetrates the profound and subtle—marvel within marvel.\n\n**Method for Crafting the Vessel**\n\nThe method employs two bronze basins—one large, one small. The larger holds water, with no fixed dimensions, provided it is broader and deeper than the smaller. If unavailable, a porcelain basin may substitute. The smaller weighs five *taels*, stands three *cun* and four *fen* in height, with both top and bottom measuring four *cun* and seven *fen* across, its sides perfectly straight. To ensure precise weight, use fifty *taiping* coins as a standard. Once crafted, bore a tiny hole in the base, no larger than a needle’s eye. Float the basin upon the water, and when inverted, water will rise through the hole into the smaller vessel. Use a dipper to measure the flow, marking the hour of *zi*. When water reaches *zi*, it is *zi*; when it reaches *wu*, it is *wu*; when it reaches the watch, it is the first watch. The rest follow accordingly.\n\n**Method for the Water Clock**\n\nEach day at dawn, just before sunrise, float the small basin upon the water’s surface in the larger vessel. By sunset, the water will have filled it, causing the small basin to sink to the bottom. Remove it, empty the water, and refloat it. By the next dawn, it will sink again. Both dusk and dawn are determined by the basin’s full submersion, marking the division of day and night. When storing water, ensure it is thoroughly filtered and free of sediment, lest debris clog the hole and disrupt the flow.\n\n**Method for Crafting the Dipper**\n\nThin wood or bamboo strips may serve as markers, inscribed with time divisions according to their length. These are used to measure the water’s rise and verify the hours and watches—simple and swift. The dipper is divided into thirty-four parts, evenly distributed into twelve segments, each segment measuring two *fen* and five *li*. For the hours of *yin*, *shen*, *ji*, and *hai*, an additional four *fen* is added, accounting for the uneven divisions of the *wei* hours. The intercalary months adjust for the discrepancy in the solar year. Here, a direct method is employed: the floating fish’s position indicates the time.\n\nFor the twelve months of the year, only twenty *taiping* coins are needed, adjusted monthly to weigh down the small basin.\n\n**Method for Adjusting the Coins**\n\nAt the eleventh month’s solar term, place twenty *taiping* coins evenly across the small basin’s bottom during the day, using an empty basin at night. At the twelfth month’s solar term, use nineteen coins during the day and one at night. Beginning with the twelfth month’s solar term, reduce the day’s coins by one and increase the night’s by one every seven days. At the first month’s solar term, use eleven coins during the day and nine at night. At the second month’s solar term, use ten coins for both day and night. At the third month’s solar term, use nine coins during the day and eleven at night. From the third month’s solar term onward, reduce the day’s coins by one and increase the night’s by one every seven days. At the fourth month’s solar term, use one coin during the day and nineteen at night. At the fifth month’s solar term, use an empty basin during the day and twenty coins at night. At the sixth month’s solar term, use one coin during the day and nineteen at night. From the sixth month’s solar term onward, increase the day’s coins by one and decrease the night’s by one every seven days. At the seventh month’s solar term, use nine coins during the day and eleven at night. At the eighth month’s solar term, use ten coins for both day and night. At the ninth month’s solar term, use eleven coins during the day and nine at night. From the ninth month’s solar term onward, increase the day’s coins by one and decrease the night’s by one every seven days. At the tenth month’s solar term, use eleven coins during the day and nine at night.\n\n**Method for Determining Sunrise and Sunset**\n\nIn the first and ninth months, the sun rises in *yi* and sets in *geng*.\nIn the second and eighth months, it rises in the *rabbit* and sets in the *rooster*.\nIn the third and seventh months, it rises in *jia* and sets in *xin*.\nIn the fourth and sixth months, it rises in *yin* and sets in the *dog*.\nIn the fifth month, it rises in *gen* and sets in *qian*.\nIn midwinter, it rises in *xun* and sets in *kun*.\nOnly in the tenth and twelfth months does it rise in *chen* and set in *shen*—examine this carefully.\n\n**Nine Yang Perfected One**\nOn the third day of the month, the moon rises in *yin*.\n\nOn the thirtieth day, it sets in *yi*.\n**The Swift Method of the Quanzhen Adept’s Alms-Bowl**—concluded.",
