  "full_translation": "**The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained**\n\n**Title of the Scripture:** The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained. Commentary by Chen Xianggu of the Song Dynasty. In two volumes.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), \"Divine Mysteries\" section, \"Jade Precepts\" category.\nThe original text is unchaptered; this edition follows the commonly transmitted version to restore chapter divisions.\n\n**Preface to the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained**\nThe Dao is the true and pure origin; its principles are most refined and clear.\nYet mortals, stirred by passions and desires, contrive countless deceits.\nThey cannot even preserve their own lives, much less save others from death.\nThe Most High Lord (太上) pities the suffering of all beings,\nand thus reveals this True Scripture,\ndeclaring that the Dao is not self-generated—all people inherently possess it—\nbut confusion arises from obscurations,\nand thus they lose their natural harmony.\nHence, the manifest teachings earnestly instruct,\nspeaking with direct intimacy,\nto restore purity and return to simplicity,\nso that the Dao may dwell within the hearts of all.\nThe division into chapters and naming of titles\nwas the tradition of ancient instruction.\n\nNow, the Dao encompasses Virtue (德), and Virtue harmonizes with the Dao;\nto force distinctions upon Virtue is not the Dao’s way,\nyet their subtle applications are unified.\nWhen one examines them through profound principles,\nwhat divisions remain?\nToday, I take the Five-Thousand Words of the Most High Lord (太上老君) as my guiding framework,\nso that the intent may be fully realized.\n\nThe principles are deep, the meanings profound;\nthe key lies in elucidation.\nIf one clings rigidly to fixed interpretations,\nfearing to stray from narrow views,\nthey risk misleading those who seek earnest study and contemplation.\nThus, I have composed this commentary,\noffering but a glimpse through a tube.\n\nWritten on the fifth day of the tenth month, the first year of Jianzhong Zhengguo (建中靖国元年).\n**Volume One of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained**\nCommentary by Chen Xianggu, the Chief Counselor (丞议郎).\n\n**Chapter One**\n\n**Chapter Two**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\nWhat can be spoken is known by all;\nwhat can be named is seen by all.\nThough known and seen,\nthey cannot exhaust the Dao’s subtle essence.\nThus, what all know as the Dao is not the Dao,\nand what all name as the Name is not the Name.\n\nThe Dao is nameless—\nthe origin of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Name is manifold—\nthe mother of all things.\n*\"Mother\"* is metaphorical,\ntaken from its role in giving birth.\nHeaven and Earth’s origin is vague and nameless,\nyet once named, it gives rise to all things between them.\n\nObserve its mystery with no desire;\nobserve its subtleties with desire.\nTo observe mystery without desire is to grasp its beginning.\nTo observe its limits with desire is to know its end.\nDesire arises from things;\nwhen things are exhausted, desire reaches its extreme—\nthen it arrives at *wuwei* (non-action).\n*\"Limits\"* means the boundary.\nWhen desire reaches its boundary,\nit is exhausted and has nowhere further to go.\nThus, there must be a return to simplicity and purity—\nhow could this differ from mystery?\nTherefore, observe mystery without desire,\nobserve limits with desire—\nthey are one and the same.\n\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names.\nThrough no desire, one knows the Dao’s mystery;\nthrough desire, one knows its limits—\nhow could this not be the same source?\nThis is called *Xuan* (the Profound).\nThe Profound means deep and subtle—\nits enlightenment lies within the heart.\n\nThe Sage knows the Dao’s beginning and end,\nawakens to its myriad applications.\nThe common folk act daily without grasping its essence—\nwhat else could it be but the Origin?\nThe Profound, again the Profound—\nthe gateway to all mysteries.\nThis is not shallow meaning.\nThe Dao that is not the eternal Dao,\nthe Name that is not the eternal Name—\nits principles are most profound,\ndifficult to fathom,\nhence: *The Profound, again the Profound—\nthe gateway to all mysteries.*\nNot merely one thing,\nit applies to governing the world,\nharmonizing the state,\nordering the family,\ncultivating the self—\nits mystery is ever thus.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen evil arises.\nThose sated on fine grains and meats\nno longer crave the taste of porridge and millet gruel;\nthose clad in pure silk\nno longer cherish the warmth of lambskin or cowhide.\nYet they do not realize:\nthe cold seek coarse hemp garments,\nthe hungry relish husks and chaff—\ntheir need is but for fullness and warmth.\nThus, beauty arises from ugliness,\nugliness from beauty;\ngoodness from evil,\nevil from goodness—\nall because the heart clings to its likes and dislikes.\nWhere there is such a heart,\nthere will be such deeds.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease arise together,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low contrast each other,\nsounds harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\nBecause the heart clings to beauty and ugliness,\nbenefit and harm become so uneven.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei* (non-action),\nteaches through *wuyan* (non-speech).\nNot claiming what is done,\nnot burdening speech with instruction,\nthe Dao flows naturally,\nthings follow in accord—\nlike the four seasons moving,\nand all things thriving thereby.\nThings arise without complaint,\nsilently following the Profound Transformation,\nunderstood without words.\n\nBorn yet not possessed,\nacting yet not relying,\nachieving yet not dwelling.\nTo dwell is shallow,\nto rely is narrow,\nto claim is limited.\nWith the Dao’s vastness thus held,\nhow could this not be its essential mystery?\nOnly by not dwelling does it not depart.\nSince it cannot be dwelled upon,\nnor abandoned—\nif abandoned, it would vanish,\nhow then could its teaching flourish?\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is vast yet used without excess.\n*\"Vast\"* means harmonious.\nThe Dao’s harmonious *qi* permeates Heaven and Earth,\nyet does not fill itself—\nspeaking of its immeasurability.\nProfound, it seems the origin of all things.\n*\"Profound\"* means deep and subtle.\n*\"Origin\"* means master.\nThe Dao acts without doing,\nyet all things arise from its harmonious *qi*—\nthus, it seems the master of all things.\nThings have differing natures—\nhard or soft, swift or slow,\ncolors, sounds—\nall uneven.\nYet their allotted portions come from Nature itself:\ngreat as mountains and rivers,\nsmall as grasses and trees—\nall share the harmonious *qi*,\nits function is one.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nDull its sharpness—\nso it does not act recklessly.\nUntangle its confusion—\nso its motion follows principle.\nDim its brilliance—\nso it does not self-illuminate.\nBlend with dust—\nso its traces vanish.\nDeep and still, it seems to exist.\nFrom the void arises presence,\nfrom presence returns the void—\nthus it is.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the Sovereign.\n*\"Child\"* refers to what arises from being—\nsince it cannot be named definitively,\nI say I do not know whose child it is.\n*\"Precedes the Sovereign\"* means\nit begins with emptiness and ends with emptiness.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not virtuous—\nthey treat all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not virtuous—\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.\nGreat virtue is non-virtue—\nthus, Heaven and Earth are not virtuous,\nthe Sage is not virtuous.\n*\"Straw\"* is grass—it has nature;\n*\"dog\"* is a domesticated beast—it has nature.\nBoth are things that follow the Way yet lack wisdom.\nNature is the beginning of the Way,\nemotion is its end.\nThe Way encompasses beginning and end,\nyet does not fully reveal its transformations—\nthus, it is spoken of in myriad terms,\nand compared to the lowly straw dog.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nIt contains without intention,\nyet nothing is excluded.\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever emerging—\nspeaking of its boundless reach.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\nThe wise value silence,\nfor much speech leads to exhaustion.\nSilence preserves inner clarity—\nthus, holding to the center is most precious.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\n*\"Valley\"* is a metaphor.\n*\"Spirit\"* is the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang.\nThough the valley’s form is small,\nit can embody the boundless void,\nreceiving without possessing—\nits subtlety is divine.\n*\"Death\"* means the stillness of extinction.\nIf its function is thus—\nendless in application,\nyet unseen in its presence—\nhow could there be a way of death?\n\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n*\"Root\"* means origin.\nHeaven and Earth speak not,\nyet the four seasons move,\nall things are born—\ntheir origin lies in the Mysterious Female’s Way,\nvast and boundless, beyond measure.\n\nContinuous as if present,\nyet its use is effortless.\n*\"Continuous\"* means unbroken.\n*\"As if present\"*—its divine function is unseen.\n*\"Effortless\"*—its natural Way leaves no trace of contrivance.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists—\nHeaven and Earth endure long\nbecause they do not generate themselves.\nHarmonious yet applied without self-assertion,\nthey do not generate all things—\nthus, the greatest is not depleted,\nthe most harmonious is not diminished.\nSo their form is complete,\ntheir Way profound—\nhow could they not endure?\nHow could they not persist?\n\nThus, the Sage yields his body yet leads,\nsets it aside yet preserves it.\nHe does not claim deeds for himself,\ndoes not monopolize himself—\nhaving yet seeming not to have,\nreal yet seeming empty—\nnurturing the primordial subtlety,\naligning with the Way—\nthus his body is always foremost,\nyet always preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n*\"Selfishness\"* is the Way.\nAll things, through Heaven and Earth’s embrace,\nretain their harmonious *qi*—\nis this not what the Way values?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\nWater’s nature:\nit does not prefer purity,\nnor despise filth.\nIts flow fills the hollows before advancing,\nits clarity is never obscured,\nits moisture never fails—\nthis is water’s nature,\nthe natural Way.\nThus, the highest virtue resembles water.\n\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where others reject it—\nthus it approaches the Way.\n*\"Benefits\"*—its nourishing function below.\n*\"Does not contend, dwells in what is hated\"*—\nnothing can surpass it.\n*\"Resides in good ground\"*—\nwhere water gathers, the land is always good.\n*\"Heart is good and deep\"*—\nwhere water collects, its depths hold clarity.\n*\"Associates with goodness and virtue\"*—\nwhere water flows, all things thrive without harm.\n*\"Words are trustworthy\"*—\nwhere water moistens, there is no deceit.\n*\"Governance is effective\"*—\nwhere water’s force moves, all things are nourished in accordance with nature.\n*\"Actions are capable\"*—\nflowing to a hundred fathoms deep without fear,\nrushing over precipices without weakening.\n*\"Movement is timely\"*—\nit flows when encountering the central plain,\nstops when meeting a barrier.\nIt drifts with the wind,\nfreezes when cold.\nOnly because it does not contend\nis it without blame.\nBecause it is the highest virtue,\nits faults cannot be sought.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nClutching to fill—\nit is better to stop.\nFault lies in clutching.\nTo clutch is to act—\nto possess and guard without tipping,\nit is better than holding to what is already possessed.\n\nPlucking to sharpen—\nit cannot be long preserved.\nTo pluck and sharpen is to exploit its advantage,\nyet exhaustion must come—\nhow could this be a lasting Way?\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nnone can guard them.\nA metaphor to illuminate the higher meaning.\nRich and noble yet arrogant—\nthey invite their own ruin.\nThe result of excess and sharpness.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nreputation established,\nthe body withdraws—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nNurturing the vital essence,\nembracing unity—\nhow could it separate?\nThe Way values preserving truth,\nnurturing simplicity.\n*\"Vital essence\"* has form yet does not stray,\n*\"unity\"* has function yet is most pure—\nthus, *\"nurturing the vital essence, embracing unity.\"*\nSeparation means failing the Way,\nbecoming dual.\nNow I say—\nhow could it separate?\nIs it not taught to avoid division?\n\nFocusing the *qi* to attain softness—\ncan you be like an infant?\n\n---\n\nSo then—\nhow could this be without flaw?\n\nPurifying and perceiving the profound—\ncan you be without blemish?\nPurifying like water washing,\nremoving like sweeping away filth,\nthus the profound perception may be fully realized.\nWithout flaw,\nthis is the essence of profound perception,\nhence it is taught that one must not have any blemish.\n\nLoving the people and governing the state—\ncan you act without action?\nLet the hundred folk say of you that it is natural,\nthis is the utmost of acting without action,\nhence it is taught that one must not have any action.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opens and closes—\ncan you be like the female?\nThe *qi* of Heaven is pure, clear, and luminous.\nTo follow things and respond to times,\nthe Way of opening and closing is not expressed in words,\nto conceal one’s *virtue* yet not stop—\nis this not being like the female?\nConcealing *virtue* means its application is unyielding.\nThe *Sūnyīn* says:\n*\"Concealing virtue yet not stopping,\nthus it does not descend.\"*\n\nBright and clear in all directions—\ncan you be without knowing?\nBright and clear in all directions,\none cannot be obscured by things,\nthus there is nothing unseen,\nnothing unheard.\nObserving externally their forms,\nilluminating internally their principles,\nsilently recognizing them—\nno need to proclaim from house to house,\nno need to spread one’s words far and wide.\nThis is the way of *virtue* without ostentation.\n\nTo give birth and to nurture—\ngiving birth yet not possessing,\ndoing yet not relying upon it,\nlengthening yet not controlling—\nthis is called *profound virtue*.\n\nGiving birth means the myriad things flow into form,\neach attaining its nature and destiny.\nNurturing means fostering with the *qi* of harmony,\nallowing them to fulfill their natural life and death.\nThe function of nurturing,\nthis is the governance of all under Heaven.\n\nThe myriad things give birth to sustain themselves yet do not claim possession,\nthus they also do without relying upon it,\nlengthening yet not controlling.\n*Profound virtue* operates within the heart,\nnot displayed outwardly—\nthis is so.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub,\nyet its utility lies in the empty space between them—\nthis is the use of a wheel.\nThe spokes and hub illustrate the beginning of the Dao.\nIts utility lies in the Dao of non-action—\nthis is the completion of the Dao.\nThe spokes and hub sustain each other,\nleaving no room for anything else,\nyet through the spokes and hub,\nits use is boundless—\nthe vastness of its benefit lies in this.\nThus, its use lies in the *non-action* of the unseen.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel,\nyet its utility lies in the empty space within—\nthis is the use of a vessel.\nPierce doors and windows to make a room,\nyet its utility lies in the empty space within—\nthis is the use of a room.\nThese all do not claim their own function,\nhence the earlier text says: *\"The harmonizing *qi* is used yet may not be full.\"*\nThus, having is for benefit,\nemptiness is for utility.\nBenefit stops at the matter at hand,\nutility follows the Dao.\nOnly the Dao is void, profound, and subtle—\ninvisible,\nhence it is said: *\"Emptiness is for utility.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate—\ngreed and desires arise from these,\nthus one contracts illness like this.\nChasing and galloping in hunts drives one’s heart to madness—\nthis is excessive movement,\nflitting about without stillness,\nthus madness arises within.\nRare treasures cause one to act improperly.\nGreed and love produce this,\nforgetting righteousness and gain,\nthus one’s actions become improper.\nHence, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nthus discarding that and taking this.\nActing for the belly means filling the belly,\ninternally storing one’s clarity.\nNot acting for the eyes means guarding against the encroachment of external influences.\nThat is external,\nthis is internal—\nthis is the sage’s choice.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace like a sudden alarm—\nwhen favor and disgrace come,\nthe emotions of sorrow and joy must arise within,\nthere is none who remains unmoved,\nhence it is said: *\"Like a sudden alarm.\"*\nGreat calamity and great virtue are like the body.\nFrom the body, great calamity and great virtue arise,\nthus it is said: *\"Great calamity and great virtue are like the body.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by favor and disgrace?\nFavor is lowly,\ndisgrace arises from within—\nenduring and bending beneath others,\nthis is the key of the Dao.\nFavor arises from without,\nrelying upon others to succeed,\nits seeking is endless,\nthus it is lowly.\nGaining it is like an alarm,\nlosing it is like an alarm—\nthis is called *\"favor and disgrace like a sudden alarm.\"*\nThis arises from the heart—\nit is clear.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"great calamity and great virtue are like the body\"*?\nMy reason for having great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nwhat great calamity do I have?\nThe body is where all affairs cluster.\nKnowing where they cluster,\none should not rely upon having it,\nnot relying upon having it,\nthus the Dao becomes the profound utility of the body.\nHence, to value the body as all under Heaven,\nas if one could entrust all under Heaven to it;\nto love the body as all under Heaven,\nas if one could commit all under Heaven to it.\nRelying upon favor and having oneself for all under Heaven,\nthis is not the key of entrusting all under Heaven.\nRelying upon love and having oneself for all under Heaven,\nthis is not the key of committing all under Heaven.\nThus, one does not magnify one’s own favor,\none does not heap up one’s own love—\nbecause one cannot sustain it long or make it last.\nHence it is said: *\"As if one could entrust, as if one could commit.\"*\nThis speaks of the meaning that one cannot truly entrust or commit.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n\n「To look upon it yet not see, it is called *Qi* (夷);\nto listen to it yet not hear, it is called *Xi* (希);\nto grasp it yet not obtain, it is called *Wei* (微).\nAll are forced names given to it.\nBecause it is the form of the formless,\nthe image of the imageless.\n\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nso they merge into one.\nTo look upon it yet not see its shape,\nto listen yet not hear its sound,\nto grasp yet not obtain its substance—\nits essence is undivided,\nits meaning cannot be separated,\nso it is said: *they merge into one.*\n\nIts uppermost is not luminous (皦),\nits lowermost is not obscure (昧).\nIt is boundless yet cannot be named,\nreturning to the realm of the formless.\n\n*Luminous* refers to clarity,\n*obscure* refers to concealment.\nNot luminous means the Dao acts within oneself,\nyet one does not reveal its workings.\nNot obscure means the Dao extends to things,\nyet one does not hide its principles.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless,\nthe image of the imageless—\nthis is called *huǎnghuǎng* (惚恍).\n*Huǎnghuǎng* cannot be definitively named;\nhow does it differ from *Qi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*?\n\nTo face it, one does not see its head;\nto follow it, one does not see its tail.\nIt cannot be summoned or questioned,\nso it appears thus.\n\nSeizing the Dao of antiquity to govern the present,\nthe Dao of antiquity is what was recorded above.\nThe Dao is singular, without past or future;\nthough the present differs from the past,\nhow could one abandon the Dao of antiquity?\n\nTo know the origin of antiquity is called *Dao Ji* (道紀).\nTo know the root of things in harmony with the Dao—\nthis has been so since antiquity.\n*Ji* (紀) is the application of principle.\nTo know its ancient origin and grasp its natural essence—\nthis is the subtlety of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThe skilled practitioners of antiquity,\nsubtle and profound in their understanding,\npenetrated what could not be perceived.\nThey held fast to the Dao and embraced unity,\nnot known by the common people,\nso they were subtle and profound in their understanding,\nand could not be easily recognized.\n\nOnly because they could not be recognized,\ndid they forcefully make themselves known:\nThey displayed teachings and demonstrated faith,\nlest those who came later could not learn from them.\n*Yu* (豫) is like crossing a river in winter—\nwinter waters are still and without surging currents#1,\nso one is content and proceeds with ease,\nthe heart at peace and the journey smooth.\nIt is as if fearing the four neighbors—\n*Yu* (犹), speaking of...」\n\n**Chapter Fifteen (continued)**\nWhen words are spoken as if fearing the four neighbors,\nthen left, right, front, and back all submit to the Dao.\nThe four neighbors are close at hand—\nwhat is said must surely be heard,\nso it is as if in fear.\n\n**Standing** as if a guest,\nrevering the Dao’s application.\n\n**Dissolving** as if ice about to release—\n*Jiang* (将), great.\nThe Dao’s application is not stingy,\nits fulfillment is certain—\nthus it dissolves and permeates all things,\nlike ice’s great release.\n\n**Solemn** as if uncarved wood—\nwood is pure and undispersed in its original state.\n*Solemn* means thick—\nthick and not shallow,\nso it is like uncarved wood.\n\n**Vast** as if a valley—\n*Vast* means emptiness.\nA valley is deep and capacious.\n\n**Mixed** as if turbid.\nNot distinguishing ability or incapacity, good or evil—\nlike water yet to be clear.\n\nWho can make turbid water clear by stillness?\nWho can make lasting peace move by enduring?\nTurbidity cannot endure—\nstill it, and the turbid settles while clarity arises.\nPeace cannot be pushed to its limit—\nendure it long enough, and motion must come,\nand motion brings forth myriad affairs.\nAll are the natural order.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.\n*Fullness* is a metaphor for excess.\nExcess in willfulness defiles the Dao,\nso one must not be full.\n\nOnly by not being full\ncan one avoid decay while remaining whole.\nThe ancients practiced the Dao—\ntheir decay never took root.\nIf the present age could emulate them,\nwould there ever be new decay?\nOnly fear that their adherence to the Dao was incomplete.\n\nThose who wish to avoid decay\nmust simply refrain from self-indulgence.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nBring emptiness to its utmost,\nguard stillness with sincerity.\n*Bring* means to attain.\n*Sincerity* means depth.\nEmptiness is the root of the Dao.\nIf emptiness is pushed to its limit,\nfearing it may become shallow,\none must guard it with profound stillness—\nthis is the subtle essence of cultivating the Dao.\n\nWhen all things arise together,\nI observe their return.\nThings reach their limit and return—\nreturn is born of stillness,\nso one can observe all things returning to their origin.\n\nThough myriad things exist,\nhow could they depart from my Dao?\nAll things, diverse and unharmonized,\neach return to their root.\n*Root* means origin.\nThose who return to their root to its utmost\nare all as such.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness—\nthe origin is naturally pure and still,\nyet things shift with their transformations.\nReturning to the origin is constancy—\nconstancy is what is naturally assigned.\nReturning to constancy is clarity—\nclarity perceives the Dao’s application,\nthe head of all principles.\nIgnorance of constancy leads to reckless action and calamity—\nhow could it not be calamity if one acts against the natural order and disrupts the Dao’s subtlety?\n\nKnowing constancy brings tolerance—\nresting in the original principle,\nno longer competing,\nwhat is there that cannot be tolerated?\nTolerance is universality—\nuniversality does not disrupt the natural order,\nnor does it favor private desires,\nso it can tolerate all.\n\nUniversality is sovereignty—\nsovereignty is exalted and vast,\ngoverning the world as the Dao dictates.\n\nSovereignty is Heaven—\nacting before Heaven, Heaven does not resist;\nacting after Heaven, one follows Heaven’s timing—\nonly sovereignty can achieve this.\n\nHeaven is the Dao—\nharmonizing with Heaven,\nthe Dao is complete in action and stillness.\n\nThe Dao is enduring—\nthe Dao’s application knows no end.\n\nDeath does not harm it—\nfor those who practice it within themselves,\nthough the body may perish, the Dao never fails.\nThe body abides in the Dao—\ndeath does not destroy it,\nso it is said to be unharmed.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nThe most exalted Dao:\nthe common people know it exists.\nThis is the time of pure harmony and non-action—\nthe wise follow the transformations of all things.\nThose who know it below\neach rectify their nature and destiny,\nthe myriad things flow in their forms,\nrectifying falsehood and enforcing order—\nthus it is said: the common people know it exists.\n\nThe next level:\nthey are cherished and praised.\nThis is the time when emotions and desires arise—\nwithout teaching and transformation, chaos would follow,\nso they cherish others to make them submit,\nand praise them to make them follow.\n\nThe next level:\nthey are feared and reviled.\nThis is the time when laws and decrees are enforced—\nthere is fear in those below,\nand revilement in those above.\nThose who fear avoid punishment,\nthose who revile lose their rectitude—\nwithout executions, they cannot be unified.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\nOnce falsehood and deceit arise,\neach harbors love and hatred,\ntrust cannot be sufficient,\nso distrust follows.\n\nEven more so with those who value speech—\nthe ignorant speak, the wise remain silent.\nThose who lack trust\nare those who prattle endlessly.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe common people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\nDeeds accomplished mean all things follow their nature.\nAffairs fulfilled mean all things attain their proper order.\nThis is the result of the subtle and profound Dao’s work,\nso it is said: the common people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nthere arises benevolence and righteousness;\nwhen wisdom emerges,\nthere arises great deceit;\nwhen familial bonds are fractured,\nthere arises filial piety and kindness;\nwhen the state is in chaos,\nthere arise loyal ministers.\n\nThis is the time when emotions and desires vie,\nwhen right and wrong are confused.\nBenevolence, righteousness, wisdom, filial piety, kindness, and loyal ministers—\nthese are forced names,\nall arising from falsehood and deceit.\nOnce falsehood takes root,\nit cannot help but be so—\nthus the Sage preserves truth and nurtures simplicity,\nusing stillness to settle it,\nreturning to purity and returning to simplicity,\nto rescue those in the world who have strayed from the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nAbandon the Sage, discard wisdom—\nthe people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n*Abandon* means to not use.\nA hundredfold benefit means the result of knowing sufficiency.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nAbandon cleverness, discard profit—\nthieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThese three are insufficient as mere names,\nso they are assigned to their proper categories.\nIf one only speaks of abandoning the Sage and wisdom,\nabandoning benevolence and righteousness,\nabandoning cleverness and profit,\nthen the meaning is incomplete and the expression insufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nineteen (continued)**\nThese three—*abandoning* to bring a hundredfold benefit to the people, *abandoning* to restore filial piety and kindness, and *abandoning* to eliminate thieves and robbers—are the essential matters.\nIf one *abandons* these three, yet still clings to the other three,\nthen the meaning is clear and the Dao is preserved.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\n*Abandon* learning, and there will be no worries.\nWhat the common folk know is enough to fulfill their desires and pleasures.\nThose who do not know, look up to it and strive to learn.\nThus, when their desires cannot be satisfied, their worries grow manifold.\nTo *abandon* learning and take no action,\nthen one can preserve the Dao in its entirety.\nWhat is the difference between *unconditional acceptance* (wú) and *non-action* (ā)?\nHow far apart are *good* and *evil*?\nLearning leads to endless striving for action,\nwhile *abandoning* learning brings clarity and self-sufficiency—\nthus, it is better not to learn at all.\n\nHence, *unconditional acceptance* and *non-action*,\n*good* and *evil*,\nall return to the same origin.\nThose who force distinctions between them are mistaken.\n*Unconditional acceptance* and *non-action*—\nis this not the perfect analogy?\n\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nWhat they fear is *worry*.\n*Worry* depletes the natural purity of Heaven,\nso one must not fail to fear *worry*.\n\nUnending is its wildness!\n*Wildness* means untamed—\nuntamed is the state of not yet exhausting its principles,\nnot yet reaching its Dao—\nthis is why it is lamented.\n\nThe crowd bustles joyfully,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,\nas if ascending to the Spring Platform.\nThis is the extreme result of learning to fulfill their desires and pleasures.\n\nYet I alone stand in dread—\nits signs have not yet appeared—\nlike an infant before it is weaned.\nIn fear of *worry* yet doing nothing,\nlike the time before knowledge and desire have sprouted.\nAn infant has no knowledge, no desires;\nonce weaned, its emotions and desires begin to form—\nhence the analogy of *before weaning*.\n\nSteadfast and deep,\nas if having nowhere to return to.\n*Steadfast and deep*—a thick, weighty appearance.\nTo uphold truth and embrace simplicity,\nfull yet never overflowing—\nis this not the very essence of *steadfast and deep*?\n\nAs if having nowhere to return to—\na state the crowd cannot comprehend.\nThe crowd all have excess,\nwhile I alone seem abandoned.\n*Excess*—those who are already full and overflowing.\nRelying on learning brings this state,\nwhile *abandonment* always feels insufficient—\nthe preciousness of the Dao lies here.\n\nMy heart is that of a great fool—\npure and unadulterated.\nThe greatest fool is not foolish,\nfor his heart is utterly pure—\nthus, it is called pure and unadulterated.\n\nThe common folk are bright and discerning,\nself-illuminated.\n\nI alone am dim and murky—\nconcealing my brilliance.\n\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nrelying on their own cleverness,\nvaluing neither forgiveness nor tolerance.\nI alone am stifled and stilled—\nno need to employ my cleverness or wisdom.\n\nSudden as if obscured,\nsilent—seeming to have no end.\n*\"Sudden as if\"*—this is what cannot be fixed or sought.\nBecause it cannot be fixed or sought,\nit seems to have no end.\n\nThe crowd all have their uses—\n*\"uses\"* meaning they rely on learning,\nnever failing to seek its application.\nI alone seem stubborn and vulgar—\nconcealing my use within,\nno one easily knows it.\nExternally, I appear incapable,\nthus seeming stubborn and vulgar.\n\nI alone differ from others—\nfor I do not follow the crowd’s learning.\nYet I cherish *seeking nourishment from the Mother*.\n*\"Seeking nourishment\"* means filling the belly.\n*\"From the Mother\"* means drawing the Way of *virtue’s* origin.\n\n**Chapter Twenty:**\nThe bearing of *Great Virtue*—\nonly the Dao is followed.\n*Great Virtue*—the highest virtue.\n*\"Bearing\"* means encompassing all without exclusion.\n*\"Followed\"* means reaching the utmost of non-resistance.\nThe virtue’s embrace never departs from the Dao—\nthis is not what lesser virtue can achieve.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nonly vague and hazy.\n*\"Vague and hazy\"*—this is what cannot be fixed in name.\nHazy and vague—\nwithin it are *forms*;\nvague and hazy—\nwithin it are *things*.\nProfound and dark—\nwithin it is *essence*.\nThis is the Dao’s most subtle mystery—\nonly those of *Great Virtue* can know it.\n*\"Forms,\" \"things,\" essence*—\nthough they seem to take shape,\nthey cannot be fixed in name.\nIts essence is supremely true—\nwithin it is *truthfulness*.\nBecause its subtlety is genuine and unerring,\nit can command belief from others.\nThus, it is said that only the Dao is followed—\nthe ultimate in truthfulness.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name never fades—\nnot an ordinary name,\nso from ancient times to now,\nit is both named and unnamed,\nto observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n*\"Observe\"*—to examine as if inspecting objects before one.\n*\"All things\"*—beauty.\nWhen things align with the Dao,\nlife and death, openness and closure—\nnone fail to reach their full beauty.\nThose who govern all beauty\ndo so with the bearing of *Great Virtue*—\nthus it is.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two:**\nBent, yet whole;\ncrooked, yet straight;\nhollow, yet full;\nworn, yet renewed;\nfew, yet sufficient;\nmany, yet confused.\nThus, the Sage holds *Oneness* for all under Heaven—\n*Oneness*—neither excessive nor chaotic,\ncapable of bending and wholeness,\ncapable of crookedness and straightness,\ncapable of hollowness and fullness,\ncapable of wear and renewal,\ncapable of fewness and sufficiency,\ncapable of many and confusion.\nThe small is the beginning of the great,\nthe obscure is the flaw of the bright—\nthis is the natural order.\nThus, the Sage holds *Oneness* in numbers,\nthen expands into *forms*,\nthen contains without self-satisfaction,\nanticipating what has not yet emerged.\nIf all under Heaven take this as their model,\nthen all will align with the Dao.\n\nNot self-illuminating, hence enlightened;\nnot self-righteous, hence manifest;\nnot self-praising, hence effective;\nnot self-glorifying, hence enduring.\nThis is the model of holding *Oneness*.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain.\"*\nOnly those who do not contend\ncan the world not contend with.\nCases like *\"whole through bending, straight through crookedness\"*\nare clear proofs of non-contention.\nThe world’s common folk do not know the great essentials of giving and taking,\nso none can contend with them.\nWas the ancient saying *\"bent, yet whole\"* mere empty talk?\nTruly whole and returned to—\nthis is the utmost in trustworthiness.\nBent does not remain bent,\nwhole does not remain whole—\nfollowing bent brings wholeness,\nonly the Dao’s subtlety can do this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three:**\nSparse speech is natural.\nWhen teachings are proclaimed,\na single word awakens understanding—\nnaturally aligning with the Dao.\nWhy use endless chatter?\nThus, speech is made sparse.\nThough speech is sparse, its meaning is clear—\nhow else but natural?\nGales do not last the morning,\ntorrent rains do not last the day.\nWho causes this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—\nhow much less can mortals?\nGales and torrents illustrate the point.\nSudden and violent—\nwhen people know the wind and rain arrive,\nwhy must they last all morning or day?\nSpeech reveals the Dao—\nlogic follows beneath the words;\nseek, and you will find—\nwhy multiply speech?\nThus, those who follow the Dao—\nthose aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao,\nthose aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue,\nthose lost are aligned with loss.\nWhen speaking of the Dao,\nthose who believe in the Dao align with it.\nWhen speaking of virtue,\nthose who believe in virtue align with it.\nWhen speaking of loss,\nthose who are lost align with it.\nThis too is natural.\nAligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;\naligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;\naligned with loss, loss is obtained.\nTheir words do not differ.\nLacking sincerity, there is no trust.\nSpeech is disordered and lacks principle,\nso people do not believe it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four:**\nThe lame cannot stand,\nthe straddling cannot walk.\nExtreme force cannot coexist—\nthus, the seated cannot stand,\nthe straddling cannot walk.\n\nThose who self-illuminate are not enlightened,\nthose who self-righteous are not manifest,\nthose who self-praise have no merit,\nthose who self-glorify do not endure.\nThis too cannot coexist.\n\nJade in the mountains makes wood moist,\ndeep waters birth pearls while shores remain dry—\nlike not self-illuminating yet enlightened,\nnot self-righteous yet manifest,\nnot self-praising yet meritorious,\nnot self-glorifying yet enduring.\n\nRegarding the Dao, it says: *\"excess food, superfluous actions.\"*\nThings may hate it,\nso those with the Dao do not dwell there.\n*\"Excess food, superfluous actions\"*—\nbecause they cannot endure.\nThis is the analogy for self-illumination, self-righteousness,\nself-praise, and self-glorification.\n*\"Things\"*—a general term.\nIf things hate it, how much more those with the Dao?\nThus, it is said: *\"Those with the Dao do not dwell.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five:**\nThere exists a *thing*—\nmixed and complete,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six:**\nMixed and complete—\nthis is the analogy of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Dao has no fixed form,\nyet Heaven and Earth take shape,\nborn from the Dao,\nso its precedence before Heaven and Earth is manifest.\n\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet never alters,\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nit may be called the Mother of all things.\n\nIn the time of Mixed Completion,\nthe Mother is taken to mean the origin of all things.\n\nI do not know its name;\nI call it Dao.\nForcibly naming it, I say: Great.\n\nBecause it has no substantial form,\na fixed name cannot be given—\nthus, I say I do not know its name,\nbut call it Dao.\n\nGreat—\nbecause it encompasses all without exclusion,\nthus it is called Great.\n\nGreat is called *passing* (*shì*).\n*Passing*—meaning to move onward.\nWhen it is Great, its movement is not confined to one place—\nthus it is called *passing*.\n\n*Passing* is called *far*.\nWhere it moves, its influence extends—\nthus it is called *far*.\n\n*Far* is called *returning*.\nFar must reach its limit,\nand when far reaches its limit, it returns.\nExhausting all transformations of things,\nit returns to its original purity—\nthus it is called *returning*.\n\nThus, the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sage also is Great.\n\nThe Dao precedes Heaven and Earth in existence—\nthus, it is first called Great.\n\nHeaven is light and pure above,\nheavy and turbid below,\nborn from the undifferentiated—\nthus, it is next called Great, and Earth is called Great.\n\nThe Sage follows the harmony of the Dao’s essence,\nreveres the generative transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nand his Greatness equals that of Heaven and Earth—\nthus, it is said the Sage also is Great.\n\nHumans model themselves after Earth,\nEarth models itself after Heaven,\nHeaven models itself after the Dao,\nThe Dao models itself after Naturalness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven:**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness,\nstillness is the sovereign of agitation.\n\nHeaviness means not moving recklessly—\nmovement gives rise to lightness.\nStillness means harmonizing with the Dao in quietude—\nabandoning stillness gives rise to agitation.\n\nThus, the Dao is fundamentally *wuwei*,\naligned with heaviness and stillness.\n\nOnly lightness and agitation\nlie dormant, awaiting their time.\n\nRoot and sovereign—\nthese are the sources of their emergence.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous person walks all day\nwithout straying from his baggage train.\nThis illustrates that which he holds dear remains constant.\n\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhe dwells in serene detachment—\nthis illustrates that his stillness finds its proper place.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nmake his body lighter than the world?\n\nThe ruler governs the vast realm—\nhe must uphold what is heavy,\ndwell in what is still,\nto subdue the light and restless,\nto suppress the reckless and agitated.\nHe must not, through the indulgence of desire,\nor the greed of the body,\nlightly move and forget the Dao of governing the world—\nthus, it is said to admonish him clearly.\n\nLightness leads to the loss of ministers,\nagitation leads to the loss of sovereignty.\n\nLightness means the Dao’s teachings are not profound—\na failure of subtlety.\nAgitation means governance is not thorough—\na failure of vastness.\n\nThus, the Way of serving above\nand the virtue of ruling below\ncannot be preserved.\n\nThe virtuous act leaves no trace,\nits work done inwardly within the heart,\nno outward display of deeds—\nlike tracks in the dust, none can seek\nthe essence of this virtue.\n\nThe virtuous speech bears no flaws,\nits teachings endure, listeners preserved whole—\nno blemish arises, and harmony extends\na thousand miles away—\nthis is the essence of virtuous speech.\n\nThe virtuous plan requires no calculations,\ngain and loss follow events,\nsuccess and failure rest in the mind—\nexcessive scheming profits no wisdom—\nthis is the essence of virtuous planning.\n\nThe virtuous closure needs no bolt or bar,\nfor bolts and bars are tools to open and shut—\nwithout them, nothing can be undone.\nLike silent action within the heart,\nwords unsaid—\nto spy upon its work or fathom its logic\nis utterly impossible.\n\nThe virtuous binding needs no rope or knot,\nyet cannot be undone.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Water flows and moistens, fire seeks and dries.\"*\nThis is the ultimate of virtuous binding.\n\nThus, the Sage always acts to save others,\nand so none are abandoned;\nalways acts to save things,\nand so none are discarded.\nTo save others in the heart\ndoes not distinguish between the wise and foolish;\nto save things in the heart\ndoes not distinguish between the beautiful and ugly—\nthis is the essence of the Sage’s constant virtue.\n\nThis is called **Clad in Clarity**.\nClarity sees all things and principles without omission.\nVirtuous action, virtuous speech, virtuous planning,\nvirtuous closure, virtuous binding—\nall belong to the enlightened.\n\nTracks, flaws, calculations, bolts and bars, ropes and knots—\nthese are the crutches of the dim-witted.\n\n**Clad in Clarity** means nothing is forgotten in the heart.\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\n*Resources*—that which is taken.\nThe good person is worthy of emulation, hence called *teacher*.\nThe unvirtuous serve as mirrors for sincerity—\nthe good also draw from them, hence called *resources*.\n\nTo not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources—\nhonoring means embracing their virtue,\ncherishing means delighting in their flaws—\nthis is not the Dao’s seed.\n\nEven if one knows the great confusion,\nthis is called the **Essence of the Mysterious**.\nTo not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources,\nto recognize inwardly while outwardly forgetting their traces—\nthe common folk see this as confusion, unaware,\nyet this is the Essence of the Mysterious.\n\nThus it is said:\nThough one knows the great confusion,\nthis is called the Essence of the Mysterious.\n\n---\n\nTo know the masculine and hold to the feminine,\nis to become the valley of the world.\nTo become the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue does not stray—\nreturning to the infant.\nAll love to be masculine,\nyet masculinity brings fullness and invites harm.\nThe Sage knows masculinity cannot be loved,\nthus holds to the feminine—\nwith its yielding yet encompassing,\ncompeting with nothing.\nThe analogy to the valley\nlies in its boundless capacity.\nYet constant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to simplicity, preserving purity—\nreverting to the infant’s uncarved, harmonious, effortless state.\n\nTo know the white and hold to the black,\nis to become the model of the world.\nTo become the model of the world,\nconstant virtue does not err—\nreturning to the boundless.\nTo know the honored and hold to the dishonored,\nis to become the valley of the world.\nTo become the valley of the world,\nconstant virtue is then complete—\nreturning to the uncarved.\n\nWhite and black take form,\nthus it is called *model*.\nHonor and dishonor are without substance,\nthus it is called *valley*.\nLaw must have limits,\nthough it never strays—\nyet it cannot reach exhaustion,\nfor holding to black allows for transformation—\nthus it returns to the boundless.\nThe valley, though empty, can contain—\nyet containing risks depletion,\nso constant virtue is complete.\nThe uncarved is the time before the Dao scatters—\nthus, in discussing masculine and feminine, we speak of the infant;\nin discussing white and black, of the boundless;\nin discussing honor and dishonor, of the uncarved—\nall return to the origin, never straying from the Dao.\n\nWhen the uncarved scatters, it becomes vessels.\nThe Sage uses it,\nand it becomes officials and leaders.\nWhen the uncarved scatters into vessels,\nit is the utmost of utility and form.\nOfficials and leaders are the rulers of these vessels.\nThus, great measures are not cut—\ngathering vessels of great and small,\nassigning talents of long and short—\nwhen used properly, they unite;\nwhen overused, they separate—\nall this follows the natural way.\nHow could the Sage forcibly cut them with strength?\n\n---\n\nWhen one seeks to take the world and do so,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Proclaim your wisdom, act as the first sovereign,\nthe first sovereign acts as parent to the people.\"*\nIs this inevitable?\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nit cannot be made.\nSpeaking of the divine vessel means its uses cannot be measured.\nTo make it is to diminish it.\nIf the Dao is narrow and wisdom exhausted,\nit is unfit for the divine vessel—\nthus it cannot be made.\nThe maker ruins it, the grasper loses it.\nRuination and loss arise from making and grasping.\nThus things sometimes move, sometimes follow,\nsometimes cling, sometimes blow—\nsometimes strong, sometimes weak,\nsometimes elevated, sometimes collapsed.\nEach follows its nature,\ncontent in its allotted place—\nthis is how the effortless and ungrasped unfold.\n\nThus the Sage avoids excess,\navoids extravagance,\navoids extravagance.\nThis refers to transgressing the proper measure.\nHow so?\nBecause of making and grasping,\nnot knowing the essence.\n\n「Chapter 30: When the Dao assists the ruler,\nit does not rely on arms to subdue the world,\nand its affairs tend to return naturally.\n*Assist* means to aid and support.\nTo aid and support the ruler in governing the world,\none must not rely on arms for coercion.\n\nIn ancient times, the Miao people defied the commands of Great Yu,\ndancing with feathered weapons on both steps,\nuntil after seven decades, the Miao were subdued—\nthis was the case of not relying on arms for coercion.\n\n*Return* means to revert.\nThough arms may slay and harm,\nwhen they do not align with righteousness,\nhuman emotions and *qi* will vie for dominance,\nso that vengeance lurks in the shadows,\nand grudges fester in the interstices,\nday after day, month after month,\nnever ceasing, this is the clear proof of affairs returning naturally.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nthorns and punishments arise.\nAfter a great army,\nthere will surely be years of calamity.\nThis illustrates the grave harm of relying on arms for coercion.\n\nThus the virtuous one acts decisively,\nbut does not dare to take strength in it.\nAct decisively without boasting,\nact decisively without arrogance,\nact decisively without presumption.\n\n*Virtuous* refers to one who virtuously aids the ruler.\n*Decisive* means boldness, triumph, resolution, and mastery.\nTo act decisively is to act with boldness.\nWhat is decisive?\nIt is not boasting, not arrogance, not presumption.\nWhen decisive action is unavoidable,\nthis is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.\n\nThough one may boast without arrogance,\nwithout arrogance, without presumption,\nyet the enemy is strong and has lost the Dao even more,\nthen arms and warfare must be employed to restore order—\nthis is the unavoidable use of them.\n\nThough victory is won through arms,\none does not take pride in it,\nfor when softness nurtures and strength grows old,\nit is the way to welcome distant guests with grace—\nthis is called *not* the Dao,\nand *not* the Dao means ruin is near.\nThis elaborates the principle of the Dao’s virtue.\n\nStrength grows old when it cannot be further enhanced,\nthus it is said to be old.\nWhen old, it fails to generate,\nthus it is said to be *not* the Dao.\nWhen the Dao is lost, things have no foundation,\nthus it is said to be ruined.\n*Ruined* means cessation.\nWhen things lack adaptability and change,\nand come to a halt,\nthen decay and ruin follow,\nwhich is not the Dao’s wondrous application.\n\n**Chapter 31:**\nA great army is an ill-omened instrument.\n*Great* means vast.\n*Ill-omened* means inauspicious.\nBecause it is vast yet inauspicious,\nthose who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\nA gentleman values the left in peace,\nbut values the right in war.\nThe left represents *yang*,\nthe right represents *yin*.\n*Yin* is not the proper use of the Dao.\n\nArms are an ill-omened instrument,\nnot the instrument of a gentleman.\nEmphasizing this again,\nit clarifies that arms are truly ill-omened,\nand cannot be the instrument of a gentleman.\n\nWhen arms must be used unavoidably,\none should do so with calm equanimity—\nthis is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.\n\nVictory without delight,\nyet those who delight in it—\nthese are those who take pleasure in killing.\nArms must necessarily kill,\nwhich is not a delightful matter.\nTo delight in it is to defy the virtue of cherishing life,\nand to flaunt the traces of cruelty—\nit is clear that arms are not the instrument of a gentleman.\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\ncannot achieve their ambitions in the world.\nHe who harms others,\nothers will surely harm him,\nand his affairs will return naturally—\nthus he cannot achieve his ambitions in the world.\n\nIn auspicious matters, the left is honored;\nin inauspicious matters, the right is honored.\nThe left general is stationed on the left,\nthe right general on the right—\nthis is to treat them with funeral rites.\nWhen many are killed,\none laments and weeps with sorrow,\nand victory is marked with funeral rites.\nThis means one should not seek inauspiciousness to gain auspiciousness.\n\nTo seek inauspiciousness is to follow sorrow and lamentation,\nwhich is not what human nature delights in.\nNow repeating this,\nit clarifies that arms cannot be depended upon,\nand that this principle is inevitable.\n\n**Chapter 32:**\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nNames cannot be fixed,\nso it is the nameless Dao.\nIt flows in transformation,\nadapting to myriad uses,\nnever confined to one form—\nthus it is called nameless.\n\nThough simplicity is small,\nthe world does not dare to submit to it.\n*Simplicity* refers to the Dao before its dispersion.\nBefore dispersion, its form is unfathomable,\nso it can be described as small.\nWhen it transforms and reaches all things,\nvast and boundless, leaving none untouched—\nthus the world does not dare to submit to it.\n*Submit* is used to illustrate the meaning of humility.\n\nIf lords and kings could preserve simplicity,\nall things would naturally come to honor them.\nIf they preserve the Dao in its simplicity,\npure and unadulterated,\nall things will submit to its transformation,\nlike the Dao’s wondrous workings.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\nThis is the utmost harmony.\nSweet dew speaks of the harmony reaching down to all things.\nNo one commands it,\nnot because human strength can compel it.\nWhen it is evenly distributed,\nit nourishes all things without bias or partiality.\n\nAt first, there were names established;\nnames were already established.\nOnce Heaven and Earth were divided,\nnames came into being from that division—\nthere must be a beginning.\nThe proliferation of life,\nhow could it be without names to speak of?\n\nKnowing when to stop is also knowing.\nKnowing when to stop is the way to avoid peril.\nWhen things are many and names are numerous,\nit lies in knowing when to stop to govern them.\nNot knowing when to stop,\nthings will be exhausted and blocked—\nthus the danger of ruin arises.\n\nCompare the Dao’s presence in the world\nto rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.\nRivers and valleys contain the sea,\nand nourish all things,\nwithout leaving the slightest trace unfulfilled—\nthus they are taken as an analogy.\n\n**Chapter 33:**\nHe who knows others is wise,\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who overcomes others has strength,\nhe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nWisdom and strength\nare actions external to oneself.\nEnlightenment and power\nare actions internal to oneself.\nEnlightenment means self-examination without oversight,\npower means advancing the Dao with steady progress.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nGaining one without seeking two,\ncontentment lies in the heart—\nthis is how true wealth lies not in abundance.\n\nHe who acts with power has resolve.\nResolve lies in the heart;\nacting with power in the great Dao also lies within—\nwhat else is enlightenment?\n\nHe who does not lose his place endures.\nGaining his place means he is at ease in the Dao,\nand at ease in the Dao means he can endure.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\nDeath cannot be avoided;\nwhen form and *qi* are exhausted,\nthis is the common fate of all living beings.\nYet he who does not perish\nis one who, through self-knowledge and self-mastery,\nknows contentment and acts with power,\nwithout losing his place—\nthis is the true meaning of longevity,\nnot to be compared with the mere hundred years of ordinary people.»\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 34**\nThe great Dao flows freely,\nand yet it can be turned to the left or right.\nIf a person can broaden the Dao,\nthe Dao will not depart from him.\nTake it, and it comes;\nact with it, and it succeeds.\nIt does not go against principle,\nand thus it is said that it can be turned to the left or right.\n\nAll things depend on it for life yet it does not refuse—\nit does not claim its own power to give life.\nWhen the work is done, it takes no name—\nit does not boast of its own achievements.\nIt nourishes all things yet does not lord over them—\nall things are born of the Dao; it does not claim dominion.\nIts bestowal is vast indeed.\n\nEver without desire, it may be called *small*.\nWithout desire, one beholds the subtlety—\nthis is the Dao’s threshold.\nThough it may be called *small*, its simplicity is complete.\n\nAll things return to it yet it does not claim them—\nthis is the true meaning of *great*.\nAll things return to its grace,\nyet it does not serve its own deeds.\nVacant yet effective, none can fathom it,\nand thus it may be called *great*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 35**\nSeize the great image of the great image,\nand all under heaven will come.\nThe great Dao’s image.\nSeize it, and its course will be fulfilled—\nnot to cling stubbornly, but to embody it.\nAll under heaven follows it,\nneither opposing nor contradicting.\nGo forth without harm,\nand peace and ease prevail.\nFollowing its image,\nconforming to its transformation,\none thus attains peace and ease,\nfree from peril, ruin, or calamity.\n\nDelight and bait—\ntravelers stop.\nDelight and bait are metaphors;\nthings universally desired.\nThough travelers stop,\none cannot long remain in their light.\nWhen the Dao is spoken of,\nits flavor is bland and without taste.\nTo speak of it in detail,\none must first purify and refine—\nthus its flavor cannot be sought in the bland.\n\nSee it, yet it is unseen;\nhear it, yet it is unheard;\nuse it, yet it cannot be exhausted.\nThe Dao is not a constant Dao,\nits name is not a constant name—\nthus those with keen eyes and sharp ears\ncannot apply their talents to it.\nIts use lies in the heart,\nits transformation reaches all things,\nand with the Dao silently in motion,\nhow could there ever be an end?\nAnd thus it is said that its use cannot be exhausted.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 36**\nWhen one would gather it,\none must first let it expand.\nWhen one would weaken it,\none must first let it grow strong.\nWhen one would ruin it,\none must first let it flourish.\nWhen one would take it away,\none must first give it.\nThis is called *subtle enlightenment*.\n\nWhen expansion reaches its limit,\nit must contract.\nWhen strength reaches its limit,\nit must weaken.\nWhen flourishing reaches its limit,\nit must decline.\nWhen giving reaches its limit,\nit must take away—\nall are the natural course of things.\n\nThe sage perceives before it happens,\nknows before it arises,\nand follows the light of enlightenment—\nand thus it is said that this is *subtle enlightenment*.\n\nIn subtle and wondrous enlightenment,\nthere is nothing hidden that cannot be seen.\nThe views of ordinary people are hard to match.\n\nThe soft overcomes the strong.\nThe ancients said:\nThe thunder of Tai Mountain splits stone,\nthe water of the deep reaches the sky.\nThis too is the natural course of things.\n\nA fish cannot be lifted from the depths,\nnor can the state’s sharpest tools be shown to the people.\nMetaphors.\nA fish cannot be lifted from the depths—\njust as a person cannot depart from the Dao.\nOne.\n\nSharp tools are made with the Dao.\nOrdinary people crave completed works,\nyet their shallow understanding cannot be revealed to the masses.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 37**\nThe Dao ever acts without action,\nyet nothing is left undone.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\nAll things transform of their own accord—\nthus nothing is left undone,\nnot because the Dao itself acts.\n\nLords and kings are those who govern all under heaven.\nIf they align with the Dao,\nall things will follow their true nature and life,\nobeying without resistance.\n\nIf they transform yet wish to act,\nI shall restrain them with the nameless simplicity.\n*Jiang* means \"great.\"\nTo desire without bound,\nto generate from love and hatred—\nif not restrained, they will reverse and fall into chaos.\nSimplicity is the undisturbed source of purity and unity.\nThe higher their desires,\nthe greater the need for restraint—\nthis is the essence of restraint.\n\nThe nameless simplicity also desires not.\nThe nameless simplicity is the desirelessness itself.\nDesirelessness in stillness—\nall under heaven will then self-correct.\nNot losing the original purity and stillness,\nthen no filth or evil can affect all things.\n\n---\n\n「Chapter 38: The virtue/power of the superior is not virtue/power itself,\nthus it truly has virtue/power.\nThe virtue/power of the inferior does not lose its virtue/power,\nthus it truly lacks virtue/power.\n\nThe one without virtue/power refers to not boasting of his virtue/power,\nso the people look up to his virtue/power and follow him.\nThe one who does not lose virtue/power refers to boasting of his virtue/power,\nthus risking its loss.\nIf one fears losing it, he will go to any lengths,\nso the people observe his actions and despise him.\nHow then can he still speak of virtue/power?\n\n*The Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"You alone do not boast,\nso none under heaven can contest your ability.\nYou alone do not claim,\nso none under heaven can dispute your merit.\"*\n\nThe virtue/power of the superior acts without doing,\nyet nothing is left undone.\nSilently nurturing the primal transformation,\nit is contained within the heart.\nThings follow their natural course,\nwithout need of self-assertion,\nyet its brilliance is manifest in all.\nThis is the one who does nothing yet achieves all.\n\nThe virtue/power of the inferior acts with doing,\nyet nothing is truly accomplished.\nBecause it does not lose its virtue/power,\nits actions become burdensome.\nThus, the Dao/Way grows distant,\nand wisdom is obscured.\n\nThe benevolence of the superior acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe righteousness of the superior acts yet has something left undone.\n\nBenevolence means cherishing life and abhorring killing—\nits application extends to all things,\nthus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.\nNot boasting nor presuming over things,\nits traces are unseen by all,\nthus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.\n\nRighteousness means judging, taking, or giving as appropriate—\nits application to things is said to act yet leave something undone.\n\nThe superior ritual acts yet finds no response,\nso it forces compliance with repeated insistence.\n*Reng* means \"repeated,\" \"frequent.\"\n\nRitual governs people,\nmaking them submit to its order.\nWhat aligns with ritual is right,\nwhat does not is wrong.\nRight and wrong must be contested,\nand if it does not conform to external teaching,\nonly coercion can enforce it,\nthus it is said to force compliance with repeated insistence.\n\nRepetition leads to inconsistency,\nfrequency leads to carelessness—\nto compel them to follow ritual,\none loses the natural Dao/Way.\n\nThus, one loses the Dao/Way and then virtue/power,\nloses virtue/power and then benevolence,\nloses benevolence and then righteousness,\nloses righteousness and then ritual.\n\nRitual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet it is the beginning of chaos.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way is complete,\nvirtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual can all be embraced as one.\nNow, having lost the Dao/Way,\nthings are distinguished by category,\nand virtue/power appears alone, with doing and use—\nunnatural, contrary to the Way.\nThus, when virtue/power is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,\nwhen benevolence is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,\nwhen righteousness is lost, it seeks support in ritual.\nAs distinctions grow ever more refined,\nloyalty and trust thin out,\nthough one may wish to reunite them,\nit is impossible.\nThus, ritual is said to be the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\n\nPresumptuous knowledge is the ornament of the Dao/Way,\nyet it marks the start of foolishness.\n\nPresumptuous knowledge refers to prior understanding of things.\nKnowing their ultimate goodness and acting accordingly,\nlike the flower of a grass or tree—\nthis is the Dao/Way’s ornament displayed outwardly.\nIgnorant of their ultimate evil yet acting accordingly,\nit cannot be concealed,\nthus it is said to mark the start of foolishness.\n\nTherefore, the true man of Dao/Way abides in its depth,\nnot in its shallowness,\ndwells in its substance,\nnot in its ornament.\nThe depth is free from blemishes in the Dao/Way.\nThe shallowness is the virtue/power of the inferior,\nbenevolence, righteousness, and ritual.\nThe substance is the inner application—\nthe Dao/Way of harmony and balance.\nThe ornament is the outer application—\nthe constant practices of life.\n\nWithout doing, in purity and stillness—\nwhy borrow from its ornament?\nThus, one abides in depth and substance.\n\nTherefore, abandon that and take this.\n*That* refers to inferior virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual.\n*This* refers to the great Dao/Way, the virtue/power of the superior.\nBy reason, its abandonment and adoption\ncan surely not be confused.\n\n---\n\nChapter 39: Those who once attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe spirit attained the One and became responsive,\nThe grain attained the One and became abundant,\nAll things attained the One and came to life,\nKings and lords attained the One and ruled the world aright.\n\nTheir attainment of the One:\nThe One is the mysterious application of the great Dao/Way.\n*Attainment* means reaching its mysterious application.\n\nHeaven without clarity would fear fragmentation,\nEarth without tranquility would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit without responsiveness would fear stagnation,\nThe grain without abundance would fear exhaustion,\nAll things without life would fear annihilation,\nKings and lords without noble elevation would fear ruin.\n\nFragmentation means incompleteness,\nupheaval means unrest,\nstagnation means short-lived,\nexhaustion means prone to collapse,\nannihilation means no continuation,\nruin means instability—\nall are consequences of losing the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, nobility rests on humility as its foundation,\nelevation rests on lowliness as its base.\nThings follow their natural course—\nthis is their inherent pattern.\n\nTherefore, kings and lords call themselves lone and childless,\nnot storing grain—\nis this not their way of resting on humility as foundation?\nIndeed, it is.\n\nThey employ the Dao/Way of humility toward the lowly.\nCalling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—\nthis is the utmost in humility.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and benefits humility,\nThe Dao/Way of Earth transforms fullness into flowing humility,\nGhosts and spirits harm fullness and bless humility,\nHuman nature abhors fullness and loves humility.\"*\n\nHumility shines bright,\nlowliness is unblemished—\nthis is the end of the true man of Dao/Way.\nTo say *non* is not to say *non*—\nthis is not to be taken as negation.\n\nThus, the wagon was first devised from the cart.\nInitially, it was made as a wheel,\nbut wheels could not carry loads,\nso it was adapted from the cart.\nThe clever use of things gave rise to knowledge.\n\nLater, it was made into a wagon,\nto carry things with it.\nWhen things arrived, the wagon was left behind—\nthough many wagons were used, none boasted of their purpose.\nYet the wagon was without a wagon.\n\nThe merit of kings and lords,\nthose who aid all things, is very great.\nCalling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—\nhow is this different from the wagon being without a wagon?\n\nThey do not wish to gleam like jade,\nnor to stand out like stone.\n*Gleam like jade* refers to jade’s beautiful appearance,\n*stand out like stone* refers to stone’s noble form.\nThough outwardly beautiful,\nwithin they lack adaptability to aid it,\nthus they do not wish to appear like jade or stone.\n\n---\n\nChapter 40: Contrariness is the movement of the Dao/Way,\nThings reaching their extreme naturally reverse—\nyet the Dao/Way does not follow things to their extreme,\nthus it is known as the Dao/Way’s movement.\n\nWeakness is the application of the Dao/Way.\nIn its practice, the Dao/Way does not contend with things,\nknowing to embrace the feminine while guarding the masculine,\nthus it is known as the Dao/Way’s application.»\n\nThe myriad things under heaven are born of *Having*,\n*Having* is born of *Having-not*.\nWhen they are born, they are *Having*;\nwhen they do not generate, they are *Having-not*.\nBenefit and harm follow each other,\nexistence and nonexistence succeed one another—\nonly the *reversing* and the *weak* align with *Having-not* in their principles.\n\n**Chapter 42**\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to *Oneness*,\n*Oneness* gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nThe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things carry *yīn* and embrace *yáng*,\nand the *harmonizing* of *qi* produces their *virtue/power*.\n\nThe *Noble Ones* hear the Dao/Way,\nand diligently practice it—\nfor their faith and understanding reach their fullest extent.\nThe *Middle Ones* hear the Dao/Way,\nand sometimes it seems they retain it, sometimes they lose it—\nfor their faith is not deep, and their understanding has not yet arrived.\nThe *Lowly Ones* hear the Dao/Way,\nand laugh at it; if they do not laugh, it is not worthy to be called the Dao/Way.\nNot believing, not understanding—\nsuch is the natural course of things.\n\nWhen speaking of *Oneness*,\nit is *Having*—\nfor it has something to rely upon.\nTo clarify the Dao/Way is like obscuring it,\nto advance the Dao/Way is like retreating,\nto level the Dao/Way is like making it uneven,\nto uphold *virtue/power* is like lacking it,\nthe greatest brightness is like a stain,\nthe broadest *virtue/power* is like insufficiency,\nestablished *virtue/power* is like stealing,\npure simplicity is like flowing away,\nthe greatest square has no corners,\nthe greatest vessel is fashioned last,\nthe greatest sound has no tone,\nthe greatest form has no shape—\nthe Dao/Way is hidden and nameless.\n\nIts outward traces are shallow and simple,\nits inner essence profound and subtle.\nKnowing the subtle, guarding the minute—\nthus it cannot be measured.\nOnly the Dao/Way is good at lending and completing.\nLending, it borrows from things without exhaustion;\ncompleting, it fulfills its perfection without failure.\n\nThe One is the beginning of the uncarved block.\n\nThe One generates the Two—\nthe body of Heaven.\nThe Two generates the Three—\nthe form of Earth.\nThe Three generates the myriad things.\n\nOnce Heaven and Earth are distinguished,\nthe myriad things come into being.\nWith the proliferation of desires and emotions,\none can no longer hold fast to the One.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within,\ntheir harmonizing *qi* in balance.\nYin and yang—\nthe wondrous operations of the Dao/Way.\n\nTo bear is to be external,\nto embrace is to be internal,\nto harmonize their *qi* in use—\nthus their balance is never lost.\n\nWhat people abhor—\nthe solitary, the orphaned, the destitute—\nare the titles of kings and nobles.\nThis is the ultimate of harmonizing *qi*.\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nand others are augmented yet lose.\nWhere the Dao/Way resides,\nit cannot be measured or reckoned.\nThe cycles of depletion and replenishment,\nof emptiness and fullness,\nendlessly succeed one another.\n\nThe teachings of humanity\nare also my teachings of *virtue/power*.\nSpeaking of teaching, it has a beginning,\na rising point—\nteaching the harmonization of *qi*.\n\n*Yi*—what is fitting.\n*Wo*—where the Dao/Way resides.\nHumanity follows its teachings,\nalso by my adapting to the fittingness of things to teach.\n\nThe overbearing and violent\ndo not meet their natural end.\nThe overbearing do not conform to nature,\nthey do not embody the wondrous harmonization of *qi*.\nNot meeting their natural end,\nthey can no longer preserve their vital essence.\n\nI shall take this as the foundation of teaching.\n\nAll who are called \"Father\" and \"Mother\"\nare but metaphors for the origin of life.\nTaking this as the foundation of teaching\nis to root it in the very beginning of instruction.\n\n**Chapter 43**\nThe utmost softness in the world\novercomes the utmost hardness.\nThe Dao/Way is subtle and void—\nhow could it not be called soft?\nIt does not contend with things,\nyet when used, it moves;\nwhen gathered, it hides—\nhow could it not be called hard?\nWithout entering the unbroken,\nwithout form—\nthis is the wondrous Dao/Way.\nWithout question,\nit penetrates all without obstruction.\nWhen the wondrous Dao/Way acts,\nit transforms without measure,\nthus preserving the subtlest principles.\n\nTherefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* [non-action].\nThe benefits of *wuwei*\nare awakened by those who grasp the Dao/Way—\nnot easily understood by the common multitude.\nSilent teaching,\nthe benefits of *wuwei*—\nfew in the world attain them.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons proceed,\nand all things are born.\"*\nThus, few attain it.\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWhich is more intimate—name or body?\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater harm—gain or loss?\nName is the adornment of the Dao/Way,\nwealth is its delusion,\ngain is its burden,\nthe body is its foundation.\nWith the body, one may observe teaching and practice the Dao/Way.\nThus, name is not more intimate than the body,\nwealth not more abundant,\ngain not more secure than loss.\nTherefore, excessive love leads to great expenditure,\nhoarding leads to great loss.\nThose who fear losing their love\nmust dissipate their vital essence.\nThose who fear losing their hoard\nmust always feel deficient.\nThus, there is regret over great expenditure,\nand anxiety over great loss.\n\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nknowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one may endure long.\nKnowing sufficiency means not loving excessively.\nKnowing when to stop means not hoarding.\nIn harmony with the Dao/Way and teaching,\neven if one does not wish to endure long,\nhow could it be otherwise?\n\n**Chapter 45**\nGreat fullness seems deficient,\nyet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat excess seems empty,\nyet its use is boundless.\nTo seem deficient and empty\nis not to be self-satisfied or false.\nThus, it is neither exhausted nor boundless.\n\nThe most straight seems bent,\nthe most skillful seems clumsy,\nthe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nBent, it is not straight;\nclumsy, it is not skillful;\ntongue-tied, it is not eloquent.\nStraightness has its time to shine,\nskill its time to act,\neloquence its time to be employed.\nThe sage, profound in the Dao’s subtlety,\nconceals its use and awaits the moment—\nthus can it be so.\n\nCold is overcome by vigor,\nheat by stillness—\nthis is the natural order.\nClarity and tranquility are the standard for the world.\nClarity and tranquility\nare the result of *wuwei*.\nIf I practice *wuwei*,\nthe people will naturally align.\nThus, clarity and tranquility\ncan be the standard for the world.\n\n**Chapter 46**\nWhen the world is in the Dao/Way,\nwarhorses are turned to plowing fields.\nWhen the world is without the Dao/Way,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nThose in the Dao/Way use clarity and tranquility,\ntheir hearts free from contention—\nthus, warhorses are turned to plowing.\nWhen the world is at peace,\nall cherish life,\nso fields are manured,\nsoil enriched,\nand borders made fertile—\nself-sufficient in food, their bellies full.\nWithout the Dao/Way, desires and greed arise,\nplacing them in lands of contention.\nThe greater resort to arms to vie for victory—\nthus, warhorses breed in the suburbs,\nfor they do not gather in battle.\nNo greater crime than indulging desire,\nno greater calamity than not knowing sufficiency,\nno greater fault than coveting gain.\nDesire is for those who hold name as intimate,\nnot knowing sufficiency is for those who hold wealth as abundant,\ncoveting gain is for those who see loss as harm.\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\nThose who know sufficiency\nhave one and do not covet two,\nhave little and do not covet more—\nthough the external world is chaotic,\ntheir inner clarity is serene.\nOne and little are already burdens—\nhow much more so insufficiency?\nThus, those who know sufficiency are always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 47**\nWithout leaving one’s door,\none knows the world;\nwithout looking out the window,\none sees the Dao/Way.\nThe sage takes unity as the standard for the world,\nthus, without relying on doors or windows,\nwhat is known and seen is even more distant.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThe senses have their limits—\nthus, it is said, the less one knows.\nTherefore, the sage acts without going,\nknows without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\nThe vast Dao/Way\nknows the movement and stillness of action,\ndiscerns the truth and falsity of names,\njudges the greatness and smallness of achievement—\nthus, it does not wait for self-action to know,\nself-perception to name,\nself-effort to accomplish.\n\n**Chapter 48**\nStudying brings daily increase,\npracticing the Dao/Way brings daily decrease.\nLearners progress gradually,\nfrom little to much—\nthus, it is said, there is increase.\nWhen the Dao/Way is complete,\nits use is hidden,\nits clarity concealed—\nthus, it is said, daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*.\nIn *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.\nEmpty, pure, and tranquil—\nseen, it is not seen;\nheard, it is not heard—\nthus, there is no fear of decrease.\nDecreasing to *wuwei*\nis the subtlest of the Dao/Way.\nIn *wuwei*, nothing remains undone—\nas if nothing were lost in the decreasing.\n\n**Chapter 49**\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\ntaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nAdapting to things, governing with measure,\nteaching according to circumstances—\nthus, no fixed heart.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nthe unvirtuous, I also treat as good—\n*virtue/power* is goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\n*virtue/power* is trustworthiness.\nSpeech is uniform, without favor or aversion.\nGoodness and trustworthiness of *virtue/power*\nmake the world regard them as good and trustworthy.\nThe sage, amidst the world’s chatter,\nblends the hearts of the people.\n*Wǒngwǒng*—[restless and fearful].\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"All day long, diligent and earnest,\nat night, vigilant as if in peril—\nno blame.\"*\nTaking the hearts of the people as one’s own,\none does not reveal one’s own capacities.\nBlending, one outwardly aligns with the people\nwhile inwardly differing.\nAll the people focus their ears and eyes—\ntheir faith, obedience, reverence, and admiration reach their peak.\n\n「百姓日用而不知，故注耳目而未知心之渊默矣。」\nThe people use it daily yet remain unaware—\nthus, though all ears and eyes are fixed upon it,\nthey still fail to grasp the profound stillness of the heart.\n\n「圣人皆孩之。」\nThe sage treats them all as infants.\n\n「言百姓随教顺治，未有所能，如孩童之就乳不难率也。」\nFor the people follow instruction and submit to governance,\nyet possess no innate capacity—\nlike infants naturally drawn to milk,\nwithout effort or resistance.\n\n「五十章 出生入死，万物出则生，入则死，自然之道。」\n**Chapter Fifty:**\nLife emerges, death returns—\nall things born must rise, decay must fall,\nthe Dao of nature.\n\n「生之徒十有三，死之徒十有三，言其类异而事不异也。」\nOf those who live, thirteen are but one kind;\nof those who die, thirteen another—\nthough their natures differ,\ntheir affairs remain the same.\n\n「人之生，动之死地十有三。」\nAmong living beings, thirteen are ever thrust\ninto the brink of death.\n\n「言不出於生死之徒也。」\nThis is to say they never stray\nfrom life’s and death’s domain.\n\n「夫何故？」\nWhy is this so?\n\n「以其生生之厚。」\nBecause their attachment to life is profound.\n\n「物性本不生不死，专用死以为死，是故以生为生，随生而死，随死而生，是厚於生也，故曰生生之厚。」\nBy nature, things neither live nor die—\nyet death is invoked to make them die.\nThus, they cling to life as life,\nand in life find death,\nwhile in death find life again—\nthis is the depth of their attachment to living,\nhence the saying: *profound attachment to life*.\n\n「盖闻善摄生者，陆行不遇兕虎，入军不被甲兵。」\nTruly, those who master life’s preservation\nwalk the earth unharmed by rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battle untouched by steel or blade.\n\n「兕无所投其角，虎无所措其爪，兵无所容其刃。」\nThe rhinoceros finds no foothold to strike,\nthe tiger no leverage for its claws,\nthe soldiers no opening for their blades.\n\n「不生不死，内明常存，外境之来，於我何有。」\nNeither born nor dying,\nthey inwardly retain their luminous clarity,\nwhile external circumstances—\nto them, what matter?\n\n「故兕虎甲兵无所能及矣。」\nThus, rhinoceros, tiger, steel, and blade\ncannot reach them.\n\n「夫何故？」\nWhy is this so?\n\n「以其无死地。」\nBecause they dwell beyond death’s grasp.\n\n「以其不生，故无死地。」\nFor they do not cling to life,\nand so death cannot claim them.\n\n「玄机妙理，悟者知之。」\nThe subtle mechanisms and profound principles—\nonly the awakened understand them.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One:**\n「道生之，大道也，始於道也。」\nThe Dao gives birth to it—\nthis is the Great Dao,\noriginating from the Dao.\n\n「德畜之，上德也，善於容物，故归於德。」\n*Virtue/Power* nurtures it—\nthis is the Supreme *Virtue/Power*,\nskilled in accommodating all things,\nthus returning to *virtue/power*.\n\n「物形之，能生而在地各自成形。」\nThings take shape from it—\neach born entity, in its place,\nforms its own distinct shape.\n\n「势成之。顺於生畜，赋分类聚。」\nMomentum completes it—\nin harmony with life’s nurturing,\nit grants portions and gathers into kinds.\n\n「是以万物莫不尊道而贵德。」\nHence, all things reverently honor the Dao\nand hold *virtue/power* in esteem.\n\n「由道而生，仰德之育，故有尊贵之常。」\nFrom the Dao they arise,\nrelying on *virtue/power*’s nourishment—\nthus, their honor and reverence endure.\n\n「道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之爵而常自然。」\nThe Dao’s honor, *virtue/power*’s nobility—\nno titles bestow them,\nyet they arise naturally.\n\n「天下之所尊贵者，官爵而已。」\nAll the world esteems and honors\nonly titles and rank.\n\n「道德无形，人莫能爵之，是不可以洛之义也，如是则出於自然。」\nThe Dao and *virtue/power* are formless—\nno one can confer titles upon them,\nthus they cannot be limited by human decree,\nand so they spring from nature.\n\n「故道生之畜之，长之育之，成之熟之，养之覆之。」\nThus, the Dao gives birth to it,\n*nurtures* it,\n*lengthens* and *nourishes* it,\n*completes* and *matures* it,\n*rears* and *shelters* it.\n\n「皆自然之常理也。」\nAll are the enduring principles of nature.\n\n「生而不有，为而不侍，长而不宰，不自有其功之至也。」\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not lord over,\nlengthens yet does not control—\nits perfection lies in not claiming its own deeds.\n\n「是谓玄德。」\nThis is called the *Mysterious Virtue/Power*.\n\n「不可以测度故也。」\n\nBecause it cannot be measured or gauged.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two:**\n「天下有始，以为天下母。」\nThe world has its origin—\nthis is the Mother of all things.\n\n「始於道也。」\nIts origin lies in the Dao.\n\n「道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物，故曰为天下母也。」\nThe Dao gives birth to *Oneness*,\n*Oneness* to *Duality*,\n*Duality* to *Triplicity*,\nand *Triplicity* to all things—\nthus it is called the Mother of all things.\n\n「既得其母，以知其子；既知其子，复守其母，没身不殆。」\nHaving obtained its Mother,\none comes to know its offspring;\nhaving known its offspring,\none returns to guard its Mother—\nthus, throughout one’s life,\nno peril shall befall.\n\n「万物本道而生，得其母之义也。」\nAll things arise from the Dao—\nthis is the meaning of obtaining their Mother.\n\n「见万物已生之众，是知其子之义也。」\nTo see all things in their myriad born forms—\nthis is the meaning of knowing their offspring.\n\n「万物有穷尽之时，而人道无休息之理，是复守其母之义也。」\nAll things have their end,\nyet the Dao of humanity knows no cessation—\nthis is the meaning of returning to guard its Mother.\n\n「如是则没身，岂有危殆以相及乎。」\nThus, through one’s entire life,\nhow could danger or peril reach them?\n\n「塞其兑，闭其门，终身不勤。」\nBlock its *Joyous* aspect,\nshut its gates—\nthus, throughout one’s life,\nno labor shall be known.\n\n「塞其兑者，欲心不兴於内也。」\nTo block its *Joyous* aspect—\nthis means the heart of desire does not stir within.\n\n「闭其门者，常邪自施於外也。」\nTo shut its gates—\nthis means perpetual perversity is warded off from without.\n\n「动，劳也。」\n*Dòng*—[exertion/labor].\n\n「不劳苦而可保淳和之道。」\nWithout toil or suffering,\none may preserve the Dao of purity and harmony.\n\n「开其兑，济其事，终身不救。」\nUnblock its *Joyous* aspect,\naid its undertakings—\nthus, throughout one’s life,\nno deliverance shall be found.\n\n「开其兑者，道不全也。」\nTo unblock its *Joyous* aspect—\nthis means the Dao is incomplete.\n\n「济其事者，施为不穷也。」\nTo aid its undertakings—\nthis means deeds know no end.\n\n「不可救者，入患难而不复安强矣，故曰不救。」\nThat which cannot be delivered—\nonce plunged into calamity,\nit never returns to safety or strength,\nhence the saying: *no deliverance*.\n\n「见小曰明，常人忽於小而重於大。」\nTo see the small is called *clarity*—\nordinary folk neglect the small\nyet fixate on the great.\n\n「干云之木起於葱青，千里之涂始於足下，此见小之义也。」\nThe tree that pierces the clouds\nbegins with tender shoots;\nthe path of a thousand *lǐ*\ncommences beneath one’s feet—\nthis is the meaning of seeing the small.\n\n「预识先知，非明而何。」\nTo foresee and know beforehand—\nwhat else is *clarity*?\n\n「守柔曰强。揉曲木者不累日，销金者不累月，此柔弱胜刚强之义也。」\nTo guard softness is called *strength*—\nbending crooked wood requires no days,\nmelting gold no months—\nthis is the meaning of softness overcoming hardness.\n\n「用其光，复归其明。」\nEmploy its *radiance*,\nthen return to its *clarity*.\n\n「光者，照於外者也。明者，内自照者也。」\n*Radiance*—that which shines outwardly.\n*Clarity*—that which inwardly illuminates itself.\n\n「用其光则知其子是也，归其明则复其母是也。」\nTo employ its *radiance* is to know its offspring;\nto return to its *clarity* is to guard its Mother.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three:**\n「使我斗然有知，行於大道，介，大也。」\nLet me boldly know the Great Dao—\n*jiè*—[great/majestic].\n\n「大有知则知其道之要妙，故能行於大道。」\nBold knowledge reveals the Dao’s essential subtleties,\nthus one may walk the Great Dao.\n\n「唯施是畏。」\nOnly *action* is to be feared.\n\n「畏其乱得失，迷善恶，以施及於万物也。」\nFor *action* may disrupt gain and loss,\nconfuse good and evil,\nand extend its influence to all things.\n\n「大道甚夷，举道之要以明非道。」\nThe Great Dao is most plain—\nby raising the Dao’s essentials,\none clarifies what is not the Dao.\n\n「民甚好径。不任自然，务敏於得，故好径捷之迹形焉。」\nThe people love shortcuts—\nthey do not submit to nature,\nyet strive eagerly for gain,\nthus they favor swift, artificial paths.\n\n「朝甚除，除其荒秽以尚严整也。」\nMorning is marked by *cleansing*—\nremoving chaos and filth\nto uphold order and precision.\n\n「田甚芜，禾稼盛之，义，如芜生焉，非荒芜之芜也。」\nFields appear overgrown—\nyet crops flourish within—\n*wú*—[overgrowth], yet not barrenness,\nbut the vitality of growth.\n\n「仓甚虚。上下足食，无拾克聚敛之事，非空虚之虚也。」\nGranaries seem empty—\nyet all, from high to low, have enough to eat,\nwith no need for hoarding or accumulation—\n*empty*, yet not void,\nbut sufficiency’s embrace.\n\n「服文彩，文事之饰也。」\nAttire is adorned with patterns—\nthe embellishment of artificial pursuits.\n\n「带利剑，武事之备也。」\nWearing sharp blades—\npreparedness for martial pursuits.\n\n「厌饮食，无饥馑也。」\nDisdaining food—\nyet no hunger or famine exists.\n\n「财货有余。」\nWealth overflows—\nabundance in goods.\n\n「是谓盗夸，非道也哉。」\nThis is called *robber’s boast*—\nhow far from the Dao!\n\n「务於好径，至於财货有余，不任自然者多矣。」\nIn their zeal for shortcuts,\nreaching even to wealth’s excess,\nmany refuse nature’s way.\n\n「失道之甚如盗者之相夸，不足贵也，故曰非道也哉。」\nTo stray so far from the Dao\nas to boast like robbers—\nunworthy of honor,\nthus it is said: *how far from the Dao!*\n\n「五十四章 善建者不拔，谨其始也。」\n**Chapter 54:**\nThose who build well are unshaken—\nfor they are careful in their foundation.\n\n「善抱者不脱，保其成也。」\nThose who embrace well do not slip—\nfor they safeguard what is complete.\n\n「子孙祭祀不报。」\nDescendants’ sacrifices are unceasing—\nthe ultimate in unshaken and unslipped.\n\n「修之身，其德乃真；德，上德也。」\nCultivate it in the self—\nits virtue becomes *true*—\n*true* virtue, the highest virtue.\n\n「真则不妄，信於下也。」\n*True* means no falsehood—\ntrustworthy even to the lowly.\n\n「修之家，其德乃余；修之乡，其德乃长；修之国，其德乃丰；修之天下，其德乃普。」\nCultivate it in the household—\nits virtue overflows;\ncultivate it in the village—\nits virtue extends;\ncultivate it in the state—\nits virtue abounds;\ncultivate it in the world—\nits virtue is universal.\n\n「以其全真，故有余以及於家。」\nBecause its *truth* is complete,\nabundance reaches even the household.\n\n「以其有余，故能长以及其乡。」\nBecause it overflows,\nit can extend to the village.\n\n「以其可长，故为丰厚以及於国。」\nBecause it can extend,\nit becomes rich and full,\nreaching even the state.\n\n「以其遂丰，故普遍行於天下。」\nBecause it achieves abundance,\nit spreads universally across the world—\nthis is the clear proof of *unshaken foundations*.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self,\nthe household through the household,\nthe village through the village,\nthe state through the state,\nthe world through the world.\nSee the Dao of governing the self—\nthen one knows how to govern one’s own self.\nSee the Dao of governing the household—\nthen one knows how to govern one’s own household.\nSee the Dao of governing the village—\nthen one knows how to govern one’s own village.\nSee the Dao of governing the state—\nthen one knows how to govern one’s own state.\nSee the Dao of governing the world—\nthen one knows how to govern one’s own world.\nThe unshaken and unslipped is thus revealed.\n\n**How do I know this of the world?**\nBy this.\nThis is the way to observe the self,\nthe household, the village,\nthe state, and the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 55:**\n「含德之厚，比於赤子。」\nThe depth of virtue held\nis likened to an *赤子*—[innocent infant].\n\n「上德之人也。」\nThe person of *highest virtue*.\n\n「赤子，婴儿之巽名也。」\n*赤子*—[innocent infant], a *humble* name for a babe.\n\n「毒虫不螫，猛兽不据，攫乌不搏。」\nNo venomous insects sting,\nno fierce beasts seize,\nno raptors clutch.\n\n「无恐畏之心，不伤於物，至诚所在，物亦知之，故不加害。」\nNo fear or dread in heart—\nunharmed by things.\nWhere *sincerity* resides supreme,\neven things recognize it,\nthus no harm is done.\n\n「骨弱筋柔而握固，未知牝牡之合而作，精之至也。」\nThough bones are frail and sinews soft,\nyet its grip is firm—\nit knows not yet the union of male and female,\nyet moves with vigor—\nthe *essence* at its peak.\n\n「终日号而不嘎，和之至。」\nAll day it cries yet never tires—\n*smoothness* at its peak.\n\n「握固则无所欲得而自执也。」\nFirm in grip—\nit seeks nothing to gain,\nyet holds itself steady.\n\n「作则不因币为而自动也。」\nVigorously moving—\nit does not rely on external incentives,\nyet acts on its own.\n\n「号而不嘎，其本固也，非精与和之至而何哉？」\nTo cry yet never tire—\nits foundation is unyielding.\nHow else but by the peak of *essence* and *smoothness*?\n\n「知和曰常，知此和之至，可以常行而不离。」\nTo know *smoothness* is to know *constancy*—\nto know this *smoothness* at its peak,\none can act in *constancy* without deviation.\n\n「知常曰明，知此常之义，复归其明不难也。」\nTo know *constancy* is to know *illumination*—\nto know the meaning of this *constancy*,\nreturning to *illumination* is no challenge.\n\n「益生曰祥，保此常，守此明，日益日生至於盛大，无凶咎也。」\nTo grow beneficially is *auspicious*—\npreserve this *constancy*,\nguard this *illumination*,\nand daily growth will flourish to greatness—\nno ill fortune or blame shall come.\n\n「心使气曰强。」\nThe heart directing *qi* is called *strength*.\n\n「不求外助，内保久长，气与道俱，不强何待。」\nNo reliance on external aid—\ninternal safeguarding of longevity,\n*qi* and Dao in harmony—\nwhat need for *strength*?\n\n「物壮则老，是谓不道，不道早已。」\nThings grow strong, then age—\nthis is called *not the Dao*,\nand *not the Dao* brings early decline.\n\n「物有成形，老必及之，不知变道，非道之用。」\nThings, once formed, must age—\nto fail to know the Dao of *transformation*,\nthis is *not the Dao’s* application.\n\n「已，止也。」\n*已*—[cessation], the end.\n\n「止而至於败，微妙何容焉。」\nTo reach ruin through *cessation*—\nhow can the *subtle* endure this?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 56:**\n「知者不言，默运元机，物随以化，家至户晓，事有穷时，故不在於言。」\nThe *wise* do not speak—\nthey silently work the *primordial mechanism*,\nand things transform in response.\nEven to the household’s door,\nwhen matters reach their limit,\nwords are not needed.\n\n「言者不知。」\nThose who speak are not *wise*.\n\n「入乎耳，出乎口，口耳之问数寸尔，何足以美七尺之躯哉？」\nWords enter the ear,\nexit the mouth—\na gap of mere inches,\nhow can they adorn a seven-foot frame?\n\nThus, words are not the essence of *wisdom*.\n\n「塞其兑，内藏其明。」\nBlock its *joyousness*—[兑, *ui*],\nand *illumination* is kept within.\n\n「闭其门，外杜其邪。」\nClose its gates—\nand external *evil* is barred outside.\n\n「挫其锐，知进退。」\nDull its sharpness—\nand one knows advance and retreat.\n\n「解其纷，顺而不乱。」\nUnravel its confusion—\nand it flows smoothly, undisturbed.\n\n「和其光，不自显。」\nSmooth its brilliance—\nand it does not reveal itself.\n\n「同其尘，不自异。」\nBlend with the dust—\nand it does not set itself apart.\n\n「是谓玄同。」\nThis is called *mysterious uniformity*.\n\n*Mysterious* means *subtle and refined*,\n*uniform* means *harmonious and one*.\n\nThus, it cannot be grasped as *near* or *distant*,\ncannot be taken as *beneficial* or *harmful*,\ncannot be claimed as *noble* or *base*.\n*Near* and *distant*, *beneficial* and *harmful*,\n*noble* and *base*—\nthese are what people weigh,\nthe distinctions they make.\n\nWhere the Great Dao resides,\nit has no *name*—[非常名, *unconventional name*],\nits form is unseen,\nits sound unheard—\nhow much less can it be grasped as *near* or *distant*,\n*beneficial* or *harmful*,\n*noble* or *base*?\n\nThus, it is *noble* for all under heaven.\n*Noble*—[贵], to honor its Dao,\nfor none beneath heaven can equal it.\n\n---\n「以政治国，以奇用兵，以无事取天下。」\nBy *government* one governs the state,\nby *strategy* one wages war,\nby *non-action* one takes the world.\n\n「政，正也。」\n*Government*—[政], *rectitude*.\n\n「奇，不正也。」\n*Strategy*—[奇], *not rectitude*.\n\nJust as the straight is the edge of the square,\nyet the crooked is not discarded.\n\nWar values *deception*—[诡祚],\nlike defending the east while striking the west—\n*rectitude* cannot be practiced.\n\n*Rectitude* and *strategy* both exist,\nyet their use is formless—\nlike *non-action* in taking the world.\n\nIf there is *action*,\nthen love becomes partial—\npartial love,\nand all will not join.\n\nIf all will not join,\nhow much less will the world?\n\n**How do I know this is so?**\nBy this.\nThus, *non-action* is the supreme subtlety.\n\nThe world abounds in taboos,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\n\nMen multiply sharp tools,\nyet the state grows ever more confused.\n\nMen multiply clever arts,\nyet strange things proliferate.\n\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nyet thieves and robbers multiply.\n\nThis too is the natural order.\n\nToo many taboos,\nand the harmony of taking and giving is lost.\n\nToo many sharp tools,\nand power shifts to the people below.\n\nToo many clever arts,\nand the heart’s turbulence is born.\n\nToo many laws and decrees,\nand the rise of reckless fortune cannot be halted.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich—\nself-sufficiency within.*\n\n*I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nthey do not greedily covet,\nand naturally return to few desires.*\n\n*I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\nWhen desire does not arise,\nthey preserve their true nature and return to the plain—\nthe beginning of returning to the Dao,\nhence it is called *simplicity*.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\nWhen governance is murky,\nthe people are pure.\nMurky—like having no ability.\nPure—like having no knowledge.\n\nThe Dao is originally *non-action*,\nthus it is valued as such.\n\nWhen governance is scrutinizing,\nthe people are deficient.\nScrutinizing—it cannot contain anything.\nDeficient—it cannot complete anything.\n\nThis is the loss of the Dao’s subtlety,\nthus it results in this.\n\nCalamity—where fortune leans,\nfortune—where calamity lurks.\nWho knows their limits?\n\nJoy to its extreme becomes sorrow,\nadversity to its extreme becomes prosperity—\nnot in a single day.\n\nThough this principle is clear,\nmen do not seek it out.\nThey forcefully invite calamity,\nforcefully pray for fortune—\nthis is called not knowing their limits.\n\nIs there no *rectitude*?\nThings have never failed to exist within the *rectitude* of the Dao.\n\n*Rectitude* becomes *strategy*,\n*goodness* becomes *monstrous*.\n*Complex*—to reverse and return.\n\nLost and not returning,\nyou consult your tortoise shell—\nyou will surely meet disaster.\nHow much less so with *strategy* and *monstrous* things?\n\nThe people’s delusion has long endured.\nThey are deceived beyond measure,\nyet do not know to cease.\n\nIs thus the Sage:\nSquare yet not sharp,\nHonest yet not rigid,\nUpright yet not domineering,\nBright yet not blinding.\n\nInner sufficiency aligns with the Dao,\nHarmonious without ostentatious adornment,\nLest its pristine virtue be defiled by external pretense.\n\n**Chapter 59:**\nTo govern men and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses *frugality*.\n*\"Frugality\"* here means love while concealing.\n\nThe Sage practices *frugality* in the Dao,\nThe petty man in wealth.\n**Frugality** alone is called *early service*—\nThrough its capacity to conceal,\nIt may be termed *supreme virtue*.\nThus men vie to embrace it,\nYet fear its consequences.\n\n*Early service* is *accumulating virtue*.\nNot boasting of one’s abilities,\nVirtue then flourishes anew—\nHence *accumulating virtue* is said.\n\n*Accumulate virtue* and nothing fails,\nNothing fails and none know its bounds—\nNone know its bounds,\nAnd thus a realm may be secured.\n\nInner harmony and sufficiency,\nNaturally require no external aid—\nThus nothing fails.\nWhat is conquered leaves no remnant,\nNo margin of excess or deficiency—\nThus none know its bounds.\n\nApplied to governance,\nWhen aligned with the Dao,\nAll things return—\nThus a realm may be secured.\n\nThe origin of securing a realm,\nLies in enduring longevity.\n*Origin* refers to the first principle of growth.\nTo practice *frugality* and accumulate virtue,\nIs the foundation of ruling a state—\nIf not thus preserved for long,\nSuch a case has never been.\n\nThis is the *Dao* of probing roots and securing foundations,\nOf enduring life and perpetual vision.\n\n*Roots and foundations* symbolize the inseparable pair.\n*Enduring life* is not the aim of *tranquility* and *non-action*.\n\n**Chapter 60:**\nTo govern a great state,\nAs if cooking a small fish.\n\n*Cooking* has its method,\nSmall and great—what difference?\nPerceive the principle, grasp the moment,\nGovernance becomes effortless.\n\nWhen the Dao is applied to the world,\nIts spirits are not *divine*—\nEach finds its proper place,\nNames persist but functions are subtle,\nNo reckless bestowal of calamity or fortune—\nThis is called *not divine*.\n\nNot that its spirits are not *divine*,\nBut that the *divine* does not harm the people.\nThere is no opening for harm,\nHence the people follow the Dao’s transformation,\nSpeaking without censure,\nActing without restraint—\nAll because the Sage governs with the Dao,\nSpirits and gods cease where humanity ends,\nThus they have no need to exert their *divinity*.\n\nTwo forces do not harm each other—\nThus virtue returns in harmony.\nThe *Dao* of resonance and response,\nEven wood and stone obey—\nHow much more so spirits and gods?\n\nWith *divinity* guarding its essence,\nI preserve its virtue—\nTogether they fulfill the Dao,\nThis is called *harmony*.\n\n**Chapter 61:**\nGreat states embrace the *lowly*,\nThe *crossroads* of the world.\n\n*The lowly*—gentle and accommodating,\nNot fixated on rigidity,\nIts currents flow without obstruction or exhaustion.\n*Crossroads*—those who gather and attach themselves.\n\nThe *crossroads* of the world are *feminine*—\nA metaphor for gentleness.\n*The feminine* always triumphs through stillness,\nThus mastering gentleness.\n\n*The masculine* finds stillness as lowly.\nThose who employ the *masculine* often regard stillness as lowly—\nIf stillness is lowly,\nThen the *crossroads* of the world will come.\n\nThus great states yield to small states,\nAnd small states yield to great states—\nBoth triumph through stillness.\n\nIt is said that small states do not govern,\nGreat states take them to govern,\nAnd great states do not govern,\nSmall states take them to govern—\nNot bound by great or small,\nOnly the Dao is revered,\nNot for private gain of people or lands.\n\nThus sometimes yielding to take,\nSometimes yielding while taken—\nTheir return is one principle,\nThe natural Dao,\nWhich does not exceed the lowly.\n\nGreat states do not seek to absorb small states,\nSmall states do not seek to serve great states.\n*Absorb*—to nurture people with propriety.\n*Serve*—to attend to others with respect.\nTo attend to others is to place oneself lowly.\n\nBoth find their proper place,\nThus the great should embrace the lowly.\n\nGreat states rely on strength,\nFew can yield to the lowly.\nNow it is said the great should embrace the lowly,\nTo reveal that which the great finds difficult to practice.\n\n**Chapter 62:**\nThe Dao—\nThe hidden essence of all things,\n*Hidden*—deep and profound—\nNot shallow or near.\nNot named, no trace remains,\nNot of the ordinary kind.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous man,\nHidden like a man’s most guarded wealth.\nThe treasure of the unvirtuous man,\nObtained brings life,\nLost brings death—\nThus it is obtained in safety.\n\nFine words may be sold,\nMany hear and follow them.\n\n「*Revere*—to elevate others with respect.\nOthers revere what is done,\nThus it is never spurned.\n\nWhat is not virtuous in others—how can it be discarded?\nDiscarding others, the Dao cannot be practiced,\nThe Dao cannot be practiced, teaching cannot flourish,\nThus it must not be discarded.\n\nTherefore, establish the Son of Heaven,\nAppoint the Three Excellencies,\nSpeaking of the utmost use of teaching.\n\nThough one may have a jade tablet to precede four horses,\nIt is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao.\n\nA jade tablet and four horses,\nThough they are the highest of gifts,\nOnce used, they are exhausted.\n\nThe implements of ritual,\nThings lack adaptability.\n\nThe Three Excellencies seated to discuss the Dao,\nThe original transformation is boundless,\nTo govern the people,\nAll receive blessings,\nThus jade tablets and horses cannot be compared to the Dao.\n\nWhy the ancients valued this Dao,\nWas it not because it was not sought daily and obtained?\nOr because it could absolve guilt and avert evil?\n\nTherefore, it is most valued by the world.\nPractice it, and it is perfect;\nThus it is not sought daily.\n\nIt aligns with principle and propriety,\nThus it is not a matter of guilt.\n\nThe Dao is as such,\nTherefore the world values it most.\n\n**Chapter 63:**\nTo act with non-action,\nTo manage without managing,\nTo savor without savoring.\n\nTo act with non-action—then what is done does not hinder.\nTo manage without managing—then matters are not repeatedly burdened.\nTo savor without savoring—then its flavor is not diminished.\n\nThose who know its essence,\nCan conclude it in a single word;\nThose who do not know its essence,\nWill endlessly ramble.\n\nGreat and small, much and little,\nRepaying grievances with virtue.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nIn summary, encompassing what is not uniform.\n\nRepaying grievances with virtue—\nGentle, harmonious, clear, and tranquil,\nWithout harboring malevolence,\nThe wondrous application of the Dao.\n\nSeek difficulty in what is easy,\nAchieve greatness in what is minute.\n\nThe world’s difficult matters must be done in ease,\nThe world’s great matters must be done in the minute.\n\nThus the sage never does what is great,\nAnd so can achieve what is great.\n\nWhat is easy is the foundation of difficulty,\nWhat is minute is the root of greatness,\nThus difficulty and ease follow one another,\nGreatness and smallness succeed one another,\nLike a cycle without end.\n\nThe sage knows this truth,\nBelieves in its principle,\nThus he preserves what is small and guards what is low.\n\nLight promises bring few trusts,\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties.\n\nThis is also the natural order.\n\nIt is said first, \"Seek difficulty in what is easy,\"\nDifficult matters are done in ease,\nLest people treat ease lightly.\n\nThus it is said, \"Light promises bring few trusts,\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties,\"\nTo reveal that matters progress gradually.\n\nTherefore, the sage avoids what is difficult,\nAnd so forever has no difficulties.\n\nKnowing the Dao of difficulty,\nHe treats the end as carefully as the beginning,\nDifficulties cannot obstruct its wondrous application,\nThus he forever has no difficulties.\n\n**Chapter 64:**\nIts stability is easy to uphold,\nIts unmanifested state is easy to plan.\n\nAct before there is danger or trace.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nGovern before there is chaos.\n\n\"Act before there is manifestation,\nGovern before there is chaos.\nLittle force yields great results.\"\n\nA tree of arms’ embrace,\nGrows from a hair’s tip;\nA nine-tiered terrace,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n\nSpeaking of the gradual growth from subtle beginnings to completion.\n\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper loses it.\n\nExerting utmost force to act,\nThe utmost force will bring ruin;\nExerting utmost force to grasp,\nExcessive grasping will cause loss.\n\nThus the sage acts with non-action,\nAnd so never meets ruin;\nHe grasps without attachment,\nAnd so never loses.\n\nIllustrating the higher meaning.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs,\nThey often fail when near completion.\n\nThe foolish demand to finish matters,\nThe wise observe what has not yet sprouted.\n\nBuilding a mountain nine *ren* high,\nIts labor fails at one *zan* short—\nCommon shallow perception,\nThus success and failure are as such.\n\nTreating the end as carefully as the beginning,\nThen there is no failing matter.\n\nPreserving fullness and guarding completion,\nCan ensure lasting duration,\nThus there is no failing matter.\n\nTherefore, the sage desires what is undesired,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;\nDifficult-to-obtain treasures are what the great desire.\n\nDesiring what is undesired,\nThen one reaches the utmost of desirelessness.\n\nLearning what is not learned,\nThe Dao is spread through virtue,\nAnd there is nothing left to learn.\n\nReturning to what others have erred,\n*Return*—to reverse.\n\nTo reverse what others have erred,\nIs not to share in their errors.\n\nTo aid all things in their natural course,\nWithout daring to act.\n\nTo aid all things in their natural course,\nIs not to rely solely on one’s own strength.\n\nNot daring to act,\nThus he displays the Dao of aiding without acting.\n\n**Chapter 65:**\nThe ancients who excelled in practicing the Dao,\nDid not do so to enlighten the people,\nBut to bewilder them.\n\nThe bewildered have no knowledge,\nThe enlightened have much knowledge.\n\nKnowledge and wisdom vie with one another,\nThey stray from virtue and violate the Dao,\nNot fitting for those who excel in practicing the Dao.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern,\nBecause their knowledge is too much.\n\nAlready difficult to govern,\nThey further use their knowledge and wisdom,\nHow much more so if enlightened to aid their chaos?\n\nTherefore, governing with knowledge is a state’s ruin;\nNot governing with knowledge is a state’s blessing.\n\nUsing knowledge causes one to lose their natural course,\nThus it is likened to ruin.\n\nTo govern things with principle,\nTo aid with adaptability,\nWhat calamity could there be?\n\nKnowing these two things is also a standard model.\nIt cannot be neglected,\nThe same for ancient and modern,\nTaking the standard model as a parable.\n\nAlways knowing the standard model,\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\n*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,\nIt opposes things,\nOnly then does it reach the utmost harmony.\n\nThough called a standard model,\nIt has no visible form,\nThus it is said, *Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant.\n\nThings pursue profit,\nAnd cunning deceits arise.\nThe Dao is natural,\nThus it opposes things.\n\nOpposing those who stray from the Dao,\nThis is the utmost harmony,\nThere is none who does not conform,\nThus it is called *great harmony*.\n\n**Chapter 66:**\nThe rivers and seas become kings of the valleys,\nBecause they excel in descending.\n\nA metaphor.\n\nRivers and seas are lowly,\nGreat and capacious,\nAll streams flow to them,\nThus they are above all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the sage wishes to be above others,\nBy his words descending;\nWishes to lead others,\nBy his person following behind.\n\nThe lonely, the widowed, the childless,\nAre those who descend with their words.\n\n**Chapter 67:**\n\nTo eat coarse food yet honor the spirits with filial piety,\nTo wear rough garments yet adorn the ceremonial cap,\nTo dwell in humble abodes yet labor diligently at irrigation—\nThis is to serve with one’s own body.\n\nThus, though placed above, none hold him in contempt;\nThough placed before, none dare to harm him.\nHis virtue and Dao are profound and distant,\nBeyond measure or injury.\nHe has no intention of self-exaltation when above,\nAnd when before others, he makes room for those behind—\nThus, weight and harm are far removed.\n\nTherefore, the world delights in promoting him without tiring.\nBecause he does not contend, none can contend with him.\nHis joy in promotion without tiring\narises from the absence of weight and harm.\nEven calamity and injury cannot reach him—\nhow much less competition and rivalry?\n\nAll under Heaven say my Dao is vast,\nyet I seem unworthy.\n*Xiào* means \"to resemble\"—\nto resemble those who came before.\nThe common view of the multitude\nis that I govern with force,\nsaying I do not resemble those who acted visibly\nto rule the world.\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it resembled others for long,\nit would be trifling indeed.\nThe Great Dao is unfathomable;\nthe multitude cannot know or see it,\nthus it seems unworthy.\nMy Dao resembles those who ruled by Dao,\nthus it is said: \"If it resembled others for long.\"\nIts principles are subtle, its words profound—\nthus it is called \"trifling.\"\n\nI possess three treasures;\nI guard and uphold them—\nnever to be parted from for a moment.\nThe first is *cì*—\n\n---\n\nTo pity those under Heaven who have lost the Dao.\nThe second is *jian*—\nthe utmost of frugality.\n\nThe third is not daring to act first for all under Heaven—\nlike the rivers and seas in their goodness of yielding.\n\nFor *cì* brings courage;\n*jian* brings abundance;\nnot daring to act first for all under Heaven\nbrings completion of one’s vessel and length of days.\n\nThe application of the Dao,\nthe working of its principles—\nnow to abandon *cì* and its courage,\nto abandon *jian* and its abundance,\nto abandon humility and act first—\nthis is death.\n\nTo rely alone on force and strength,\nto act recklessly and bring chaos—\nall will reject you,\nand death may be awaited at once.\n\nFor *cì*—\nin war, it brings victory;\nin defense, it brings security.\nTo speak of *cì* as the Dao\nis to say its application knows no limits.\n\nWhen Heaven intends to save,\nit shields with *cì*.\nThis aligns with Heaven’s virtue—\nfor Heaven’s Dao also holds *cì* as supreme.\n\n**Chapter 68:**\nThe virtuous warrior does not rely on force,\nbut acts with yielding gentleness.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nbut triumphs through benevolence and righteousness.\nThe master of victory does not contend—\ncontention brings insufficiency,\nso victory lies in not contending.\n\nThe adept at using people places themselves beneath them.\nBy praising virtues and humbling oneself,\npeople will surely turn to you.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe strength of using people,\nthe harmony with Heaven’s ancient measure—\nthe utmost attainment of the Dao.\n\nWith non-contention’s virtue within oneself,\nand the people’s strength devoted to you,\nHeaven follows the Dao in its course,\nand the sage follows Heaven in governance.\n\n*Ji*—the extreme—\nis the central way,\nthe great central Dao.\n\n**Chapter 69:**\nIn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\n\nWeapons are instruments of calamity;\nthe sage uses them only when unavoidable,\nthus does not act as aggressor but as defender—\nspeaking that misfortune does not arise from oneself.\n\nNot daring to advance an inch—\nthis is to avoid reckless action.\nNot daring to retreat a foot—\nthis is to be resolute in repelling chaos.\n\nThis is called *xíng wú xíng*—\naction without action,\naction that does not originate from oneself.\n\nTo seize without arms,\nto prevail without strength,\nto hold without weapons—\nall are of the kind of *xíng wú xíng*.\n\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—\nnot daring to advance an inch,\nnot daring to retreat a foot—\nhow could this be underestimating the enemy?\n\nTo underestimate the enemy risks losing one’s treasures.\nThis is an analogy—\nfor *cì* is the treasure.\n\nThus, when armies clash,\nvictory may be won in a single morning.\nTo fight without anger,\nwith benevolence and righteousness following—\nthis is surely how victory is taken.\n\nThe Han High Emperor, clad in mourning at the military gate,\ncould honor the Emperor Yi with profound pity.\n\n**Chapter 70:**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\n\nThe world cannot know it, cannot practice it.\nHumans may exalt the Dao, but the Dao does not exalt humans.\nEasy to know yet not known,\neasy to practice yet not practiced—\nthus they are deceived by it.\n\nWords have their root,\naffairs have their master.\nRoot and master—\nstrong names indeed,\nyet their essence lies in knowing their core.\n\nOnly the ignorant fail to know me.\nBecause they are ignorant,\nthey fail to grasp my subtlety.\nFew know me,\nso those who do are precious.\nThough few know me,\nif there are those who know and take me as their model,\nthis is what makes them precious.\n\nThus the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade—\nan analogy.\nWearing coarse cloth does not flaunt his beauty,\nbut conceals his outward appearance.\nCherishing jade preserves his inner truth,\nthus safeguarding his inner realm.\n\n**Chapter 72:**\nKnowing the unknown is supreme.\nTo know the subtlety of knowing—\nthough humble and insufficient,\nit is still better than not knowing.\nNot knowing what is known is a flaw.\nTo feign knowledge when truly ignorant,\nto force interpretations,\nto stray from naturalness—\nthis is the flaw.\n\nYuan Xian said:\n*\"To study the Dao yet fail to practice it—\nthis is the flaw.\"*\n\nOnly by recognizing the flaw\ndoes one avoid it.\nTo know that not knowing is a flaw,\nand to seek true knowing to dispel ignorance—\nthus, no flaw remains,\nand one is free from it.\n\nThe Sage is free from flaw,\nfor knowing the essence of knowing,\none is free from flaw.\nBecause one recognizes the flaw,\none is free from it.\nThis is also why teaching others\nto remove their ignorance\nleads to their freedom from flaw.\n\n---\n\nThe people do not fear coercive power,\nyet great power arrives.\nThis is not the power of ordinary rulers—\nthose who rely on reputation, color, punishment, and law.\nThe Dao values only knowing.\nWithout knowing, morals collapse,\nand violence and theft arise—\nthus great power lies within.\n\nDo not narrow your dwelling,\nfor if you narrow your comfort,\nthe Dao will not expand.\nDo not exhaust your life’s purpose.\nThe more life manifests the Dao,\nthe more it should not be exhausted.\nOnly by not exhausting it\ndoes one not exhaust it.\nBecause one does not exhaust the Dao,\none does not exhaust life’s purpose.\nJoy resides within—\nhow could there be exhaustion?\n\nThus the Sage knows himself without displaying himself,\nloves himself without valuing himself.\nHe focuses within while overlooking the external.\nHence, he discards that and embraces this—\ndiscarding self-display and self-aggrandizement,\nembracing the Dao of inexhaustibility.\n\n**Chapter 73:**\nBoldness in daring leads to death,\nboldness in not daring leads to life.\nKnowing these two,\none may gain or suffer harm.\nWhat does Heaven abhor?\nWho knows its reason?\n\nBoldness in daring is harm,\nboldness in not daring is benefit—\nboth lose the subtle harmony of *kūn*.\nWhat Heaven abhors is what opposes the Dao.\nWho knows its reason?\nIt is confusion over daring and not daring,\nnot understanding its true nature.\n\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\nHe cannot boldly dare or not dare.\nThe Way of Heaven:\nwithout contention, yet victorious,\nwithout speech, yet responsive,\nwithout summoning, yet they come,\neffortless yet masterful in planning.\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nthus it is so.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast,\nsparse yet nothing slips through.\nThe net symbolizes encompassing all things.\n*Huánghuáng*—\nits vastness.\nGreatness makes precision difficult,\nyet its response to things is like an echo—\nno loss can be spoken of.\n\n---\n\nThe people do not fear death,\nyet they seek danger as their daily pursuit,\nknowing how to advance but not retreat,\npushing one another into calamity—\nhow could this be fear of death?\n\nSeeing death before them,\nthey rush toward it—\nthus they do not fear it.\nIf one made people constantly fear death,\nand then acted strangely,\nI could seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\n\nFear of death and dread of killing\nwould make the wicked few,\nwhile indifference to death and contempt for killing\nleaves the wicked unchanged—\nwhat benefit is there for teaching and transformation?\n\n*Qí*—evil.\nNow, because they do not fear death,\nthey dare not take killing upon themselves.\nLet those who hold authority kill.\nWhen crimes are manifest,\nlet the authorities execute them—\nthis is sufficient to deter and encourage.\n\nTo usurp the authority to kill\nis like a substitute carpenter wielding the adze—\nan analogy.\nThe master carpenter has his lines and sharp tools,\nyet does not carve recklessly,\nthus able to shape things into vessels.\nFor a substitute to wield the adze—\nfew escape injury to their hands.\nInjured hands mean losing the method.\nTo usurp the authority to kill\nis like a substitute carpenter—\nit will fail and cause harm.\n\n---\n\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThey do not know that giving is taking,\nyet plunder is rampant,\nfood is insufficient—\nthus they hunger.\n\nThe people are hard to govern\nbecause their rulers act excessively.\nLaws and edicts multiply,\nthieves and bandits abound.\nThe more rulers act,\nthe more the people rise in exhaustion,\nhoping to escape punishment,\ntheir deceits multiplying—\nthus they are hard to govern.\n\nPeople’s indifference to death\ncomes from their excessive pursuit of life.\nThey are lost in pleasure,\nforgetting their sorrows—\nthis is human nature.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who value it.\nNot clinging to life—\nthis is the subtlety of the Dao.\nFollowing nature effortlessly,\nnot forcing things,\nthus wiser than those who value life,\nfor they have attained the Way.\n\n**Chapter 76:**\nThe people are soft and weak in life,\nfirm and strong in death.\nTheir nature is still, forgetting passions,\nsimple and unadorned—\nthus they may preserve longevity.\nAs desires grow,\nthey no longer fear death—\nhence, *\"soft and weak in life, firm and strong in death.\"*\n\nAll things, grasses and trees,\nare soft and brittle in life,\ndry and withered in death.\nIn life, like young onions—\ntouch them, and they break.\nGreedy for life, striving to grow,\ntheir strength exhausted,\nthey must meet their end—\nthis too has its nature,\nlike that of humans.\nThus, *\"soft and brittle in life, dry and withered in death.\"*\n\nThus, those who are firm and strong are the servants of death,\nwhile those who are soft and weak are the servants of life.\nWhen desires grow strong,\nthey must contend with others;\nwhen their form is robust,\nthey are bound to be exploited by others.\nThe soft and weak—\nno one competes with them,\nno craftsman takes them—\nhence, the distinction between life and death.\n\nTherefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,\nthe strong in wood perish.\nWhen arms are pushed to their utmost,\nthey reveal inevitable defeat—\nhence, *\"do not conquer.\"*\nWhen wood is pushed to its utmost,\nit reveals withering and decay—\nhence, *\"perish.\"*\nThey perish together in their decay,\nall by nature’s logic.\n\nThe strong and great are lowly,\nthe soft and weak are exalted.\nThe strong and great have no room to spare—\npushed to their limit, they easily falter.\nThe Way of the lowly preserves endurance.\nThe soft and weak have room to spare—\nnot yet reaching their limit,\nall give unto them.\nThe benefit of the lowly—\nall things follow this.\n\n**Chapter 77:**\nIs the Dao of Heaven like the drawing of a bow?\nThe high are pressed down,\nthe low are lifted up,\nthe overabundant are diminished,\nthe insufficient are supplied.\nThis is the bow’s tension—\nunrelenting yet never exhausted.\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the overabundant\nand supplements the insufficient,\nbalancing all things in due measure—\nthus it is so.\n\nBut the Dao of humankind is not so:\nthey diminish the insufficient to serve the overabundant.\nThey speak of insatiable greed,\nyet overlook the harmony of perfect balance.\n\nWho can serve the world with what they have in excess?\nOnly those who have attained the Dao.\nThe Dao’s use is vast and boundless,\nbenefiting all things without end—\nthus, they always have excess to serve the world.\n\nHence, the Sage acts yet does not cling,\ncompletes the task yet does not dwell—\nthis is the mystery of having excess.\nThey do not desire to be seen as virtuous.\nIf they cling to their deeds and dwell in their achievements,\nthen their virtue is revealed—\nthis is not the Dao of the Sage who has attained the Way.\n\n**Chapter 78:**\nIn all things, none are weaker than water,\nyet none can conquer the strong as water does—\nthere is nothing to replace it.\nWater’s virtue benefits all things:\nit enters filth and flows downward—\nhow else but through softness?\n\nThose who attack the strong rely on force and defy nature,\nthus they cannot conquer water’s softness.\nThere is nothing to replace it—\nits logic is natural, unalterable.\nHence, softness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nall know this, yet none can practice it.\nWater is seen by all,\nnot a difficult thing to know.\nYet none can practice it—\nthis shows the Dao is unclear,\nand those who revere the Dao are not steadfast.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the land’s impurities—\nthis is to be its sovereign.\nTo bear the land’s misfortunes—\nthis is to rule the world.\"*\nThey speak of enduring filth and accepting impurities without end,\nfor then the Dao is practiced and virtue grows greater—\nthis is what the world bestows upon them.\nStraight words seem like their reverse.\nThey appear contrary to what is straight.\nTo bear impurities is to be the sovereign of the land,\nto bear misfortunes is to rule the world—\nin speech, it seems not the truth,\nyet in principle, it is most true.\n\n**Chapter 79:**\nTo reconcile great grudges,\nthere will always be lingering grudges.\nHaving grudges is better than having none,\nyet reconciling them requires strength—\nthus grudges breed grudges,\nand lingering grudges arise.\n\nHow can one do good?\nThis is not the good of goodness.\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract and does not demand accountability from others.\nThe left contract is what the common people cannot see—\nit is also the meaning of embracing *yang*.\n\nWhen the left contract is applied, people will inevitably follow it,\nso there is no need to demand accountability from others before the Dao is fulfilled.\n\nThus, those with virtue hold the contract,\nwhile those without virtue hold the tally.\nThe left contract is what the highest virtue holds—\nwhen highest virtue exists, it aligns with the Dao;\nwithout highest virtue, there is no alignment—\nhence it is called *tally*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites,\nit always sides with those who are good in their practice of the Way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 80:**\n\nIn small states with few people,\nlet there be tens and hundreds of implements,\nyet they are not used.\n*Le* means few—\nfew people means few needs,\nno competing desires,\nand one may resemble the subtlety of the Dao,\npreserving wholeness, returning to simplicity.\nThe tens and hundreds of implements are not entirely unused—\nthey are simply not contended for.\n\nLet the people value death and not move far away.\nEach person suffices to preserve the intent of life,\nso they cherish death.\nWith few desires and little seeking,\nthey need not travel far to pursue gain.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthey have no use for them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to display them.\n\n「Let the people return to knotting cords to record their needs.\nWith few desires and easy contentment, they share without contention,\nso boats and carriages may remain idle,\nand armor and weapons may be laid aside.\nThe governance of knotted cords—\na practice of the ancient age when people were pure—\nnow revived, proves the verification of preserving wholeness and returning to simplicity.\n\nLet them find sweetness in their food,\nbeauty in their attire,\ncomfort in their dwellings,\nand joy in their customs.\nThis is the ease of self-sufficiency.\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them—\nspeaking of their untamed yet orderly ways.\nWhen people reach old age and die,\nthey do not visit one another.\nEach does not covet what the other has,\nfor purity in its fullest form compels such conduct.\n\n**Chapter 81:**\nFaithful words are not ornate,\nornate words are not faithful.\nWords are used to manifest teaching and convey principle—\nwhy bind them to beauty or ugliness?\nTo adorn words with beauty\ndoes not necessarily mean sincerity,\nbut gaining trust becomes difficult.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe good act in accordance with the Way before them,\nwithout relying on empty rhetoric.\nWhen empty rhetoric flourishes,\nhow can it be the Way of the truly virtuous?\n\nThe wise do not boast of knowledge,\nthose who boast of knowledge are not wise.\nKnowledge resides within the heart,\nunspoken yet all-pervading;\nto claim knowledge as vast\nis not truly so—\nit risks the suspicion of ignorance,\nand such boasting arises from it.\n\nThe sage does not hoard.\nEstablishing teaching and manifesting principle,\nthey do not always align with others—\nthe Way is not something to be privately stored and accumulated.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses,\nthe more one shares with others, the more one has.\nWith clear understanding and penetrating insight,\nthe Way is vast and virtue broad—\nteaching others as one teaches oneself,\nlike the source of rivers and seas,\none need not fear lack or scarcity.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nthe Dao of the sage acts without contention.\nThe Dao of Heaven and the sage’s Dao,\nin their application, are one—\nbenefiting nature’s essence,\nacting at the beginning of things,\nwithout harm or contention,\nthus fully realizing the subtle and profound use of the Way.\n\n*The Daoist Classic of Virtue and the Way, Explication, Volume Two, ends.*」",

aid and support the ruler in governing the world,\none must not rely on arms for coercion.\n\nIn ancient times, the Miao people defied the commands of Great Yu,\ndancing with feathered weapons on both steps,\nuntil after seven decades, the Miao were subdued—\nthis was the case of not relying on arms for coercion.\n\n*Return* means to revert.\nThough arms may slay and harm,\nwhen they do not align with righteousness,\nhuman emotions and *qi* will vie for dominance,\nso that vengeance lurks in the shadows,\nand grudges fester in the interstices,\nday after day, month after month,\nnever ceasing, this is the clear proof of affairs returning naturally.\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nthorns and punishments arise.\nAfter a great army,\nthere will surely be years of calamity.\nThis illustrates the grave harm of relying on arms for coercion.\n\nThus the virtuous one acts decisively,\nbut does not dare to take strength in it.\nAct decisively without boasting,\nact decisively without arrogance,\nact decisively without presumption.\n\n*Virtuous* refers to one who virtuously aids the ruler.\n*Decisive* means boldness, triumph, resolution, and mastery.\nTo act decisively is to act with boldness.\nWhat is decisive?\nIt is not boasting, not arrogance, not presumption.\nWhen decisive action is unavoidable,\nthis is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.\n\nThough one may boast without arrogance,\nwithout arrogance, without presumption,\nyet the enemy is strong and has lost the Dao even more,\nthen arms and warfare must be employed to restore order—\nthis is the unavoidable use of them.\n\nThough victory is won through arms,\none does not take pride in it,\nfor when softness nurtures and strength grows old,\nit is the way to welcome distant guests with grace—\nthis is called *not* the Dao,\nand *not* the Dao means ruin is near.\nThis elaborates the principle of the Dao’s virtue.\n\nStrength grows old when it cannot be further enhanced,\nthus it is said to be old.\nWhen old, it fails to generate,\nthus it is said to be *not* the Dao.\nWhen the Dao is lost, things have no foundation,\nthus it is said to be ruined.\n*Ruined* means cessation.\nWhen things lack adaptability and change,\nand come to a halt,\nthen decay and ruin follow,\nwhich is not the Dao’s wondrous application.\n\n**Chapter 31:**\nA great army is an ill-omened instrument.\n*Great* means vast.\n*Ill-omened* means inauspicious.\nBecause it is vast yet inauspicious,\nthose who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\nA gentleman values the left in peace,\nbut values the right in war.\nThe left represents *yang*,\nthe right represents *yin*.\n*Yin* is not the proper use of the Dao.\n\nArms are an ill-omened instrument,\nnot the instrument of a gentleman.\nEmphasizing this again,\nit clarifies that arms are truly ill-omened,\nand cannot be the instrument of a gentleman.\n\nWhen arms must be used unavoidably,\none should do so with calm equanimity—\nthis is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.\n\nVictory without delight,\nyet those who delight in it—\nthese are those who take pleasure in killing.\nArms must necessarily kill,\nwhich is not a delightful matter.\nTo delight in it is to defy the virtue of cherishing life,\nand to flaunt the traces of cruelty—\nit is clear that arms are not the instrument of a gentleman.\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\ncannot achieve their ambitions in the world.\nHe who harms others,\nothers will surely harm him,\nand his affairs will return naturally—\nthus he cannot achieve his ambitions in the world.\n\nIn auspicious matters, the left is honored;\nin inauspicious matters, the right is honored.\nThe left general is stationed on the left,\nthe right general on the right—\nthis is to treat them with funeral rites.\nWhen many are killed,\none laments and weeps with sorrow,\nand victory is marked with funeral rites.\nThis means one should not seek inauspiciousness to gain auspiciousness.\n\nTo seek inauspiciousness is to follow sorrow and lamentation,\nwhich is not what human nature delights in.\nNow repeating this,\nit clarifies that arms cannot be depended upon,\nand that this principle is inevitable.\n\n**Chapter 32:**\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nNames cannot be fixed,\nso it is the nameless Dao.\nIt flows in transformation,\nadapting to myriad uses,\nnever confined to one form—\nthus it is called nameless.\n\nThough simplicity is small,\nthe world does not dare to submit to it.\n*Simplicity* refers to the Dao before its dispersion.\nBefore dispersion, its form is unfathomable,\nso it can be described as small.\nWhen it transforms and reaches all things,\nvast and boundless, leaving none untouched—\nthus the world does not dare to submit to it.\n*Submit* is used to illustrate the meaning of humility.\n\nIf lords and kings could preserve simplicity,\nall things would naturally come to honor them.\nIf they preserve the Dao in its simplicity,\npure and unadulterated,\nall things will submit to its transformation,\nlike the Dao’s wondrous workings.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\nThis is the utmost harmony.\nSweet dew speaks of the harmony reaching down to all things.\nNo one commands it,\nnot because human strength can compel it.\nWhen it is evenly distributed,\nit nourishes all things without bias or partiality.\n\nAt first, there were names established;\nnames were already established.\nOnce Heaven and Earth were divided,\nnames came into being from that division—\nthere must be a beginning.\nThe proliferation of life,\nhow could it be without names to speak of?\n\nKnowing when to stop is also knowing.\nKnowing when to stop is the way to avoid peril.\nWhen things are many and names are numerous,\nit lies in knowing when to stop to govern them.\nNot knowing when to stop,\nthings will be exhausted and blocked—\nthus the danger of ruin arises.\n\nCompare the Dao’s presence in the world\nto rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.\nRivers and valleys contain the sea,\nand nourish all things,\nwithout leaving the slightest trace unfulfilled—\nthus they are taken as an analogy.\n\n**Chapter 33:**\nHe who knows others is wise,\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who overcomes others has strength,\nhe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nWisdom and strength\nare actions external to oneself.\nEnlightenment and power\nare actions internal to oneself.\nEnlightenment means self-examination without oversight,\npower means advancing the Dao with steady progress.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nGaining one without seeking two,\ncontentment lies in the heart—\nthis is how true wealth lies not in abundance.\n\nHe who acts with power has resolve.\nResolve lies in the heart;\nacting with power in the great Dao also lies within—\nwhat else is enlightenment?\n\nHe who does not lose his place endures.\nGaining his place means he is at ease in the Dao,\nand at ease in the Dao means he can endure.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\nDeath cannot be avoided;\nwhen form and *qi* are exhausted,\nthis is the common fate of all living beings.\nYet he who does not perish\nis one who, through self-knowledge and self-mastery,\nknows contentment and acts with power,\nwithout losing his place—\nthis is the true meaning of longevity,\nnot to be compared with the mere hundred years of ordinary people.»",

does not lose virtue/power refers to boasting of his virtue/power,\nthus risking its loss.\nIf one fears losing it, he will go to any lengths,\nso the people observe his actions and despise him.\nHow then can he still speak of virtue/power?\n\n*The Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"You alone do not boast,\nso none under heaven can contest your ability.\nYou alone do not claim,\nso none under heaven can dispute your merit.\"*\n\nThe virtue/power of the superior acts without doing,\nyet nothing is left undone.\nSilently nurturing the primal transformation,\nit is contained within the heart.\nThings follow their natural course,\nwithout need of self-assertion,\nyet its brilliance is manifest in all.\nThis is the one who does nothing yet achieves all.\n\nThe virtue/power of the inferior acts with doing,\nyet nothing is truly accomplished.\nBecause it does not lose its virtue/power,\nits actions become burdensome.\nThus, the Dao/Way grows distant,\nand wisdom is obscured.\n\nThe benevolence of the superior acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe righteousness of the superior acts yet has something left undone.\n\nBenevolence means cherishing life and abhorring killing—\nits application extends to all things,\nthus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.\nNot boasting nor presuming over things,\nits traces are unseen by all,\nthus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.\n\nRighteousness means judging, taking, or giving as appropriate—\nits application to things is said to act yet leave something undone.\n\nThe superior ritual acts yet finds no response,\nso it forces compliance with repeated insistence.\n*Reng* means \"repeated,\" \"frequent.\"\n\nRitual governs people,\nmaking them submit to its order.\nWhat aligns with ritual is right,\nwhat does not is wrong.\nRight and wrong must be contested,\nand if it does not conform to external teaching,\nonly coercion can enforce it,\nthus it is said to force compliance with repeated insistence.\n\nRepetition leads to inconsistency,\nfrequency leads to carelessness—\nto compel them to follow ritual,\none loses the natural Dao/Way.\n\nThus, one loses the Dao/Way and then virtue/power,\nloses virtue/power and then benevolence,\nloses benevolence and then righteousness,\nloses righteousness and then ritual.\n\nRitual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet it is the beginning of chaos.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way is complete,\nvirtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual can all be embraced as one.\nNow, having lost the Dao/Way,\nthings are distinguished by category,\nand virtue/power appears alone, with doing and use—\nunnatural, contrary to the Way.\nThus, when virtue/power is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,\nwhen benevolence is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,\nwhen righteousness is lost, it seeks support in ritual.\nAs distinctions grow ever more refined,\nloyalty and trust thin out,\nthough one may wish to reunite them,\nit is impossible.\nThus, ritual is said to be the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\n\nPresumptuous knowledge is the ornament of the Dao/Way,\nyet it marks the start of foolishness.\n\nPresumptuous knowledge refers to prior understanding of things.\nKnowing their ultimate goodness and acting accordingly,\nlike the flower of a grass or tree—\nthis is the Dao/Way’s ornament displayed outwardly.\nIgnorant of their ultimate evil yet acting accordingly,\nit cannot be concealed,\nthus it is said to mark the start of foolishness.\n\nTherefore, the true man of Dao/Way abides in its depth,\nnot in its shallowness,\ndwells in its substance,\nnot in its ornament.\nThe depth is free from blemishes in the Dao/Way.\nThe shallowness is the virtue/power of the inferior,\nbenevolence, righteousness, and ritual.\nThe substance is the inner application—\nthe Dao/Way of harmony and balance.\nThe ornament is the outer application—\nthe constant practices of life.\n\nWithout doing, in purity and stillness—\nwhy borrow from its ornament?\nThus, one abides in depth and substance.\n\nTherefore, abandon that and take this.\n*That* refers to inferior virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual.\n*This* refers to the great Dao/Way, the virtue/power of the superior.\nBy reason, its abandonment and adoption\ncan surely not be confused.\n\n---\n\nChapter 39: Those who once attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe spirit attained the One and became responsive,\nThe grain attained the One and became abundant,\nAll things attained the One and came to life,\nKings and lords attained the One and ruled the world aright.\n\nTheir attainment of the One:\nThe One is the mysterious application of the great Dao/Way.\n*Attainment* means reaching its mysterious application.\n\nHeaven without clarity would fear fragmentation,\nEarth without tranquility would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit without responsiveness would fear stagnation,\nThe grain without abundance would fear exhaustion,\nAll things without life would fear annihilation,\nKings and lords without noble elevation would fear ruin.\n\nFragmentation means incompleteness,\nupheaval means unrest,\nstagnation means short-lived,\nexhaustion means prone to collapse,\nannihilation means no continuation,\nruin means instability—\nall are consequences of losing the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, nobility rests on humility as its foundation,\nelevation rests on lowliness as its base.\nThings follow their natural course—\nthis is their inherent pattern.\n\nTherefore, kings and lords call themselves lone and childless,\nnot storing grain—\nis this not their way of resting on humility as foundation?\nIndeed, it is.\n\nThey employ the Dao/Way of humility toward the lowly.\nCalling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—\nthis is the utmost in humility.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and benefits humility,\nThe Dao/Way of Earth transforms fullness into flowing humility,\nGhosts and spirits harm fullness and bless humility,\nHuman nature abhors fullness and loves humility.\"*\n\nHumility shines bright,\nlowliness is unblemished—\nthis is the end of the true

behind—\nthough many wagons were used, none boasted of their purpose.\nYet the wagon was without a wagon.\n\nThe merit of kings and lords,\nthose who aid all things, is very great.\nCalling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—\nhow is this different from the wagon being without a wagon?\n\nThey do not wish to gleam like jade,\nnor to stand out like stone.\n*Gleam like jade* refers to

instruction.\n\n**Chapter 43**\nThe utmost softness in the world\novercomes the utmost hardness.\nThe Dao/Way is subtle and void—\nhow could it not be called soft?\nIt does not contend with things,\nyet when used, it moves;\nwhen gathered, it hides—\nhow could it not be called hard?\nWithout entering the unbroken,\nwithout form—\nthis is the wondrous Dao/Way.\nWithout question,\nit penetrates all without obstruction.\nWhen the wondrous Dao/Way acts,\nit transforms without measure,\nthus preserving the subtlest principles.\n\nTherefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* [non-action].\nThe benefits of *wuwei*\nare awakened by those who grasp the Dao/Way—\nnot easily understood by the common multitude.\nSilent teaching,\nthe benefits of *wuwei*—\nfew in the world attain them.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons proceed,\nand all things are born.\"*\nThus, few attain it.\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWhich is more intimate—name or body?\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater harm—gain or loss?\nName is the adornment of the Dao/Way,\nwealth is its delusion,\ngain is its burden,\nthe body is its foundation.\nWith the body, one may observe teaching and practice the Dao/Way.\nThus, name is not more intimate than the body,\nwealth not more abundant,\ngain not more secure than loss.\nTherefore, excessive love leads to great expenditure,\nhoarding leads to great loss.\nThose who fear losing their love\nmust dissipate their vital essence.\nThose who fear losing their hoard\nmust always feel deficient.\nThus, there is regret over great expenditure,\nand anxiety over great loss.\n\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nknowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one may endure long.\nKnowing sufficiency means not loving excessively.\nKnowing when to stop means not hoarding.\nIn harmony with the Dao/Way and teaching,\neven if one does not wish to endure long,\nhow could it be otherwise?\n\n**Chapter 45**\nGreat fullness seems deficient,\nyet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat excess seems empty,\nyet its use is boundless.\nTo seem deficient and empty\nis not to be self-satisfied or false.\nThus, it is neither exhausted nor boundless.\n\nThe most straight seems bent,\nthe most skillful seems clumsy,\nthe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nBent, it is not straight;\nclumsy, it is not skillful;\ntongue-tied, it is not eloquent.\nStraightness has its time to shine,\nskill its time to act,\neloquence its time to be employed.\nThe sage, profound in the Dao’s subtlety,\nconceals its use and awaits the moment—\nthus can it be so.\n\nCold is overcome by vigor,\nheat by stillness—\nthis is the natural order.\nClarity and tranquility are the standard for the world.\nClarity and tranquility\nare the result of *wuwei*.\nIf I practice *wuwei*,\nthe people will naturally align.\nThus, clarity and tranquility\ncan be the standard for the world.\n\n**Chapter 46**\nWhen the world is in the Dao/Way,\nwarhorses are turned to plowing fields.\nWhen the world is without the Dao/Way,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nThose in the Dao/Way use clarity and tranquility,\ntheir hearts free from contention—\nthus, warhorses are turned to plowing.\nWhen the world is at peace,\nall cherish life,\nso fields are manured,\nsoil enriched,\nand borders made fertile—\nself-sufficient in food, their bellies full.\nWithout the Dao/Way, desires and greed arise,\nplacing them in lands of contention.\nThe greater resort to arms to vie for victory—\nthus, warhorses breed in the suburbs,\nfor they do not gather in battle.\nNo greater crime than indulging desire,\nno greater calamity than not knowing sufficiency,\nno greater fault than coveting gain.\nDesire is for those who hold name as intimate,\nnot knowing sufficiency is for those who hold wealth as abundant,\ncoveting gain is for those who see loss as harm.\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\nThose who know sufficiency\nhave one and do not covet two,\nhave little and do not covet more—\nthough the external world is chaotic,\ntheir inner clarity is serene.\nOne and little are already burdens—\nhow much more so insufficiency?\nThus, those who know sufficiency are always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 47**\nWithout leaving one’s door,\none knows the world;\nwithout looking out the window,\none sees the Dao/Way.\nThe sage takes unity as the standard for the world,\nthus, without relying on doors or windows,\nwhat is known and seen is even more distant.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThe senses have their limits—\nthus, it is said, the less one knows.\nTherefore, the sage acts without going,\nknows without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\nThe vast Dao/Way\nknows the movement and stillness of action,\ndiscerns the truth and falsity of names,\njudges the greatness and smallness of achievement—\nthus, it does not wait for self-action to know,\nself-perception to name,\nself-effort to accomplish.\n\n**Chapter 48**\nStudying brings daily increase,\npracticing the Dao/Way brings daily decrease.\nLearners progress gradually,\nfrom little to much—\nthus, it is said, there is increase.\nWhen the Dao/Way is complete,\nits use is hidden,\nits clarity concealed—\nthus, it is said, daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*.\nIn *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.\nEmpty, pure, and tranquil—\nseen, it is not seen;\nheard, it is not heard—\nthus, there is no fear of decrease.\nDecreasing to *wuwei*\nis the subtlest of the Dao/Way.\nIn *wuwei*, nothing remains undone—\nas if nothing were lost in the decreasing.\n\n**Chapter 49**\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\ntaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nAdapting to things, governing with measure,\nteaching according to circumstances—\nthus, no fixed heart.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nthe unvirtuous, I also treat as good—\n*virtue/power* is goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\n*virtue/power* is trustworthiness.\nSpeech is uniform, without favor or aversion.\nGoodness and trustworthiness of *virtue/power*\nmake the world regard them as good and trustworthy.\nThe sage, amidst the world’s chatter,\nblends the hearts of the people.\n*Wǒngwǒng*—[restless and fearful].\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"All day long, diligent and earnest,\nat night, vigilant as if in peril—\nno blame.\"*\nTaking the hearts of the people as one’s own,\none does not reveal one’s own capacities.\nBlending, one outwardly aligns with the people\nwhile inwardly

this so?\n\n「以其生生之厚。」\nBecause their attachment to life is profound.\n\n「物性本不生不死，专用死以为死，是故以生为生，随生而死，随死而生，是厚於生也，故曰生生之厚。」\nBy nature, things neither live nor die—\nyet death is invoked to make them

*clarity*?\n\n「守柔曰强。揉曲木者不累日，销金者不累月，此柔弱胜刚强之义也。」\nTo guard softness is called *strength*—\nbending crooked wood requires no days,\nmelting gold no months—\nthis is the meaning of softness overcoming

original transformation is boundless,\nTo govern the people,\nAll receive blessings,\nThus jade tablets and horses cannot be compared to the Dao.\n\nWhy the ancients valued this Dao,\nWas it not because it was not sought daily and obtained?\nOr because it could absolve guilt and avert evil?\n\nTherefore, it is most valued by the world.\nPractice it, and it is perfect;\nThus it is not sought daily.\n\nIt aligns with principle and propriety,\nThus it is not a matter of guilt.\n\nThe Dao is as such,\nTherefore the world values it most.\n\n**Chapter 63:**\nTo act with non-action,\nTo manage without managing,\nTo savor without savoring.\n\nTo act with non-action—then what is done does not hinder.\nTo manage without managing—then matters are not repeatedly burdened.\nTo savor without savoring—then its flavor is not diminished.\n\nThose who know its essence,\nCan conclude it in a single word;\nThose who do not know its essence,\nWill endlessly ramble.\n\nGreat and small, much and little,\nRepaying grievances with virtue.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nIn summary, encompassing what is not uniform.\n\nRepaying grievances with virtue—\nGentle, harmonious, clear, and tranquil,\nWithout harboring malevolence,\nThe wondrous application of the Dao.\n\nSeek difficulty in what is easy,\nAchieve greatness in what is minute.\n\nThe world’s difficult matters must be done in ease,\nThe world’s great matters must be done in the minute.\n\nThus the sage never does what is great,\nAnd so can achieve what is great.\n\nWhat is easy is the foundation of difficulty,\nWhat is minute is the root of greatness,\nThus difficulty and ease follow one another,\nGreatness and smallness succeed one another,\nLike a cycle without end.\n\nThe sage knows this truth,\nBelieves in its principle,\nThus he preserves what is small and guards what is low.\n\nLight promises bring few trusts,\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties.\n\nThis is also the natural order.\n\nIt is said first, \"Seek difficulty in what is easy,\"\nDifficult matters are done in ease,\nLest people treat ease lightly.\n\nThus it is said, \"Light promises bring few trusts,\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties,\"\nTo reveal that matters progress gradually.\n\nTherefore, the sage avoids what is difficult,\nAnd so forever has no difficulties.\n\nKnowing the Dao of difficulty,\nHe treats the end as carefully as the beginning,\nDifficulties cannot obstruct its wondrous application,\nThus he forever has no difficulties.\n\n**Chapter 64:**\nIts stability is easy to uphold,\nIts unmanifested state is easy to plan.\n\nAct before there is danger or trace.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nGovern before there is chaos.\n\n\"Act before there is manifestation,\nGovern before there is chaos.\nLittle force yields great results.\"\n\nA tree of arms’ embrace,\nGrows from a hair’s tip;\nA nine-tiered terrace,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n\nSpeaking of the gradual growth from subtle beginnings to completion.\n\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper loses it.\n\nExerting utmost force to act,\nThe utmost force will bring ruin;\nExerting utmost force to grasp,\nExcessive grasping will cause loss.\n\nThus the sage acts with non-action,\nAnd so never meets ruin;\nHe grasps without attachment,\nAnd so never loses.\n\nIllustrating the higher meaning.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs,\nThey often fail when near completion.\n\nThe foolish demand to finish matters,\nThe wise observe what has not yet sprouted.\n\nBuilding a mountain nine *ren* high,\nIts labor fails at one *zan* short—\nCommon shallow perception,\nThus success and failure are as such.\n\nTreating the end as carefully as the beginning,\nThen there is no failing matter.\n\nPreserving fullness and guarding completion,\nCan ensure lasting duration,\nThus there is no failing matter.\n\nTherefore, the sage desires what is undesired,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;\nDifficult-to-obtain treasures are what the great desire.\n\nDesiring what is undesired,\nThen one reaches the utmost of desirelessness.\n\nLearning what is not learned,\nThe Dao is spread through virtue,\nAnd there is nothing left to learn.\n\nReturning to what others have erred,\n*Return*—to reverse.\n\nTo reverse what others have erred,\nIs not to share in their errors.\n\nTo aid all things in their natural course,\nWithout daring to act.\n\nTo aid all things in their natural course,\nIs not to rely solely on one’s own strength.\n\nNot daring to act,\nThus he displays the Dao of aiding without acting.\n\n**Chapter 65:**\nThe ancients who excelled in practicing the Dao,\nDid not do so to enlighten the people,\nBut to bewilder them.\n\nThe bewildered have no knowledge,\nThe enlightened have much knowledge.\n\nKnowledge and wisdom vie with one another,\nThey stray from virtue and violate the Dao,\nNot fitting for those who excel in practicing the Dao.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern,\nBecause their knowledge is too much.\n\nAlready difficult to govern,\nThey further use their knowledge and wisdom,\nHow much more so if enlightened to aid their chaos?\n\nTherefore, governing with knowledge is a state’s ruin;\nNot governing with knowledge is a state’s blessing.\n\nUsing knowledge causes one to lose their natural course,\nThus it is likened to ruin.\n\nTo govern things with principle,\nTo aid with adaptability,\nWhat calamity could there be?\n\nKnowing these two things is also a standard model.\nIt cannot be neglected,\nThe same for ancient and modern,\nTaking the standard model as a parable.\n\nAlways knowing the standard model,\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\n*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,\nIt opposes things,\nOnly then does it reach the utmost harmony.\n\nThough called a standard model,\nIt has no visible form,\nThus it is said, *Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant.\n\nThings pursue profit,\nAnd cunning deceits arise.\nThe Dao is natural,\nThus it opposes things.\n\nOpposing those who stray from the Dao,\nThis is the utmost harmony,\nThere is none who does not conform,\nThus it is called *great harmony*.\n\n**Chapter 66:**\nThe rivers and seas become kings of the valleys,\nBecause they excel in descending.\n\nA metaphor.\n\nRivers and seas are lowly,\nGreat and capacious,\nAll streams flow to them,\nThus they are above all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the sage wishes to be above others,\nBy his words

harmony of *kūn*.\nWhat Heaven abhors is what opposes the Dao.\nWho knows its reason?\nIt is confusion over daring and not daring,\nnot understanding its true nature.\n\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\nHe cannot boldly dare or not dare.\nThe Way of Heaven:\nwithout contention, yet victorious,\nwithout speech, yet responsive,\nwithout summoning, yet they come,\neffortless yet masterful in planning.\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nthus it is so.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast,\nsparse yet nothing slips through.\nThe net symbolizes encompassing all things.\n*Huánghuáng*—\nits vastness.\nGreatness

advance but not retreat,\npushing one another into calamity—\nhow could this be fear of death?\n\nSeeing death before them,\nthey rush toward it—\nthus they do not fear it.\nIf one made people constantly fear death,\nand then acted strangely,\nI could seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\n\nFear of death and dread of killing\nwould make the wicked few,\nwhile indifference to death and contempt for killing\nleaves the wicked unchanged—\nwhat benefit is there for teaching and transformation?\n\n*Qí*—evil.\nNow, because they do not fear death,\nthey dare not take killing upon themselves.\nLet those who hold authority kill.\nWhen crimes are manifest,\nlet the authorities execute them—\nthis is sufficient to deter and encourage.\n\nTo usurp the authority to kill\nis like a substitute carpenter wielding the adze—\nan analogy.\nThe master carpenter has his lines and sharp tools,\nyet does not carve recklessly,\nthus able to shape things into vessels.\nFor a substitute to wield the adze—\nfew escape injury to their hands.\nInjured hands mean losing the method.\nTo usurp the authority to kill\nis like a substitute carpenter—\nit will fail and cause harm.\n\n---\n\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThey do not know that giving is taking,\nyet plunder is rampant,\nfood is insufficient—\nthus they hunger.\n\nThe people are hard to govern\nbecause their rulers act excessively.\nLaws and edicts multiply,\nthieves and bandits abound.\nThe more rulers act,\nthe more the people rise in exhaustion,\nhoping to escape punishment,\ntheir deceits multiplying—\nthus they are hard to govern.\n\nPeople’s indifference to death\ncomes from their excessive pursuit of life.\nThey are lost in pleasure,\nforgetting their sorrows—\nthis is human nature.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who value it.\nNot clinging to life—\nthis is the subtlety of the Dao.\nFollowing nature effortlessly,\nnot forcing things,\nthus wiser than those who value life,\nfor they have attained the Way.\n\n**Chapter 76:**\nThe people are soft and weak in life,\nfirm and strong in death.\nTheir nature is still,
