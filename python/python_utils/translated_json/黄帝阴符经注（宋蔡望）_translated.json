  "full_translation": "**Huangdi Yin Fu Jing Zhu (The Commentary on the Huangdi Yin Fu Classic) – Cai Shi’s Annotation**\n\n**Upper Section**\n\nTo observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp Heaven’s operations—this is all there is.\n\nThe Dao divides into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth divide into the myriad things. Among the myriad things, humanity is the most refined. Originally, it shares the same substance as Heaven and Earth, yet what humanity receives from Heaven and Earth is pure or mixed in differing ways. Thus, one must observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its operations, for then the Dao resides within oneself.\n\nWhen speaking of Heaven, one does not speak of Earth, for Earth is contained therein.\n\nHeaven has five \"bandits\"—those who perceive them flourish.\nThe five \"bandits\" dwell in the heart and manifest in Heaven’s operations.\nThe cosmos lies within the palm; myriad transformations arise from the body.\n\nThe five \"bandits\" are the Five Phases.\nThe good of the world arises from these five; evil also stems from them. Hence, reversing the speech, they are called \"bandits.\"\n\nThough the five \"bandits\" belong to Heaven and Earth, they are also the very means by which Heaven and Earth were formed.\nDescending into humanity, they become this mind.\nIf one recognizes their workings, one can apply them to Heaven and Earth, and thus creation rests within oneself.\nHence it is said: *Those who perceive them flourish.*\n\nHeaven’s nature—humanity.\nHumanity’s heart—a mechanism.\nEstablish Heaven’s Dao to settle humanity.\n\nWhat Heaven and Earth possess as nature is tranquil and boundless, unseen and unattainable.\nYet what humanity inherits is the very nature of Heaven and Earth.\nThus it is said: *Heaven’s nature is humanity.*\n\nHumanity’s heart acts spontaneously, unaware of its own workings—that is the mechanism.\nThe reason Heaven moves and Earth remains still is this mechanism.\nThis mechanism in humanity—what cannot it achieve?\nTo become Yao and Shun, or Jie and Zhou—both are the mechanism.\nOnly by establishing Heaven’s Dao can it be settled, and wisdom attained.\nThus, when it departs, principle is restored.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise upon the land.\nWhen humanity unleashes the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert.\nWhen Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the foundation of myriad transformations is set.\n\nThe killing mechanism is the mechanism’s excess.\nWhen the *qi* of Heaven and Earth exceeds, anomalies appear and dragons and serpents rise upon the land.\nWhen the human heart exceeds, intentions and thoughts arise, and Heaven and Earth invert.\nWhen Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the Dao is present—Heaven’s intent and humanity’s emotions align.\nYet Heaven’s order has its norms, Heaven’s ranks have their rites—these are humanity’s greatest principles.\nWestern learning regards this as the \"worldly net\" and rejects it, yet it cannot be shaken because the foundation of myriad changes is fixed and unalterable.\n\nNature has skill and clumsiness; it can be concealed.\nThe nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials, which can be moved or stilled.\nThe sage’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth, yet commoners cannot—because of differing skill and clumsiness.\nOnly by knowing how to conceal can the clumsy become skilled.\nHumanity’s inability to conceal stems from the nine orifices’ evils.\nThough there are nine orifices, the essentials are three: the ears, eyes, and mouth.\nKnowing how to move and still them, three cycles suffice to purge the nine orifices of evil.\n\nThe eyes must see, the ears must hear, the mouth must speak—these cannot be stilled. Yet movement never departs from stillness; stillness is not mere inaction—thus one speaks of moving and stilling.\n\nFire arises from wood; disaster strikes and overcomes.\nTreachery arises in the realm; when the time comes, it collapses.\nTo know and refine this is to be a sage.\n\nFire arises from wood, yet sometimes it consumes the wood.\nTreachery arises in the realm, yet sometimes it must collapse.\nThe mechanisms of the five \"bandits\" follow this pattern.\nTo know and refine this—who but the sage can do so?\nThe method of refinement is the doctrine of moving, stilling, and concealing.\n\n**Middle Section**\n\nHeaven generates and Heaven kills—this is the Dao’s principle.\nGeneration and killing are the Dao’s descent into *qi*, natural and inescapable.\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of the myriad things;\nThe myriad things are thieves of humanity;\nHumanity is the thief of the myriad things.\nWhen the three thieves are appropriate, the Three Powers are at peace.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate the myriad things yet also kill them.\nThe myriad things generate humanity yet also kill it.\nHumanity generates the myriad things yet also kills them.\nBecause they generate yet also kill, reversing the speech, they are called thieves—just as the five \"bandits\" are named.\n\nYet when generation and killing are rightly measured, the three thieves are appropriate.\nWhen the three thieves are appropriate, Heaven and Earth are in their place, and the myriad things flourish.\nThus it is said: *Eat in season, and the hundred limbs are in order.*\n*Stir the mechanism, and myriad transformations are at peace.*\n\nHeaven and Earth and the myriad things are governed by humanity. If humanity eats in season, the hundred limbs are in order; if it stirs Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms, myriad transformations are at peace.\nThis is the Dao of thievery.\n\n*Season* refers to the early and late of spring and autumn.\n*Mechanism* refers to generation, killing, growth, and nurturing.\n\nHumanity knows the divine’s divinity but does not know how the non-divine is divine.\nThe divine is the uncanny and unfathomable.\nThe non-divine are Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, the moving and growing things.\n\nHumanity knows the uncanny as divine, yet Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, and the moving and growing things—though perceived by ear and eye—are unknown in their divinity.\n\nThe sun and moon have their numbers; great and small have their limits.\nFrom this, sagely functions arise, and divine clarity emerges.\n\nThe sun and moon—humanity does not know their divinity.\nThe sun’s number is great, completing three hundred sixty days;\nThe moon’s number is small, completing three hundred sixty *chén* (constellations).\nHeaven and Earth’s transformations do not exceed three hundred sixty.\nThus, the sage’s functions arise from knowing this alone;\n\nThe **Dao/Way**’s divinity thus manifests—from this alone.\n\nThose who **steal the mechanism** (of the Dao) are unseen by the world, unknowable by all.\nThe **gentleman** (君子) who attains it safeguards his own life,\nwhile the **petty man** (小人) who attains it risks his very fate.\n**Stealing the mechanism** refers to the five thieves (五贼) rampant between Heaven and Earth—\nthe **numbers of the sun and moon** (日月之数) as previously mentioned.\nTo see and know them is to curb the three thieves (三盗),\nand thus the Three Talents (三才) find harmony.\n\nYet, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun (黄帝尧舜) gained renown and longevity,\nwhile Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei (苏张申韩) perished, their families slaughtered—\nall through the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe people can be made to follow it,\nbut not to understand its workings.\nHow profound the words!\n\n**Next Section:**\nThe blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight.\nSevering one source of profit, the teacher’s strength is tenfold;\nreversing three cycles of day and night, the teacher’s strength is ten thousandfold.\nThe blind and deaf, their **will** (志) undivided, one suffices for ten.\n**Reversing three cycles** refers to the eyes, ears, and mouth (目、耳、口).\n**Return** (反) means to restore to their origin.\nDay and night (昼夜) are the movements of **yin and yang** (阴阳).\nOnce the three are restored,\nthey transcend the movements of **yin and yang**,\nand thus grasp the unity of day and night—\none life and one death—\none suffices for ten thousand.\nThis is the *Yì* (《易》)’s **mighty and non-slaying** (神武而不杀).\n\nThe **heart** (心) is born from things, dies from things—\nthe **mechanism** (机) lies within the eyes.\nThe **heart** perceives through things—this is being born from things;\nit pursues things and is lost—this is dying from things.\nThe **orifices** (窍) through which humans encounter things number nine,\nbut the **vital points** (要) are three,\nand the eyes are the most crucial of these three.\n\nLǎo Dān (老聃) said:\n*\"Do not see what is desired, and the heart will not be disordered.\"*\nConfucius replied:\n*\"The eyes of self-mastery (克己之目) must first be disciplined—\nand sight (视) is the means to achieve this.\"*\n\nIn the West, the discussion of the six senses and six cognitions (六根六识)\nmust first mention the eye and color (眼、色)—\nall this is the **will** (意).\n\nHeaven’s lack of favor yet gives rise to great kindness.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nnone escape its **unfathomable power** (蠢然).\n\nThe **favor without favor** is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nOnly when there is **favor without favor** can true **favor** arise;\nonly when there is **non-action** can true **action** be achieved—\nthis is the **virtue/power** of the Sage, multiplied tenfold,\nand only through **threefold return** can it be attained.\n\nThe **supreme joy** leaves **virtue/power** in excess;\nthe **supreme stillness** maintains **virtue/power** in moderation.\nHeaven’s **most private** work is deployed with **most public** **virtue/power**.\nThe **control** of things lies in **qi**.\n\nThe **supreme joy** has no **affairs**, thus **virtue/power** overflows,\nand it can anticipate the world’s concerns before they arise;\nthe **supreme purity** is unstained, thus **virtue/power** is unblemished,\nand it can share in the world’s calamities as its own.\nThis is the **Dao/Way** of **threefold return** and **non-action** at its peak—\nthe work of one who does not pluck a single hair.\nYet Heaven’s **Dao/Way**, though **most private**, is applied with **most public** **virtue/power**,\nso **supreme joy** and **supreme purity** are the means by which **action** arises.\n\nSo too with things.\nWhat may be taken from things is called **prey**—\nyet when all things subdue one another,\nwho among them **acts** with intent?\nIt is merely the **natural** working of **qi**.\nThe tiger and leopard do not conquer the **qilin** through their own prowess,\nnor does the eagle and falcon subdue the **phoenix** by their own strength.\nThis is the **threefold return** of day and night,\nby which one attains to **one against ten thousand**.\n\nLife is the root of death;\ndeath is the root of life.\n**Favor** arises from harm;\nharm arises from **favor**.\nLife, death, **favor**, harm—\nthe **Dao/Way** is never otherwise.\nThis is why frost and snow, though destructive,\nbestow **supreme favor**,\nand why rain and dew, though nourishing,\nembody **supreme endurance**.\n\nPushed to its limit, one finds that even in **non-being** and **being**, **stillness** and **movement**,\nthere is never a moment without their mutual exchange—\nthus, what seems **correct** may appear as its **opposite**.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** as **sagely**,\nbut I see the **patterns of time** and the **principles of things** as **wise**.\nPeople perceive Heaven’s **patterns** and Earth’s **principles** and call them **sagely**,\nyet they do not know *why* they are **sagely**.\nI discern Heaven and Earth’s **sageliness** through the **patterns of time** and the **principles of things**.\nHeaven’s **patterns** follow seasons;\nEarth’s **principles** follow things—\nthis is **wise** understanding.\n\nWhen speaking of Heaven and Earth’s **constants**, their **Dao/Way** is thus;\nwhen speaking of what **transforms**, it is also thus.\nThis is observing Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\ngrasping Heaven’s **actions**,\nuntil one is in harmony with the **day and night**,\nand in unity with **Creation**—\n**movement** and **stillness** in perfect accord.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s* *Yin-Shu Jing* *commentary concludes.*",
