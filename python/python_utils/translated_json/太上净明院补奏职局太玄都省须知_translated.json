Court**\n\nThe Great Mystery Capital is the exclusive office of the Jade Emperor’s decrees.\nWithin this office are two ranks of officials: the Literary Grove and the Martial Grove.\nThe Literary Grove oversees matters of composition, records, and ritual propriety;\nThe Martial Grove oversees the suppression of evil and the execution of punitive expeditions.\nBoth ranks are filled by those who practice the Daoist arts, promoted according to merit.\nWhile living, they hold provisional appointments; upon death, they receive formal investiture—this is the standard procedure.\nIf, however, one possesses extraordinary abilities or exceptional achievements, their name recorded in the Mystic Register, the Perfected and Sages may grant formal investiture directly.\nAlternatively, those whose blessings and conduct warrant it may have their souls temporarily assigned to a rank, their judgments rendered in dreams by celestial law.\nThose whose past lives are recorded in the registers of spirits and deities, who secretly uphold heavenly statutes, whose hearing and vision are as keen as the heavens, whose minds align with the celestial, and whose spirits commune with the unseen—these are formally commissioned and assigned ranks accordingly.\nAnnual reviews are conducted, and after one year, they enter the Cavern Spirit Literary Hall.\n\n—**Literary Grove**\n*Director of the Great

For dispatched officials, add: \"Your subject is presently at [location] and departed for [destination] on [month and day].\"\n\nFor memorials and petitions, include the subject’s name and title, and seal with the phrase \"respectfully and truthfully sealed.\" Fold the corner, and affix seals at both ends. If no seal is available, sign in full. Do not affix yellow slips to the cover. For external memorials, note only \"confidential\" or \"urgent.\" For letters, omit titles, names, and years at the beginning. Replace \"memorial\" with \"report,\" and conclude with \"awaiting your decree.\" Submit directly to the appropriate office without passing through subordinate bureaus.\n\nFor urgent documents, use a notice format, omitting the year, partial sheets, and sealing. For minor written matters during silent memorials, face north, proceed with the ritual, and burn the document before the incense burner.\n\n**Format for Memorials of Recommendation** (e.g., for transmitting Daoist teachings):\n- List the official’s name and title.\n- State: \"In accordance with the statutes or regulations, I briefly outline the criteria for recommendation.\"\n- \"Your subject [name] has observed that [official’s name] meets the intended purpose. I now recommend them as qualified for [position], etc.\"\n- \"Should discrepancies arise later, I shall abide by the celestial statutes and respectfully submit this memorial for your decree.\"\n- If the recommended individual is elsewhere, refer to the \"immortal decree\" and conclude with the date.\n\n**Single Memorial Format**:\n- For a bureau submitting a report, state the title and matter.\n- If no specific cause is given, begin with \"The undersigned respectfully reports as follows,\" then list the matters.\n- Conclude: \"The above memorial is respectfully submitted as stated. [Bureau name] respectfully memorializes.\"\n- If awaiting instructions, add: \"Awaiting your command.\"\n- End with the date and the submitter’s title.\n\nAll subordinate offices use this format.

If no seal is available, sign in full. Do not affix yellow slips to the cover. For external memorials, note only \"confidential\" or \"urgent.\" For letters, omit titles, names, and years at the beginning. Replace \"memorial\" with \"report,\" and conclude with \"awaiting your decree.\" Submit directly to the appropriate office without passing through subordinate bureaus.\n\nFor urgent documents, use a notice format, omitting the year, partial sheets, and sealing. For minor written matters during silent memorials, face north, proceed with the ritual, and burn the document before the incense burner.\n\n**Format for Memorials of Recommendation** (e.g., for transmitting Daoist teachings):\n- List the official’s name and title.\n- State: \"In accordance with the statutes or regulations, I briefly outline the criteria for recommendation.\"\n- \"Your subject [name] has observed that [official’s name] meets the intended purpose. I now recommend them as qualified for [position], etc.\"\n- \"Should discrepancies arise later, I shall abide by the celestial statutes and respectfully submit this memorial for your decree.\"\n- If the recommended individual is elsewhere, refer to the \"immortal decree\" and conclude with the date.\n\n**Single Memorial Format**:\n- For a bureau submitting a report, state the title and matter.\n- If no specific cause is given, begin with \"The undersigned respectfully reports as follows,\" then list the matters.\n- Conclude: \"The above memorial is respectfully submitted as stated. [Bureau name] respectfully memorializes.\"\n- If awaiting instructions, add: \"Awaiting your command.\"\n- End with the date and the submitter’s title.\n\nAll subordinate offices use this format. For memorials to the **Eastern Marchmount** and the like, note the date and time of dispatch at the top.\n\n**Memorandum Format**:\n- \"[Bureau name] memorandum to [recipient bureau/official]: Regarding [matter], etc.\"\n- List the matters as above.\n- Conclude: \"Respectfully submitted. Memorialized on [year, month, day]. [Official’s signature and seal].\"\n- For non-subordinate offices, use this format. For divine memoranda, replace the bureau name with the individual’s name, omitting blank spaces.\n- Even for subordinate offices without memorial precedents or equal status, use the above format.\n- For offices under jurisdiction without formal memorandum procedures, address the memorandum to \"[location/official]\" without blank spaces, and conclude with the date and the official’s signature.\n\n**Format for Offices with Separate Jurisdictions but Shared Subordination** (e.g., **Celestial Way Institute’s** memorandum to the **Immortal Registers Section** of the **Heavenly Pivot**):\n- Use the standard memorandum format.\n\n**Decree Format**:\n- \"[Bureau name]: Regarding [matter], etc.\"\n- Conclude: \"This decree is issued to [recipient]. Upon receipt, comply accordingly. [Year, month, day]. [Official’s signature and seal].\"\n- Use this format for subordinate offices (e.g., issuing to **Community Deities**).\n\n**Slip Format**:\n- \"[Bureau name]: Regarding [matter], etc.\"\n- Conclude: \"This slip is issued to [recipient official]. The above matters are as stated. [Year, month, day]. [Submitter’s signature].\"\n- Use this for dispatching divine generals, healing rituals, and other matters (e.g., with a date reference).\n\n**Proclamation Format**:\n- \"[Bureau name]: Regarding [matter], etc.\"\n- Conclude: \"This proclamation is issued to [recipient]. The above matters are as stated. [Year, month, day]. [Submitter’s signature].\"\n- For other matters, conclude with \"The above matters are as stated.\"\n\n**Seals for Use**:\n- Memorials to the Supreme Emperor: **Pure Clarity Institute Seal**, **Upper Memorial Office Seal**.\n- Communications to the Heavens: **Supreme Mystery Province Seal**.\n- Communications to the Nine Earths: **Pure Clarity Dharma Master Seal**.\n- Prayers and deliverance rituals: **Dao Lord Seal**.\n- Healing, dispatching generals, talismanic summons, and spirit convocations: **General Supervisor of Ghosts and Spirits Seal**.",
