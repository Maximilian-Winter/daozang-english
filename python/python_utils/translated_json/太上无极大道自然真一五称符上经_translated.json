  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture*. Also known as *The Numinous Treasure True Unity Fivefold Invocation Scripture*. The author is unknown, approximately dating to the Eastern Jin dynasty, belonging to the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. Originally in one scroll, later divided into two. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Shenfu* category. Collated with the Dunhuang manuscript P.2440.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture, Scroll One**\n\nThis was treasured by the Supreme Venerable in the Purple Tenuity Terrace, concealed by the host of perfected ones in renowned mountains and grotto-chambers, and once secreted in the northern shade of Mount Lao.\n\nLord Lao said: At the inception of primordial chaos, the subtle and wondrous source. Before the separation of heaven and earth, there existed the *Numinous Treasure Spontaneous True Writ*, prior to the image of the Sovereign. I am the profound gateway of the *Numinous Treasure Great Dao*, receiving its essence and subtlety, thereby becoming the spirit of heaven, earth, and humanity. When the five talismans divided the clear and turbid qi, I was about to depart. The *Talismanic Scripture* was secreted in the Purple Chamber, transmitted without end.\n\nGe Xuan said: The Dao’s practice is without end.\n\nLord Lao said: The *Supreme Numinous Treasure* arose before heaven, earth, and the myriad things, riding the constant of the formless, empty, and cavernous Dao, operating through the limitless and non-action to spontaneously coalesce as the natural. Its nobility cannot be named; its honor has no superior—thus it is called *Supreme Venerable*. Vast, it encompasses all; minute, it pervades all. Its principle is subtle and unfathomable, the origin of heaven, earth, and humanity. In heaven, the five stars circulate qi, the sun and moon radiate light; on earth, the five peaks establish their dominion, mountains rise high and seas plunge deep; among humans, the five viscera are secure. Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could heaven shine? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could earth manifest form? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could spirits enter darkness? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could humans attain life? Thus, heaven, earth, and humanity—three and five—unite in darkness, becoming one. Therefore, the teeming myriad things take me as their root, me as their gate. What is this root and gate? I possess the *Numinous Treasure Writ*, which enables one to journey to the Penglai Prefecture and be received as a perfected one. Entering the Bright Hall at the center of the heavens, passing through the Jade Armillary, ascending the Limitless Purple Palace, one is ordained as a *Dao Lord*. Descending to govern the myriad things, returning to the Central Plains, it is secreted in the northern shade of Mount Lao. The Five Thearchs succeeded one another, and it must not be recklessly transmitted; reckless transmission invites deadly calamity.\n\nLord Lao said: When a serpent obtains the *Numinous Treasure*, it transforms into a divine dragon; when birds and fowl obtain it, they become phoenixes; when ordinary beasts obtain it, they change into qilin; when commoners obtain it, they are called sages. What is a sage? One who possesses the *Perfected Writ of Penetrating Sagacity*, able to ingest it constantly, roaming the Five Peaks in play, wandering carefree in the great void, altering the five viscera, transforming form and countenance, accumulating essence and simplicity, commanding the service of ghosts and spirits, penetrating the ten directions, appearing and vanishing unpredictably, ascending heights and riding clouds, journeying afar to the Highest Clarity, proceeding to the Penglai Prefecture to be received as a perfected one, ascending to the Purple Palace to pay homage, merging merits and virtues with the great sagely and honored spirits. Formerly, the Yellow Thearch received it and ascended as the *Supreme Unity Emperor Lord*, leading the Five Thearchs to ascend to heaven together—this is the way of ascending immortals. Those who revere this scripture and single-mindedly make offerings to it shall have their names entered into the Golden Watchtower of the Supreme Venerable and be titled *Perfected Immortals*.\n\nLord Lao said: When a state is about to flourish, it cultivates and attains this writ. Those who desire wealth, honor, and agelessness must attain the *Numinous Treasure*. If the Son of Heaven obtains it, phoenixes will come to pay homage, the five stars will align in harmony, the sun and moon will radiate brilliance, the four directions will submit in tribute, the world will be clear and peaceful, inauspicious omens will not arise, the feudal lords will return in allegiance, and his longevity will match heaven and earth, enduring for ten thousand generations without decline. If a feudal lord obtains it, the constellations will contain their light, benefiting the state and harmonizing the household, his rank ascending to promotion, enjoying long life and enduring vision, ultimately preserving himself from calamity. If a grandee obtains it, his longevity will extend without end, his rank and emoluments will be weighty, ascending to the status of marquis or lord with a salary of two thousand bushels. From petty officials to commoners, gazing upward and looking downward, they will penetrate the numinous and divine, their minds opening and inner brilliance arising, foreknowing the yet-to-be, attaining high office and wealth, jade pendants chiming, extending years and increasing longevity, with descendants filling the hall. If a woman obtains it, she will become a queen or consort to a king, jade lads attending her, blue-waisted maidens by her side, bearing noble children with countenances like jade blossoms, her longevity matching the sun and moon, her radiance flowing through the Three Luminaries.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: Since ancient times, the utmost Dao has been conferred upon kings. Those among the Dao who bear immortal names have encountered this scripture in their time; revering and upholding it, they inevitably attain transcendence, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, receiving the offerings of kings and lords, preserving their lives and bodies, increasing their lifespan, safeguarding their ancestral temples, pacifying their states, and eternally enjoying supreme fortune. My words are absolute.\n\nLord Lao said: *Numinous* means the Dao’s penetration. Able to penetrate the great Dao to the utmost numinous, one commands the service of the myriad spirits. *Treasure* means able to preserve oneself alongside heaven and earth—thus it is called *Numinous Treasure*. *Supreme Venerable* is the utmost honor of the Dao. *Five* refers to the talismanic mandates of heaven, earth, and humanity. *Cavernous Mystery* means uniting with the great origin of the empty and cavernous true. The mother of the Five Phases—thus it is called the *Fivefold Spontaneous Talisman*. Above, it corresponds to the five stars, regulating and summoning the Five Dipper alliances; below, it manifests in the five peaks, the Five Phases sharing a root, centrally treasuring the five viscera, the root of the five Dao paths, the Five Tones harmonizing in succession. If a Daoist obtains it, the five viscera transform the self, penetrating the numinous of heaven, commanding the service of the myriad spirits, summoning traveling kitchens while seated, riding clouds and driving dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, able to ascend and descend, transforming unpredictably, indulging desires and following inclinations. The Dao’s methods are not burdensome; secrete it in a jade coffer, and take care not to transmit it lightly. This scripture can endure countless kalpas, forever without end.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord said: \"Heaven and earth have their kalpic cycles and appointed times, yet the Dao is without end.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Eastern Year Star Great Emperor Gou Mang’s Numinous Treasure Eastern Talisman is named *Tongming*. The Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, governs an office of four thousand three hundred persons, surnamed Liu, styled *Gaiging*. The Direct Talisman Azure Waist Jade Maiden presides over it in the liver. Within the body, it governs the two eyes and the left flank. It rules the East, its season is spring, its phase is Wood, its tone is *jue*, its color azure, its number nine, modeled on Heaven’s Lesser Yang qi. Its beast is the Azure Dragon, its days *jia-yi*. If Daoists seek divine transcendence, longevity without aging, and the service of the myriad spirits, they should use azure silk as the ground, cinnabar ink for the script, store it in an azure pouch, and wear it on the left elbow. Cultivate virtue and practice the Dao, and the spirit will come of its own accord. The common people may take azure stone, carve the talismanic script in cinnabar, and place it to guard the East.\"\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord said: \"Each of the Five Thearchs received one scroll of the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Natural True Writ, which was later divided into five scrolls. Their root is the same as that single scroll. That single scroll is the Dao’s true writ, pervading heaven, earth, and the ten thousand directions.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the complexion of the common people suddenly changes and their mouths turn green, the liver must be afflicted—Wood is injured by Metal. Swiftly perform the Southern *cheng* talisman and place it in the West; perform the Northern *cheng* talisman and place it in the East. Then make and ingest the Eastern *cheng* talisman to pacify the spirit, prolong life, and cure the illness. After twenty-seven days—three times nine—the myriad illnesses will all be healed. This is what is meant by \"deliverance in peril, revival from death.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people seek wealth, pursue women, make binding vows, plan good deeds, or wish for success; when they present petitions to the noble, resolve lawsuits, or redress grievances—it is the Azure-Waisted Jade Maiden who presides over these matters. Those who desire such blessings and wishes should first perform the Eastern *cheng* talisman for forty-five days—five times nine—then follow with the Northern *cheng* talisman.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people’s livelihood falters, wealth gathers only to scatter, plans for construction or calculation fail, ambitions are thwarted, they are envied by others, falsely accused, with grievances unvoiced and hardships unspoken—those who wish to dispel such calamities and absolve such transgressions should first perform the Eastern *cheng* talisman for ninety days, then follow with the Northern *cheng* talisman for fifty days.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Southern *cheng* talisman of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, the Vermilion Thearch of the Blazing Star of the South, is called \"Yang-Pervading.\" The Southern Marchmount Hengshan’s office governs nine hundred ninety persons, surnamed Huang, or alternatively Chen, styled Youlin. The talisman is presided over by the Vermilion Jade Maiden, who governs the heart. In the body, she rules the mouth, lips, tongue, and chest. The South is ruled by summer, its element Fire, its note *zhi*, its color red, its number three, corresponding to the qi of the Three Luminaries and the Great Yang. Its beast is the Vermilion Phoenix, its days *bing-ding*. Daoists seeking divine transcendence, longevity without aging, and the service of the spirit-spirits should use red silk as the ground, yellow ink for the script, store it in a red pouch, and wear it over the heart. Cultivate virtue and practice the Dao, and the spirit will come of its own accord. The common people may take red stone, carve the talismanic script in yellow, and place it to guard the South.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord said: The Southern Thearch received one scroll.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the complexion of the common people suddenly changes and their mouths turn red, the heart must be afflicted—Fire is injured by Water. Swiftly perform the Central *cheng* talisman and place it in the North; perform the Eastern *cheng* talisman and place it in the South. Then make and ingest the Southern *cheng* talisman to pacify the spirit, prolong life, and cure the illness. After forty-two days—six times seven—all illnesses will be healed. This is what is meant by \"revival from qi-extinction, reopening of the sealed mouth.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people wish to repel weapons, ward off tigers and wolves, secure their persons, protect their households, ensure the prosperity of descendants, maintain harmony within and without, be welcomed when seen and missed when absent; when they wish to avoid conscription, travel far without misfortune, thwart others’ schemes, prevent harm from befalling them, block the path of treachery, seal the gate of monstrosities, turn curses back upon the curser, reverse hexes to afflict the hexer, sever the breath of officialdom, and cut off the source of slander—it is the Vermilion Jade Maiden who presides over these matters. Those who desire such blessings and wishes should perform the Southern *cheng* talisman for twenty-seven days—three times nine—then follow with the Eastern *cheng* talisman.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people suffer from sores and wounds, are harried by livestock, plagued by illness, lose children and grandchildren, endure family discord, or engage in internal and external strife; when they curse one another, cry out to Heaven in resentment, harbor grudges, or secretly cast hexes; when the spirit-guardians scatter and depart, returning to the Celestial Thearch’s observation, no longer offering protection; when treachery enters their gates and monstrosities arise in their chambers; when they are conscripted and do not return, travel far and do not come back, are entangled in slander, or oppressed by officials—those who wish to dispel such calamities and absolve such transgressions should first perform the Southern *cheng* talisman for thirty days, then follow with the Eastern *cheng* talisman for ninety days.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Western *cheng* talisman of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, the White Thearch of the Grand White Star of the West, is called \"Yin-Pervading.\" The Western Marchmount Huashan’s office governs one thousand persons, surnamed Zhou, styled Yuanqi. The talisman is presided over by the White-Silk Jade Maiden, who governs the lungs. In the body, she rules the two ears and the right flank. The West is ruled by autumn, its element Metal, its note *shang*, its color white, its number seven, corresponding to the qi of the Seven Stars and the Lesser Yin. Its beast is the White Tiger, its days *geng-xin*. Daoists seeking divine transcendence, longevity without aging, and the service of the myriad spirits should use white silk as the ground, black ink for the script, store it in a white pouch, and wear it on the right elbow. Cultivate virtue and practice the Dao, and the spirit will come of its own accord. The common people may take white stone, carve the talismanic script in black, and place it to guard the West.\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord said: The Western Thearch received one scroll.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the complexion of the common people suddenly changes and their mouths turn white, the lungs must be afflicted—Metal is injured by Fire. Swiftly perform the Northern *cheng* talisman and place it in the South; perform the Central *cheng* talisman and place it in the West. Then make and ingest the Western *cheng* talisman to pacify the spirit, prolong life, and cure the illness. After thirty-five days—five times seven—all illnesses will be healed. This is what is meant by \"revival from the brink of death, restoration to life without need of medicine.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people wish to serve their lord, attend their teachers, win their favor, gain their trust, receive special favor and respect, excel in learning, advance in office, cross rivers and seas, enter mountains and marshes, achieve their desires, profit in trade, block the path of illness, and seal the gate of misfortune and calamity—it is the White-Silk Jade Maiden who presides over these matters. Those who desire such blessings and wishes should perform the Western *cheng* talisman for forty-nine days—seven times seven—then follow with the Central *cheng* talisman.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When one offends their lord and is banished, displeases their teachers and is dismissed, finds all actions and retreats without merit, loses office and rank, suffers from a blocked mind, repeatedly drowns when crossing rivers and bridges, encounters peril and terror when entering mountains and marshes, loses money in trade, suffers from unending illness, and faces ceaseless death—those who wish to dispel these disasters and absolve these transgressions should first perform the Western *cheng* talisman for seventy days, then follow with the Central *cheng* talisman for ten days.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Northern *Chen* Star, the Black Emperor Zhuanxu’s Numinous Treasure Northern *Cheng* Talisman, bears the name \"Communing with the Divine.\" The Northern Peak, Mount Heng, governs an office of two thousand, whose overseer is surnamed Xu, styled Ziya. The Straight Talisman is presided over by the Great Mystery Jade Maiden, who rules the kidneys. In the body, she governs the waist, navel, yin, and both feet. She reigns over the north, corresponds to winter, embodies the phase of water, resonates with the *yu* tone, manifests in black, aligns with the number five, follows the *qi* of Greater Yin, is symbolized by the Dark Warrior, and governs the days *ren* and *gui*. Those Daoist adepts who seek immortality, everlasting life, and the command of myriad spirits should inscribe the talisman on black silk with blue-green ink, store it in a black pouch, wear it on the back aligned with the heart, cultivate virtue, and practice the Dao—then the spirits will come of their own accord. The common people may carve the talisman’s script in blue-green on black stone to guard the north.\n\nThe Perfected Lord said: The Black Emperor received one scroll.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the complexion suddenly changes and the mouth turns black, the kidneys are surely afflicted, for water has harmed earth. Swiftly perform the Eastern *cheng* talisman in the center, then follow with the Western *cheng* talisman in the north, and further create and ingest the Northern *cheng* talisman to pacify the spirit, prolong life, and cure the illness. After forty-five days—five times nine—all illnesses will be healed. This is what is meant by \"revival of ceased *qi*, restoration of sight to dimmed eyes, warmth returning to a body with scattered pulses and cold limbs, without need of shamans, acupuncture, or moxibustion.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people wish to humble the worthy and draw them to themselves, repel the wicked and flattering, win the hearts of spirits and deities, gain the favor of the people, be loved by all—men and women alike—achieve their heart’s desires and fulfill their innermost wishes, resolve others’ troubles and avert misfortune, succeed in all endeavors, have all requests granted, have all loans and petitions met with favor, seal the gate of thieves, and bar the door of loss—it is the Great Mystery Jade Maiden who presides over these matters. Those who desire such blessings and wishes should perform the Northern *cheng* talisman for twenty-five days—five times five—then follow with the Western *cheng* talisman.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people are spurned by the worthy, harmed by spirits, prone to sudden mood swings and madness, estranged from the people, forsaken by their children, increasingly foolish and erring, unable to achieve their desires, embroiled in others’ troubles only to incur blame, entangled in grudges that deepen their woes, plagued by thieves, and suffering ceaseless loss—those who wish to dispel these disasters and absolve these transgressions should first perform the Northern *cheng* talisman for fifty days, then follow with the Western *cheng* talisman for seventy days.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Central *Zhen* Star, the Yellow Emperor Wenchang’s Numinous Treasure Central *Cheng* Talisman, bears the name \"Myriad Blessings.\" The Central Peak, Mount Song, governs an office of nine hundred, whose overseer is surnamed Wu, styled Taicang.

Those Daoist adepts who seek immortality, everlasting life, and the command of myriad spirits should inscribe the talisman on yellow silk with white ink, store it in a yellow pouch, wear it at the collar aligned with the neckline—or on the head—cultivate virtue, and practice the Dao—then the spirits will come of their own accord. The common people may carve the talisman’s script in white on yellow stone to guard the center.\n\nThe Perfected Lord said: The Central Emperor received one scroll.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the complexion suddenly changes and the mouth turns yellow, the spleen is surely afflicted, for earth has harmed wood. Swiftly perform the Western *cheng* talisman in the east, then follow with the Southern *cheng* talisman in the center, and further create and ingest the Central *cheng* talisman to pacify the spirit, prolong life, and cure the illness. After twenty-one days—three times seven—all illnesses will be healed. This is what is meant by \"the return of the wandering hun and the restoration of the departed po, dispelling misfortune without need of divination.\"\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people wish for abundant harvests, thriving livestock, obedient servants who do not flee, recovery from illness, relief from official summons, victory in disputes, and auspiciousness in all matters; when they wish for those who hate them to suffer heartache and dry mouths, for those who love them to enjoy blessings without harm, for those who praise them to receive daily protection, and for those who slander them to face official judgment; when they wish to seal the door of decline and open the gate of fortune—it is the Yellow-Silk Jade Maiden who presides over these matters. Those who desire such blessings should perform the Central *cheng* talisman for twenty-seven days—three times nine—then follow with the Southern *cheng* talisman.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: When the common people suffer poor harvests, crops withered by locusts, silkworms dying in droves, livestock failing to thrive, servants fleeing, chronic hidden illnesses worsening beyond cure, hatred from others, petty disputes escalating to official summons, more misfortune than fortune, and daily depletion—those who wish to dispel these disasters and absolve these transgressions should first perform the Central *cheng* talisman for ten days, then follow with the Southern *cheng* talisman for thirty days.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Five *Cheng* Spontaneous Talismans, born before heaven and transforming with the *qi* of the Dao, are the essence of my Way.\n\nFrom this origin, heaven and earth were born, and all the myriad spirits of heaven and earth submit to the Numinous Treasure. If you wish to purify your essence-chamber in stillness, dwell in the mountains to summon the divine, avert disasters and repel harm, and merge with the Dao to attain truth, you must receive the true script of the Numinous Treasure—the root of the Way. The immortals of the ten directions and the myriad spirits of heaven and earth will come to pay homage; mountain spirits and earthly numina will all arrive in audience.\n\nIf you wish to enter the profound gate of the Great Dao of the Numinous Treasure, wear the Five Talismans upon your body, and the myriad spirits will humbly submit to you. If your bone destiny is recorded in the registers of immortals in the Upper Clarity Palace, you shall receive the Numinous Treasure scriptures, fast in purity, and wear the talismans—thus attaining longevity, never dying, never aging. You must know the location of your still chamber or mountain dwelling, the mountain range to which your household belongs, and the corresponding star of its celestial division.\n\nFor example, if your household falls under the domain of the Eastern Marchmount, begin with the Eastern *Cheng* Luminous Talisman. At the time of the Beginning of Spring, on a day when *jia* or *yi* is in ascendance, enter the fasting hall and wear the talisman according to the method. Close your eyes, clench your fists, and in your heart summon the Azure Emperor of the East, riding a green dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist ever attending at your left. Maintain a serene countenance, gaze forward, and rejoice as if beholding the divine. Visualize your liver as pure azure, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Year Star of the East, radiant azure, with an azure thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your liver. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-seven days—three times nine—the attending spirits of the East, including the Directing Scribe Shen Yuan, the Great Mystery, the deities of *jia-yin* and *jia-chen*, the officials of the Eastern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Eastern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *bing* or *ding* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Summer, perform the Southern *Cheng* Yang-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the Vermilion Emperor of the South, riding a red dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Vermilion Scepter ever attending before you. Visualize your heart as pure vermilion, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Fire Star of the South, radiant vermilion, with a vermilion thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your heart. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-four days—three times eight—the attending spirits of the South, including the Directing Scribe Lin Gang, the Pillar Scribe, the deity of *jia-wu*, the officials of the Southern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Vermilion Scepter will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Southern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *geng* or *xin* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Autumn, perform the Western *Cheng* Yin-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the White Emperor of the West, riding a white dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of White Simplicity ever attending at your right. Visualize your lungs as pure white, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Grand White Star of the West, radiant white, with a white thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your lungs. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-one days—three times seven—the attending spirits of the West, including the Directing Scribe Jian Gang, the Mystery Essence, the deities of *jia-shen* and *jia-xu*, the officials of the Western Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of White Simplicity will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Western Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *ren* or *gui* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Winter, perform the Northern *Cheng* Spirit-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the Black Emperor of the North, riding a black dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery ever attending behind you. Visualize your kidneys as pure black, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Chronographic Star of the North, radiant black, with a black thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your kidneys. Swallow as if ingesting it. After fifteen days—three times five—the attending spirits of the North, including the Directing Scribe Tian Jian, the Moon Essence, the deity of *jia-zi*, the officials of the Northern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Northern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *wu* or *ji* is in ascendance, during the seasons of the four quarters, perform the Central *Cheng* Myriad Blessings Talisman. In your heart, summon the Yellow Emperor of the Center, riding a yellow dragon to welcome you, together ascending the lofty Mount Song of the Central Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of Yellow Simplicity ever attending at your side. Visualize your spleen as pure yellow, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Quelling Star of the Center, radiant yellow, with a yellow thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your spleen. Swallow as if ingesting it. After eighteen days—three times six—the spirits of the Great Dao of the Limitless will all arrive, along with the Eight Scribes of the Ten Directions, the Six *Jia* Parents, the Six Yin and Six Yang Jade Maidens, the celestial officials and stellar lodges, the Five Agents of the Four Seasons, the immortals of the eight poles and ten directions above and below, and the myriad mountain spirits and earthly numina—none will dare to be absent.\n\nFrom this point onward, your name is entered among the immortals. All chronic illnesses and the hundred diseases will heal of themselves. Your body will be pure, your eyes bright, and your perception will penetrate the four directions. Follow the illustrated scriptures to cultivate virtue and practice the methods: in one year, your *qi* will be renewed; in two years, your blood; in three years, your flesh; in four years, your skin; in five years, your marrow; in six years, your sinews; in seven years, your bones; in eight years, your hair; in nine years, your form. When your entire body is transformed, the Great Dao is complete. The myriad spirits will come in audience, the Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure will manifest in majesty, and you will form an alliance with the four seasons. The sun and moon will unite in brilliance, and you will ascend as a guest of the Heavenly Emperor. Proceed to the Bureau of Destiny to remove your name from the register of death, and the guardians of the Gate of Life will attend you.\n\nThus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Limitless Great Dao’s Spontaneous True One Five Cheng Talismans*.\n\nThe jade pendants chime melodiously—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"silken threads of jade.\"*\nThe Jade Essence—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"Great Yang.\"*\nThose whose Dao bears immortal names—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"Daoists with immortal names.\"*\nWhen encountered—*originally \"whenever seen,\" amended per Dunhuang version.*\nTo command and employ—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"to summon and employ.\"*\nThe True and Great—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"the True Original.\"*\nCorresponding above—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"ascending above.\"*\nTo regulate—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"to sever.\"*\n*Note: The Eastern Cheng Talisman in this passage, along with the Southern, Central, Western, and Northern Cheng Talismans recorded elsewhere, differs in the Dunhuang version, where the talismanic graphs are simpler.*\n\nThe Lord Lao says—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"Laozi says.\" All subsequent instances of \"the Lord Lao says\" in the Dunhuang version read \"Laozi says.\"*\nThe Eastern Cheng Talisman—*alternate Dunhuang version: \"Eastern Victory Talisman.\" Note: All instances of \"Cheng\" (稱) in this text—Eastern, Western, Southern, Northern, Central, and Five Cheng Talismans—are rendered as \"Victory\" (勝) or \"Ascendant\" (滕) in the Dunhuang version.

If you seek the immortal Dao, you must first master the Eight Essences. The Eight Essences are the eight spirits beneath the Dao, all of whom comprehend the Mandate of Heaven. The Numinous Treasure is ever-present, halting the Eight Scribes. Within your home, divide the space into eight directions and twelve earthly branches. At each branch and outside the left and right gates, plant fourteen stalks of divine *zhi* herbs. Inscribe the Eight Trigrams and draw the Mysterious Cavern Communicating Numinous Talisman in the eight directions, placing the Five Cheng Talismans upon the central beam of the hall. This enables one to commune with spirits; within a single household, men, women, and children unite in purpose, radiant as the sun and moon, seated in awareness of the four quarters, attaining longevity and immortality, and summoning divine transcendents.\n\nPurify the hall to create a fasting chamber, twenty-four feet square, and divide it equally into eight directions and twelve earthly branches. Select fourteen individuals of upright character. First, choose the one at the central gate, stationed outside the hall’s pillar, to forbid all malevolent influences from entering within. Next, select the twelve earthly branches, beginning with *yin*, and carve each into a figure at the front of the hall—those of yang as men, those of yin as women—and install them within the hall.\n\nAt each of the twelve earthly branches’ positions, dig the earth to form a platform, leveling its surface so that its center aligns with the central point. First, at the hour of *yin* during the Spring Equinox, take a mortar of five *yin* and prepare a bath of orchid and mugwort infusion. By the fifth *mao* day, draw water to brew chrysanthemum nectar at the *yin* and *mao* positions. On the following day, select the fourteen *zhangju*. At the time of selection, clear the surroundings, arrange small mats as seats, and prepare fourteen designated places. Burn incense, offer each wine and dried meat, bow twice, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Born of the* zhangju*, body upright and pure, guarding the twelve palaces, your qi communes with spirits. Today, I unite with you, joining in divine fellowship. I take you as friend, to wander together at the southern slope of such-and-such a mountain. When I call, you shall answer; when I ask, you shall respond. Let no deceit breach our pact; let our bond be sealed in covenant.\"*\n\nAfter three libations of wine, conclude the offering. Grasp the root, carve it into human form, and assign names according to their completion, distinguishing male from female. The next dawn, when the day aligns with the Eastern Well constellation, kneel at the door and declare: *\"Your humble descendant So-and-so, having completed the bath today, enters the chamber to install the* zhangju.\" *Wait until the day of the Five Designations, then take their brushes and inscribe talismans on the corresponding days, placing them among the Five Talismans. After ten days, all will be complete; then burn incense. On the appointed day, offer sacrifices to the* zhangju *at their earthly branch positions. First, call them by their names and recite the incantation: \"So-and-so, who communes with spirits, today shares your name. After twelve branches and six cycles of ten, you shall respond to mortals on the twelfth day.\"*\n\nAfter the offering, simply burn incense, visualize the Eight Scribes, memorize their names, and gather white blossoms. Dry and process them, then ingest a square-inch spoonful within the hall to commune with the body’s spirits and befriend the Scribes. Thereafter, on days when the heavens align with the Eastern Well, dissolve the talismans, bathe again, and replace them. Repeat this process every other day as prescribed. After five baths, completing one hundred twenty-four days, the spirits will all have arrived—some may already be heard, others seen, appearing as depicted in the illustrations. The next dawn, offer sacrifices beneath the hall’s central pillar, and the spirits will converse with you. The Six Jia Jade Maidens with azure sashes and attendant wings will also arrive, though they do not speak to mortals. Thus, the Eight Scribes attend first, and you, understanding human affairs, should inquire of them the Way of divine transcendence and longevity. The Scribes enter the celestial lodgings to review the registers and relay the words to mortals. If your name is not recorded in the Register of Immortals, you remain distant from transcendence. You may only cultivate devotion to attain wealth and nobility, extending your lifespan to three or four hundred years. Merely ingesting divine elixirs, golden liquors, or mineral medicines diverges from the Dao.\n\nIf you seek longevity, command the Eight Scribes to perform transformations and summon traveling kitchens with myriad offerings, you must dissolve and place the Designation Talismans in a five-colored pouch, hanging it within the canopy of your bed. Take a vermilion brush to inscribe white silk with the Eight Trigrams’ Mystic Cavern Communion Talisman of the Eight Mighty Spirits, placing it over your heart to command them. Regularly employ the Five Talismans and *zhangju* to summon the Eight Scribes, ensuring they do not depart. The Eight Talismans govern their might and control, compelling them to remain, though they cannot fully preserve or stabilize them. Collect the *zhangju* figures, each in a leather pouch. Craft a bamboo basket shaped like a pot to hold the twelve figures, covering it inside and out with leather. Name it the Harmonious Hare’s Secret Chamber of Spirit Communion and place it within your bed’s canopy. Each dawn, bow twice and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Spirit So-and-so, ever communing with your humble descendant, I beseech you today to accompany Scribe So-and-so, riding together upon the Azure Dragon, traversing the hidden realms. Whatever is spoken today, let the two attendants at the door hear and heed, pursuing and installing the spirit at the designated door. When venturing forth, call the spirit of the current door, barring the Five Evil Specters from entering the Jade Chamber. Instead, usher in the luminous Jade Maidens of the Dao of divine transcendence, the Six Jia spirits, and all deities present today within my garments. Visualize the talisman and summon the Scribe to depart; the Scribe follows wherever you rest. If you wish to conceal your form or transform your body, visualize the Scribe at your left elbow, and you shall move unseen among crowds. To manifest auspicious omens or wondrous marvels, command the Scribe aloud to perform your bidding, leaving traces where you pause. People will speak and sounds will resonate as the Scribe enacts transformations—nothing is beyond their power.\"*\n\nOnce this Way is accomplished, you may conceal and record all things, face and perceive ghosts and spirits, sit and behold the Eight Wastes, cause the sun and moon to alternate between darkness and light, disrupt the five colors’ order of blue and yellow, alter the stars’ paths and celestial measures, make the Five Peaks shift and turn at will, and invert the four seasons’ yin and yang. In winter, grass and trees grow; in summer, frost and ice form. You may command thunder and lightning to crash and roar, clouds and mist to surge and soar. When blessings sweep in, banish misfortune and calamity. If you cultivate this, you shall be enthroned as a Transcendent King. Once transformations are mastered, all things become accessible—you may save the living, prolong the short-lived, deliver and protect boundless beings.\n\nDo not lightly scorn the world’s people or recklessly act against the Dao, lest the populace tremble in fear and pray to celestial spirits, who will hold you accountable. The Dao will then recede far from you—beware. If you employ the Scribes for three years without offending the spirits, even without a name in the Register of Immortals, the Scribes will petition on your behalf to extend your years to a thousand.\n\nThe Transcendent Duke said: Diligently establish meritorious deeds, and when your merits reach three hundred, you shall extend your lifespan to a thousand years. Meritorious deeds refer to rescuing those in peril and saving lives. You need not employ the Six Jia spirits any longer. Those who study transcendence must prioritize attaining long life and ascending to deliverance, for delivering the world is the most urgent task. Lifespans are finite; they do not wait for mortals, and one must constantly race against time—only then may death be averted.\n\nLord Lao said: When wearing the Fivefold Invocation Talisman of the Numinous Treasure into the purification hall, you may summon the yin and yang spirits of the Six Jia. This follows the proper method, though it differs from the Eight Scribes. The time limit is one hundred days, and the divine herbs used also vary. For the Six Jia purification rites, wear the talisman on the days of the four seasons, and the ritual will be complete within a year. The Six Jia hold supremacy in heaven, while the Five Dipper spirits serve merely as their subordinate officials. Over one thousand two hundred and forty days, you may invoke the Six Jia’s parents, the Six Jia Numinous Communication Chart, the Numinous Communication Talisman, and the Precious Register Chart—only then can the spirits be summoned and commanded.\n\nThe parents of the Six Jia reside in the yang regions of mountains corresponding to their respective sacred peaks. Every mountain has its attendant mountain spirits, whose affiliated peaks must be known before use. These parents are also called *Ghost Arrows*, *Ghost Supervisors*, or *Solitary Sway*. Gather their roots, which bear thirteen stalks: one great stalk stands at the center, called the Six Jia Parents, while the twelve others are positioned at the twelve earthly branches on the four sides. Those on the yang branches are the Six Jia, and those on the yin branches are the Six Ding. Bing, Wu, Geng, and Ren follow Jia; Yi, Si, Xin, and Gui follow Ding—this is the pairing of yin and yang.\n\nTake the roots and carve each into a human figure according to the chart. Recognize their earthly branches and enter the chamber, using the central character as the stalwart and sagely master. The Six Jia Parents and the twelve figures should each be assigned to their original branches, forming the Six Jia. On Jia days, offer sacrifices of wine and dried meat. By the third day of the third month, take tiger-head fur and plant it in the center of the courtyard, then water it with the blood of a sheep and a crow. This will cause the Six Jia Parents to grow anew, sprouting thirteen stalks with stalks beneath them. Their color is a true blue-green, and their sap is also blue-green. Use this sap to inscribe the Numinous Communication Talisman. All writings for the rites should be made with this sap.\n\nOnce the inscription is complete, take the roots and prepare them as powder. In the hall, consume them with well-flower water on their respective days. At sunrise, ingest the talisman; at noon, take the powder—all following the chart’s design. After three years, the Five Talismans will adhere to the four walls of the hall, while the Yellow Emperor’s Talisman will rest upon the central beam. Once the Dao is accomplished, store each in a five-colored pouch, kept within a secluded chamber.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Immortals said: \"When one’s study of the Dao reaches fulfillment, the numinous spirits of Heaven and Earth and the officials of the Three Realms’ Great Demon Kings will all come to serve—why trouble oneself with summoning the Six Jia? There is no need to perform the Six Jia Offering Rite. For those who seek immortality, ascending to the Cloudy Han and riding dragons comes first.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Supreme Numinous Treasure existed before Heaven and Earth, enduring through boundless kalpas since primordial chaos. It is the natural and true Dao. In the Dao, it is the root of the Dao; in teachings, it is the origin of all teachings. The teachings of the Ten Directions all begin with the Numinous Treasure.\"\n\nWhen you ingest the Five Talismans, the multitude of Perfected Ones will respond in kind. The Numinous Treasure manifests in the East as the Fragrant Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Entering Diligence, styled Reverent Head, governing the *Zhen* trigram, and its spirit is styled Establishing Firmness. In the South, it is the Joyous Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Unceasing Diligence, styled Enlightened Head, governing the *Li* trigram, and its spirit is styled Lunar Essence. In the West, it is the Flourishing Grove Retreat; its Perfected One is named Practicing Diligence, styled Treasure Head, governing the *Dui* trigram, and its spirit is styled Supreme Mystery. In the North, it is the Primordial Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Advancing Diligence, styled Benevolent Head, governing the *Kan* trigram, and its spirit is styled Heavenly Establishment. In the Northeast, it is the Lotus Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Compassionate Diligence, styled Virtuous Head, governing the *Gen* trigram, and its spirit is styled Solar Origin. In the Southeast, it is the Golden Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Exhaustive Diligence, styled Eye Head, governing the *Xun* trigram, and its spirit is styled Mysterious Essence. In the Southwest, it is the Treasure Grove Abode; its Perfected One is named Supreme Diligence, styled Radiant Head, governing the *Kun* trigram, and its spirit is styled Pillar Scribe. In the Northwest, it is the Vajra Abode; its Perfected One is named Single-Boundary Diligence, styled Dharma Head, governing the *Qian* trigram, and its spirit is styled Overseeing Firmness. Above, it is the Treasure Grove Palace; its Perfected One is named Utmost Diligence, styled Worthy Head, governing the Floral Canopy, and its spirit is styled Eight Essences. Below, it is the Water Essence Palace; its Perfected One is named Brahman Diligence, styled Wise Head, governing the Five-Tone Water府, and its spirit is styled Eight Scribes. The Eight Scribes are the Eight Essences of Heaven and Earth, enabling one to commune with the numinous.\n\nAll Daoist practitioners, students of immortality, and common disciples who wish to uphold the True Dao of the Ten Directions and seek the divine immortality of agelessness should ingest the Numinous Treasure, first summoning the Eight Scribes. Cultivate the numinous *zhi* herbs in the purified chambers, palaces, and spirit temples, placing them at the twelve earthly branches according to the method. Wear the Numinous Treasure’s scripture on the proper days of the four seasons. On the fifteenth day of the first month or the seventh day of the seventh month, inscribe the Fivefold Invocation Talisman of the Numinous Treasure in the purified chambers and palaces, placing it at the four directions and the center. For those placed in the purified chamber, affix them to the four walls, with the central talisman on the central beam—all concealed, hidden from the sight of ordinary people. Burn incense and perform the rites, visualizing the names of the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s True Teachings of the Ten Directions. Recite and chant the Daoist scriptures, aspiring to the lofty immortals’ flight to the Eight Scribes of the Supreme Ultimate’s府, whose names are pure and immaculate.\n\nOn the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), the hosts of the Boundless in the Northeast, the Perfected One of Compassionate Diligence, Virtuous Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Gen* trigram, Solar Origin, will come to the Great Dao Perfected One. When invoked, they will follow your body’s radiance—blue, yellow, and golden—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of ten thousand kalpas. On the day of *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), the hosts of the Boundless in the East, the Perfected One of Entering Diligence, Reverent Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Zhen* trigram, Establishing Firmness, will come. When invoked, they will follow your body’s radiance—blue as indigo—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of twenty thousand kalpas. On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), the hosts of the Boundless in the Southeast, the Perfected One of Exhaustive Diligence, Eye Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Xun* trigram, Mysterious Essence, will come. When invoked, they will follow your body’s radiance—blue, red, and yellow—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of thirty thousand kalpas. On the day of *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), the hosts of the Boundless in the South, the Perfected One of Unceasing Diligence, Enlightened Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Li* trigram, Lunar Essence, will come. When invoked, they will follow your *śarīra*—red as cinnabar—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of forty thousand kalpas. On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), the hosts of the Boundless in the Southwest, the Perfected One of Supreme Diligence, Radiant Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Kun* trigram, Pillar Scribe, will come. When invoked, they will follow your *śarīra*—yellow as gold—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of fifty thousand kalpas. On the day of *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), the hosts of the Boundless in the West, the Perfected One of Practicing Diligence, Treasure Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Dui* trigram, Supreme Mystery, will come. When invoked, they will follow your *śarīra*—white as silver—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of sixty thousand kalpas. On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), the hosts of the Boundless in the Northwest, the Perfected One of Single-Boundary Diligence, Dharma Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Qian* trigram, Overseeing Firmness, will come. When invoked, they will follow your *śarīra*—grayish-yellow and golden—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of seventy thousand kalpas. On the day of *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), the hosts of the Boundless in the North, the Perfected One of Advancing Diligence, Benevolent Head, together with the Perfected One of the *Kan* trigram, Heavenly Establishment, will come. When invoked, they will follow your *śarīra*—watery and gray—granting you, upon ingestion, a lifespan of eighty thousand kalpas.\n\nOn the days of *wu* and *ji* during the four seasons, the hosts of the Boundless above and below, the Perfected Ones of Supreme Diligence and Brahmā’s Diligence, Worthy Head and Wisdom Head, will come together with the Perfected Ones of the Eight Essences and Eight Scribes. When invoked, they will follow the radiance of your body—azure, crimson, white, black, and yellow—granting you, upon ingestion, union with the Great Dao in perfect harmony, forever boundless.\n\nAfter ingesting the talisman for one year, the hosts of the Boundless from the ten directions, along with all the Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, will arrive without exception. Before the Eight Scribes, they will follow the radiance of your body, revealing their true forms to you. Thus, immortality and eternal life are achieved.\n\nFor Daoist practitioners and common folk alike, those who cannot cultivate the methods or practice the Dao may still keep this talismanic scripture at home, carving it into stone for placement and stabilization. By deploying the *zhongzhangju* talismans, the radiance of your body will manifest naturally, granting longevity. Your heart will open, and inner illumination will arise, bright as the sun and moon. All illnesses will be cured, malevolent spirits and demonic forces will vanish, and disasters and misfortunes will be dispelled. You will attain high office and abundant emoluments, wealth like clouds, worthy sons and chaste daughters, and descendants filling your halls. Your kindness will extend to all beings, and your blessings and virtue will be towering.\n\nLord Lao says: From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, though not Daoist practitioners, those who possess karmic blessings may obtain this *Lingbao* scripture, and their lives will naturally be prolonged.\n\nIf you wish to deploy the talismans, take five large stones, each of pure color and weighing between seventy and one hundred *jin*. One stone should be pure azure, carved in vermilion with the talisman of the East; one pure crimson, carved in yellow with the talisman of the South; one pure white, carved in black with the talisman of the West; one pure black, carved in azure with the talisman of the North; and one pure yellow, carved in white with the talisman of the Center. Inscribe each with its respective text and place them to guard the five directions of your dwelling. The Five Phases will generate one another without mutual harm, all illnesses will be cured, and the five malevolences and six harms—even extraordinary disasters—will each be dispelled. You will hold high office with abundant emoluments, remain untouched by the five weapons of war, and grow ever richer, your wealth like clouds. Your life will be prolonged across generations, and your descendants will flourish.\n\nDraw the talismans of the Eight Trigrams, the Mystic Cavern, and the Eight Mighty Spirits on the eight directions, and plant the *tongshen changsheng* grass on the twelve earthly branches. This will open your heart, allowing you to perceive the four directions with clarity, foreknowing the unseen as if illuminated by the sun and moon.\n\nWhen traveling by boat or carriage, engaging in trade, crossing rivers or lakes, or entering seas, these talismans will repel wind, waves, water spirits, and pestilence, safeguarding your body and multiplying your wealth tenfold. You will avoid misfortune and constantly encounter good fortune.\n\nTake a jar shaped like a flask, and with five-colored *zou* and five-colored brushes, inscribe the spirit talismans within it. On the outside, draw in vermilion the talismans of the Eight Trigrams, the Mystic Cavern, and the Eight Mighty Spirits. After the offering ritual, clothe the jar in yellow silk, covering its mouth. Seal it with a yellow wooden tag tied with yellow silk cords, inscribing it with the talisman of the Five Stars’ Mystic Protection. Affix the seal of the Five Stars’ Mystic Protection and place the jar in your boat or carriage.\n\nWhen journeying near or far to the Five Peaks, the Four Marshes, the Five Lakes, or the Three Rivers, the spirit essences will all come to welcome and protect you. The local earth deities, mountain spirits, and even beasts like tigers and wolves will come to pay homage. Upon returning home, place the jar on the central beam.\n\nFor those seeking to avert disasters or deploy the five stones to guard their dwelling, follow the method above. On the appointed day, burn incense and gather white blossoms, drying them thoroughly. Ingest a square-inch spoonful to attain communion with spirits and summon blessings.\n\nThe white blossoms have twenty-four names: *Zhangju of the Fourteen*, *Zhangming*, *Zhangsheng*, *Zhangcao*, *Zhanglu*, *Tongshenming*, *Tongjing*, *Tongling*, *Jade Maiden*, *Household Immortal*, *Household Treasure*, *Household Zhi*, *Prolonging Life*, *Longevity Grass*, *Guardian of the Palace*, *Twelve Household Guardians*, *Night Caller*, *Night Singer*, *Attracting Essence*, *Yang Brightness*, *Yin Brightness*, *Red Kudzu*, *White Blossom*, and *Danglu*. These twenty-four names correspond to my twenty-four titles, aligning above with the twenty-four qi of Heaven and Earth. They are the sacred implements of the Daoist *Lingbao* tradition.\n\nTalismans are the mandate of Heaven and humanity. If you possess karmic destiny, obtaining my Five Talismans and the white blossoms will together summon spirit essences. Guard them carefully and do not recklessly disclose them to the world. If you rashly reveal them, you will violate the qi of Heaven, bringing calamity upon yourself and annihilation upon your seven generations of ancestors and descendants.\n\nIf the spirits inform you that someone of destined bone and fate should receive them, transmit them once every forty years to five individuals. Ensure their five notes—*gong*, *shang*, *zhi*, *yu*, and *jiao*—harmonize. On a day when the Eastern Well constellation is in the heavens, bathe and enter the chamber. Burn incense according to the numbers of the five directions: three on the left, seven on the right, nine in front, one behind, and four in the center. For twenty-four days, align with the twenty-four qi of Heaven. I reside at the Five Stars of the Center, overseeing the Five Dipper stars. The spirit lords of the Five Peaks will together ascend to the imperial throne, where the Five Emperors will bestow the talismans, granting the recipient eternal life.\n\nThe dais should be two *zhang* in length, circular at the center, and covered with layered silk mats. On an *jia* or *yi* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take three thousand gold coins to the eastern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *bing* or *ding* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take nine thousand gold coins to the southern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *geng* or *xin* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take seven thousand gold coins to the western land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *ren* or *gui* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take one thousand gold coins to the northern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion.\n\nOn a *wu* or *ji* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take four thousand gold coins to the central land or to a blessed and virtuous place in the city, and burn the mat-incense to completion. In total, twenty-four thousand gold coins are to be used, all personally prepared in purification. When burning the incense, one must not seek to harmonize the Five Tones.\n\nOn a day when the celestial lodges align with Dongjing, bathe in orchid-infused water to purify the body, observe the fast, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Begin with the eastern direction, and complete the ritual in twenty-four days. When the celestial qi is received in harmony, transmit the Five Tones.\n\nIf one begrudges wealth and arbitrarily reduces the offering, failing to align with the celestial qi, or if one transmits the scripture without proper authorization, the celestial qi will fall into disharmony, the Five Stars will not shine, the Five Thearchs will not bestow their talismans, the Five Marchmounts will not open, the Five Viscera will suffer illness, and calamity will bring about the destruction of the body.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: \"Many Daoist masters in villages and counties are poor. Now, gold and bronze coins may be used as substitutes to transmit the scriptures. Disciples must personally prepare the required offerings with reverence, observing the fast and aiding the destitute; they must not use them for private purposes. Burn the Fivefold Blended Incense to demonstrate utmost sincerity.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The *Lingbao* is the foremost of the Dao, upon which divine spirits constantly rely, and which all the sages of the heavens, earth, and realms universally revere. The Mystic Cavern’s numinous spirit-true talismans, the Three Sovereigns’ celestial writings in great script, and the root texts of the *Dongzhen* scriptures are equal to the *Lingbao*. Thus, they were first compiled into the Five-Named Talismans, while the rest were incorporated into the celestial qi, hence called the Celestial Script and the Sovereign’s Talismans. Together, they may be employed to summon and command the spirits of heaven and earth. One must first wear the *Lingbao* talisman before deploying the script, for only then can the spirits be attained. Once the spirits are attained and one relies on oneself, they will not bring misfortune to others.\n\nWithout the *Lingbao* scriptures, how can one cultivate celestial perfected beings? Be cautious in their application: if one summons spirits without consistently relying on oneself, it will instead bring misfortune to others, harming oneself and one’s descendants. Having obtained the *Lingbao* talismans, one should also acquire the *Lingbao* Charts. The Charts comprise twenty-four sections, embodying the true qi of heaven—my dharma titles, the true methods of the Great Dao.\n\nIf you seek the methods of the Dao, first bathe to remove filth and impurities, and obtain the *Dongjing Chart*. If you wish to stabilize the Five Thearchs and command mountain spirits, obtain the *Five Marchmounts Chart*. If you seek to communicate with divine spirits, first resolve the Eight Essences, and obtain the *Eight Scribes’ True Forms Chart*. If you wish to master the Five Phases and summon the traveling kitchen, obtain the *Six Jia Spirit-Communication Chart*. If you wish to preserve the Five Teeth and summon celestial spirits, obtain the *Nine Palaces Purple Chamber Chart*. If you wish to uphold the methods of the Dao, obtain the *Taiqing Chart*. If you wish to follow the Dao in compliance, obtain the *Hunchen Chart*. If you seek to grasp the mechanisms of the Dao, obtain the *Xisheng Baolu Chart*. If you wish to master the transformations of the Dao, obtain the *Linghua Chart*. If you wish to tread the celestial Dao, obtain the *Nine Heavens Chart*. If you wish to liberate your bodily form, obtain the *Nine Transformations Chart*. If you wish to conceal and preserve the spirits guarding your body, obtain the *Changcun Chart*. If you wish to stabilize your body and guard the divine treasure, obtain the *Hanying Chart*. If you wish to cultivate tranquility and guard the One to preserve your body, obtain the *Yangshen Chart*. If you wish to nurture your will in silence, obtain the *Jingcheng Shouzhi Chart*. If you wish to attain purity and whiteness to summon the mushroom spirits, obtain the *Zhiying Yunu Chart*. If you wish to summon the Six Ding, obtain the *Six Yin Jade Maidens Chart*. If you seek immortal records, obtain the *Nine-Nine Daoist Immortal Chart*. If you wish to ingest the qi of the Dao, obtain the *Daoyin Chart*. If you wish to practice the arts of the Dao, obtain the *Dongzhong Hongbao Chart*. If you wish to master transformations, obtain the *Yince Chart*. If you wish to refine the furnace and stabilize the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor, obtain the *Taiyi Chart*. If you wish to ascend the Five Marchmounts to seek divine mushroom medicines, obtain the *Kaishan Zhiyao Chart*. If you wish to protect your bodily form and repel malevolent spirits, demons, and specters, obtain the *Mingjing Chart*. Once you have obtained the *Mingjing Chart*, you should also acquire the *Hanjing Chart*.\n\nIn total, there are twenty-four true charts—my *Lingbao*. The *Dongzhong Huanglu* chapters, the *Zhonghuang Jiudu* scriptures, and their respective esoteric essential texts are all my alternate titles. All take the *Lingbao* natural talismans as their fundamental origin, mutually complementing one another to become a perfected person. If you can obtain them, you will surely attain longevity, ascending as a transcendent, soaring through the Great Clarity, where eons pass like a single day.\"\n\nThe Yellow Thearch said: \"The Celestial Elder, seeing that my humble omens did not yet comprehend the celestial qi, bestowed upon me the *Lingbao Five-Named Talisman Scripture*. I request that, following the *Dongjing* prophecies, on an auspicious day of purity, one should bathe in purification and observe the fast to receive the *Lingbao* talismans.\n\nThe proper times are:\n- The tenth day of the first month at the *ren ding* hour,\n- The eighth day of the second month at the *huang hun* hour,\n- The sixth day of the third month at the *ri ru* hour,\n- The fourth day of the fourth month at the *xia bu* hour,\n- The first day of the fifth month at the *shang bu* hour, and the twenty-ninth day at the *ri bu* hour,\n- The twenty-seventh day of the sixth month at the *ri zhong* hour,\n- The twenty-fifth day of the seventh month at the *yu zhong* hour,\n- The twenty-second day of the eighth month at the *ri chu* hour,\n- The twentieth day of the ninth month at the *ji san ming* hour,\n- The eighteenth day of the tenth month at the *ji chu ming* hour,\n- The fifteenth day of the eleventh month at the *guo ye ban* hour,\n- The thirteenth day of the twelfth month at the *ye ban* hour.\n\nThese are all times when the celestial qi and the lunar lodge align with Dongjing. On these days and hours, one should blend incense in harmony with the divine immortals, bathe, and the spirits will descend into oneself. Bathing in orchid-infused water signifies that the Daoist seeks communion with divine beings—ordinary people do not require this ritual.\n\nFurthermore, the superior method involves placing the Five Stones to pacify the household, as stated in the *Kaiming Scripture*: 'A household possessing the *Lingbao* will never age for ten thousand years. A lord possessing the Five-Named and Eight Might talismans will ensure that all treasures remain undiminished.' Thus, no further pacification is needed.\"\n\nThis must be employed in governing the people; those without this text merely perform it perfunctorily.\n\nMoreover, the *Yuzha Ji* states: The Five Talismans, known as the appellations of the Five Directions, are the true unity of the Dao. Thus, one must not place this scripture’s talismanic texts or sacred writings among common books when entering the spirit chamber or quiet room. Instead, they should always be kept within the canopy, for they communicate with the numinous Eight Talismans that command the spirits of the Eight Directions. The *August Talisman* is difficult to bear, so it is separately venerated as received, using its power to compel the Eight Spirits.\n\nThe Supreme Great Ultimate Perfected One said: After receiving this scripture, a Dao practitioner transmits it to one person every forty years. Those who have extended their lifespan transmit it to one person every four hundred years. Those who attain earthly immortality transmit it to one person every four thousand years. Those who attain celestial immortality transmit it to one person every forty thousand years. Those who attain the supreme, profoundly quiescent, Most High Perfected One transmit it to one person every forty thousand kalpas. The transmission protocols of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Great Method are thus complete.\n\nThis scripture expounds the Way of the lofty immortals who traverse the void. The Supreme’s vast and universal teachings are set forth; its profound and distant words are manifest. The mystery of the true and the subtle essence of the imperceptible cannot be contemplated or discussed.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: Thus, through the ages, all worthies have sung odes of transcendent thought.\n\nThe Supreme Mysterious Unity Perfected One said: The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* is the most profound of texts, fully conveying the intent of the Dao and the teachings of true correctness. How resplendent and wondrous its words! Reciting it for a thousand days with an empty mind and focused absorption enables one to ascend as an immortal in broad daylight, becoming a Supreme Four-Flowered Perfected One. This is the lineage of the loftiest immortals, and it can also bring blessings to the seven generations of ancestors.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* is magnificent, its marvels and profundities defying description. If a practitioner’s heart is not wholly consumed by thoughts of glory and splendor but remains inwardly and outwardly steadfast, reading this scripture in hope of attaining celestial perfection, such a goal remains unseen. Yet if one possesses the qualities of a noble person, the world will come to know that these words are not mere fabrication. To propagate such subtle and arcane teachings is like a lotus blooming in fire.\n\nOne who embodies the Dao to its utmost truth, with the six penetrations fully realized, neither lives nor dies, their virtue harmonizing with spontaneity. They soar and traverse the caverns, their body emerging unscathed from water and fire, and through the Dao, they deliver others. Though it may seem as impossible as seawater entering a hair’s pore or a lotus blooming in fire, such things cannot be declared nonexistent.\n\nAccording to the scriptures and precepts, the supreme Way is difficult to achieve. One must initiate even the smallest effort, cultivating diligently, like a traveler on a thousand-mile journey taking the first step. Only through accumulating goodness over countless kalpas can one naturally attain union with it.\n\n*Scripture of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao’s Natural True Unity and the Five-Named Talismans, Lower Scroll* concludes.\n\nThe text should read *hōngniáng* (轰娘).

the Dunhuang manuscript reads *zhòng fó* (众佛). #88 *Xiānglín guǎn* (香林馆) appears as *xiānglín chà* (香林剎) in the Dunhuang manuscript. Following the subsequent entries—*Lèlín guǎn* (乐林馆), *Huálín guǎn* (华林馆), *Shǒulín guǎn* (首林馆, *Dàolín guǎn* 道林馆 in the Dunhuang manuscript), *Liánlín wǎn* (莲林绾), *Jīnlín guǎn* (金林馆), *Bǎolín wǎn* (宝林绾), *Jīngāng guǎn* (金刚馆), *Bǎolín gōng* (宝林宫, *Yùlín gōng* 欲林宫 in the Dunhuang manuscript), and *Shuǐjīng gōng* (水精宫)—the Dunhuang manuscript consistently uses *chà* (剎) or *gōng* (宫) in place of *guǎn* (馆). This is likely due to the influence of Buddhist scribes. #89 *Qí zhēnrén míng rù jīngjìn* (其真人名入精进) was mistakenly written as *qí yī wén jīngjìn* (其一文精进); corrected according to the Dunhuang manuscript, which reads *qí fó míng rù jīngjìn púsà* (其佛名入精进菩萨). In the subsequent entries—*qí zhēnrén míng bù shě jīngjìn* (其真人名不舍精进) and *qí zhēnrén míng xí jīngjìn* (其真人名习精进)—the Dunhuang manuscript replaces *zhēnrén* (真人) with *fó* (佛) and appends *púsà* (菩萨) at the end.

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture*. Also known as *The Numinous Treasure True Unity Fivefold Invocation Scripture*. The author is unknown, approximately dating to the Eastern Jin dynasty, belonging to the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. Originally in one scroll, later divided into two. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Shenfu* category. Collated with the Dunhuang manuscript P.2440.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Venerable Highest Dao’s Spontaneous True Unity Fivefold Talisman Scripture, Scroll One**\n\nThis was treasured by the Supreme Venerable in the Purple Tenuity Terrace, concealed by the host of perfected ones in renowned mountains and grotto-chambers, and once secreted in the northern shade of Mount Lao.\n\nLord Lao said: At the inception of primordial chaos, the subtle and wondrous source. Before the separation of heaven and earth, there existed the *Numinous Treasure Spontaneous True Writ*, prior to the image of the Sovereign. I am the profound gateway of the *Numinous Treasure Great Dao*, receiving its essence and subtlety, thereby becoming the spirit of heaven, earth, and humanity. When the five talismans divided the clear and turbid qi, I was about to depart. The *Talismanic Scripture* was secreted in the Purple Chamber, transmitted without end.\n\nGe Xuan said: The Dao’s practice is without end.\n\nLord Lao said: The *Supreme Numinous Treasure* arose before heaven, earth, and the myriad things, riding the constant of the formless, empty, and cavernous Dao, operating through the limitless and non-action to spontaneously coalesce as the natural. Its nobility cannot be named; its honor has no superior—thus it is called *Supreme Venerable*. Vast, it encompasses all; minute, it pervades all. Its principle is subtle and unfathomable, the origin of heaven, earth, and humanity. In heaven, the five stars circulate qi, the sun and moon radiate light; on earth, the five peaks establish their dominion, mountains rise high and seas plunge deep; among humans, the five viscera are secure. Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could heaven shine? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could earth manifest form? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could spirits enter darkness? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could humans attain life? Thus, heaven, earth, and humanity—three and five—unite in darkness, becoming one. Therefore, the teeming myriad things take me as their root, me as their gate. What is this root and gate? I possess the *Numinous Treasure Writ*, which enables one to journey to the Penglai Prefecture and be received as a perfected one. Entering the Bright Hall at the center of the heavens, passing through the Jade Armillary, ascending the Limitless Purple Palace, one is ordained as a *Dao Lord*. Descending to govern the myriad things, returning to the Central Plains, it is secreted in the northern shade of Mount Lao. The Five Thearchs succeeded one another, and it must not be recklessly transmitted; reckless transmission invites deadly calamity.\n\nLord Lao said: When a serpent obtains the *Numinous Treasure*, it transforms into a divine dragon; when birds and fowl obtain it, they become phoenixes; when ordinary beasts obtain it, they change into qilin; when commoners obtain it, they are called sages. What is a sage? One who possesses the *Perfected Writ of Penetrating Sagacity*, able to ingest it constantly, roaming the Five Peaks in play, wandering carefree in the great void, altering the five viscera, transforming form and countenance, accumulating essence and simplicity, commanding the service of ghosts and spirits, penetrating the ten directions, appearing and vanishing unpredictably, ascending heights and riding clouds, journeying afar to the Highest Clarity, proceeding to the Penglai Prefecture to be received as a perfected one, ascending to the Purple Palace to pay homage, merging merits and virtues with the great sagely and honored spirits. Formerly, the Yellow Thearch received it and ascended as the *Supreme Unity Emperor Lord*, leading the Five Thearchs to ascend to heaven together—this is the way of ascending immortals. Those who revere this scripture and single-mindedly make offerings to it shall have their names entered into the Golden Watchtower of the Supreme Venerable and be titled *Perfected Immortals*.\n\nLord Lao said: When a state is about to flourish, it cultivates and attains this writ. Those who desire wealth, honor, and agelessness must attain the *Numinous Treasure*. If the Son of Heaven obtains it, phoenixes will come to pay homage, the five stars will align in harmony, the sun and moon will radiate brilliance, the four directions will submit in tribute, the world will be clear and peaceful, inauspicious omens will not arise, the feudal lords will return in allegiance, and his longevity will match heaven and earth, enduring for ten thousand generations without decline. If a feudal lord obtains it, the constellations will contain their light, benefiting the state and harmonizing the household, his rank ascending to promotion, enjoying long life and enduring vision, ultimately preserving himself from calamity. If a grandee obtains it, his longevity will extend without end, his rank and emoluments will be weighty, ascending to the status of marquis or lord with a salary of two thousand bushels. From petty officials to commoners, gazing upward and looking downward, they will penetrate the numinous and divine, their minds opening and inner brilliance arising, foreknowing the yet-to-be, attaining high office and wealth, jade pendants chiming, extending years and increasing longevity, with descendants filling the hall. If a woman obtains it, she will become a queen or consort to a king, jade lads attending her, blue-waisted maidens by her side, bearing noble children with countenances like jade blossoms, her longevity matching the sun and moon, her radiance flowing through the Three Luminaries.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: Since ancient times, the utmost Dao has been conferred upon kings. Those among the Dao who bear immortal names have encountered this scripture in their time; revering and upholding it, they inevitably attain transcendence, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, receiving the offerings of kings and lords, preserving their lives and bodies, increasing their lifespan, safeguarding their ancestral temples, pacifying their states, and eternally enjoying supreme fortune. My words are absolute.\n\nLord Lao said: *Numinous* means the Dao’s penetration. Able to penetrate the great Dao to the utmost numinous, one commands the service of the myriad spirits. *Treasure* means able to preserve oneself alongside heaven and earth—thus it is called *Numinous Treasure*. *Supreme Venerable* is the utmost honor of the Dao. *Five* refers to the talismanic mandates of heaven, earth, and humanity. *Cavernous Mystery* means uniting with the great origin of the empty and cavernous true. The mother of the Five Phases—thus it is called the *Fivefold Spontaneous Talisman*. Above, it corresponds to the five stars, regulating and summoning the Five Dipper alliances; below, it manifests in the five peaks, the Five Phases sharing a root, centrally treasuring the five viscera, the root of the five Dao paths, the Five Tones harmonizing in succession. If a Daoist obtains it, the five viscera transform the self, penetrating the numinous of heaven, commanding the service of the myriad spirits, summoning traveling kitchens while seated, riding clouds and driving dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, able to ascend and descend, transforming unpredictably, indulging desires and following inclinations. The Dao’s methods are not burdensome; secrete it in a jade coffer, and take care not to transmit it lightly. This scripture can endure countless kalpas, forever without end.",

If you wish to purify your essence-chamber in stillness, dwell in the mountains to summon the divine, avert disasters and repel harm, and merge with the Dao to attain truth, you must receive the true script of the Numinous Treasure—the root of the Way. The immortals of the ten directions and the myriad spirits of heaven and earth will come to pay homage; mountain spirits and earthly numina will all arrive in audience.\n\nIf you wish to enter the profound gate of the Great Dao of the Numinous Treasure, wear the Five Talismans upon your body, and the myriad spirits will humbly submit to you. If your bone destiny is recorded in the registers of immortals in the Upper Clarity Palace, you shall receive the Numinous Treasure scriptures, fast in purity, and wear the talismans—thus attaining longevity, never dying, never aging. You must know the location of your still chamber or mountain dwelling, the mountain range to which your household belongs, and the corresponding star of its celestial division.\n\nFor example, if your household falls under the domain of the Eastern Marchmount, begin with the Eastern *Cheng* Luminous Talisman. At the time of the Beginning of Spring, on a day when *jia* or *yi* is in ascendance, enter the fasting hall and wear the talisman according to the method. Close your eyes, clench your fists, and in your heart summon the Azure Emperor of the East, riding a green dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist ever attending at your left. Maintain a serene countenance, gaze forward, and rejoice as if beholding the divine. Visualize your liver as pure azure, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Year Star of the East, radiant azure, with an azure thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your liver. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-seven days—three times nine—the attending spirits of the East, including the Directing Scribe Shen Yuan, the Great Mystery, the deities of *jia-yin* and *jia-chen*, the officials of the Eastern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Eastern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *bing* or *ding* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Summer, perform the Southern *Cheng* Yang-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the Vermilion Emperor of the South, riding a red dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Vermilion Scepter ever attending before you. Visualize your heart as pure vermilion, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Fire Star of the South, radiant vermilion, with a vermilion thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your heart. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-four days—three times eight—the attending spirits of the South, including the Directing Scribe Lin Gang, the Pillar Scribe, the deity of *jia-wu*, the officials of the Southern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Vermilion Scepter will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Southern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *geng* or *xin* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Autumn, perform the Western *Cheng* Yin-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the White Emperor of the West, riding a white dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of White Simplicity ever attending at your right. Visualize your lungs as pure white, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Grand White Star of the West, radiant white, with a white thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your lungs. Swallow as if ingesting it. After twenty-one days—three times seven—the attending spirits of the West, including the Directing Scribe Jian Gang, the Mystery Essence, the deities of *jia-shen* and *jia-xu*, the officials of the Western Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of White Simplicity will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Western Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *ren* or *gui* is in ascendance, at the time of the Beginning of Winter, perform the Northern *Cheng* Spirit-Through Talisman. In your heart, summon the Black Emperor of the North, riding a black dragon to welcome you, together ascending Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery ever attending behind you. Visualize your kidneys as pure black, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Chronographic Star of the North, radiant black, with a black thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your kidneys. Swallow as if ingesting it. After fifteen days—three times five—the attending spirits of the North, including the Directing Scribe Tian Jian, the Moon Essence, the deity of *jia-zi*, the officials of the Northern Marchmount, and the Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery will all arrive, along with the immortals of the Northern Limitless.\n\nNext, on a day when *wu* or *ji* is in ascendance, during the seasons of the four quarters, perform the Central *Cheng* Myriad Blessings Talisman. In your heart, summon the Yellow Emperor of the Center, riding a yellow dragon to welcome you, together ascending the lofty Mount Song of the Central Marchmount. Visualize the mountain spirit coming to guard your body, with the Jade Maiden of Yellow Simplicity ever attending at your side. Visualize your spleen as pure yellow, like an egg, emerging from your abdomen into your mouth. Next, visualize the Quelling Star of the Center, radiant yellow, with a yellow thread-like path descending from the star into your mouth, merging with your spleen. Swallow as if ingesting it. After eighteen days—three times six—the spirits of the Great Dao of the Limitless will all arrive, along with the Eight Scribes of the Ten Directions, the Six *Jia* Parents, the Six Yin and Six Yang Jade Maidens, the celestial officials and stellar lodges, the Five Agents of the Four Seasons, the immortals of the eight poles and ten directions above and below, and the myriad mountain spirits and earthly numina—none will dare to be absent.\n\nFrom this point onward, your name is entered among the immortals. All chronic illnesses and the hundred diseases will heal of themselves. Your body will be pure, your eyes bright, and your perception will penetrate the four directions. Follow the illustrated scriptures to cultivate virtue and practice the methods: in one year, your *qi* will be renewed; in two years, your blood; in three years, your flesh; in four years, your skin; in five years, your marrow; in six years, your sinews; in seven years, your bones; in eight years, your hair; in nine years, your form. When your entire body is transformed, the Great Dao is complete. The myriad spirits will come in audience, the Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure will manifest in majesty, and you will form an alliance with the four seasons. The sun and moon will unite in brilliance, and you will ascend as a guest of the Heavenly Emperor. Proceed to the Bureau of Destiny to remove your name from the register of death, and the guardians of the Gate of Life will attend you.\n\nThus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Limitless Great Dao’s Spontaneous True One Five Cheng Talismans*.",

Select fourteen individuals of upright character. First, choose the one at the central gate, stationed outside the hall’s pillar, to forbid all malevolent influences from entering within.

Today, I unite with you, joining in divine fellowship. I take you as friend, to wander together at the southern slope of such-and-such a mountain. When I call, you shall answer; when I ask, you shall respond. Let no deceit breach our pact; let our bond be sealed in covenant.\"*\n\nAfter three libations of wine, conclude the offering. Grasp the root, carve it into human form, and assign names according to their completion, distinguishing male from female. The next dawn, when the day aligns with the Eastern Well constellation, kneel at the door and declare: *\"Your humble descendant So-and-so, having completed the bath today, enters the chamber to install the* zhangju.\" *Wait until the day of the Five Designations, then take their brushes and inscribe talismans on the corresponding days, placing them among the Five Talismans. After ten days, all will be complete; then burn incense. On the appointed day, offer sacrifices to the* zhangju *at their earthly branch positions. First, call them by their names and recite the incantation: \"So-and-so, who communes with spirits, today shares your name. After twelve branches and six cycles of ten, you shall respond to mortals on the twelfth day.\"*\n\nAfter the offering, simply burn incense, visualize the Eight Scribes, memorize their names, and gather white blossoms. Dry and process them, then ingest a square-inch spoonful within the hall to commune with the body’s spirits and befriend the Scribes. Thereafter, on days when the heavens align with the Eastern Well, dissolve the talismans, bathe again, and replace them. Repeat this process every other day as prescribed. After five baths, completing one hundred twenty-four days, the spirits will all have arrived—some may already be heard, others seen, appearing as depicted in the illustrations. The next dawn, offer sacrifices beneath the hall’s central pillar, and the spirits will converse with you. The Six Jia Jade Maidens with azure sashes and attendant wings will also arrive, though they do not speak to mortals. Thus, the Eight Scribes attend first, and you, understanding human affairs, should inquire of them the Way of divine transcendence and longevity. The Scribes enter the celestial lodgings to review the registers and relay the words to mortals. If your name is not recorded in the Register of Immortals, you remain distant from transcendence. You may only cultivate devotion to attain wealth and nobility, extending your lifespan to three or four hundred years. Merely ingesting divine elixirs, golden liquors, or mineral medicines diverges from the Dao.\n\nIf you seek longevity, command the Eight Scribes to perform transformations and summon traveling kitchens with myriad offerings, you must dissolve and place the Designation Talismans in a five-colored pouch, hanging it within the canopy of your bed. Take a vermilion brush to inscribe white silk with the Eight Trigrams’ Mystic Cavern Communion Talisman of the Eight Mighty Spirits, placing it over your heart to command them. Regularly employ the Five Talismans and *zhangju* to summon the Eight Scribes, ensuring they do not depart. The Eight Talismans govern their might and control, compelling them to remain, though they cannot fully preserve or stabilize them. Collect the *zhangju* figures, each in a leather pouch. Craft a bamboo basket shaped like a pot to hold the twelve figures, covering it inside and out with leather. Name it the Harmonious Hare’s Secret Chamber of Spirit Communion and place it within your bed’s canopy. Each dawn, bow twice and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Spirit So-and-so, ever communing with your humble descendant, I beseech you today to accompany Scribe So-and-so, riding together upon the Azure Dragon, traversing the hidden realms. Whatever is spoken today, let the two attendants at the door hear and heed, pursuing and installing the spirit at the designated door. When venturing forth, call the spirit of the current door, barring the Five Evil Specters from entering the Jade Chamber. Instead, usher in the luminous Jade Maidens of the Dao of divine transcendence, the Six Jia spirits, and all deities present today within my garments. Visualize the talisman and summon the Scribe to depart; the Scribe follows wherever you rest. If you wish to conceal your form or transform your body, visualize the Scribe at your left elbow, and you shall move unseen among crowds. To manifest auspicious omens or wondrous marvels, command the Scribe aloud to perform your bidding, leaving traces where you pause. People will speak and sounds will resonate as the Scribe enacts transformations—nothing is beyond their power.\"*\n\nOnce this Way is accomplished, you may conceal and record all things, face and perceive ghosts and spirits, sit and behold the Eight Wastes, cause the sun and moon to alternate between darkness and light, disrupt the five colors’ order of blue and yellow, alter the stars’ paths and celestial measures, make the Five Peaks shift and turn at will, and invert the four seasons’ yin and yang. In winter, grass and trees grow; in summer, frost and ice form. You may command thunder and lightning to crash and roar, clouds and mist to surge and soar. When blessings sweep in, banish misfortune and calamity. If you cultivate this, you shall be enthroned as a Transcendent King. Once transformations are mastered, all things become accessible—you may save the living, prolong the short-lived, deliver and protect boundless beings.\n\nDo not lightly scorn the world’s people or recklessly act against the Dao, lest the populace tremble in fear and pray to celestial spirits, who will hold you accountable. The Dao will then recede far from you—beware. If you employ the Scribes for three years without offending the spirits, even without a name in the Register of Immortals, the Scribes will petition on your behalf to extend your years to a thousand.",

      "translated_text": "The Transcendent Duke said: Diligently establish meritorious deeds, and when your merits reach three hundred, you shall extend your lifespan to a thousand years. Meritorious deeds refer to rescuing those in peril and saving lives. You need not employ the Six Jia spirits any longer. Those who study transcendence must prioritize attaining long life and ascending to deliverance, for delivering the world is the most urgent task. Lifespans are finite; they do not wait for mortals, and one must constantly race against time—only then may death be averted.\n\nLord Lao said: When wearing the Fivefold Invocation Talisman of the Numinous Treasure into the purification hall, you may summon the yin and yang spirits of the Six Jia. This follows the proper method, though it differs from the Eight Scribes. The time limit is one hundred days, and the divine herbs used also vary. For the Six Jia purification rites, wear the talisman on the days of the four seasons, and the ritual will be complete within a year. The Six Jia hold supremacy in heaven, while the Five Dipper spirits serve merely as their subordinate officials. Over one thousand two hundred and forty days, you may invoke the Six Jia’s parents, the Six Jia Numinous Communication Chart, the Numinous Communication Talisman, and the Precious Register Chart—only then can the spirits be summoned and commanded.\n\nThe parents of the Six Jia reside in the yang regions of mountains corresponding to their respective sacred peaks. Every mountain has its attendant mountain spirits, whose affiliated peaks must be known before use. These parents are also called *Ghost Arrows*, *Ghost Supervisors*, or *Solitary Sway*. Gather their roots, which bear thirteen stalks: one great stalk stands at the center, called the Six Jia Parents, while the twelve others are positioned at the twelve earthly branches on the four sides. Those on the yang branches are the Six Jia, and those on the yin branches are the Six Ding. Bing, Wu, Geng, and Ren follow Jia; Yi, Si, Xin, and Gui follow Ding—this is the pairing of yin and yang.\n\nTake the roots and carve each into a human figure according to the chart. Recognize their earthly branches and enter the chamber, using the central character as the stalwart and sagely master. The Six Jia Parents and the twelve figures should each be assigned to their original branches, forming the Six Jia. On Jia days, offer sacrifices of wine and dried meat. By the third day of the third month, take tiger-head fur and plant it in the center of the courtyard, then water it with the blood of a sheep and a crow. This will cause the Six Jia Parents to grow anew, sprouting thirteen stalks with stalks beneath them. Their color is a true blue-green, and their sap is also blue-green. Use this sap to inscribe the Numinous Communication Talisman. All writings for the rites should be made with this sap.",

Below, it is the Water Essence Palace; its Perfected One is named Brahman Diligence, styled Wise Head, governing the Five-Tone Water府, and its spirit is styled Eight Scribes. The Eight Scribes are the Eight Essences of Heaven and Earth, enabling one to commune with the numinous.\n\nAll Daoist practitioners, students of immortality, and common disciples who wish to uphold the True Dao of the Ten Directions and seek the divine immortality of agelessness should ingest the Numinous Treasure, first summoning the Eight Scribes.

Your kindness will extend to all beings, and your blessings and virtue will be towering.\n\nLord Lao says: From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, though not Daoist practitioners, those who possess karmic blessings may obtain this *Lingbao* scripture, and their lives will naturally be prolonged.\n\nIf you wish to deploy the talismans, take five large stones, each of pure color and weighing between seventy and one hundred *jin*. One stone should be pure azure, carved in vermilion with the talisman of the East; one pure crimson, carved in yellow with the talisman of the South; one pure white, carved in black with the talisman of the West; one pure black, carved in azure with the talisman of the North; and one pure yellow, carved in white with the talisman of the Center. Inscribe each with its respective text and place them to guard the five directions of your dwelling. The Five Phases will generate one another without mutual harm, all illnesses will be cured, and the five malevolences and six harms—even extraordinary disasters—will each be dispelled. You will hold high office with abundant emoluments, remain untouched by the five weapons of war, and grow ever richer, your wealth like clouds. Your life will be prolonged across generations, and your descendants will flourish.\n\nDraw the talismans of the Eight Trigrams, the Mystic Cavern, and the Eight Mighty Spirits on the eight directions, and plant the *tongshen changsheng* grass on the twelve earthly branches. This will open your heart, allowing you to perceive the four directions with clarity, foreknowing the unseen as if illuminated by the sun and moon.\n\nWhen traveling by boat or carriage, engaging in trade, crossing rivers or lakes, or entering seas, these talismans will repel wind, waves, water spirits, and pestilence, safeguarding your body and multiplying your wealth tenfold. You will avoid misfortune and constantly encounter good fortune.\n\nTake a jar shaped like a flask, and with five-colored *zou* and five-colored brushes, inscribe the spirit talismans within it. On the outside, draw in vermilion the talismans of the Eight Trigrams, the Mystic Cavern, and the Eight Mighty Spirits. After the offering ritual, clothe the jar in yellow silk, covering its mouth. Seal it with a yellow wooden tag tied with yellow silk cords, inscribing it with the talisman of the Five Stars’ Mystic Protection. Affix the seal of the Five Stars’ Mystic Protection and place the jar in your boat or carriage.\n\nWhen journeying near or far to the Five Peaks, the Four Marshes, the Five Lakes, or the Three Rivers, the spirit essences will all come to welcome and protect you. The local earth deities, mountain spirits, and even beasts like tigers and wolves will come to pay homage. Upon returning home, place the jar on the central beam.\n\nFor those seeking to avert disasters or deploy the five stones to guard their dwelling, follow the method above. On the appointed day, burn incense and gather white blossoms, drying them thoroughly. Ingest a square-inch spoonful to attain communion with spirits and summon blessings.\n\nThe white blossoms have twenty-four names: *Zhangju of the Fourteen*, *Zhangming*, *Zhangsheng*, *Zhangcao*, *Zhanglu*, *Tongshenming*, *Tongjing*, *Tongling*, *Jade Maiden*, *Household Immortal*, *Household Treasure*, *Household Zhi*, *Prolonging Life*, *Longevity Grass*, *Guardian of the Palace*, *Twelve Household Guardians*, *Night Caller*, *Night Singer*, *Attracting Essence*, *Yang Brightness*, *Yin Brightness*, *Red Kudzu*, *White Blossom*, and *Danglu*. These twenty-four names correspond to my twenty-four titles, aligning above with the twenty-four qi of Heaven and Earth. They are the sacred implements of the Daoist *Lingbao* tradition.\n\nTalismans are the mandate of Heaven and humanity. If you possess karmic destiny, obtaining my Five Talismans and the white blossoms will together summon spirit essences. Guard them carefully and do not recklessly disclose them to the world. If you rashly reveal them, you will violate the qi of Heaven, bringing calamity upon yourself and annihilation upon your seven generations of ancestors and descendants.\n\nIf the spirits inform you that someone of destined bone and fate should receive them, transmit them once every forty years to five individuals. Ensure their five notes—*gong*, *shang*, *zhi*, *yu*, and *jiao*—harmonize. On a day when the Eastern Well constellation is in the heavens, bathe and enter the chamber. Burn incense according to the numbers of the five directions: three on the left, seven on the right, nine in front, one behind, and four in the center. For twenty-four days, align with the twenty-four qi of Heaven. I reside at the Five Stars of the Center, overseeing the Five Dipper stars. The spirit lords of the Five Peaks will together ascend to the imperial throne, where the Five Emperors will bestow the talismans, granting the recipient eternal life.\n\nThe dais should be two *zhang* in length, circular at the center, and covered with layered silk mats. On an *jia* or *yi* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take three thousand gold coins to the eastern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *bing* or *ding* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take nine thousand gold coins to the southern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *geng* or *xin* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take seven thousand gold coins to the western land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion. On a *ren* or *gui* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take one thousand gold coins to the northern land of blessings and virtue, and burn the mat-incense to completion.",

      "translated_text": "On a *wu* or *ji* day of flourishing *wangxiang*, take four thousand gold coins to the central land or to a blessed and virtuous place in the city, and burn the mat-incense to completion. In total, twenty-four thousand gold coins are to be used, all personally prepared in purification. When burning the incense, one must not seek to harmonize the Five Tones.\n\nOn a day when the celestial lodges align with Dongjing, bathe in orchid-infused water to purify the body, observe the fast, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Begin with the eastern direction, and complete the ritual in twenty-four days. When the celestial qi is received in harmony, transmit the Five Tones.\n\nIf one begrudges wealth and arbitrarily reduces the offering, failing to align with the celestial qi, or if one transmits the scripture without proper authorization, the celestial qi will fall into disharmony, the Five Stars will not shine, the Five Thearchs will not bestow their talismans, the Five Marchmounts will not open, the Five Viscera will suffer illness, and calamity will bring about the destruction of the body.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: \"Many Daoist masters in villages and counties are poor. Now, gold and bronze coins may be used as substitutes to transmit the scriptures. Disciples must personally prepare the required offerings with reverence, observing the fast and aiding the destitute; they must not use them for private purposes. Burn the Fivefold Blended Incense to demonstrate utmost sincerity.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The *Lingbao* is the foremost of the Dao, upon which divine spirits constantly rely, and which all the sages of the heavens, earth, and realms universally revere. The Mystic Cavern’s numinous spirit-true talismans, the Three Sovereigns’ celestial writings in great script, and the root texts of the *Dongzhen* scriptures are equal to the *Lingbao*. Thus, they were first compiled into the Five-Named Talismans, while the rest were incorporated into the celestial qi, hence called the Celestial Script and the Sovereign’s Talismans. Together, they may be employed to summon and command the spirits of heaven and earth. One must first wear the *Lingbao* talisman before deploying the script, for only then can the spirits be attained. Once the spirits are attained and one relies on oneself, they will not bring misfortune to others.\n\nWithout the *Lingbao* scriptures, how can one cultivate celestial perfected beings? Be cautious in their application: if one summons spirits without consistently relying on oneself, it will instead bring misfortune to others, harming oneself and one’s descendants. Having obtained the *Lingbao* talismans, one should also acquire the *Lingbao* Charts. The Charts comprise twenty-four sections, embodying the true qi of heaven—my dharma titles, the true methods of the Great Dao.\n\nIf you seek the methods of the Dao, first bathe to remove filth and impurities, and obtain the *Dongjing Chart*. If you wish to stabilize the Five Thearchs and command mountain spirits, obtain the *Five Marchmounts Chart*. If you seek to communicate with divine spirits, first resolve the Eight Essences, and obtain the *Eight Scribes’ True Forms Chart*. If you wish to master the Five Phases and summon the traveling kitchen, obtain the *Six Jia Spirit-Communication Chart*. If you wish to preserve the Five Teeth and summon celestial spirits, obtain the *Nine Palaces Purple Chamber Chart*. If you wish to uphold the methods of the Dao, obtain the *Taiqing Chart*. If you wish to follow the Dao in compliance, obtain the *Hunchen Chart*. If you seek to grasp the mechanisms of the Dao, obtain the *Xisheng Baolu Chart*. If you wish to master the transformations of the Dao, obtain the *Linghua Chart*. If you wish to tread the celestial Dao, obtain the *Nine Heavens Chart*. If you wish to liberate your bodily form, obtain the *Nine Transformations Chart*. If you wish to conceal and preserve the spirits guarding your body, obtain the *Changcun Chart*. If you wish to stabilize your body and guard the divine treasure, obtain the *Hanying Chart*. If you wish to cultivate tranquility and guard the One to preserve your body, obtain the *Yangshen Chart*. If you wish to nurture your will in silence, obtain the *Jingcheng Shouzhi Chart*. If you wish to attain purity and whiteness to summon the mushroom spirits, obtain the *Zhiying Yunu Chart*. If you wish to summon the Six Ding, obtain the *Six Yin Jade Maidens Chart*. If you seek immortal records, obtain the *Nine-Nine Daoist Immortal Chart*. If you wish to ingest the qi of the Dao, obtain the *Daoyin Chart*. If you wish to practice the arts of the Dao, obtain the *Dongzhong Hongbao Chart*. If you wish to master transformations, obtain the *Yince Chart*. If you wish to refine the furnace and stabilize the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor, obtain the *Taiyi Chart*. If you wish to ascend the Five Marchmounts to seek divine mushroom medicines, obtain the *Kaishan Zhiyao Chart*. If you wish to protect your bodily form and repel malevolent spirits, demons, and specters, obtain the *Mingjing Chart*. Once you have obtained the *Mingjing Chart*, you should also acquire the *Hanjing Chart*.\n\nIn total, there are twenty-four true charts—my *Lingbao*. The *Dongzhong Huanglu* chapters, the *Zhonghuang Jiudu* scriptures, and their respective esoteric essential texts are all my alternate titles. All take the *Lingbao* natural talismans as their fundamental origin, mutually complementing one another to become a perfected person. If you can obtain them, you will surely attain longevity, ascending as a transcendent, soaring through the Great Clarity, where eons pass like a single day.\"\n\nThe Yellow Thearch said: \"The Celestial Elder, seeing that my humble omens did not yet comprehend the celestial qi, bestowed upon me the *Lingbao Five-Named Talisman Scripture*. I request that, following the *Dongjing* prophecies, on an auspicious day of purity, one should bathe in purification and observe the fast to receive the *Lingbao* talismans.\n\nThe proper times are:\n- The tenth day of the first month at the *ren ding* hour,\n- The eighth day of the second month at the *huang hun* hour,\n- The sixth day of the third month at the *ri ru* hour,\n- The fourth day of the fourth month at the *xia bu* hour,\n- The first day of the fifth month at the *shang bu* hour, and the twenty-ninth day at the *ri bu* hour,\n- The twenty-seventh day of the sixth month at the *ri zhong* hour,\n- The twenty-fifth day of the seventh month at the *yu zhong* hour,\n- The twenty-second day of the eighth month at the *ri chu* hour,\n- The twentieth day of the ninth month at the *ji san ming* hour,\n- The eighteenth day of the tenth month at the *ji chu ming* hour,\n- The fifteenth day of the eleventh month at the *guo ye ban* hour,\n- The thirteenth day of the twelfth month at the *ye ban* hour.\n\nThese are all times when the celestial qi and the lunar lodge align with Dongjing. On these days and hours, one should blend incense in harmony with the divine immortals, bathe, and the spirits will descend into oneself. Bathing in orchid-infused water signifies that the Daoist seeks communion with divine beings—ordinary people do not require this ritual.\n\nFurthermore, the superior method involves placing the Five Stones to pacify the household, as stated in the *Kaiming Scripture*: 'A household possessing the *Lingbao* will never age for ten thousand years. A lord possessing the Five-Named and Eight Might talismans will ensure that all treasures remain undiminished.' Thus, no further pacification is needed.\"",

      "translated_text": "This must be employed in governing the people; those without this text merely perform it perfunctorily.\n\nMoreover, the *Yuzha Ji* states: The Five Talismans, known as the appellations of the Five Directions, are the true unity of the Dao. Thus, one must not place this scripture’s talismanic texts or sacred writings among common books when entering the spirit chamber or quiet room. Instead, they should always be kept within the canopy, for they communicate with the numinous Eight Talismans that command the spirits of the Eight Directions. The *August Talisman* is difficult to bear, so it is separately venerated as received, using its power to compel the Eight Spirits.\n\nThe Supreme Great Ultimate Perfected One said: After receiving this scripture, a Dao practitioner transmits it to one person every forty years. Those who have extended their lifespan transmit it to one person every four hundred years. Those who attain earthly immortality transmit it to one person every four thousand years. Those who attain celestial immortality transmit it to one person every forty thousand years. Those who attain the supreme, profoundly quiescent, Most High Perfected One transmit it to one person every forty thousand kalpas. The transmission protocols of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Great Method are thus complete.\n\nThis scripture expounds the Way of the lofty immortals who traverse the void. The Supreme’s vast and universal teachings are set forth; its profound and distant words are manifest. The mystery of the true and the subtle essence of the imperceptible cannot be contemplated or discussed.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: Thus, through the ages, all worthies have sung odes of transcendent thought.\n\nThe Supreme Mysterious Unity Perfected One said: The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* is the most profound of texts, fully conveying the intent of the Dao and the teachings of true correctness. How resplendent and wondrous its words! Reciting it for a thousand days with an empty mind and focused absorption enables one to ascend as an immortal in broad daylight, becoming a Supreme Four-Flowered Perfected One. This is the lineage of the loftiest immortals, and it can also bring blessings to the seven generations of ancestors.\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* is magnificent, its marvels and profundities defying description. If a practitioner’s heart is not wholly consumed by thoughts of glory and splendor but remains inwardly and outwardly steadfast, reading this scripture in hope of attaining celestial perfection, such a goal remains unseen. Yet if one possesses the qualities of a noble person, the world will come to know that these words are not mere fabrication. To propagate such subtle and arcane teachings is like a lotus blooming in fire.\n\nOne who embodies the Dao to its utmost truth, with the six penetrations fully realized, neither lives nor dies, their virtue harmonizing with spontaneity. They soar and traverse the caverns, their body emerging unscathed from water and fire, and through the Dao, they deliver others. Though it may seem as impossible as seawater entering a hair’s pore or a lotus blooming in fire, such things cannot be declared nonexistent.\n\nAccording to the scriptures and precepts, the supreme Way is difficult to achieve. One must initiate even the smallest effort, cultivating diligently, like a traveler on a thousand-mile journey taking the first step. Only through accumulating goodness over countless kalpas can one naturally attain union with it.\n\n*Scripture of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao’s Natural True Unity and the Five-Named Talismans, Lower Scroll* concludes.",
