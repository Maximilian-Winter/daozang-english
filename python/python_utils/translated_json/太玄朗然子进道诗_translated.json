  "full_translation": "**Preface to *The Radiant One’s Poems on Advancing in the Dao***\n\nI was born by the Zhang River, of a once-illustrious family, raised in the Confucian tradition, and even earned the title of provincial graduate. Yet I lament how fleeting this world is—swift as a loosed arrow, its time rushing like a cataract. Thus I withdrew to the gates of the Mysterious, my heart dwelling in the cap and coarse robe of the Dao. I grasped the subtle principles of the external elixir, its truths veiled in obscurity, and illuminated the inner qi, tracing the source of embryonic breathing. Though my efforts spanned less than a decade, others marveled at my agelessness, for my lifespan had already extended beyond five cycles—such was the awakening I experienced. Endowed with this spiritual insight, I could not remain silent. With reverence, I composed thirty poems, titling them *The Radiant One’s Poems*, offering them to fellow seekers. May distant minds perceive the sagely intent, for it is not remote—only men’s doubts obscure it.\n\nWritten in the twelfth lunar month of the *wuzǐ* year of the *Duangong* era of the Song, while residing at Tongxuan Abbey in Luoyang, on a moment of inspiration.\n\n—Inscribed by the Radiant One\n\n---\n\n**The Radiant One’s Poems on Advancing in the Dao**\n*By Liu Xiyue of Xiufeng*\n\n**1.**\nFor decades, adrift in wine and folly,\neach dawn I indulged, rising late from slumber.\nYet once the *Weilü* connects to the *Niwan* cavity,\nthe cinnabar turtle discerns the power of creation.\nThis cloud-scraping path must have its way—\nhow can man’s fate be left to Heaven?\nSay not the Great Dao is hard to fathom—\n’tis only fools who refuse to learn immortality.\n\n**2.**\nNorth and south I wandered for decades,\nsteeping myself in the Mysterious, silently cultivating truth.\nI sought not the world’s endless treasures,\nonly a true man within this mortal realm.\nThe external medicine’s fire and timing now clear,\nthe inner elixir ever circulates, tracing the flowing ford.\nEven if we meet again in a thousand years,\nyou’ll find my countenance ever renewed.\n\n**3.**\nIn the quietude of Luoyang’s ancient abbey,\nI dwell where old moats hem in the past.\nWorldly passions may taint, yet my heart remains unstained;\nthough entangled in mundane affairs, my Dao differs.\nWhy shun the thousand days’ toil of elixir-refining?\nI constantly refine essence, keeping the four limbs unobstructed.\nOf all things under Heaven, none is so precious—\nsave the human body, all else is emptiness.\n\n**4.**\nSeekers of immortality swarm in chaos,\ntraversing mountains and rivers like drifting clouds.\nAll pursue longevity through external things—\nwho has truly heard the Supreme Dao?\nWithin this body lies the path to Heaven’s ascent;\nwho lacks the mark of transcendence upon their back?\nAlas for the common folk, utterly unenlightened,\ncontent to rot in wild graves as barrows.\n\n**5.**\nNeither wealth nor rank do I prize—\npity those who come into this world thus bound.\nIn the cinnabar field, I sow the herbs of longevity;\nin the Purple Palace, embers of death never kindle.\nMy marrow brims, indifferent to cold or heat;\nonce the Dao is perfected, why fear dawn or dusk?\nYet the world toils ceaselessly, chasing gain and fame,\ntheir natures growing ever more dull.\n\n**6.**\nDrunk in bliss, all cares dissolved,\npetals bloom and fade as spring and autumn pass.\nLet others covet gold seals and purple sashes—\nI rejoice in the freedom of plain cloth and cap.\nMay my lifespan endure with Heaven and Earth,\nmy heart at ease, companion to clouds and waters.\nI marvel at the Primordial Ancestor of the Grand Supreme—\nwhy do men on earth age so soon?\n\n**7.**\nOver a decade in Luoyang,\nI never deigned to chase wealth or rank.\nI nurtured my being, preventing the primordial qi from scattering,\ncultivating so the Valley Spirit might abide.\nHunger sated by the nectar beneath my tongue,\ncold dispelled by the fire in my cinnabar field.\nI find joy in my nature, content in solitude—\nno fleeting beauty can sway my grace.\n\n**8.**\nFailing to awaken in this life, they pin hopes on the next—\nyet who knows where the next life may lead?\nBetter to tread the celestial path now—\nwhy descend again into the earth’s pit?\nA robust yang soul does not ensure longevity;\na strong yin spirit must bring demise.\nAll herbs wither after frost—\nonly the pine remains verdant, evergreen.\n\n**9.**\nOnce I followed Confucian and Mohist paths, seeking office,\nuntil I suddenly grasped the profound subtlety of the Dao—no hardship there.\nWhen yin qi dissipates, one does not die;\nwhen yang essence abides, one is naturally at peace.\nWithin this body, I refine boundless medicine;\nin the crucible, I burn the elixir of life.\nAlas for those enslaved to wealth and lust—\ntheir days consumed in endless torment.\n\n**10.**\nOf all things in the world, none merit discourse—\nonly the body and qi endure.\nIn the golden crucible, I concoct the life-extending elixir;\nin the cinnabar field, I plant the root of agelessness.\nEver do I receive the Great Dao’s subtle guidance—\nhow could I accept the haphazard favors of common men?\nFreed from glory and decay, unstained by defilement,\nI fear only the sun’s emergence from the cosmos.\n\n**11.**\nThe lesser hermit dwells in Kun, the greater in Zou—\nI prefer to stand amidst the clamor, at ease.\nMy heart is as limpid as the moon at heaven’s edge,\nmy will as steadfast as mountains upon the sea.\nI keep desire’s hues from my eyes,\nand naturally, my face retains its youth.\nOnce the *Niwan* cavity is mastered,\nwhy labor over the Great Return?\n\n**12.**\nI speak of the profound subtleties of the Primordial,\nyet who has truly inquired into their own heart?\nWhen qi flows freely through the Three Fields,\nthe Two Cavities’ currents are swallowed without cease.\nFor years I sailed seas in search of life’s medicine,\ntraversed forests seeking immortality—\nhow much better to seek within this body,\nwhere the Dao of *Xiyi* is easily found.\n\n**13.**\nSecluded in an ancient abbey, better than mountain dwelling,\ngates barred by moss, hoofprints rare.\nIn stillness, I swallow a thousand mouthfuls of nectar;\nby the secluded window, I set aside a forest of books.\nFewer disputes, fewer acquaintances;\nno greed, no glory, no shame.\nStolidly, I pass the days as they come—\nlet others call me a fool.\n\n**14.**\nRefining primordial essence to restore purity,\nall endeavors return to the True.\nIf fools could all attain the Dao,\nhow could immortals be called extraordinary?\nRepayment comes only when merit is complete;\nthe state of *Xiyi* is not apart from this body.\nSimply circulate the harmonious qi with diligence,\nand your countenance will grow ever more youthful.\n\n**15.**\nIn youth, I endured hardship near the literati,\nsixty-odd years slipping by like grass in the wind.\nFortunate to meet a perfected one who taught the Dao,\nI entrusted my nature and life to emptiness.\nHair, once white, turned black through qi’s refinement;\na face, once wrinkled, smoothed by essence’s preservation.\nThe great aim was to stand beside ministers—\nyet in my allotted span, I found no end to toil.\n\n**16.**\nThe flowing current ascends straight to the *Niwan*;\nonce the joints are unblocked, the countenance is preserved.\n\n**17.**\nEnlightenment is like turning a palm to behold,\nwhile delusion lies beyond layered mountains.\nBefore the spirit’s discernment is clear, a thousand distractions arise;\nonce the heart’s field is awakened, ten thousand affairs grow still.\nIf you seek long life and transcendence alike,\nall lies in the leisure of this very body.\nWhy study the Dao only to cling to confusion?\nThe principle of non-action must still be practiced.\n\nQi that swallows root and ancestor is not mere exhalation;\nhunger that starves the heart’s bowels spares no hunger.\nPreserve the primordial essence, and age will not come;\ncast off passions and desires, and you return to infancy.\nIf you further comprehend the *Chongtian* cavity,\nyou will surely have a carefree, transcendent destiny.\n\n**18.**\nThose who seek immortality all learn to refine the Yin elixir,\nyet where do they exchange essence, only to lose and regain it?\nBefore a year has passed, many lie stricken with illness,\njust as youth and vigor alter the countenance.\nThe Yang soul gradually wanes, and no awakening comes;\nlife and nature are treated as if they were nothing.\nIf you wish to prolong your years and remain in the world,\npreserve essence, guard qi, and inquire in stillness.\n\n**19.**\nThe purple-robed master, greedy for titles,\nneglected the cultivation of qi and the firing of the elixir.\nBefore middle age, his body was already old,\njust as strength and vigor gave way to autumn’s first frost.\nThough he knew the path to long life,\nhe dully followed the flowing stream.\nWhat use was it to hang up his cap and robes?\nThe pursuit of fame and profit should long since have ceased.\n\n**20.**\nDwelling in the mortal dust for decades,\nthough he observed forms as supple as a willow,\nhe constantly refined the primordial qi to nourish his appearance,\nand often spoke of cinnabar while seeking the Dao’s current.\nOne kind of profit and fame held no allure;\nall manner of glory and disgrace faded before his eyes.\nWith money, he bought only cups of wine;\nwithout care or worry, what sorrow remained?\n\n**21.**\nFor ten years by the firefly’s lamp, he sought renown,\ntwice sitting for the spring examinations, yet nothing came of it.\nWith ambition but no opportunity to secure even a minor post,\nhe turned at last to the study of long life.\nHow could seeking office compare to seeking immortality?\nHow could lust for beauty rival love for the Dao?\nAs long as the countenance remains radiant,\nascension is surely near at hand.\n\n**22.**\nWhat is fame but a fleeting echo across the earth?\nHow can it compare to secluded cultivation and transcendence?\nDiligently firing the elixir through nine cycles,\nearnestly circulating qi to reach the Three Clarities—\nwhen the medicine is complete, a path of flight will open;\nwhen merit is full, you must depart for the realm beyond things.\nWhy crave glory, wealth, and honor?\nThe body’s firmness is the true essence.\n\n**23.**\nPeople covet beauty and chase riches,\nand thus lose their lives and bodies.\nAnts and flies bite the flesh, and they fear pain;\nthe Yang soul departs the body, yet they doubt not.\nOne day, struck by illness with no cure,\nthey seek gods in ten thousand ways to avert disaster.\nBut if you master the refinement of essence and preservation of qi,\nhow could long life ever be buried in the Yellow Springs?\n\n**24.**\nDo not envy the fleeting splendor of the Three Maos;\nthough you pore over the *Zhouyi*, you copy it in vain.\nOnly when you awaken to the Dao’s truth and embrace its principle\ndo you distance yourself from worldly affairs and sever all ties.\nYang essence, endlessly refined, knows no limit;\njade nectar, constantly consumed, is never set aside.\nWait only for the day when merit is complete,\nand you will ascend with the mysterious crane, leaving the mortal nest.\n\n**25.**\nAll seek transmutation to enrich their households,\nforgetting that the body withers and the years change.\nChasing beauty, they make themselves slaves to desire;\ngreedy for wealth, they treat life as lightly as dust.\nThough their mouths speak of cultivating the immortal Dao,\ntheir hearts are like yakshas in the night.\nSuch fools will never awaken—\nlet the enlightened not grieve for them.\n\n**26.**\nBowing, burning incense, and commissioning painted images—\nhow can these compare to striving in self-cultivation?\nDiligently swallow saliva a thousand times over,\nand long remember to guard the spirit through the fifth watch.\nDo not neglect the constant rules of guiding and pulling;\nbe ever mindful to refine the primordial essence.\nThough you may not yet ascend to heaven,\nyour name will surely be recorded in the immortals’ register.\n\n**27.**\nDo not read the Nine Classics and Three Histories—\nwhat use are they to you in the end?\nHow much better to preserve the harmonious qi of breath\nand personally tend the great furnace of medicine!\nPreserve the Yang essence, and you will sustain old age;\nrefine the golden substance, and you will ascend in emptiness.\nThe path to long life is clearly laid out,\nyet how can the foolish nature of mortals be turned?\n\n**28.**\nThe pursuit of rank and wealth knows no end;\nwhat use is it to attain the highest office and greatest riches?\nHow much better to quiet the heart and forget scheming,\nto still the body and dispel all doubt!\nLet the song pillow drift with the endless spring days,\nand refine essence so the temples never gray.\nOne day, beyond the world, when we meet again,\nit will be as immortals, with a destiny apart.\n\n**29.**\nTrue lead and true mercury are not hard to find—\nit is mortals who err in their use of the heart.\nThe moon’s spirit and the sun’s soul are easily understood,\nbut the principles of wood essence and fire timing run deep.\nThrough bitter toil, refine the medicine for three years;\nthrough transformation and spiritual communion, transmute the five metals.\nTo transcend the world, you need only consume a single grain—\nthen Penglai and Yingzhou will know your name.\n\n**30.**\nThe twin gates along the spine lead to the crown’s gate—\nthis is the root path of cultivation.\nFrequently swallow the jade liquid of the Flower Pool,\nand the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will send it upward.\nConstantly let qi pierce through the joints,\nand naturally essence will fill and the Valley Spirit abide.\nOne day, when you reach the land of long life,\nyou must remember those who first guided you.\n\n**Postscript:**\n*Langranzi* was formerly the abbot of Tongxuan Temple in the Tang dynasty.\nHis deeds were wondrous, his cultivation profound.\nHe concealed himself in the world for a hundred years, and in the *Duangong* era of the Song dynasty,\nhe ascended to heaven in broad daylight at Peach Blossom Lane.\nThe emperor bestowed the name *Jizhen Temple*,\nand his *Thirty Poems on the Immortal’s Awakening to the Dao* circulated in the world.\nHere ends *Langranzi of the Great Mystery’s Poems on Advancing the Dao*.",

      "translated_text": "**17.**\nEnlightenment is like turning a palm to behold,\nwhile delusion lies beyond layered mountains.\nBefore the spirit’s discernment is clear, a thousand distractions arise;\nonce the heart’s field is awakened, ten thousand affairs grow still.\nIf you seek long life and transcendence alike,\nall lies in the leisure of this very body.\nWhy study the Dao only to cling to confusion?\nThe principle of non-action must still be practiced.\n\nQi that swallows root and ancestor is not mere exhalation;\nhunger that starves the heart’s bowels spares no hunger.\nPreserve the primordial essence, and age will not come;\ncast off passions and desires, and you return to infancy.\nIf you further comprehend the *Chongtian* cavity,\nyou will surely have a carefree, transcendent destiny.\n\n**18.**\nThose who seek immortality all learn to refine the Yin elixir,\nyet where do they exchange essence, only to lose and regain it?\nBefore a year has passed, many lie stricken with illness,\njust as youth and vigor alter the countenance.\nThe Yang soul gradually wanes, and no awakening comes;\nlife and nature are treated as if they were nothing.\nIf you wish to prolong your years and remain in the world,\npreserve essence, guard qi, and inquire in stillness.\n\n**19.**\nThe purple-robed master, greedy for titles,\nneglected the cultivation of qi and the firing of the elixir.\nBefore middle age, his body was already old,\njust as strength and vigor gave way to autumn’s first frost.\nThough he knew the path to long life,\nhe dully followed the flowing stream.\nWhat use was it to hang up his cap and robes?\nThe pursuit of fame and profit should long since have ceased.\n\n**20.**\nDwelling in the mortal dust for decades,\nthough he observed forms as supple as a willow,\nhe constantly refined the primordial qi to nourish his appearance,\nand often spoke of cinnabar while seeking the Dao’s current.\nOne kind of profit and fame held no allure;\nall manner of glory and disgrace faded before his eyes.\nWith money, he bought only cups of wine;\nwithout care or worry, what sorrow remained?\n\n**21.**\nFor ten years by the firefly’s lamp, he sought renown,\ntwice sitting for the spring examinations, yet nothing came of it.\nWith ambition but no opportunity to secure even a minor post,\nhe turned at last to the study of long life.\nHow could seeking office compare to seeking immortality?\nHow could lust for beauty rival love for the Dao?\nAs long as the countenance remains radiant,\nascension is surely near at hand.\n\n**22.**\nWhat is fame but a fleeting echo across the earth?\nHow can it compare to secluded cultivation and transcendence?\nDiligently firing the elixir through nine cycles,\nearnestly circulating qi to reach the Three Clarities—\nwhen the medicine is complete, a path of flight will open;\nwhen merit is full, you must depart for the realm beyond things.\nWhy crave glory, wealth, and honor?\nThe body’s firmness is the true essence.\n\n**23.**\nPeople covet beauty and chase riches,\nand thus lose their lives and bodies.\nAnts and flies bite the flesh, and they fear pain;\nthe Yang soul departs the body, yet they doubt not.\nOne day, struck by illness with no cure,\nthey seek gods in ten thousand ways to avert disaster.\nBut if you master the refinement of essence and preservation of qi,\nhow could long life ever be buried in the Yellow Springs?\n\n**24.**\nDo not envy the fleeting splendor of the Three Maos;\nthough you pore over the *Zhouyi*, you copy it in vain.\nOnly when you awaken to the Dao’s truth and embrace its principle\ndo you distance yourself from worldly affairs and sever all ties.\nYang essence, endlessly refined, knows no limit;\njade nectar, constantly consumed, is never set aside.\nWait only for the day when merit is complete,\nand you will ascend with the mysterious crane, leaving the mortal nest.\n\n**25.**\nAll seek transmutation to enrich their households,\nforgetting that the body withers and the years change.\nChasing beauty, they make themselves slaves to desire;\ngreedy for wealth, they treat life as lightly as dust.\nThough their mouths speak of cultivating the immortal Dao,\ntheir hearts are like yakshas in the night.\nSuch fools will never awaken—\nlet the enlightened not grieve for them.\n\n**26.**\nBowing, burning incense, and commissioning painted images—\nhow can these compare to striving in self-cultivation?\nDiligently swallow saliva a thousand times over,\nand long remember to guard the spirit through the fifth watch.\nDo not neglect the constant rules of guiding and pulling;\nbe ever mindful to refine the primordial essence.\nThough you may not yet ascend to heaven,\nyour name will surely be recorded in the immortals’ register.\n\n**27.**\nDo not read the Nine Classics and Three Histories—\nwhat use are they to you in the end?\nHow much better to preserve the harmonious qi of breath\nand personally tend the great furnace of medicine!\nPreserve the Yang essence, and you will sustain old age;\nrefine the golden substance, and you will ascend in emptiness.\nThe path to long life is clearly laid out,\nyet how can the foolish nature of mortals be turned?\n\n**28.**\nThe pursuit of rank and wealth knows no end;\nwhat use is it to attain the highest office and greatest riches?\nHow much better to quiet the heart and forget scheming,\nto still the body and dispel all doubt!\nLet the song pillow drift with the endless spring days,\nand refine essence so the temples never gray.\nOne day, beyond the world, when we meet again,\nit will be as immortals, with a destiny apart.\n\n**29.**\nTrue lead and true mercury are not hard to find—\nit is mortals who err in their use of the heart.\nThe moon’s spirit and the sun’s soul are easily understood,\nbut the principles of wood essence and fire timing run deep.\nThrough bitter toil, refine the medicine for three years;\nthrough transformation and spiritual communion, transmute the five metals.\nTo transcend the world, you need only consume a single grain—\nthen Penglai and Yingzhou will know your name.\n\n**30.**\nThe twin gates along the spine lead to the crown’s gate—\nthis is the root path of cultivation.\nFrequently swallow the jade liquid of the Flower Pool,\nand the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will send it upward.\nConstantly let qi pierce through the joints,\nand naturally essence will fill and the Valley Spirit abide.\nOne day, when you reach the land of long life,\nyou must remember those who first guided you.\n\n**Postscript:**\n*Langranzi* was formerly the abbot of Tongxuan Temple in the Tang dynasty.\nHis deeds were wondrous, his cultivation profound.\nHe concealed himself in the world for a hundred years, and in the *Duangong* era of the Song dynasty,\nhe ascended to heaven in broad daylight at Peach Blossom Lane.\nThe emperor bestowed the name *Jizhen Temple*,\nand his *Thirty Poems on the Immortal’s Awakening to the Dao* circulated in the world.\nHere ends *Langranzi of the Great Mystery’s Poems on Advancing the Dao*.",
      "overlap_context": "ear the literati,\nsixty-odd years slipping by like grass in the wind.\nFortunate to meet a perfected one who taught the Dao,\nI entrusted my nature and life to emptiness.\nHair, once white, turned black through qi’s refinement;\na face, once wrinkled, smoothed by essence’s preservation.\nThe great aim was to stand beside ministers—\nyet in my allotted span, I found no end to toil.\n\n**16.**\nThe flowing current ascends straight to the *Niwan*;\nonce the joints are unblocked, the countenance is preserved.",
