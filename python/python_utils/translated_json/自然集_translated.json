  "full_translation": "**The Natural Collection**\n\n**Daoist Lyrics #1**\n\n**[Immortal Prosperity] \"Rouged Lips\"**\nThe Dao’s mystery is subtle and profound,\nFirst one must awaken to the mind-ground—no easy feat.\nYet there lie the ancient sages’ writings,\nWithin them hidden the true message.\n\n**[Mixed River Dragon]**\nIf speaking of the root of the primordial embryo,\nOnly through containing light and silently guarding emptiness to its utmost.\nFrom movement seek stillness,\nStillness and stability are the subtle and profound.\nSilent sitting, forgetting words—\nThis is the Dao’s communal dwelling,\nSealing the mouth is the Dao’s foundation.\n\nThere are those so-called enlightened masters,\nArrogant and self-aggrandizing, spouting wild and deceitful words.\nHearing the Dao by the wayside,\nThey obscure their own primordial spirit.\nThey fear neither Heaven’s scrutiny\nNor the six paths of rebirth.\n\n**[Oil Gourd]**\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless and actionless,\nIts wondrous principle seizes the marrow of Heaven and Earth.\nWithin it, only the self may know,\nFrom non-being, being arises—this one may yet comprehend.\nIn the jade crucible, constantly harmonize yin and yang.\nAdvance the fire’s work without delay,\nThrough the double gates, penetrate into the Mud Pill Palace.\nNaturally, radiant light will manifest.\n\n**[Joy Under Heaven]**\nGolden liquid, returning elixir descends the jade ladder,\nRefining and simmering, white snow flies.\nThe yellow sprout gradually grows,\nGenerating the substance of Heaven and Earth.\nWithin the body, the true path is not lost,\nTransforming into jade pond-filled nectar.\n\n**[Rear Courtyard Flowers]**\nHunger within satiety, satiety after hunger,\nDrinking ghee to nourish kidney water.\nSecurely close the earth gate,\nTransform true essence, swallow the jade bud.\nSpitting rainbow mists, within the Yellow Court they meet,\nSeeing the Metal Elder flush red.\nThe infant and the wu-ji,\nTogether with the primordial spirit, mutually protect.\n\n**[Willow Leaf]**\nPursuing straight to the Heavenly Palace to meet,\nThe Alchemical Maiden weeps tears like rain,\nThe Ding Lad sighs deeply.\nArranging the auspicious time,\nIn an instant, gathering and parting, separation.\n\n**[Golden Goblet]**\nMountain-top snow blown by the xun wind,\nSweet dew descends, drinking the medicinal spoon.\nAdjusting the fire’s timing with meticulous effort,\nFor long, fully nurturing the tranquil spirit-turtle.\nThe elixir is complete, gold fills the house,\nThe crow and hare roam east and west.\nIf one inverts kan and li,\nRefining soul and spirit, nurturing the embryo’s foundation.\n\n**[Admiring Flowers]**\nTemporarily selecting a patch of white snow piled on the ground,\nCirculating the two qi, exchanging and drinking from the jade cup.\nWithin the three fields, warming and practicing the four phases’ harmonious body,\nIn the Fivefold Luminous Palace, guarding the true reality.\n*[Refrain]*:\nRefining the six-foot body to cultivate the self,\nTransforming seven golden lotuses to follow everywhere.\nMatching the eight trigrams, riding the simurgh to return,\nReaching the nine skies beyond,\nUtterly displaying majestic might.\n\n**[Finale]**\nTen years of bitter cultivation,\nNine streets as livelihood.\nEight hundred deeds refine the jade body,\nThe seven-star sword has always dispelled ghosts.\nWithin the six harmonies, penetrating the subtle and tranquil,\nSinging the Dao, practicing the Five Ancestors’ non-action.\nWho knows the effort within the four markets?\nNurturing the three fields, gathering beauty.\nWith the two heavens’ spirits aiding,\nA single wheel of bright moon illuminates the mysterious mechanism.\n\n---\n\n**[Nanlü] \"A Branch of Flowers\"**\nSince I left the household life,\nBy chance I met an enlightened master.\nEnduring hardship for over a decade,\nWorking diligently through the nights of ignorance.\nTransmitted was the Dao’s wondrous emptiness,\nInstructing me to firmly secure the cinnabar field.\nFor this fleeting life, practicing Daoist arts.\nRefining the fire’s timing, tempering and augmenting,\nEntering stillness and stability—this is the bath.\n\n**[Liangzhou]**\nUtterly unmoving, unwavering in resolve,\nRefining the golden elixir to escape suffering and leave the mundane,\nExchanging the mortal frame, forgetting words and reducing speech.\nIn a moment, gathering and restraining lead and mercury.\nWith root and foundation, returning to simplicity and truth,\nWith aspiration, soaring through clouds and mist,\nWith karmic affinity, flying to the celestial thoroughfare.\nIn initial study, earnestly upholding true words,\nSeeing worldly people, greedy for wealth and lust, heedless of their fleeting lives,\nEach one striving to amass gold and pearls.\nWhen the great limit arrives, all is naught,\nWasting spirit, leaving the body withered.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nImmortals were originally made from mortals.\nDetermining floating and sinking, recognizing guest and host,\nGathering mercury, gathering lead—do not delay.\nAsking oneself: is there being, is there non-being?\n\n**[Announcing to Heaven]**\nTransforming pure incense, blowing into the middle sky’s path,\nIn an instant, creation and transformation occur in a moment.\nGracefully dancing, seeking gulls at the sea’s bottom,\nDelighting in the cold and desolate, the sparse and secluded.\nDisciple and master,\nLaughing and chanting, together stepping toward the immortals’ capital,\nReturning home to the three isles of Penglai.\nDay and night, effort without thought,\nDim and distant, vague and indistinct.\nThe Heavenly Gate opens, the Dao is clear and empty,\nThe earth gate is securely closed, endlessly withdrawing and adding.\nThe work of clarity and depth is done,\nSitting alone, forgetting words, silent speech,\nDriving the river chariot up and down with ease.\nThe work complete, purely guarding,\nSeeming to exist yet like non-being.\nBrightly, not obscuring the original path,\nEmbracing the ten thousand images, the body clings not to a thread’s weight.\n\n**[Crow Caws at Night]**\nCirculating kun’s fire, qian’s heavenly mist,\nDiligently guarding the jade crucible.\nRefining true mercury into the supreme treasure,\nSimmering white snow like golden pearls.\nTempering the yellow sprout into the earth mother,\nDrinking the medicinal spoon, practicing true earth.\nSubduing dragon and tiger,\nSummoning wind and rain.\n\n**[Finale]**\nTransforming into a golden immortal, shedding the body to ride the wind away,\nA single streak of cold light fills the great void.\nThere is the infant, the Alchemical Maiden,\nThe Yellow Woman matching the dear daughter.\nIn an instant, meeting in cloud and rain,\nAll immortals joyfully dancing.\nDeparting the worldly dust, leaving love and desire.\nEarly on, not turning back,\nWholeheartedly seeking Zhong and Lü.\nStraight to Penglai to accompany the ancestral master,\nTogether with the host of immortals, resting in one place.\nAscending and descending the three palaces to the Purple Court,\nRegulating breath, endlessly refining true earth.\nGathering the yellow sprout to tame dragon and tiger,\nRiding the white crane, mounting the simurgh’s chariot.\nLeaving the mortal realm, ascending the immortal path,\nAgain accompanying the pure wind as a companion,\nAnd with the bright moon as the Dao’s master,\nFlying into the Heavenly Palace to wander the immortals’ abode.\n\n**[Double Tune] \"New Water Melody\"**\n\nWithin these gates, I have delved for decades,\nOnly now piercing the sages’ subtle transformations.\nStilling rise and fall to grasp the wondrous principle,\nAdvancing the earthly fire to refine the cinnabar field.\nFirst restrain the mind’s horse and heart’s ape,\nNo longer entangled in worldly俗.\nHalt and listen—\nPracticing breath’s unbroken flow,\nInhaling and exhaling wind and cloud in due order.\nBy the time the Three Palaces ascend and transform,\nThe nine returns and seven reversals hold profound mystery.\nDriving the river chariot, moving swift as smoke,\nRefining the clear wind to reach the Golden Duke’s court.\nShould the Dao-heart grow firm,\nThe Yellow River’s surging waves turn the mud-pill.\nStep by step, gracefully—\nThe great Way has ever been hard for mortals to envy,\nAppearing as shadow without form.\nWithin the gourd lies another heaven,\nWhere golden elixir is refined to nurture the fetal immortal.\nAlong the twin-pass road, qi flows ceaselessly,\nFermenting sweet dew, frequently swallowed.\n\nIntoxicated by the eastern wind—\nWhen the great limit arrives, no choice is made,\nNor does rank or wealth matter.\nSimply pushed on, again and again,\nEach day vowing anew, vowing anew.\nThis year deferred to the next,\nDelaying cultivation, the path still far.\nHow to escape the wheel of birth and death?\n\nLike the wild goose’s fall, the triumphant command—\nI once met a radiant master who transmitted the true Dao,\nPointing to the effortless teaching.\nTaught me to curb greed and desire,\nTo devote more effort, cultivate more goodness.\nTaught me to cast off fame and profit,\nTo pore over ancient texts.\nAll reveal the gateway to the mysterious,\nTo study closely with the true master.\nIf my merit is complete,\nI gain the workings of creation unseen by others.\nJust as the heart grows firm,\nFirmness comes naturally.\n\nPouring fine wine—\nWithin the lead-mercury crucible, the fire burns,\nRefining the supreme treasure with ceaseless care.\nThe wonder lies in the waxing and waning moon,\nA clear path revealed.\nDrawing the primordial spirit to the palace,\nThe subtle workings of the three passes transform.\nOne qi penetrates the three fields,\nNine revolutions in the furnace, smoke and flame.\nDragon and tiger, tortoise and snake coil,\nEmerging from spontaneity,\nSpontaneously a true person of non-action appears.\n\nRowing the river oar—\nHow joyfully I laugh,\nResting with the immortals.\nNo need to seek the Dao or study Chan,\nOnly to sit in silence, forgetting words.\nRegulating true breath without panting,\nThere is the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.\n\nBefore the palace’s joy—\nI urge the worthy:\nPray, always study the *Pointers to the Mysterious*.\nThe great Dao of non-action entices all,\nTo fulfill merit and complete the work,\nRiding the crane to ascend the heavens.\nOnly then entering the effortless transmission,\nEarly fulfilling the vow of cultivation.\nCultivating one who neither comes nor goes,\nWho would cling to this world for long years?\n\nResting the fingers, tuning the strings—\nThis time, who would be bound by worldly俗?\nTranscending the mundane, entering the sagely, following the transformations.\nForgetting both Dao and method, tightly controlling withdrawal and addition,\nSinging of the true arrival at Penglai’s paradise.\nComposing the lower section’s natural collection,\nEarly is the *Chapter of Emptiness and Nothingness*.\nMay the heart’s wishes be fulfilled.\n\n**[Zheng Gong] \"Rolling Embroidered Ball\"**\nCultivating effort, opening wisdom and concentration,\nRefining the Three August Ones to form the sagely embryo.\nThe infant suddenly startled,\nIn an instant flying past the spirit terrace.\nArriving at the Yellow Court’s inner palace,\nJoyfully stirring the yang pass to array dragon and tiger.\nIn a moment, forging them into one,\nStilling rise and fall, tempering the three calamities.\nThe three flowers gather at the mud-pill’s summit,\nThe five qi return to the origin, circling the jade street.\nDescending the twelve towers.\n\nIf you’re a talented scholar—\nHarmonizing lead and mercury in the smelter,\nSuddenly seeing the Kan maiden and Li lad unite.\nThe Golden Duke is buried here,\nCreating the workings of creation, laughing merrily.\nHow proper and fine—\nWho would know my stillness yields great merit?\nThis time, early free from dust.\nIn youth, I once paid homage to a radiant master,\nTaught me to leap from the bewitching fortress.\n\nWelcoming the immortal guest—\nAlways tending the jade furnace’s gate,\nMust open these eight doors.\nUsing Kan and Li in inversion,\nDriving the river chariot, the ox plows in circles.\nTransporting the load into the palace,\nGathering it beyond the three fields.\n\nRed embroidered shoes—\nIn sitting and lying, yang ascends and yin descends,\nOne aperture opens, a hundred apertures open in unison.\nNine returns, seven reversals settle the three calamities,\nBreath opens to the wondrous Dao,\nRegulating true breath to fill the cheeks,\nRefining essence and flower to return to the qi sea.\n\nOld Bao—\nRefining the primordial spirit to behold self-mastery,\nNurturing the fetal immortal, smiling face aglow,\nThe three fields’ qi surging through the breast.\nTempering the supreme treasure yields great merit,\nTen thousand words, a thousand phrases, each fitting,\nAll emerging from the realm of *Dao and Its Virtue* and *The Yin Talisman*.\nActivating the heavenly pass to moisten the nine realms,\nGathering medicinal substances beyond heaven and earth.\nWithin the white cloud’s embrace, ascension swift,\nTransforming through kalpas of cultivation.\n\nPlayful child—\nAt first learning, earnestly loving the true heart,\nBroadly reading scriptures and commentaries.\nSuddenly, the mind’s earth opens in enlightenment,\nRecalling past days of burial.\nTruly, there is a path to ascend as immortal,\nFreely roaming wherever one pleases.\nRepaying this karmic debt,\nThis time, cutting all ties, unstained by a thousand calamities.\n\n**Finale**\nIn stillness, silently practicing,\nDividing the knife’s edge between black and white.\nThe spirit terrace empty, enduring patience,\nDeparting the path of birth and death to cultivate the true,\nInstead planting the withered pine day and night.\nFor now, awaiting the time,\nNearly merit complete, work fulfilled,\nAlone ascending the terrace of heaven.\n\n**Second Finale**\nNo need to read the books of the three teachings,\nNo need to learn the talent of seven steps.\nOnly to dimly, silently endure the work’s progress.\nRefining the jade body to ride the wind away,\nA single beam of cold light entering the sagely ranks.\nBecoming a guest of Penglai,\nRelying entirely on three thousand merits fulfilled,\nThen shedding the mortal frame to attain the immortal embryo.\n\n**Third Finale**\nWhen weary, riding the green simurgh to fly to heaven,\nDriving the white crane to return to earth,\nAscending the immortal realm through transformation.\nThe yellow sprout gradually grows, unknown to others,\nIn the jade rabbit’s nest, well hidden.\nFor now, awaiting the time,\nNearly merit complete, work fulfilled,\nAlone ascending the terrace of heaven.\n\n**Finale**\nThere is quiet work, there is meditative work,\nUnburdened, unentangled.\nThis time, the debt to human ties is repaid,\nLeaping free from the sea of delusion and strife.\n\n**[Zhenggong] Duanzheng Hao**\nCast aside right and wrong,\nBrush away contention and conflict,\nTightly rein in this heart-ape and mind-horse.\nI only wish to dance in the west wind, sleeves wide as falling leaves,\nWatching the sun and moon turn day into night.\n\n**Gun Xiuqiu**\nA thousand households’ rice is enough to beg,\nA hundred-patched robe brings no shame.\nWhy cling to this fleshly shell,\nProud before the lords and nobles of the world?\nI only wish to wander carefree, singing Daoist hymns,\nDrunk and tipsy, bowing in reverence.\nAlms-gathered sacred soup and immortal wine,\nA staff and gourd—these are my only possessions.\nI only wish to drink today when there is wine,\nBeg tomorrow when there is no coin.\nIn the end, bare-chested and free from care.\n\n**Tang Xiucai**\nSome hoard books for their descendants, yet they may not all be kept,\nSome amass gold for their descendants, yet it may not all be guarded.\nI urge you: do not labor like an ox or horse for your children.\nToday, clouds shape mountains with artful grace,\nTomorrow, frost recedes, leaving water’s trace.\nHow can one endure the racing hare and fleeing crow?\n\n**Gun Xiuqiu**\nJust now, the Lantern Festival’s lamps were carried in hand,\nSoon, willow branches were planted before the gates at Qingming.\nJust as wine cups circled the winding stream in purification rites,\nUnnoticed, the dragon boats’ drums thundered in the races.\nJust now, it was the seventh day of the seventh month,\nSoon, it was the ninth day of the ninth.\nHow many times can we joyfully linger together?\nAll our springs and autumns pass in vexation.\nYou see this tangled world—why not drift with fate?\nNone heed how swiftly time flows like water,\nTurning hair to white.\n\n**Tang Xiucai**\nSome build gardens, laying bricks for ponds,\nSome erect pavilions, carving beams and brackets.\nExhausting effort to complete their work.\nToday, it is the Zhang family’s land,\nTomorrow, it becomes the Li family’s tower.\nAll is as fleeting as a hand’s turn.\n\n**Gun Xiuqiu**\nClearing brambles to make a pond,\nUprooting weeds to plant flowers and willows,\nIn four seasons, it blooms like embroidered silk,\nYet how many times can the master wander and return?\nHere, pavilions soon decay,\nFlowers and trees wither in turn,\nThorns reclaim their place,\nMaking travelers sigh at the passing of time.\nOnce, rare blossoms and exotic plants flourished in a thousand hues,\nNow, they are but wild grasses and idle flowers, strewn in sorrow.\nTruly, this is not the autumn of fallen leaves.\n\n**Dai Guduo**\nSpeak not of Yao, Shun, Jie, or Zhou,\nBetter to follow Hao Wangsun, Tan Maqiu, or Liu.\nThey were disciples of Wen Zhongzi, friends of Kang Cangzi.\nSpeak not of officials like Zhang Pingshu or courtesans like Liu Xingshou.\nBetter to follow Perfected Wang, founder of Quanzhen,\nOr turn back halfway, like the horse at Ban Prefecture.\n\n**Zui Taiping**\nHan Zhongli was once a general,\nLan Caihe was once a wandering performer.\nMaster Xuanhu never went to sell wine,\nTieguai Li’s body was burned to ash.\nHe Lianxian guided Cao Guojiu,\nHan Xiangzi could brew wine in an instant.\nLü Dongbin, thrice drunk at Yueyang Tower,\nDelivered a single green willow.\n\n**Tail**\nSpeak not of when merit and work will be complete—\nOnce the mysterious pass is entered, one may join the ranks.\nIn the realm of self and others, all striving is in vain,\nBetter to turn back early from the bitter sea.\n\nWhat of wandering the four great realms,\nOr the three isles and ten continents?\nThese immortals hide their traces, bury their names,\nThey only wait for the present moment to depart.\n\n**[Zhenggong] (Untitled)**\nI practice the art of self-liberation,\nYou scheme to harm others and build a household.\nYou call me mad—you are even madder.\nHere, I have seen through fame and profit,\nWhile your greed is as vast as the heavens.\nHere, I laugh at the arena of fame and gain, seeing it clearly,\nWhy trouble yourself for children, tossed in endless waves?\nHoarding ill-gotten wealth, amassing useless goods,\nWhen death comes, how will you escape?\nInevitably, you’ll be reborn as a mule or horse.\nThe path to heaven lies open, yet few walk it,\nThe gates of hell have no doors, yet many enter.\nFallen and forlorn,\nThus ends the *Natural Collection*.\n\n**[1]** All entries in this section are *sanqu* (vernacular songs). The original lacks musical modes; these have been reconstructed here.\n\n**[2]** This piece was originally titled *Zhenggong* (Proper Palace Mode) but lacked a specific tune name. Based on the *Taihe Zhengyin Pu* (Orthodox Sounds of Grand Harmony) compiled by Zhu Quan of the Ming dynasty, which includes Deng Xueke’s suite under *Zhenggong·Duanzhenghao* (Proper Palace Mode·Upright and Proper) titled *Le Dao* (Joy in the Dao), this tune is adopted here. The following text follows the Ming edition, with emendations noted but not annotated in detail.\n\n**[3]** The Ming edition renders these two lines as:\n*\"Begging for leftover broth and dregs of wine,\nThis fool’s drum and clapper are my stage props.\"*\n\n**[4]** *Gang yisi* (\"just like\"): The Ming edition reads *da gang lai zhishi* (\"all comes down to\"), which is also coherent.\n\n**[5]** The Ming edition renders this line as:\n*\"Were it not for Patriarch Wang, the revealer of the Perfect Realization,\nOne could not seize even half a province of the rebirth-cycle’s horses.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Within these gates, I have delved for decades,\nOnly now piercing the sages’ subtle transformations.\nStilling rise and fall to grasp the wondrous principle,\nAdvancing the earthly fire to refine the cinnabar field.\nFirst restrain the mind’s horse and heart’s ape,\nNo longer entangled in worldly俗.\nHalt and listen—\nPracticing breath’s unbroken flow,\nInhaling and exhaling wind and cloud in due order.\nBy the time the Three Palaces ascend and transform,\nThe nine returns and seven reversals hold profound mystery.\nDriving the river chariot, moving swift as smoke,\nRefining the clear wind to reach the Golden Duke’s court.\nShould the Dao-heart grow firm,\nThe Yellow River’s surging waves turn the mud-pill.\nStep by step, gracefully—\nThe great Way has ever been hard for mortals to envy,\nAppearing as shadow without form.\nWithin the gourd lies another heaven,\nWhere golden elixir is refined to nurture the fetal immortal.\nAlong the twin-pass road, qi flows ceaselessly,\nFermenting sweet dew, frequently swallowed.\n\nIntoxicated by the eastern wind—\nWhen the great limit arrives, no choice is made,\nNor does rank or wealth matter.\nSimply pushed on, again and again,\nEach day vowing anew, vowing anew.\nThis year deferred to the next,\nDelaying cultivation, the path still far.\nHow to escape the wheel of birth and death?\n\nLike the wild goose’s fall, the triumphant command—\nI once met a radiant master who transmitted the true Dao,\nPointing to the effortless teaching.\nTaught me to curb greed and desire,\nTo devote more effort, cultivate more goodness.\nTaught me to cast off fame and profit,\nTo pore over ancient texts.\nAll reveal the gateway to the mysterious,\nTo study closely with the true master.\nIf my merit is complete,\nI gain the workings of creation unseen by others.\nJust as the heart grows firm,\nFirmness comes naturally.\n\nPouring fine wine—\nWithin the lead-mercury crucible, the fire burns,\nRefining the supreme treasure with ceaseless care.\nThe wonder lies in the waxing and waning moon,\nA clear path revealed.\nDrawing the primordial spirit to the palace,\nThe subtle workings of the three passes transform.\nOne qi penetrates the three fields,\nNine revolutions in the furnace, smoke and flame.\nDragon and tiger, tortoise and snake coil,\nEmerging from spontaneity,\nSpontaneously a true person of non-action appears.\n\nRowing the river oar—\nHow joyfully I laugh,\nResting with the immortals.\nNo need to seek the Dao or study Chan,\nOnly to sit in silence, forgetting words.\nRegulating true breath without panting,\nThere is the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.\n\nBefore the palace’s joy—\nI urge the worthy:\nPray, always study the *Pointers to the Mysterious*.\nThe great Dao of non-action entices all,\nTo fulfill merit and complete the work,\nRiding the crane to ascend the heavens.\nOnly then entering the effortless transmission,\nEarly fulfilling the vow of cultivation.\nCultivating one who neither comes nor goes,\nWho would cling to this world for long years?\n\nResting the fingers, tuning the strings—\nThis time, who would be bound by worldly俗?\nTranscending the mundane, entering the sagely, following the transformations.\nForgetting both Dao and method, tightly controlling withdrawal and addition,\nSinging of the true arrival at Penglai’s paradise.\nComposing the lower section’s natural collection,\nEarly is the *Chapter of Emptiness and Nothingness*.\nMay the heart’s wishes be fulfilled.\n\n**[Zheng Gong] \"Rolling Embroidered Ball\"**\nCultivating effort, opening wisdom and concentration,\nRefining the Three August Ones to form the sagely embryo.\nThe infant suddenly startled,\nIn an instant flying past the spirit terrace.\nArriving at the Yellow Court’s inner palace,\nJoyfully stirring the yang pass to array dragon and tiger.\nIn a moment, forging them into one,\nStilling rise and fall, tempering the three calamities.\nThe three flowers gather at the mud-pill’s summit,\nThe five qi return to the origin, circling the jade street.\nDescending the twelve towers.\n\nIf you’re a talented scholar—\nHarmonizing lead and mercury in the smelter,\nSuddenly seeing the Kan maiden and Li lad unite.\nThe Golden Duke is buried here,\nCreating the workings of creation, laughing merrily.\nHow proper and fine—\nWho would know my stillness yields great merit?\nThis time, early free from dust.\nIn youth, I once paid homage to a radiant master,\nTaught me to leap from the bewitching fortress.\n\nWelcoming the immortal guest—\nAlways tending the jade furnace’s gate,\nMust open these eight doors.\nUsing Kan and Li in inversion,\nDriving the river chariot, the ox plows in circles.\nTransporting the load into the palace,\nGathering it beyond the three fields.\n\nRed embroidered shoes—\nIn sitting and lying, yang ascends and yin descends,\nOne aperture opens, a hundred apertures open in unison.\nNine returns, seven reversals settle the three calamities,\nBreath opens to the wondrous Dao,\nRegulating true breath to fill the cheeks,\nRefining essence and flower to return to the qi sea.\n\nOld Bao—\nRefining the primordial spirit to behold self-mastery,\nNurturing the fetal immortal, smiling face aglow,\nThe three fields’ qi surging through the breast.\nTempering the supreme treasure yields great merit,\nTen thousand words, a thousand phrases, each fitting,\nAll emerging from the realm of *Dao and Its Virtue* and *The Yin Talisman*.\nActivating the heavenly pass to moisten the nine realms,\nGathering medicinal substances beyond heaven and earth.\nWithin the white cloud’s embrace, ascension swift,\nTransforming through kalpas of cultivation.\n\nPlayful child—\nAt first learning, earnestly loving the true heart,\nBroadly reading scriptures and commentaries.\nSuddenly, the mind’s earth opens in enlightenment,\nRecalling past days of burial.\nTruly, there is a path to ascend as immortal,\nFreely roaming wherever one pleases.\nRepaying this karmic debt,\nThis time, cutting all ties, unstained by a thousand calamities.\n\n**Finale**\nIn stillness, silently practicing,\nDividing the knife’s edge between black and white.\nThe spirit terrace empty, enduring patience,\nDeparting the path of birth and death to cultivate the true,\nInstead planting the withered pine day and night.\nFor now, awaiting the time,\nNearly merit complete, work fulfilled,\nAlone ascending the terrace of heaven.\n\n**Second Finale**\nNo need to read the books of the three teachings,\nNo need to learn the talent of seven steps.\nOnly to dimly, silently endure the work’s progress.\nRefining the jade body to ride the wind away,\nA single beam of cold light entering the sagely ranks.\nBecoming a guest of Penglai,\nRelying entirely on three thousand merits fulfilled,\nThen shedding the mortal frame to attain the immortal embryo.\n\n**Third Finale**\nWhen weary, riding the green simurgh to fly to heaven,\nDriving the white crane to return to earth,\nAscending the immortal realm through transformation.\nThe yellow sprout gradually grows, unknown to others,\nIn the jade rabbit’s nest, well hidden.\nFor now, awaiting the time,\nNearly merit complete, work fulfilled,\nAlone ascending the terrace of heaven.",
