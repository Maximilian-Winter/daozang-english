  "full_translation": "**The Emerald Void Scroll**\n\n**Title:** *The Emerald Void Scroll* (*Cuìxū Piān*). One fascicle. Composed by Chen Nan of the Southern Song. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Great Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Emerald Void Scroll***\n\nI once read the poem Zhang Ziyang presented to the Master of White Deer Grotto, which said:\n*\"I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*\n*Why not refine the mind and smelt mercury and lead?*\n*Let not the lamp be snuffed out by the wind,*\n*For the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame Heaven.\"*\n\nUpon reading this, I closed the scroll and struck my breast, sighing deeply: Ziyang’s words were meant for those who already knew the medicine—how much more so for those still benighted! Thus, day and night, I took the wind and lamp as my warning. For ten years, I pored over books of golden hoops and thorny trials; for another ten, I practiced the arts of golden lead and wooden mercury—yet it all tasted like chewing wax. Though I sought a path beyond birth and death, I fumbled like a fly at a window, unaware that the world had already passed me by.\n\nOnly upon reverently perusing *The Emerald Void Scroll* and listening to the profound discourses of lofty recluses did I begin to understand: what is gathered is called the *medicine*; what is refined is called the *fire*; what congeals is called the *elixir*; what is nurtured is called the *embryo*—yet in truth, they are one. The place of its arising is called the *river source*; the vessels hidden in mountains and seas are called the *altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth*. The nature it receives is given names like *mercury, lead, water, and fire*; the forms it takes are called *cinnabar, dark pearl*, and other titles. Yet from today’s perspective, it is but a single thing.\n\nIndeed, the ancients dissected the true origin and distinguished the categories of *qi*, giving rise to teachings on gathering, uniting, forging, and bathing. Like the hexagrams of the *Yijing*, all emerge from *Qian*; like the stars and birds of the celestial sphere, all revolve around the Dipper. Through the subtleties of extraction and replenishment, discussions of weights and measures arise. But by observing the moon’s halos—black and white—and the tides of earth—ebbing and flowing—one may silently grasp the intent of seizing the hour within the day. With not even a hair’s breadth of error, why fear that the Golden Elder will not ride the dragon, or the Radiant Maiden will not mount the tiger?\n\nThe elixir’s head is knotted in an instant; the infant is born within ten months. Spirit congeals, *qi* gathers, and a body exists beyond the body. This is truly the swiftest path to immortal learning, the wondrous Way of transcending the world. Its essential, subtle, and concise words are all contained within *The Emerald Void Scroll*.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Wang Sicheng, the True Breath Master, who bows twice with reverence after burning incense.\n\n**The Emerald Void Scroll**\nComposed by Perfected Chen of the Muddy Pellet.\n\n**The Purple Court Scripture**\n\nThe Celestial Sovereign of the Crimson Palace governs the firmament of Qian,\nThe Qian Dragon soars to the Nine-Flowered Heaven.\nWithin Heaven lies the wondrous, boundless Palace of the Limitless,\nWhere myriad scrolls point to the arcane chapters—\nEach verse reveals the golden elixir’s intent,\nA thousand phrases, ten thousand words, distilled into one.\n\nTeach men only to seek mercury and lead,\nGather these two into the crucible and refine them.\nAt night, fire erupts from Kunlun Mountain,\nIts flames cooling as the moon’s light turns cold.\nAbove the Winding River, the Golden Crow takes flight,\nWhile Chang’e rejoices with the Dipper and Ox.\n\nRefine them without pause for even a moment,\nA single breath, vast and subtle, pierces the Three Passes.\nThe qi flows ceaselessly through the Three Passes,\nA white meridian ascending to the Muddy Pellet.\nAbove the Muddy Pellet rests the Purple Gold Crucible,\nWithin it, a lump of purple gold—\nTransformed into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth,\nFragrant, sweet, and refreshing upon the tongue’s tip.\nSwallowed and absorbed into the five viscera,\nThe organs rejoice, the body at peace and hale.\n\nWhen the Crimson Serpent and Azure Dragon unite,\nWind stills, waves calm, tiger and dragon coil.\nThe divine water brims, the Flowery Pond at rest,\nWhite snow swirls, flying across the four mountains.\nThe Seven-Treasure Pavilion stands through the twelve hours,\nBefore it, golden blossoms bloom in profound splendor.\n\nThis is the essence of lead and mercury,\nTransmuted into marrow, filling the gates’ source.\nSeek only the Celestial Cycle within the body,\nFrom the waxing crescent to the waning, and back again.\nThe medicine is balanced, the qi abundant,\nAs heaven and earth, sun and moon, converge in union.\n\nThe void shatters into a hundred fragments,\nChew the chaos soft as silk.\nTurned and folded, it becomes a single coin,\nThe body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.\nCrimson blood is exchanged for white blood,\nGolden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.\nA pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,\nA golden blossom blooms like a crimson lotus.\n\nNow the body’s spirit and qi are whole,\nNo need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.\nI now know your wisdom is thus,\nThat you are destined to become an immortal.\nClearly instructed without a second word,\nSilently refine and withdraw, then replenish.\n\nIn a year, harvest the moon without waiting a year,\nIn a month, seize the sun without waiting a month,\nIn a day, grasp the hour as hours yield to days,\nWithin the hour, find the moment—profound and arcane.\nArcane beyond arcane, inexpressible in words,\nYet it lies in the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.\nThe Golden Elder and Radiant Maiden wrest creation,\nGhosts and spirits weep in astonishment and clamor.\nClouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—\nA single grain of the mysterious pearl sown in the Jade Field.\nTen months of fire, the sacred embryo becomes an immortal,\nNine revolutions, nine new moons, cycling in endless return.\n\nAt first, the meridians of the spine’s pass open,\nNext, the bladder blazes like fire,\nWithin, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,\nStirring to surge toward the heart’s source.\nHeart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally unite,\nMetal and wood, though separated, follow their course.\nThe Yellow Court’s qi dwells in the Central Palace,\nThe palace governs all phenomena, the heart holds sway.\nThe water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—\nWho sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,\nThe crow’s soul and hare’s spirit crumble to dust.\n\nThus, in silence, seek the true root,\nA straight path leading to the numinous truth.\nClearly, essence is preserved by qi,\nGradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.\nThis spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,\nPure yang, undying—the true person.\nKnowing this, one should cultivate immortality,\nAnd the only gate to immortality is the golden elixir.\nThe golden elixir has no second secret—\nA single acre within the body is your homestead.\nSaliva, mucus, essence, fluids, blood, and humors—\nThese seven yin substances, how can they be rectified?\n\nWithin Kan, it is not the kidneys but the numinous root,\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red as the Northern Horse gallops.\nSeven returns, nine reversions—all in a moment,\nAll things in creation are thus born.\nOnly this true operation of Qian and Kun,\nNo need for empty striving or silent words.\nWithout thought, without念, the spirit grows dull—\nHow then can it congeal into the embryonic immortal?\n\nThe embryonic immortal is but the union of two,\nAnd this union occurs in but an instant.\nDo you yet know the return of the Great Yang?\nIt lies just before the Winter Solstice.\nIt is said when the golden essence descends,\nWith what is it restored?\nThe golden essence lies in the Kun Palace’s medicine,\nKun resides in the southwest, the river’s source.\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—\nThis is the root of the medicine.\n\nExchange hours for days, moments for hours,\nA single drop of sweet dew—named the Numinous Spring.\nSwallowed, it surges into the heart, piercing the lung’s transport points,\nFalling into the bladder to form the elixir.\nThe elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—\nThough it originates there, it rests in the liver.\nThe liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence,\nEncountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.\n\nDo not say this is the work of effort,\nLest such words cling to form.\nBegin with form, end without form—\nRefine essence into qi, qi returns to the root,\nThe root of qi congeals into spirit,\nOnly then is there non-doing and spiritual communion.\n\nLike husband and wife in union,\nA single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.\nTheir union is born of emotion, yet emotion,\nStill brings forth a child in ten months—\nHow much more so when the cosmos lies within your grasp?\n\nWithin the body, the tiger’s roar and dragon’s song,\nThough the dragon’s song is unseen,\nWaves surge high, a thousand fathoms deep.\nThough the tiger’s roar is unheard,\nThe night wind howls through ten thousand forests.\n\nFrom the elixir’s coagulation onward,\nThrough the deepening of the fire’s refinement,\nUntil the tenth month, when frost descends,\nSpirit and soul flee—who dares contend?\nA year comprises twelve months,\nYet who dares bathe at Mao and You?\nThus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,\nThe golden crucible brimming, dragon essence overflowing.\nThe mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—\nWith the secret received, what difficulty remains in cultivation?\n\nIf you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,\nAnd grasp the moon’s soul,\nNodding at these words, you know the ancients—\nWhat worry remains that your body will not ascend?\n\nWithin the body’s shell, within the heart’s depths,\nLies a priceless treasure—\nIt can give life or bring death,\nFeed the hungry or sate the full.\nSeek its meaning, take its origin,\nAnd wander carefree, joyous, without hunger or cold.\n\nSuch scenes and proofs of attainment\nAll unfold within a single day’s effort.\nThis effort seems idle,\nThe medicine is not distant, its gathering not difficult.\n\nWho knows the fire’s glow, crimson as ten thousand fathoms,\nBurning away the Three Corpses, the jade crucible grows cold?\nThe cinnabar field can birth purple mushrooms,\nThe Yellow Court may yield red coptis.\n\nA single taste of red coptis banishes hunger forever,\nOne dose of purple mushrooms preserves a youthful face.\nThe body becomes wholly white as milk-flowers,\nGolden sinews and jade bones never dim with age.\n\nWhen merit is complete and the Way fulfilled, cranes arrive—\nWith one leap, you ascend to the clouds’ edge.\n\n*Song of the Great Dao*\nTrue yin and true yang are the true Dao,\nYet they lie before your eyes—why seek them afar?\nOrdinary folk year after year refine the returning elixir,\nSome see blue and yellow and claim it is fine.\n\nThe steadfast should aspire to uphold the method,\nNot harm the spirit-mind but perceive the Dao.\nSimply know how to seek the true Yellow Sprout,\nAnd one who consumes it will never age.\n\nThe Yellow Sprout is not the same as worldly lead,\nIn vain do they labor, seeing no achievement.\nWasting time, their hair turns white in vain—\nWhere in this drifting world can they visit Red Pine?\n\nThe divine water of the Flower Pool is rare in the world,\nIts transmission unknown to the vulgar.\nThey take worldly lead and mercury,\nMistaking them for the true, lost in confusion.\n\nThe Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger follows the Dragon,\nThe Red Bird mates with a resonant clang.\nRegulate the qi, move the fire, follow the Palace of Birds,\nCinnabar enters the belly, the body surges with vitality.\n\nThe profound mystery of the Five Phases is hard to grasp,\nDragon and Tiger lie hidden in Kan and Li.\nHundreds of methods for the returning elixir exist,\nBut the most wondrous requires the true Flower Pool.\n\nCinnabar’s position is not inherently red,\nThe four seasons array it in the southern abode.\nThe Flowing Pearl’s nature has no fixed dwelling—\nIf you know its origin, it is like autumn stone.\n\nThe sun’s essence and moon’s radiance are the two true qi,\nContaining the embryo, nurturing the child, it is divine.\nWhen the transformation nears its end, you will see it yourself,\nClearly becoming the dust on the bright window.\n\nDo not rely on the lead-mercury of this world,\nThe golden elixir’s secret is unknown even to sages.\nDo not take the lead and mercury of common folk,\nMeasuring years to move the fire, clinging to one another.\n\nHeaven births two things from emptiness,\nNow wife, now child, now husband.\nThe gate of three and five is the sun and moon,\nAble to distinguish east and west, beginning and end.\n\nNurture the natural endowment of the utmost spirit,\nThe qi of harmony congeals to form the body.\nWealth and nobility come only from embracing the Five Colors,\nKnowing that lead and mercury together form kinship.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not shun each other,\nGathering primordial harmony within the cosmos.\nFor ten months, nurture the mother and child apart—\nThe wise never again circulate qi.\n\nThe mystery of dark and yellow is hard to discern,\nThe gate of lead and mercury is difficult to reveal.\nIf people do not grasp its source,\nExamine the Five Phases closely to hear and see.\n\nThe infant’s obscurity is beyond comprehension,\nIn vain they labor their spirit, suffering needlessly.\nSimply understand the sages’ words,\nAnd you will clearly see the path to heaven.\n\nThree and four dwell together in one chamber,\nOne and two are husband and wife in a pair.\nThey must rely on a good matchmaker to unite,\nThen their friendship deepens in affection.\n\nFloating and sinking, indistinct, hard to distinguish,\nThose who awaken from the lost path spend years in vain.\nTo know when the numinous medicine will form,\nThe yang number must ultimately return to nine cycles.\n\nYin and yang’s obscurity is unknowable,\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger contend with each other.\nBy year’s end, they transform and devour one another,\nThe White Tiger restrains the Dragon, the Dragon gradually wanes.\n\nHeaven is the father, Earth the mother,\nThe Vermilion Bird in the south, the Dark Warrior in the north.\nAs years pass, all become earth—\nWhere then can people seek Dragon and Tiger?\n\nThree unite in principle as one clan,\nConstantly moving the sun and moon to shine within.\nHaving met the Three Flowers and the golden jade liquid,\nNine cycles must conclude with ten months’ work.\n\nThe Green Dragon’s essence resides in the Eastern Palace,\nMatched with Heaven and Earth in the Zhen position.\nAfter the White Tiger appears from this,\nHow could the Flowing Pearl refuse to follow?\n\nDragon and Tiger refined, five cycles grow strong,\nIn the crucible, the fragrance of chrysanthemums gradually arises.\nNow is the proper time for cultivation—\nDo not let the years drift idly by.\n\nTo recognize cinnabar as the essence of wood,\nMove it to the west to join with metal.\nWhere can ordinary people trace its signs?\nIn the indistinct, the Five Mysteries are obscure.\n\nThose who awaken are like returning to their homeland,\nThose lost on the path find it no easier than seeking a road.\nThree operate together from one source—\nTheir original surname never left the ancestral clan.\n\nOne exists, one does not,\nMetal Lord as wife, wood as husband.\nThe profound and distant cannot be measured—\nHow could the steadfast ever force their way?\n\nStanding in the vastness of heaven, paired with earth’s yellow,\nMale essence harmonizes in the same chamber.\nThe white liquid transforms according to the furnace’s measure—\nThose who consume it find their hearts cool and bright.\n\nWho determines the origin of metal and wood’s mutual harm?\nThe Five Phases reverse and connect of themselves.\nIn the world, the Yellow Dragon, yin fire, and white mercury—\nWho can recognize the Yellow Sprout’s lead?\n\nWorldly lead and mercury do not depend on each other,\nThe steadfast know they lie in Kan and Li.\nThe wise conceal them where others cannot see,\nAs Huainan’s secret refinement lies in the Flower Pool.\n\nWhen the nine-cycle elixir nears completion as the year ends,\nOpen the crucible to see the medicine’s red blossoms.\nWater and fire transform, all becoming earth—\nWhere then can people seek the Golden Elder?\n\nThe transmission of lead and mercury is rare in the world,\nCinnabar as substance, snow as its robe.\nDimly it dwells in your own home—\nDay after day, you look yet do not know.\n\nThe returning elixir enters the mouth, the body grows light,\nAble to dispel long illness and banish demons.\nFrom this, greed and desire have nothing to cling to,\nTransforming even the foolish from worldly passions.\n\nWho awakens to the numinous elixir’s transcendence of the world?\nThe Three Flowers unite and befriend the Dragon.\nLook at those who refined elixirs before and after—\nHow many thousands, even tens of thousands, have perished?\n\n*Chant of Emerald Void at Luofu*\nIn the autumn of the eighth month, Jia Ding Ren Shen,\nThe Emerald Void Daoist was at Luofu.\nBefore my eyes, all things pass like water,\nWhere in heaven and earth is a single sandpiper?\n\nI will shed my form and return to the Jade Tower,\nThus I impart the fire-tending secrets of the golden elixir,\nSpeaking them to Bai Yuchan of Qiong Mountain,\nThat he may deeply know the bones of creation.\n\nDaoguang Chan Master Xue Zixian\nPassed to me the *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life*,\nPointing out the two words, lead and mercury—\nWhat is called the true mystery within the mystery.\n\nAll the toil comes down to ten months,\nGradually gathering, gradually congealing.\nNow the spirit is communicated through white blood,\nI already feel my four limbs free of cold and heat.\n\nLater, I still went forth to seek masters,\nExamining how many wild fox spirits I exposed—\nEach and every one not the true One,\nAll mere side doors, not the authentic Way.\n\nI fear you waste this youthful spring in vain,\nSo I recount it all from the beginning for you:\nUnless it be the secret of the golden liquor and returning elixir,\nThere is no need to squander your spirit in vain.\n\nLike the deluded who study \"bedchamber arts,\"\nTheir hearts ever clinging to lustful union,\nCalling it \"yin elixir\" or \"the method of controlling women,\"\nPressing fingers between the brows to swallow qi,\nSeizing others’ essence to replenish their own,\nClinging to the Three Peaks with perverse views—\nThe birth gate they call the \"source of life,\"\nNine shallow thrusts and one deep, repeated endlessly.\nXuanyuan, Pengzu, Lao Rongcheng,\nHuanggu, Shouguang, Zhao Feiyan—\nTheir households have other paths to the heavens,\nPracticed in wine shops and brothels.\nDo not say you meet immortals among the flowers,\nOnly to trade a golden hairpin for a clay tile.\nThe root is already rotten, leaves but green in vain,\nThe qi-sea churns, death comes swift as an arrow.\n\nOther side doors may still offer some ease and comfort:\nSome practice \"serving qi\" as the Central Yellow,\nSome \"guarding the crown\" as the Primordial Chaos,\nSome \"circulating qi\" as the Precelestial,\nSome \"swallowing saliva\" as the Numinous Spring.\nOr they fixate on a point beside the spleen,\nInsisting it is the root of breath;\nOr take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\nInhaling purity and exhaling turbidity as \"returning and restoring.\"\nOr silently supplicate the Highest Lord,\nEyes upturned to guard the Mud Pill.\nWith these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,\nCalling it the \"Spine’s Pass\";\nOr hold breath and swallow saliva,\nCalling it the \"Jade Liquor and Golden Liquor Elixir\";\nOr concentrate spirit below the navel,\nOr fix thoughts between the brows.\nSome circulate the mind along the spine,\nSome press the tongue to the palate,\nHunch shoulders, crane necks, arch backs—\nCalling it \"direct entry to the Royal Capital Mountain.\"\nMouth as the \"Flowery Pond,\" tongue as the dragon,\nCalling it \"numinous water flowing murmuringly.\"\nThese side-door methods of ease and comfort,\nHow can they hope to become celestial immortals?\n\nEighty swallows, nine held back, one swallowed,\nGathering qi to the navel as \"embryonic breathing,\"\nHands clutching prayer beads to count breaths,\nWater clocks and earthen gnomons to mark time.\nOr following the *Lingbao* secret methods,\nForcibly restraining the tailbone to swallow saliva;\nOr studying the *Xishan Huizhen Ji*,\nFacing the wall in silence all day.\nThough people now learn to sit in meditation,\nWhen has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade?\nThough they practice \"embracing the One,\"\nWhen have they ever been like jade hidden in stone?\n\nSome say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nDry wood, dead ash, solitary silence;\nSome claim it is already manifest and complete,\nYet ask them—where is the illusory body obtained?\nOthers exhaust their forms gathering sun and moon,\nCalling it \"heavenly hun and earthly po\";\nOthers ingest the Seven Luminaries through the night,\nCalling it the \"true bloodline of creation\";\nOthers \"fly golden essence from behind the elbow,\"\nQi steaming, water dripping;\nOthers \"contain the true qi of Taiyi,\"\nHearts darkly serene, worthy and still.\nSome circulate the flowing pearl in cycles,\nSome in stillness visualize red tangerines—\nSuch are all methods for nurturing life,\nYet none can transform insubstantial into numinous essence.\n\nThe Dao’s essentials nurture the child within the void,\nWithin it lies the true and certain mark.\nAll rely on the wondrous heavenly mechanism’s simplicity,\nScattered through alchemical texts yet never revealed.\nPitiful are the foolish who cling to delusion,\nPointing at one another, sketching emptiness upon emptiness.\nSuch bizarre and deranged lot,\nSitting and swaying, trembling for hours,\nBending, stretching, prostrating in countless postures,\nWeeping and wailing like children at play—\nAll because the square inch of their hearts has no master,\nQi scattered, spirit wild and flying.\nA throng of vain thoughts clamoring in chorus,\nDeceiving the common folk, beguiling the foolish.\nThey know not how to unite with the Dao’s truth,\nOnly to unite with demons in vain folly.\n\nOnce the heart stirs, qi follows,\nLeaping, trembling, activating the spirit’s mechanism.\nSome say this is \"yang qi arriving,\"\nSome say it is \"dragon and tiger battling,\"\nSome say the \"river chariot welcomes a thousand times,\"\nSome say \"water and fire rush in pursuit.\"\nWatch as they sway the qi of the five viscera,\nOne day the brain drains, the spirit withers.\nThe ancestral immortals left elixir secrets,\nGenerating something from nothing as the elixir’s foundation—\nWhen was there ever such ghostly and monstrous behavior?\nAll are the delusions of inferior scholars.\n\nI have heard the sages and masters of former ages:\nWithin non-action, nothing is not done,\nAll arises from formlessness to generate true form,\nNo need for visualization or forced cultivation.\nTherein lies the marvel, strange and wondrous—\nHeart and kidney were never Kan and Li,\nLiver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder,\nOnly old fences around empty houses.\nTears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, fluids,\nOnly aids to be used as stepping stones.\nSpirit, hun, po, heart, intent, qi—\nObserve them: they seem real, yet are not.\n\nWhy seek inner vision or mirror the form,\nOr listen for numinous echoes, gaze into limpid pools?\nSwallowing mist, drinking dew, ingesting primordial qi,\nTheir efforts prove futile, hearts and spirits weary.\nExpounding on emptiness, tinkering with furnace fires,\nDemanding written pledges, collecting gold and treasures.\nDaring to equate frogwort with the vast ocean,\nClaiming the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than themselves.\nFalsely assuming titles, feigning divine powers,\nPointing at ghosts and spirits to expound cause and effect.\nToday and tomorrow, they file petitions,\nInner elixir, outer elixir—nothing is beyond them.\nDeceiving the worthy, deluding the sages, obscuring the Three Luminaries,\nThey claim to see fortune and misfortune as clearly as a loom’s shuttle,\nSummoning disciples to wander the market’s dust,\nDrunk on wine, sated with virtue, forming gangs.\n\nThe Great Dao has always transcended names and forms,\nTrue immortals are never adorned with flowers and grasses.\nThey teach others to take vows and labor diligently—\nHow is that better than your own diligent practice?\nIf one person is deluded, it may still be endured,\nBut delusion passed to delusion leads to old age in confusion.\nThese blind leading the blind,\nTogether they enter the maze—truly lamentable.\nWhen fortune is exhausted and retribution arrives,\nOffending heaven, there is no place for prayer.\nThe Three Origins and Nine Palaces record their transgressions,\nTheir hun and po seized, they endure the underworld’s trials.\n\nThe world delights in learning immortality,\nYet how many daily seek the profound mystery?\nEach boasts of their own absurdities, competing in loftiness,\nNeglecting the true and real as the ultimate truth.\n\nThe ancients’ wise words must be firmly remembered:\nWith skill refined and effort pure, speech communes with immortals.\nWords that fail to connect reveal no true kinship,\nAnd without sufficient work, nothing attains perfection.\n\nIn my own practice, after one year’s cultivation,\nThe six pulses stilled, and qi returned to its root.\nA spiritual infant then dwelt in the cinnabar field,\nIts form and visage mirroring my own.\n\nYet reflecting on those who study the Dao in this dusty world,\nAfter three or nine years, they merely drift in vain.\nStill wandering as cloud and water across the four seas,\nCold-eyed, I see who among them is truly worthy of transmission.\n\nSeeking the Dao through incense at the stove, they remain in the lower ranks;\nExamining right and wrong, one discerns the foolish from the wise.\nReturning, I compose this *Song of Emerald Void*,\nRadiant as the sun shining in the azure sky.\nIt sweeps away the petty arts of lesser learning,\nDistinguishing the firing times and refining the elixir’s ingredients.\nI take only the gold within water,\nGathering emptiness to forge the crucible of creation.\nUrging the hundred pulses to return to their source,\nWhen pulse and conception vessels halt, the elixir begins to coalesce.\n\nAt first, a withered tree clings to a cold cliff;\nTwo beasts meet like lightning in a flash.\nFrom the central, true position, the mysterious pearl is born.\nWaves calm, winds cease, clouds and rain disperse.\nIn half a moment, the elixir’s head appears—\nSoft as a cotton ball, hard as iron.\n\nAt this time, the crimson phoenix of the south bleeds;\nIts gathering requires precise timing.\nOnce obtained, all things become complete,\nReturning to life and rooting in the true cavity.\nWithin lies a true paradise,\nWhere landscapes gleam and the moon shines bright.\nDragon chants, tiger roars, lead and mercury unite;\nThe golden sprout and white snow are clearly seen.\nWhenever heaven and earth conjoin,\nSeize the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.\n\nAt *mao* and *you*, *jia* and *geng*, one must bathe;\nAt crescent, full, waning, and new moons, guard against danger.\nAdjust the weight daily and hourly,\nWithdrawing and adding as needed, all in tranquil harmony.\nWithin the twelve hours, only one moment matters—\nNine returns, seven reversions, these are the steps.\nThe work of warming and nurturing must be steadfast,\nThe *xun* wind ever blowing into the *kan* trigram.\nIn walking, sitting, sleeping, and eating, remain thus,\nLest the fire cool and the elixir’s power lag.\nAfter a year, the celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;\nNine revolutions of effort consume nine months.\nBy the tenth month, jade frost descends,\nThe sacred embryo perfects, and wind and thunder roar.\n\nA year’s gestation births one child,\nWho begets grandchildren, branching endlessly.\nIn this most wondrous transformation of thousands and millions,\nHow could it be lightly taught to others?\n\nForget form, still the heart, sever all \"you\" and \"I\";\nIn life and death, movement and stillness, distinguish host from guest.\nMorning and evening, the elixir’s ingredients rise and sink;\nWater and fire, hexagrams and talismans must be carefully managed.\nTrue qi steams without cold or heat,\nPure yang flows without birth or death.\n\nThere is a path where mother and child part ways—\nIts wonder lies in the Dipper’s tail and the Oxherd and Weaver maidens.\nIf you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,\nCut off lust and abandon the side gates.\nTo permanently preserve this flowing form in the world,\nYou must circulate the fire and refine the spirit elixir.\n\nThe spirit elixir’s work takes three hundred days;\nSeven dissolutions, seven moltings complete the great return.\nGathered, it forms a body; scattered, it becomes qi—\nThe same in heaven as it is among men.\n\nBetter to seek a master’s peaceful method\nThan to perversely plunder essence and blood.\nAs the ancients said, \"All under heaven returns to this\"—\nYou must learn the non-action of the pure and still.\n\nBind the ten thousand acres of clouds to the green mountain,\nScoop the full moon from the azure pool.\nThe mysterious pass—a single aperture—none know it,\nYet this is the most wondrous *daogui* knife.\n\nOne night, I encountered Master Lü the Scholar,\nWho possessed an elixir formula even more marvelous:\nHe took the great void as his crucible,\nSeized the sun and moon as his ingredients.\nMountains, rivers, and the vast earth ignited with fierce fire,\nWithin which the ten thousand images birthed clouds and thunder.\nThe primordial chaos of old became the myriad things,\nAll conjoining in an instant to form the sacred embryo.\nNo gold or wood intervened,\nNo dragon or tiger divided south and north.\nNo inquiry into mother or child, female or male,\nNo distinction between husband and wife, black or white.\nWhat man calls the Great Return Elixir?\nEven the Supreme Lord Lao could not swallow it.\n\nThe Old Lord left it for the carefree wanderer,\nWho, upon consuming it, ascends as an immortal to the Great Ultimate.\nWith a cup of primordial wine,\nFeeding on this *daogui* to strengthen the countenance—\nThough the seas may turn to mulberry fields,\nIn my Dao, a year in the pot has not yet passed.\n\nI know your heart is firm as iron,\nThus I transmit these words secretly, mouth to mouth.\nIn the wondrous place, not half a phrase exists—\nThe immortal’s method is truly natural.\n\nHasten to begin, knit the embryo immortal,\nAnd chant brightly as you return to Penglai’s heaven.\n\n**On the Foundation of the Elixir Returning to the One**\n\nThe ancients said: \"Attain the One, and all things are complete.\"\nAh!\nHow true!\n\nThis saying—\nit is why I carve away the overgrowth of alchemical scriptures,\nwhy I mark the pivotal essentials of the Purple Writ.\nFor this is the truth:\nThe One is the foundation of the Golden Elixir,\nthe origin of a thousand classics and ten thousand treatises,\nthe ancestor of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes.\n\nTo speak concisely:\nHeavenly soul and earthly spirit are but the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon;\ncinnabar lead and black mercury are but the essence of metal and the fluid of wood.\nThe crow and hare are the tortoise and serpent;\nthe horse and ox are the dragon and tiger.\nCinnabar and quicksilver form the bones of the yellow sprout and white snow;\ncinnabar and autumn stone arise from white gold and black tin.\n\nDistinguished as male and female, husband and wife,\nembodied as metal, wood, water, and fire,\ncategorized as the azure, the dark, the slow, and the swift,\nsymbolized as Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—\nwhether called the River Chariot,\nor the Yellow Ascension,\nor spoken of as the fire-jujube and the exchange-pear,\nor as golden sand and jade mercury—\nor by names like Elder Ding and Yellow Matron,\nor titles such as Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—\ndissected into black and white,\ndivided into azure and yellow,\nall this profusion,\nin truth, is but the two words: yin and yang.\nAll are one thing.\n\nConsider the Guarding-the-One Altar,\nthe Wu-Ji Gate,\nthe Mysterious Pass’s single aperture,\nthe Gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthe Divine Water and Flower Pool,\nthe lead furnace and earthen crucible,\nthe cinnabar tripod,\nthe recumbent moon furnace,\nthe Central Yellow Palace,\nthe Elixir Origin Mansion,\nthe Spirit Chamber and Qi Mansion,\nthe Pass Origin and Elixir Field,\nthe root of breath,\nthe site of coagulation—\nthese, too, are all one place.\n\nAgain, like the winter and summer solstices,\nthe spring and autumn equinoxes,\nthe Mao and You, Jia and Geng,\nthe crescent and full, the dark and new moons,\nthe Zi and Wu, Si and Hai, Yin and Shen,\nthe twenty-four qi,\nthe seventy-two seasonal markers,\nthe year’s conjunctions,\nthe month’s revolutions,\nthe Kan and Li moments,\nthe months of the hare and rooster,\nthe Qian and Xun caverns,\nthe gates of two and eight,\nthe morning *Tun* and evening *Meng*,\nthe day *Gou* and night *Fu*—\npeople, not knowing, believe one must strictly adhere to times and seasons,\ncalculate qi and measure markers,\ndissect methods by the number,\nweigh by the scruple and hexagram.\nThus they say: \"Gaze at the earth-gnomon, watch the night’s water-clock\"—\nhow grievously mistaken!\n\nDo they not know that the year’s creation is but the essence and qi of the body’s cycle,\nthat day and night, hours and moments, are but the transformations of essence and qi?\nWithin them lie decline and flourishing,\nrising and falling,\nfloating and sinking,\nclarity and turbidity.\nThus the sages used external symbols to verify them,\nunaware that the qi and numbers of heaven and earth lie in a single moment’s work.\n\nWithin this are the signs of yin and yang, cold and heat,\nthe states of generation and destruction, fullness and deficiency.\nIn the small, it follows the hundred divisions of the day;\nin the large, it mirrors a year—\nyet all occurs in a single moment.\nThat moment is one place;\none place is one thing.\n\nIf one knows that this is the One,\nthen gathering follows method,\ncirculation has measure,\nweights and measures have standards,\nwater and fire have degrees,\nand the wonders of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat,\nthe mysteries of bathing and conjoining—\nnone lack caution against danger, vigilance against peril.\nFor the slightest error,\nand the sun and moon lose their way,\ngold and mercury part crucibles.\nNone but those deeply versed in creation’s workings\ncan fathom the meaning of yin and yang as profoundly secret as this.\n\n\"The Way is called the alternation of one yin and one yang\"—\nthe Way is the Golden Elixir,\nthe Golden Elixir is this.\n\nThe ancient immortals and transcendent spirits,\nthe refined ones who refined the Seven Returns and Nine Cycles,\nthe Great Elixir of Golden Liquid—\nthese were but shortcuts to entering the Dao.\nThus there are sayings of a moment’s work naturally conjoining,\nthe return of wind blending all,\nthe hundred days’ achievement of efficacy.\nPracticed for nine months, it is called the Nine Revolutions;\nrefined for a year, it is called the Sacred Embryo.\n\nThis is why it remains hidden, not revealed—\nheaven’s secrets are cherished,\nand this Dao is not lightly disclosed.\nHow could there be no fortune or misfortune in transmitting it to the worthy or unworthy?\n\nEven saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, and blood are yin substances,\nwhile Mud Pill Palace, Elixir Field, heart, kidneys, spleen, lungs,\ntailgate, spine, mouth, and nose—\nthese are not truly one place.\nHow then can one know the separation of metal and wood,\nthe incompletion of water and fire?\n\nIf one can use the One to rectify the multitude of classics,\nto examine the words of past sages,\nnot taking spirit and qi as naturally returning,\nnot taking meditation as naturally conjoining—\nif one can discern thus,\nperhaps one may unknowingly align with Sun and Hao,\nyet still not hasten the hundred meridians to return to the source,\nexhaust the nine passes to their depths,\nwhere the three fires gather,\nthe eight waters converge.\n\nAs for spirit entering qi to form the fetal fire,\nrefining the medicine into the elixir—\nhow can this be easily understood?\nSome say \"spirit guards qi,\"\nsome say \"when spirit congeals, qi gathers,\"\nsome say \"spirit and qi naturally return\"—\nwhite-haired, they remain bewildered,\nsighing in vain at emptiness.\nHow could they know the true wonder of the Elixir Foundation’s One?\n\nThose who wander in floating spirits,\nwho bow to Hua Quan in the misty obscurity above—\nattaining the One can complete the ten thousand.\nThus I write *On the Foundation of the Elixir Returning to the One*\nand entrust it to the scholars, to White Jade Toad.\n\nThe teachings of Chen Niyuan of Yingchuan,\nthe Supreme Unity’s Knife and Round,\nare transmitted to later ages.\n\n---\n\n**Water Melody Song**\n*For Jiu Xiazi, Ju Jiushi*\n\nSeize the wondrous celestial mechanism,\nat midnight watch the stars blaze.\nA droplet of pearly dew—\nwho guides it to the rice flower’s head?\nGather it now, in this moment,\nlike a green lotus closing its petals to concoct the medicine,\npiercing the autumn of the Jade Pool.\nAs the ten thousand sounds stir the first wind,\na lone gull glides beneath the bright moon.\n\nThe Purple River Chariot,\nriding the crimson phoenix,\nenters the jade tower.\nThis is called jade mercury,\nwhich, with lead and earth, perfectly aligns.\nThe five qi and three flowers gather at the crown,\nstoked by the true fire of nature,\nrefined until it resembles the pomegranate’s red.\nAfter ten months, the fetal immortal emerges,\nborne away by thunder and lightning.\n\n---\n\n**Magpie Bridge Immortal**\n*For Dianxuzi, Sha Daozhao*\n\nThe red lotus holds the medicine,\ndew pearls congeal in azure,\nfalling drop by drop into the Flower Pool.\n\n**Returning to the Golden Crucible, Calling Ding Gong,**\nRefined until it resembles a single crimson tangerine.\nThe Three Flowers spew flame,\nthe Five Clouds embrace the moon,\nabove lies the golden womb’s divine chamber.\nThe bridal chamber’s clouds and rain stir with spring’s breeze—\nafter ten months, the fetal immortal is complete.\n\n**True Pearl Curtain**\n*For Hainanzi, Bai Yuchan*\n\nThe great elixir of golden cinnabar is within every person,\nbut it must be transmitted heart-to-mind, mouth-to-ear.\nA slice of the White Dragon’s liver,\na cup of *tihu* wine—\nseek only in the high where none exists, in the low where all abides,\nshifting the Southern Aster to turn the Northern Dipper.\nHow laughable—\nthe Golden Elder and the Mystic Maiden,\nthe two locked in struggle.\nA touch of lead and mercury blended just so,\nobserve the Han’s moon and the sea’s tide,\ndrawing and adding the fire’s measure.\nAn arrow piercing the Three Passes—\nonly then does the immortal’s hand reveal itself.\nThe hare arrives where the crow dwells,\nthe tortoise brother swallows the serpent whole.\nDo you know?\nThose two, Zhong and Lü,\nare my teachers and friends.\n\n**Verses on the Golden Elixir**\n\nHalf a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead,\nhidden in the numinous source before the Supreme Ultimate.\nSeize the hour of *zi* to gather it,\nrefine it into golden liquid to enter the cinnabar field.\nDivine talismans, white snow congealing into the mysterious pearl—\nthis is the golden elixir’s first furnace.\nThrough the twelve hours, recognize *zi* as the key,\nlest the golden crucible’s mercury flowers wither.\n\nWater and fire intertwine, tiger meets dragon,\nthe Golden Elder and the Mystic Maiden vie for mastery.\nGreen departs, white arrives, then turns to black—\nonly at red does it enter the Yellow Palace.\nThe jade crucible’s third revolution reveals the yellow sprout,\nwithin fire, the red lotus unfurls its petals.\nThe adept lingers in the Crimson Palace, craving the night’s moon—\na cup of fine wine to nourish the cinnabar.\n\nThe fourth revolution of the red furnace turns the Four Spirits,\nadding talismans, stoking the fire to nurture the fetal essence.\nDragon and tiger coil around the crucible, contending for creation,\nthe *xun* wind stirs the lamp upon the water.\nThe fifth revolution yields the White Horse’s sprout,\nthen the Six Bandits drive the River Chariot.\nThe Five Phases complete, thunder’s roar resounds—\nnow is the time to ascend the tower and gaze upon the mercury flowers.\n\nRefined into jade liquid, the divine cinnabar elixir,\nseizing and subduing the tortoise and serpent in an instant.\nHere lies the moment of completion’s subtle work—\ntend the jade crucible’s fire, let it not grow cold.\n\nHeaven’s seven stars, earth’s seven treasures,\nman’s seven apertures governed by the brain.\nThe sevenfold-returned numinous cinnabar consumes yin’s breath—\nin the lead furnace, use only the gentlest fire.\n\nThe eighth revolution: divine brocade, Jade Clarity’s sand,\n*mao* and *you* draw and add fire without error.\nThirst quenched by the Flower Pool, hunger sated by qi,\nthe Yellow Matron watches the golden flowers all day.\nThe ninth revolution: purple gold becomes the supreme treasure,\nthe Gate of Heaven and Door of Earth seal themselves.\nThree hundred eighty-four *zhu*,\nscattered into thirty-six thousand grains.\n\nThe Azure Youth holds the mirror to the Muddy Pellet,\nauspicious clouds from the five viscera pierce the upper pass.\n*Zi*, *wu*, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*—\nwhen the fetal orb’s count is full, it emerges from Kunlun.\n\nShift the Northern Dipper toward the Southern Aster,\npierce the Yellow Court to enter the Purple Court.\nA year of drilling and clustering brings true creation—\nthe Great Yang shines directly at the moon’s third watch.\n\nAbove, it aligns with the stars; below, with lead.\nThe Great Yang paces thirty-six exchanges.\nWithout the dharma’s image, how could it be gathered?\nWho speaks of birth before heaven and earth?\n\nYellow cinnabar, ceruse, litharge—\nthese are Jiazhou’s powers of creation.\nIf you have not witnessed the true Yang’s singular method,\nhow many in the world have ever known it?\n\nThe essence of red lead is called true mercury,\nthe essence of black mercury is true lead.\nSeek not creation in the kidneys—\nlook instead within the heart for the primordial.\n\nNuminous mercury is not mere quicksilver,\ncinnabar’s lack of redness deludes most.\nWho can recognize such true substances?\nThose who do mount simurghs to shed the world’s dust.\n\nThree true forms, one rare,\ncongealing into numinous marvels few understand.\nDo not say dragon and tiger share a single source—\nthis is the immortal’s foundation laid.\n\nThe Star of Stability paired with the center,\nreclining water’s union changes its hue to yellow.\nUnlike common gold, silver, or iron,\nits completion relies wholly on yin and yang.\n\nAvoid graves, defiled fields,\nand battle-scarred lands where men sleep.\nWhen *kun*’s numinous qi takes form as fortune,\nit becomes the seeker’s minor grotto-heaven.\n\nMountain forests’ quietude is most fitting,\nwhether in the world’s dust or the countryside.\nWhen earth’s virtue is thick, the elixir grows thick—\nreckless acts swiftly bring misfortune.\n\nThe chamber should face wood, toward the rising sun,\n*dui*’s bright window facing the evening light.\nGuard it well—let no one know its name,\nand at dusk’s yin, do not seal the golden walls.\n\nThe Eight Gates’ transformations open in due time,\nadvancing and retreating with the metal’s decree.\nDo not neglect the bright furnace or the hundred doors—\ncalmly, the two crucibles occupy the Three Terraces.\n\nThe six hundred verses rise and fall with clarity,\nthe Three Luminaries must follow the sun’s emptiness and fullness.\nShift the Eight Trigrams to clarify weight and measure,\nalign with the clepsydra’s flow—do not halt the process.\n\nWhen yin’s fire ceases, yang’s fire dissolves,\nprinciples divide externally, following Fu Xi’s lines.\nFollow further the black and white of heaven’s edge-moon—\nonly after the six periods does the new moon meet the dark.\n\nThe four seasons’ revolutions follow the star-ladle,\nday and night evenly divided into a hundred marks.\nReverently, the Primordial Sovereign reaffirms the pattern—\nscrutinize the times, for they are clearly marked.\n\nHeaven’s twelve hours are distinct,\nyet mortals divide them into the elixir’s regimen.\nIf you claim the clepsydra lacks proof,\nyou will not grasp the mystery, and the medicine will not form.\n\nThe heart-earth empty and idle, severed from ten thousand threads,\nbest to return to stillness and observe the self.\nTo know the iron-spined man—\nwhat worry is there in beginning the elixir’s work?\n\nThose who speak do not know; those who know do not speak.\nLofty discourse and grand theories abound,\nyet though none may argue now,\nyou may deceive yourself for a lifetime.\n\nOne who attains the Dao becomes like an infant,\nunmoved by idle words, right or wrong.\nIf you cannot see with the heart’s eye,\nwho will you ask in regret later?\n\nThe obstinate cannot grasp the truth,\nmorning’s practice abandoned by dusk—this is not sincerity.\nOnly with a sincere heart and diligent refinement will results appear—\nthen you are among those who truly know.\n\nFather’s essence, mother’s blood congeal to form the fetus,\nyet its shape still resembles another’s.\nRecognize the true father and mother within the body—\nonly then can you seize the Five Phases’ essence.\n\nAt the hour of *zi*, qi faces the *weilü* pass,\nthe spinal River Chariot pierces the crown’s gate.\nA crystal pearl enters the crucible—\nthe Red Dragon holds mercury, ascending to the Muddy Pellet.\n\nQi enters the cinnabar field to nourish the white crow—\nonly then does the day yield the yellow sprout.\nThe Flower Pool’s divine water cradles the bright moon,\nand the *daogui* obtained is as small as a sesame seed.\n\nKnow that medicine, refined by fire, becomes the elixir,\nand the elixir, meeting fire, becomes immortal.\nA moment’s effort yields immediate results,\nyet mastery demands three years of ripening.\n\nThe Great Dao lies plain before your eyes,\nyet people fail to grasp it and waste their return to the spring.\nThe yellow sprout is none other than the qi of heaven and earth,\nwhile the divine water’s root is linked to mercury.\n\nOnce you recognize the source, there is no need to rush—\nthree threes unite as nine, forming pure yang.\nHidden transformations manifest as divine radiance,\nand from here, you ascend near the Jade Emperor.\n\nUnite heaven and earth, merge their primal essence,\nmother and child meet in silent reverence.\nFirst mercury, then lead—this is the Great Dao;\ndo not let the companionless crane return to heaven.\n\nThis treasure has long been passed down through the two eights,\nin an auspicious year and month, it is placed in the furnace.\nTen days of fire-tending, knowing the seasons,\nsurely the sprout matures and mercury is perfected.\n\nSilent intent, wordless principle—this is the truest path,\nnothing else binds or relates.\nTurn your gaze inward with but a trace of effort,\nand once clarity dawns, all affairs grow still.\n\nRed lead and black mercury form the foundation of the great elixir,\ntheir union is rarely known in the world.\nWhen these two become *wu* and *ji*,\nthe immortals call it a single *daogui*.\n\nThe sun’s crow and moon’s hare, two wheels full,\ntheir root lies in precelestial essence—hard to grasp.\nOn a moonlit night, if you can gather them,\nheaven’s soul and earth’s spirit congeal into the numinous elixir.\n\nDo not dismiss the golden elixir as trivial—\nyou must labor diligently and delve deeply.\nSeek guidance from teachers and mentors,\nfor it lies not elsewhere, but right before you.\n\nBefore refining the returning elixir, first cultivate lead;\nthe tortoise and snake, one qi, give birth to the precelestial.\nEmpty the heart, fill the belly—only then can harmony arise,\nforging the numinous cinnabar into a single, perfect sphere.\n\nWalking together, sitting together, sleeping side by side,\nthey follow you all day, ever present.\nRecognize these swiftly and gather them in haste—\nto see them is to find the lead of the watery realm.\n\nNot lamp-light, sun, moon, nor stars,\nthe medicine’s spirit shines with extraordinary brightness.\nWith eyes half-closed, gaze long into the luminous place—\na resplendent pearl reveals its true nature.\n\nTo spend the day in seeming foolishness—what is there to gain or lose?\nStealthily apply effort amid idleness.\nAt first, jade liquid flies like drifting snow,\ngradually, flowing gold fills the old hut.\n\nNuminous mercury, attuned to the true, transforms endlessly—\nit is best to preserve and guard, not to overstep.\nThe divine talisman silently courses through the three passes,\nwhile lead follows the Yellow River into the Great Luo.\n\nThe *jia*-dragon and *geng*-tiger stand guard together,\nonly when lead and mercury share the furnace can work begin.\nRecall the union of earth and heaven in harmonious balance—\nnaturally, *kan* and *li* unite in marriage.\n\nThe fire-tending of the celestial cycle spans the hidden and manifest,\nits movements of withdrawal and addition occur in due time.\nWhy divide the qi-seasons into eight nodes?\nBeware even a moment’s lapse or a hair’s breadth of error.\n\nThe Five Phases, Four Images, *kan* and *li*—\nthe poetic verses clearly explain them to you.\nYet where the work truly begins,\nhow many comprehend? How many know?\n\nIf you have not yet met a teacher, study these verses,\nfor within them lies the secret to cultivation.\nThough you may not reach Penglai’s path,\nyou will at least gain leisure in life and delay death.\n\nBy day, circulate the numinous banner; by night, tend the fiery mushroom.\nWithdraw and add with care, ever vigilant against danger.\nWithout like-minded companions to share and appreciate,\nhow can you gauge the furnace’s fire-tending?\n\nThe *zhen* trigram returns to the *dui* region in the west,\nthe three yangs and the maiden play with the bright cauldron.\nThe *xun* wind stirs the coral tree,\nentering *gen* and returning to *kun*—another cycle begins.\n\nClench your fists, close your eyes, guard the flowing pearl—\nthis is the true path of entry.\nAs the *Wuzhen Pian* states:\nwhen true gold builds the house, how can it ever wither?\n\nWho knows the mechanism of short before and long after?\nWithin the twelve hours, only one moment matters.\nWaxing and waning, full and new—advance and retreat,\nrefining through nine cycles to gestate the infant.\n\nOn Kunlun’s peak, fire stars fly,\nwhen metal and wood meet at the *kan*-thunder hour.\nWhen the medicine reaches the full moon, the scale must be full—\nhurry to add fire, lest you miss the moment.\n\nThe great medicine relies on spirit, qi, and essence;\ngathered in one place, they unite and form.\nThe elixir’s head is but precelestial qi,\nrefined into the yellow sprout, blooming as jade blossoms.\n\nThe truth lies plain in a single word,\nyet in old age, the paths diverge in ease and difficulty.\nFirst, awaken to the *daogui* in an instant,\nthen gradually refine the nine cycles of the great returning elixir.\n\nSeize the two and place them in one furnace,\na pool of true water congeals into true butter.\nSwallow the *daogui*’s savor, let it return to your belly,\nnourishing the yellow sprout to yield the jade talisman.\n\nDraw back the hundred vessels, return them to the source—\nnaturally, mercury will meet lead.\nThe mountains and rivers of the great earth are all treasures,\nyet who knows to seek the precelestial within the body?\n\nWithin the palace, beneath the eyes, fire stars fly,\nthunder and lightning churn, white snow hangs suspended.\nWithin the body, the sound of dripping is heard—\nthe three corpses’ essence and blood can sate hunger.\n\nSeek the Five Phases and Four Images outside,\nyet they reside within a single inch of your heart.\nMaster the interplay of yin and yang to perfect the wondrous Dao,\nand even tiles and pebbles will turn to gold.\n\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, refine *kan* and *li*—\nin a moment, a single *daogui* forms.\nA message to the patriarch Zhang Ping Shu:\nthe ten thousand sages and thousand worthies all reside in the west.\n\nWhen drunk and deeply asleep in dream,\na boat laden with treasure crosses Cao Creek.\nOnce you discern the foundation of the elixir,\nits release and gathering lie entirely in your hands.\n\nOn the southwestern road, the moon’s radiance shines bright—\nthe great medicine arises from this place.\nRecall an ancient verse:\nabove the winding river, the magpie bridge spans.\n\nA month’s thirty days, a single day—\nthe method of elixir-refining rivals heaven’s work.\nThe union of two eights becomes the mother of the elixir,\nwhile seeking dragons and tigers afar is but vain labor.\n\nWhite and black thread the *weilü* to the cinnabar field,\na single true pearl, soft as silk.\nCold light fills the earth, birthing jade’s laughter,\nwhile the two pools’ autumn waters ripple with red lotuses.\n\nThe crucible’s fire-tending is meticulously arranged,\nrefining until pure yang qi ascends.\nWhen the earthly gate closes, the bones and body solidify;\ngradually, the heavenly gate opens of its own accord.\n\nWater is the numinous talisman, the harmonious fluid,\nfire is the elixir’s pivot, the primordial essence.\nWhen they meet in the palace’s congealing point,\nthe medicine naturally forms, and new life blooms.\n\nA man’s pregnancy births the fetal immortal—\nall because the toad’s light waxes full each night.\nSeizing heaven’s mechanism, the true transformation,\nwithin the body, the Jade Pure Heaven resides.\n\nWithin the crucible, vermilion tangerines glow crimson across the sky—\nthis is the ceaseless work of nurturing the fire.\nPrimal qi returns to the furnace, the spirit unscattered,\nas spring mountains, spring waters, and spring winds arise of themselves.\n\nFirst dry the golden crucible to quicken living mercury,\nwhen the mercury is dried, the great elixir is complete.\nClearly there grows an herb of immortality,\ntransmuting iron to gold without deceiving man.\n\nTears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood—\ntrue and false intermingle, requiring discernment.\nFrom nothing comes something: these are the medicinal materials,\nnot to be confused with illusory, hollow things.\n\nScriptural transformations occur in an instant,\nyet the deluded seek them in distant days and months.\nSimply guard the fire-hexagram for three hundred moments,\nand a luminous pearl is born in the night.\n\nA celestial source flows straight from Kunlun,\nnowhere more hidden than the Nine-Bend Bay.\nA million jade dragons roar without cease,\nas a river of spring moonlight chases the fishing boats.\n\nWhen spirit and essence merge in the return to darkness,\nbone and flesh fuse so subtly they go unnoticed.\nThe joints open and flow freely,\nthe countenance gleams, smooth as an infant’s.\n\nMeasurements must correspond to the two crescents,\nthis pattern of the law mirrors heaven’s abyss.\nTurn and ask the Yellow Dame for guidance—\nwhy wait for mere oral transmission?\n\nLead and mercury trace back to the roots of dragon and tiger,\nthe Mysterious Female’s gate is the door of wu and ji.\nOnly within the jade pot of spring’s hues\nmay one pluck a blossom to question Fu Xi and Xuan Yuan.\n\nNear, it takes three mornings; far, ninety days—\nknow that transformations have their appointed hours.\nWithout understanding the elixir of long life’s creation,\neven lazy mercury transmuting to gold stirs wonder.\n\nThe crucible holds no hidden medicine to seek,\nwhat is sought and what emerges are the same gold.\nCast it large or small at will—\nsuch is the profound principle of the ice-pure vessel.\n\nEntering the crucible requires a weight of one jin,\nyet when weighed, it becomes sixteen stars.\nEach star holds true gold’s wonder within water,\ncombining to form flowing pearls in perfect balance.\n\nThe Kan Palace’s even pond, the stone-foot spring,\nstars face one another, shooting toward the high heavens.\nThe murmuring yang pulse courses through green and white,\nbathing the golden body to make it firm.\n\nAll say the Perfected One remains utterly silent—\nhow could he ever reveal it through words?\nIf not for arrogance, matters would require no speech,\nit is only that the chest lacks mercury and lead.\n\nWhen heaven and earth first parted, sun and moon rose high,\nshaped like an egg, then like a peach.\nYin and yang’s true qi knows its seasons,\nwaiting three years to shed the armor of strife.\n\nThe dragon-tiger cinnabar’s meaning is most profound,\nwithin the five-spirit gold, mercury and lead flow.\nAfter a thousand mornings, it turns purple and soars into the clouds,\nascending straight to the Great Canopy Heaven.\n\nTo use lead, one must blend it with mercury,\nthe two families become kin as the woman sings.\nWhen refined to the point the Purple River Chariot stirs the earth,\nwhite clouds accompany the passing crane.\n\nRed and black unite as wife weds husband,\nonce a year entering the elixir’s pivot.\nIn the bridal chamber’s depths, true cloud and rain—\na child is born, just like them.\n\nThe Kan man and Qian woman dwell in heaven’s domain,\nbuying medicine and firing the elixir costs no coin.\nWithin the crescent moon furnace, the work of creation is brewed—\na bit of wondrous medicine requires true lead.\n\nWhat strange thing provokes laughter time and again?\nNow even men can conceive.\nTheir own essence and blood intermingle,\nwithin the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed.\n\nThree families contain the union of two things,\nthe red dragon flies up to the azure clouds.\nAt night, sweet dew passes through the empty sky,\na sliver of moon hangs above the Magpie Bridge.\n\nReturning to the union, cultivate the water-fire school,\nthe rabbit and crow bathe in the inner elixir’s red glow.\nAfter sixty-six circuits of the celestial orbit and the cold furnace,\nthe ten-month fetus matures, revealing sacred power.\n\nWater and fire share essence between wood and metal,\nbut where does one seek fire and wood?\nShedding yellow to don purple—why?\nOnly because the River Chariot’s revolutions run deep.\n\nThe jade talisman and golden liquid refine the celestial immortal,\nmoonlight illuminates Kunlun’s lotus pool.\nPointing to the northern Dark Warrior’s affair—\nwhy do tortoise and snake entwine?\n\nRain washes the new bamboo as twin phoenixes take flight,\nbeneath the jade mushroom, a sacred tortoise.\nHolding the zither, it plays the dance of immortal melodies,\nthen releases Chang’e to feast by the small pool.\n\nGolden light suffuses the body, the marrow fragrant,\ngolden sinews and jade bones are wholly yang.\nRefined until red and white flow as white,\nyin qi dissolves, and the body is naturally sound.\n\nOnce the work is done with utmost sincerity,\nconcentrate the spirit, gather the qi, and secure true essence.\nThe complexion becomes jade-like, hunger and thirst vanish—\nonly then does the golden elixir’s momentary formation appear.\n\nThe Green Maiden stands alone in the crystal palace,\nher graceful form brimming with intent.\nAt midnight, the Yellow Dame comes knocking at the door,\nto act as matchmaker, marrying her to the Golden Elder.\n\nThe Great One’s mysterious pearl, the golden liquid elixir,\nreturns to the origin, restores the root, and preserves youthful countenance.\nOne must personally heed the enlightened master’s words,\nonly then may you be shown the way.\n\nAt night, a single emerald lotus leaf appears,\nwithin it, red pellets drip like pearls.\nDripping into the Flowery Pond, it becomes spirit water,\ncongealing in the cinnabar field to form the elixir’s pivot.\n\nHigh and Kan are called the essences of water and fire,\noriginally formed from Qian and Kun’s two trigrams.\nSimply take Kan’s essence to infuse the high cavity—\npure Qian can then grasp the flying jasper.\n\n*Green Void Chapters Complete* #1\n(Three characters missing here in the original.)\n\nPer *The Complete Daoist Canon: Collected Mysteries of

      "translated_text": "**The Emerald Void Scroll**\n\n**Title:** *The Emerald Void Scroll* (*Cuìxū Piān*). One fascicle. Composed by Chen Nan of the Southern Song. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Great Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Emerald Void Scroll***\n\nI once read the poem Zhang Ziyang presented to the Master of White Deer Grotto, which said:\n*\"I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*\n*Why not refine the mind and smelt mercury and lead?*\n*Let not the lamp be snuffed out by the wind,*\n*For the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame Heaven.\"*\n\nUpon reading this, I closed the scroll and struck my breast, sighing deeply: Ziyang’s words were meant for those who already knew the medicine—how much more so for those still benighted! Thus, day and night, I took the wind and lamp as my warning. For ten years, I pored over books of golden hoops and thorny trials; for another ten, I practiced the arts of golden lead and wooden mercury—yet it all tasted like chewing wax. Though I sought a path beyond birth and death, I fumbled like a fly at a window, unaware that the world had already passed me by.\n\nOnly upon reverently perusing *The Emerald Void Scroll* and listening to the profound discourses of lofty recluses did I begin to understand: what is gathered is called the *medicine*; what is refined is called the *fire*; what congeals is called the *elixir*; what is nurtured is called the *embryo*—yet in truth, they are one. The place of its arising is called the *river source*; the vessels hidden in mountains and seas are called the *altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth*. The nature it receives is given names like *mercury, lead, water, and fire*; the forms it takes are called *cinnabar, dark pearl*, and other titles. Yet from today’s perspective, it is but a single thing.\n\nIndeed, the ancients dissected the true origin and distinguished the categories of *qi*, giving rise to teachings on gathering, uniting, forging, and bathing. Like the hexagrams of the *Yijing*, all emerge from *Qian*; like the stars and birds of the celestial sphere, all revolve around the Dipper. Through the subtleties of extraction and replenishment, discussions of weights and measures arise. But by observing the moon’s halos—black and white—and the tides of earth—ebbing and flowing—one may silently grasp the intent of seizing the hour within the day. With not even a hair’s breadth of error, why fear that the Golden Elder will not ride the dragon, or the Radiant Maiden will not mount the tiger?\n\nThe elixir’s head is knotted in an instant; the infant is born within ten months. Spirit congeals, *qi* gathers, and a body exists beyond the body. This is truly the swiftest path to immortal learning, the wondrous Way of transcending the world. Its essential, subtle, and concise words are all contained within *The Emerald Void Scroll*.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Wang Sicheng, the True Breath Master, who bows twice with reverence after burning incense.\n\n**The Emerald Void Scroll**\nComposed by Perfected Chen of the Muddy Pellet.",

      "translated_text": "**The Purple Court Scripture**\n\nThe Celestial Sovereign of the Crimson Palace governs the firmament of Qian,\nThe Qian Dragon soars to the Nine-Flowered Heaven.\nWithin Heaven lies the wondrous, boundless Palace of the Limitless,\nWhere myriad scrolls point to the arcane chapters—\nEach verse reveals the golden elixir’s intent,\nA thousand phrases, ten thousand words, distilled into one.\n\nTeach men only to seek mercury and lead,\nGather these two into the crucible and refine them.\nAt night, fire erupts from Kunlun Mountain,\nIts flames cooling as the moon’s light turns cold.\nAbove the Winding River, the Golden Crow takes flight,\nWhile Chang’e rejoices with the Dipper and Ox.\n\nRefine them without pause for even a moment,\nA single breath, vast and subtle, pierces the Three Passes.\nThe qi flows ceaselessly through the Three Passes,\nA white meridian ascending to the Muddy Pellet.\nAbove the Muddy Pellet rests the Purple Gold Crucible,\nWithin it, a lump of purple gold—\nTransformed into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth,\nFragrant, sweet, and refreshing upon the tongue’s tip.\nSwallowed and absorbed into the five viscera,\nThe organs rejoice, the body at peace and hale.\n\nWhen the Crimson Serpent and Azure Dragon unite,\nWind stills, waves calm, tiger and dragon coil.\nThe divine water brims, the Flowery Pond at rest,\nWhite snow swirls, flying across the four mountains.\nThe Seven-Treasure Pavilion stands through the twelve hours,\nBefore it, golden blossoms bloom in profound splendor.\n\nThis is the essence of lead and mercury,\nTransmuted into marrow, filling the gates’ source.\nSeek only the Celestial Cycle within the body,\nFrom the waxing crescent to the waning, and back again.\nThe medicine is balanced, the qi abundant,\nAs heaven and earth, sun and moon, converge in union.\n\nThe void shatters into a hundred fragments,\nChew the chaos soft as silk.\nTurned and folded, it becomes a single coin,\nThe body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.\nCrimson blood is exchanged for white blood,\nGolden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.\nA pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,\nA golden blossom blooms like a crimson lotus.\n\nNow the body’s spirit and qi are whole,\nNo need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.\nI now know your wisdom is thus,\nThat you are destined to become an immortal.\nClearly instructed without a second word,\nSilently refine and withdraw, then replenish.\n\nIn a year, harvest the moon without waiting a year,\nIn a month, seize the sun without waiting a month,\nIn a day, grasp the hour as hours yield to days,\nWithin the hour, find the moment—profound and arcane.\nArcane beyond arcane, inexpressible in words,\nYet it lies in the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.\nThe Golden Elder and Radiant Maiden wrest creation,\nGhosts and spirits weep in astonishment and clamor.\nClouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—\nA single grain of the mysterious pearl sown in the Jade Field.\nTen months of fire, the sacred embryo becomes an immortal,\nNine revolutions, nine new moons, cycling in endless return.\n\nAt first, the meridians of the spine’s pass open,\nNext, the bladder blazes like fire,\nWithin, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,\nStirring to surge toward the heart’s source.\nHeart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally unite,\nMetal and wood, though separated, follow their course.\nThe Yellow Court’s qi dwells in the Central Palace,\nThe palace governs all phenomena, the heart holds sway.\nThe water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—\nWho sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,\nThe crow’s soul and hare’s spirit crumble to dust.\n\nThus, in silence, seek the true root,\nA straight path leading to the numinous truth.\nClearly, essence is preserved by qi,\nGradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.\nThis spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,\nPure yang, undying—the true person.\nKnowing this, one should cultivate immortality,\nAnd the only gate to immortality is the golden elixir.\nThe golden elixir has no second secret—\nA single acre within the body is your homestead.\nSaliva, mucus, essence, fluids, blood, and humors—\nThese seven yin substances, how can they be rectified?\n\nWithin Kan, it is not the kidneys but the numinous root,\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red as the Northern Horse gallops.\nSeven returns, nine reversions—all in a moment,\nAll things in creation are thus born.\nOnly this true operation of Qian and Kun,\nNo need for empty striving or silent words.\nWithout thought, without念, the spirit grows dull—\nHow then can it congeal into the embryonic immortal?\n\nThe embryonic immortal is but the union of two,\nAnd this union occurs in but an instant.\nDo you yet know the return of the Great Yang?\nIt lies just before the Winter Solstice.\nIt is said when the golden essence descends,\nWith what is it restored?\nThe golden essence lies in the Kun Palace’s medicine,\nKun resides in the southwest, the river’s source.\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—\nThis is the root of the medicine.\n\nExchange hours for days, moments for hours,\nA single drop of sweet dew—named the Numinous Spring.\nSwallowed, it surges into the heart, piercing the lung’s transport points,\nFalling into the bladder to form the elixir.\nThe elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—\nThough it originates there, it rests in the liver.\nThe liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence,\nEncountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.\n\nDo not say this is the work of effort,\nLest such words cling to form.\nBegin with form, end without form—\nRefine essence into qi, qi returns to the root,\nThe root of qi congeals into spirit,\nOnly then is there non-doing and spiritual communion.\n\nLike husband and wife in union,\nA single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.\nTheir union is born of emotion, yet emotion,\nStill brings forth a child in ten months—\nHow much more so when the cosmos lies within your grasp?\n\nWithin the body, the tiger’s roar and dragon’s song,\nThough the dragon’s song is unseen,\nWaves surge high, a thousand fathoms deep.\nThough the tiger’s roar is unheard,\nThe night wind howls through ten thousand forests.\n\nFrom the elixir’s coagulation onward,\nThrough the deepening of the fire’s refinement,\nUntil the tenth month, when frost descends,\nSpirit and soul flee—who dares contend?\nA year comprises twelve months,\nYet who dares bathe at Mao and You?\nThus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,\nThe golden crucible brimming, dragon essence overflowing.\nThe mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—\nWith the secret received, what difficulty remains in cultivation?\n\nIf you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,\nAnd grasp the moon’s soul,\nNodding at these words, you know the ancients—\nWhat worry remains that your body will not ascend?\n\nWithin the body’s shell, within the heart’s depths,\nLies a priceless treasure—\nIt can give life or bring death,\nFeed the hungry or sate the full.\nSeek its meaning, take its origin,\nAnd wander carefree, joyous, without hunger or cold.\n\nSuch scenes and proofs of attainment\nAll unfold within a single day’s effort.\nThis effort seems idle,\nThe medicine is not distant, its gathering not difficult.",

people seek the Golden Elder?\n\nThe transmission of lead and mercury is rare in the world,\nCinnabar as substance, snow as its robe.\nDimly it dwells in your own home—\nDay after day, you look yet do

Way.\n\nI fear you waste this youthful spring in vain,\nSo I recount it all from the beginning for you:\nUnless it be the secret of the golden liquor and returning elixir,\nThere is no need to squander your spirit in vain.\n\nLike the deluded who study \"bedchamber arts,\"\nTheir hearts ever clinging to lustful union,\nCalling it \"yin elixir\" or \"the method of controlling women,\"\nPressing fingers between the brows to swallow qi,\nSeizing others’ essence to replenish their own,\nClinging to the Three Peaks with perverse views—\nThe birth gate they call the \"source of life,\"\nNine shallow thrusts and one deep, repeated endlessly.\nXuanyuan, Pengzu, Lao Rongcheng,\nHuanggu, Shouguang, Zhao Feiyan—\nTheir households have other paths to the heavens,\nPracticed in wine shops and brothels.\nDo not say you meet immortals among the flowers,\nOnly to trade a golden hairpin for a clay tile.\nThe root is already rotten, leaves but green in vain,\nThe qi-sea churns, death comes swift as an arrow.\n\nOther side doors may still offer some ease and comfort:\nSome practice \"serving qi\" as the Central Yellow,\nSome \"guarding the crown\" as the Primordial Chaos,\nSome \"circulating qi\" as the Precelestial,\nSome \"swallowing saliva\" as the Numinous Spring.\nOr they fixate on a point beside the spleen,\nInsisting it is the root of breath;\nOr take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\nInhaling purity and exhaling turbidity as \"returning and restoring.\"\nOr silently supplicate the Highest Lord,\nEyes upturned to guard the Mud Pill.\nWith these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,\nCalling it the \"Spine’s Pass\";\nOr hold breath and swallow saliva,\nCalling it the \"Jade Liquor and Golden Liquor Elixir\";\nOr concentrate spirit below the navel,\nOr fix thoughts between the brows.\nSome circulate the mind along the spine,\nSome press the tongue to the palate,\nHunch shoulders, crane necks, arch backs—\nCalling it \"direct entry to the Royal Capital Mountain.\"\nMouth as the \"Flowery Pond,\" tongue as the dragon,\nCalling it \"numinous water flowing murmuringly.\"\nThese side-door methods of ease and comfort,\nHow can they hope to become celestial immortals?\n\nEighty swallows, nine held back, one swallowed,\nGathering qi to the navel as \"embryonic breathing,\"\nHands clutching prayer beads to count breaths,\nWater clocks and earthen gnomons to mark time.\nOr following the *Lingbao* secret methods,\nForcibly restraining the tailbone to swallow saliva;\nOr studying the *Xishan Huizhen Ji*,\nFacing the wall in silence all day.\nThough people now learn to sit in meditation,\nWhen has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade?\nThough they practice \"embracing the One,\"\nWhen have they ever been like jade hidden in stone?\n\nSome say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nDry wood, dead ash, solitary silence;\nSome claim it is already manifest and complete,\nYet ask them—where is the illusory body obtained?\nOthers exhaust their forms gathering sun and moon,\nCalling it \"heavenly hun and earthly po\";\nOthers ingest the Seven Luminaries through the night,\nCalling it the \"true bloodline of creation\";\nOthers \"fly golden essence from behind the elbow,\"\nQi steaming, water dripping;\nOthers \"contain the true qi of Taiyi,\"\nHearts darkly serene, worthy and still.\nSome circulate the flowing pearl in cycles,\nSome in stillness visualize red tangerines—\nSuch are all methods for nurturing life,\nYet none can transform insubstantial into numinous essence.\n\nThe Dao’s essentials nurture the child within the void,\nWithin it lies the true and certain mark.\nAll rely on the wondrous heavenly mechanism’s simplicity,\nScattered through alchemical texts yet never revealed.\nPitiful are the foolish who cling to delusion,\nPointing at one another, sketching emptiness upon emptiness.\nSuch bizarre and deranged lot,\nSitting and swaying, trembling for hours,\nBending, stretching, prostrating in countless postures,\nWeeping and wailing like children at play—\nAll because the square inch of their hearts has no master,\nQi scattered, spirit wild and flying.\nA throng of vain thoughts clamoring in chorus,\nDeceiving the common folk, beguiling the foolish.\nThey know not how to unite with the Dao’s truth,\nOnly to unite with demons in vain folly.\n\nOnce the heart stirs, qi follows,\nLeaping, trembling, activating the spirit’s mechanism.\nSome say this is \"yang qi arriving,\"\nSome say it is \"dragon and tiger battling,\"\nSome say the \"river chariot welcomes a thousand times,\"\nSome say \"water and fire rush in pursuit.\"\nWatch as they sway the qi of the five viscera,\nOne day the brain drains, the spirit withers.\nThe ancestral immortals left elixir secrets,\nGenerating something from nothing as the elixir’s foundation—\nWhen was there ever such ghostly and monstrous behavior?\nAll are the delusions of inferior scholars.\n\nI have heard the sages and masters of former ages:\nWithin non-action, nothing is not done,\nAll arises from formlessness to generate true form,\nNo need for visualization or forced cultivation.\nTherein lies the marvel, strange and wondrous—\nHeart and kidney were never Kan and Li,\nLiver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder,\nOnly old fences around empty houses.\nTears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, fluids,\nOnly aids to be used as stepping stones.\nSpirit, hun, po, heart, intent, qi—\nObserve them: they seem real, yet are not.\n\nWhy seek inner vision or mirror the form,\nOr listen for numinous echoes, gaze into limpid pools?\nSwallowing mist, drinking dew, ingesting primordial qi,\nTheir efforts prove futile, hearts and spirits weary.\nExpounding on emptiness, tinkering with furnace fires,\nDemanding written pledges, collecting gold and treasures.\nDaring to equate frogwort with the vast ocean,\nClaiming the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than themselves.\nFalsely assuming titles, feigning divine powers,\nPointing at ghosts and spirits to expound cause and effect.\nToday and tomorrow, they file petitions,\nInner elixir, outer elixir—nothing is beyond them.\nDeceiving the worthy, deluding the sages, obscuring the Three Luminaries,\nThey claim to see fortune and misfortune as clearly as a loom’s shuttle,\nSummoning disciples to wander the market’s dust,\nDrunk on wine, sated with virtue, forming gangs.\n\nThe Great Dao has always transcended names and forms,\nTrue immortals are never adorned with flowers and grasses.\nThey teach others to take vows and labor diligently—\nHow is that better than your own diligent practice?\nIf one person is deluded, it may still be endured,\nBut delusion passed to delusion leads to old age in confusion.\nThese blind leading the blind,\nTogether they enter the maze—truly lamentable.\nWhen fortune is exhausted and retribution arrives,\nOffending heaven, there is no place for prayer.\nThe Three Origins and Nine Palaces record their transgressions,\nTheir hun and po seized, they endure the underworld’s trials.\n\nThe world delights in learning immortality,\nYet how many daily seek the profound mystery?\nEach boasts of their own absurdities, competing in loftiness,\nNeglecting the true and real as the ultimate truth.",

scattered, it becomes qi—\nThe same in heaven as it is among men.\n\nBetter to seek a master’s peaceful method\nThan to perversely plunder essence and blood.\nAs the ancients said, \"All under heaven returns to this\"—\nYou must learn the non-action of the pure and still.\n\nBind the ten thousand acres of clouds to the green mountain,\nScoop the full moon from the azure pool.\nThe mysterious pass—a single aperture—none know it,\nYet this is the most wondrous *daogui* knife.\n\nOne night, I encountered Master Lü the Scholar,\nWho possessed an elixir formula even more marvelous:\nHe took the great void as his crucible,\nSeized the sun and moon as his ingredients.\nMountains, rivers, and the vast earth ignited with fierce fire,\nWithin which the ten thousand images birthed clouds and thunder.\nThe primordial chaos of old became the myriad things,\nAll conjoining in an instant to form the sacred embryo.\nNo gold or wood intervened,\nNo dragon or tiger divided south and north.\nNo inquiry into mother or child, female or male,\nNo distinction between husband and wife, black or white.\nWhat man calls the Great Return Elixir?\nEven the Supreme Lord Lao could not swallow it.\n\nThe Old Lord left it for the carefree wanderer,\nWho, upon consuming it, ascends as an immortal to the Great Ultimate.\nWith a cup of primordial wine,\nFeeding on this *daogui* to strengthen the countenance—\nThough the seas may turn to mulberry fields,\nIn my Dao, a year in the pot has not yet passed.\n\nI know your heart is firm as iron,\nThus I transmit these words secretly, mouth to mouth.\nIn the wondrous place, not half a phrase exists—\nThe immortal’s method is truly natural.\n\nHasten to begin, knit the embryo immortal,\nAnd chant brightly as you return to Penglai’s heaven.\n\n**On the Foundation of the Elixir Returning to the One**\n\nThe ancients said: \"Attain the One, and all things are complete.\"\nAh!\nHow true!",

soul and earthly spirit are but the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon;\ncinnabar lead and black mercury are but the essence of metal and the fluid of wood.\nThe crow and hare are the tortoise and serpent;\nthe horse and ox are the dragon and tiger.\nCinnabar and quicksilver form the bones of the yellow sprout and white snow;\ncinnabar and autumn stone arise from white gold and black tin.\n\nDistinguished as male and female, husband and wife,\nembodied as metal, wood, water, and fire,\ncategorized as the azure, the dark, the slow, and the swift,\nsymbolized as Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—\nwhether called the River Chariot,\nor the Yellow Ascension,\nor spoken of as the fire-jujube and the exchange-pear,\nor as golden sand and jade mercury—\nor by names like Elder Ding and Yellow Matron,\nor titles such as Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—\ndissected into black and white,\ndivided into azure and yellow,\nall this profusion,\nin truth, is but the two words: yin and yang.\nAll

say: \"Gaze at the earth-gnomon, watch the night’s water-clock\"—\nhow grievously mistaken!\n\nDo they not know that the year’s creation is but the essence and qi of the body’s cycle,\nthat day and night, hours and moments, are but the transformations of essence and qi?\nWithin them lie decline and flourishing,\nrising and falling,\nfloating and sinking,\nclarity and turbidity.\nThus the sages

      "translated_text": "Within the crucible, vermilion tangerines glow crimson across the sky—\nthis is the ceaseless work of nurturing the fire.\nPrimal qi returns to the furnace, the spirit unscattered,\nas spring mountains, spring waters, and spring winds arise of themselves.\n\nFirst dry the golden crucible to quicken living mercury,\nwhen the mercury is dried, the great elixir is complete.\nClearly there grows an herb of immortality,\ntransmuting iron to gold without deceiving man.\n\nTears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood—\ntrue and false intermingle, requiring discernment.\nFrom nothing comes something: these are the medicinal materials,\nnot to be confused with illusory, hollow things.\n\nScriptural transformations occur in an instant,\nyet the deluded seek them in distant days and months.\nSimply guard the fire-hexagram for three hundred moments,\nand a luminous pearl is born in the night.\n\nA celestial source flows straight from Kunlun,\nnowhere more hidden than the Nine-Bend Bay.\nA million jade dragons roar without cease,\nas a river of spring moonlight chases the fishing boats.\n\nWhen spirit and essence merge in the return to darkness,\nbone and flesh fuse so subtly they go unnoticed.\nThe joints open and flow freely,\nthe countenance gleams, smooth as an infant’s.\n\nMeasurements must correspond to the two crescents,\nthis pattern of the law mirrors heaven’s abyss.\nTurn and ask the Yellow Dame for guidance—\nwhy wait for mere oral transmission?\n\nLead and mercury trace back to the roots of dragon and tiger,\nthe Mysterious Female’s gate is the door of wu and ji.\nOnly within the jade pot of spring’s hues\nmay one pluck a blossom to question Fu Xi and Xuan Yuan.\n\nNear, it takes three mornings; far, ninety days—\nknow that transformations have their appointed hours.\nWithout understanding the elixir of long life’s creation,\neven lazy mercury transmuting to gold stirs wonder.\n\nThe crucible holds no hidden medicine to seek,\nwhat is sought and what emerges are the same gold.\nCast it large or small at will—\nsuch is the profound principle of the ice-pure vessel.\n\nEntering the crucible requires a weight of one jin,\nyet when weighed, it becomes sixteen stars.\nEach star holds true gold’s wonder within water,\ncombining to form flowing pearls in perfect balance.\n\nThe Kan Palace’s even pond, the stone-foot spring,\nstars face one another, shooting toward the high heavens.\nThe murmuring yang pulse courses through green and white,\nbathing the golden body to make it firm.\n\nAll say the Perfected One remains utterly silent—\nhow could he ever reveal it through words?\nIf not for arrogance, matters would require no speech,\nit is only that the chest lacks mercury and lead.\n\nWhen heaven and earth first parted, sun and moon rose high,\nshaped like an egg, then like a peach.\nYin and yang’s true qi knows its seasons,\nwaiting three years to shed the armor of strife.\n\nThe dragon-tiger cinnabar’s meaning is most profound,\nwithin the five-spirit gold, mercury and lead flow.\nAfter a thousand mornings, it turns purple and soars into the clouds,\nascending straight to the Great Canopy Heaven.\n\nTo use lead, one must blend it with mercury,\nthe two families become kin as the woman sings.\nWhen refined to the point the Purple River Chariot stirs the earth,\nwhite clouds accompany the passing crane.\n\nRed and black unite as wife weds husband,\nonce a year entering the elixir’s pivot.\nIn the bridal chamber’s depths, true cloud and rain—\na child is born, just like them.\n\nThe Kan man and Qian woman dwell in heaven’s domain,\nbuying medicine and firing the elixir costs no coin.\nWithin the crescent moon furnace, the work of creation is brewed—\na bit of wondrous medicine requires true lead.\n\nWhat strange thing provokes laughter time and again?\nNow even men can conceive.\nTheir own essence and blood intermingle,\nwithin the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed.\n\nThree families contain the union of two things,\nthe red dragon flies up to the azure clouds.\nAt night, sweet dew passes through the empty sky,\na sliver of moon hangs above the Magpie Bridge.\n\nReturning to the union, cultivate the water-fire school,\nthe rabbit and crow bathe in the inner elixir’s red glow.\nAfter sixty-six circuits of the celestial orbit and the cold furnace,\nthe ten-month fetus matures, revealing sacred power.\n\nWater and fire share essence between wood and metal,\nbut where does one seek fire and wood?\nShedding yellow to don purple—why?\nOnly because the River Chariot’s revolutions run deep.\n\nThe jade talisman and golden liquid refine the celestial immortal,\nmoonlight illuminates Kunlun’s lotus pool.\nPointing to the northern Dark Warrior’s affair—\nwhy do tortoise and snake entwine?\n\nRain washes the new bamboo as twin phoenixes take flight,\nbeneath the jade mushroom, a sacred tortoise.\nHolding the zither, it plays the dance of immortal melodies,\nthen releases Chang’e to feast by the small pool.\n\nGolden light suffuses the body, the marrow fragrant,\ngolden sinews and jade bones are wholly yang.\nRefined until red and white flow as white,\nyin qi dissolves, and the body is naturally sound.\n\nOnce the work is done with utmost sincerity,\nconcentrate the spirit, gather the qi, and secure true essence.\nThe complexion becomes jade-like, hunger and thirst vanish—\nonly then does the golden elixir’s momentary formation appear.\n\nThe Green Maiden stands alone in the crystal palace,\nher graceful form brimming with intent.\nAt midnight, the Yellow Dame comes knocking at the door,\nto act as matchmaker, marrying her to the Golden Elder.\n\nThe Great One’s mysterious pearl, the golden liquid elixir,\nreturns to the origin, restores the root, and preserves youthful countenance.\nOne must personally heed the enlightened master’s words,\nonly then may you be shown the way.\n\nAt night, a single emerald lotus leaf appears,\nwithin it, red pellets drip like pearls.\nDripping into the Flowery Pond, it becomes spirit water,\ncongealing in the cinnabar field to form the elixir’s pivot.\n\nHigh and Kan are called the essences of water and fire,\noriginally formed from Qian and Kun’s two trigrams.\nSimply take Kan’s essence to infuse the high cavity—\npure Qian can then grasp the flying jasper.\n\n*Green Void Chapters Complete* #1\n(Three characters missing here in the original.)",
