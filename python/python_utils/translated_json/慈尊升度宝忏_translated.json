One fascicle.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Mysteries (Dongxuan)*, *Category of Ritual Propriety (Weiyi)*.\n\n---\n\n**The Precious Repentance for the Ascension of the Compassionate Lord**\n*Ritual performed according to proper form.*\n\nThe officiant, your humble servant [Name], having lit incense, respectfully petitions:\n\nTo the Most Perfect and Supreme *Dao-Treasure*, the Three Venerable Ones of the Highest;\nTo the Most Perfect and Supreme *Scripture-Treasure*, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures;\nTo the Most Perfect and Supreme *Master-Treasure*, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;\nTo the Great Compassionate One of the Eastern Ultimate Palace, the *Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering*;\nTo the *Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Empyrean*;\nTo the *Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells*;\nTo the *Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions*;\nTo the *Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering*;\nTo the *Perfected of Great Compassion and Great Kindness*;\nTo the boundless true lords of the Assembly of Salvation;\nTo the incense-offering officials and courier messengers;\nTo the local earth gods of this realm—\nAll are reverently offered true incense in universal homage.\n\nYour servant now petitions:\n\nI have heard that the Three Clarities’ sagely lords spread the Three Caverns to extend their compassion,\nThat the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Poles pervade the Ten Directions to save from suffering.\nTheir grace blankets the cosmos, their kindness reaches the hidden and dark.\nThe sentient beings of the Six Realms, parting clouds and mist, gaze upon the sun and moon;\nThe Nine Hells’ various realms transform sands and dust to ferry gods and humans.\nHow much more so do the Yellow Register’s precepts descend, the Purple Clarity’s teachings establish,\nUniversally aiding, universally delivering—boundless and immeasurable!\n\nToday, on behalf of the departed soul of [Name], we rely on the true precepts of the Nine Grades,\nAnd pray to the ranked sages of the Ten Heavens.\nWe purify the sacred space, sincerely revealing our sorrowful devotion,\nRepenting the transgressions of dust and kalpas, dissolving the karmic obstructions of many lives.\nNow, the orchid altar is prepared, precious incense coils in smoke.\nReverently facing the Most Venerable, we proclaim the repentance ritual,\nBowing our heads in refuge to the Boundless Great Dao.\n\n**Invocation of Respectful Praise**\n**The Three Refuges**\nHaving taken refuge in the Three Treasures, the Ten Directions clearly witness.\nToday, on behalf of the departed soul of [Name], we humbly follow the true precepts,\nRelying on the Daoist assembly to dedicate merit to the hidden realm,\nAiding their transcendence and rebirth.\nWith pure and fragrant flowers, we offer sincere worship.\n\n**The Assembly** proclaims:\nThus, incense—rare wood of the *Qian* groves, divine roots of the *Ju* caves—\nRadiates the splendor of the Dao and virtue, solidifies the auspicious *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nAs the jeweled casket opens, the golden tripod begins its chant.\nMay this single wisp of fragrant incense pervade the Ten Flowery Realms.\nThe assembly, with reverence, takes refuge and makes offerings.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy of Distant Fragrance**\nThe altar’s hundred harmonies settle like auspicious clouds,\nA single heart’s incense expresses utmost sincerity.\nMay the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering deign to descend,\nThat the departed soul may be delivered and bow to the Three Clarities.\n\nThus, flowers—roots transmitted from the *Lang* gardens, buds formed in the numinous terrace—\nExtend five branches of immortal cassia, bloom ten-yard fragrant lotuses.\nScattered in profusion around the altar’s corners, gracefully swirling in the void,\nThey adorn the myriad blossoms, dispersing across the Ten Directions.\nThe assembly takes refuge and makes offerings with reverence.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy of Precious Flowers’ Purity**\nHeavenly fragrance and royal beauty ever endure,\nResplendent on the plate, they express utmost sincerity.\nMay the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms deign to witness,\nThat the departed soul may be delivered and bow to the Compassionate Lord.\n\nThus, water—its source deep and vast, its benefits inexhaustible—\nDrawn from the Eastern Well, poured toward the Ten Directions’ realms.\nThough simple in preparation, its value lies in reverent devotion.\nThe assembly takes refuge and makes offerings with sincerity.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy of Sweet Dew’s Circulation**\nThe jade sea’s profound waves flow with numinous ripples,\nVast and clear, they bestow abundant moisture.\nMay the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Poles deign to witness,\nThat grace may bathe the departed, guiding them to depart the netherworld.\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering fills the Ten Directions’ realms,\nEver employing divine power to rescue and deliver all sentient beings,\nEnabling them to depart from delusion’s paths.\nSentient beings, unaware, are like the blind beholding the sun and moon.\nI originate from the Great Nothingness, guiding without limit.\nAuspicious clouds open the gate of life, propitious smoke seals the door of death.\nFirst issuing from the Mysterious and Primordial, it connects with the mechanism of auspicious response.\nSaving all sins, delivering all calamities,\nVastly transcending the immortal source, boundlessly attaining natural purity.\nSuch is the power of the Dao—immeasurable and boundless!\n\nToday, gazing upon the precious radiance, we bow to the jade countenance.\nOn behalf of the departed soul of [Name],\nWe repent the transgressions of their former life, eradicate the faults of their demise.\nThe assembly, with reverence, sincerely prostrates.\n\n**Sincerely prostrate and bow to:**\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Chaotic Origin and the Dao and Virtue.\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, the Great Unity.\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, August and Supreme.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious and True, Myriad Blessings.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme and Most Wondrous.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity, Mysterious and Supreme.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Ascended Immortals and Sagely Ones.\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous and Empty Sovereign.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Flower.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity, Bright and August.\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Grotto Spirits.\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion and Great Kindness.\n\n**Bows completed.** Each rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.\n\nWe, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,\nTo the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.\nReverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.\nToday, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,\nWe confess transgressions and repent.\nFor the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,\nIn all actions and movements, they were mired in the dust and filth of the six senses;\nIn vain pleasures and idle delights, they multiplied myriad transgressions.\nThrough countless rebirths, their heavy sins in bodily karma—\nWe pray these may be pardoned and absolved.\n\nWe humbly pray the Three Treasures extend their compassion, the Worthies of the Ten Directions bestow salvation.\nMay they issue golden writs to absolve sins, and by their grace of favor, guide the spirit to ascend.\nWe, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Most Perfect Three Treasures.\n\n*Step into the void*\n\nWe, the assembly, further fear that for the departed soul of [Name], though bodily karma is severed, mental karma remains unresolved.\nAgain we beseech the Ten Directions, invoking the assembly of sages.\nWe repent the sins of their former life, that today’s good causes may be witnessed.\nThe ritual assembly takes refuge, renewing their reverent homage.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue of Chaos Origin.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Grand Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Emperor.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Perfection and

Clarity of the Mystic Above.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers Immortals and the Most Sagely.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the

to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Mystic Spirit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Favor.\n\nEach rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.\nWe, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,\nTo the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.\nReverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.\nToday, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,\nWe confess transgressions and repent.\nFor the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,\nAnger and joy, love and aversion—all arose from the heart;\nGreed and delusion, vain and false thoughts—each moment sprang from the mind’s sprouting.\nThus, they committed boundless errors.\nWe pray all sins of mental karma may be pardoned and absolved.\nHumbly we pray that compassionate grace spread through the Ten Directions, that the roots of sin be extinguished;\nThat the purified soul swiftly depart the Nine Realms, and in blessed realms, wander free.\n\nWe, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures.\n\n*Step into the void*\n\nWe, the assembly, further fear that for [Name], though mental karma is now dissolved and right mindfulness restored,\nVerbal karma, unrepented, leaves evil roots unsevered.\nAgain we beseech the Ten Directions, to eradicate the three karmas,\nThat the departed soul of [Name] may awaken to the illusory nature of bodily, mental, and verbal karma, and their sins melt like ice;\nThat through reverence for the Dao, scriptures, and masters, the true vehicle may flourish and good roots grow.\nThe ritual assembly takes refuge, thrice renewing their reverent homage.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue of Chaos Origin.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Grand Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the

Spirit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Favor.\n\nEach rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.\nWe, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,\nTo the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.\nReverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.\nToday, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,\nWe confess transgressions and repent.\nFor the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,\nWords belied the heart, wantonly harming living beings;\nFlowery speech and ornate language, displaying cunning and flattery through the tongue’s root.\nSelf-committed or taught to others, their transgressions were boundless.\nWe pray all grave sins of verbal karma may be pardoned and absolved.\nHumbly we pray the three karmas be purged, the six senses purified.\nThrough the sacred power of the Ten Heavens, may they forever depart the dark paths of the Nine Nights.\n\nWe, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures.\n\n*Step into the void*   *Thrice invoked*   *Thrice bowed*\n\nWe look up to the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions,\nWho manifest forms across the ten realms, universally delivering gods and humans.\nGathering qi and amassing merit, they harmoniously rescue sinful souls.\nBeyond this realm lies the Eastern Paradise, within the Hall of Eternal Joy,\nThe Merciful One, the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, vows to universally deliver all beings.\nThrough countless eons, they have saved immeasurable multitudes.\nShould one invoke their sacred name, meditate upon their compassionate visage,\nWith unwavering devotion and ceaseless recitation,\nThey shall depart all realms of suffering, attain this sublime cause,\nEnjoy great blessings in heaven, and hear no cries of torment in hell.\nThe fiery haze transforms into clear coolness, the sword trees become towering forests.\nAscending to the Vermilion Mansion, they proceed directly to the Primordial Lord.\nRelying further on the companions of the Dao, together we invoke.\n\n*Recite the Precious Name of Azure Florescence*\n\nHaving heard the sacred name, we meditate upon the honored countenance.\nVast are the merits, dispelling calamities and erasing sins.\nThrough the power of the Dao and the scriptures, we aid the dark blessings to ascend;\nBy the wondrous sounds of the Dharma, we awaken the soul’s deportment to enlightenment.\nThe true scriptures hold mysteries, the secret canon is solemnly proclaimed.\nThe ritual assembly takes refuge, reciting with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering*—now, as jade tablets inscribe celestial script and sounds reach the ten directions, the precious name of the Jade Tone resounds through all heavens. May the golden youths attending incense trace fragrant sigils in the sky; may the jade lads presenting scriptures advance the sacred texts upon the tablets. Thus shall sins vanish across kalpas, and blessings descend upon this very hour. The living and the dead alike receive the grace of flourishing peace; all beings, moving and still, perceive the virtue of life’s completion. Such wondrous power adorns all things universally.\n\nThe three wretched paths cease their tormenting toils; the nine nights end their bitter agonies. Then, all beings—whether noble or humble, whether dimly stirring or fully sentient—together board the vessel of the Six Perfections and ascend to the realm of the Three Purities.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Most High, the Void Sovereign, the True and Orthodox Three Treasures.\n\nHerein concludes the *Precious Repentance for the Ascension of the Merciful Honored One*, now offered in dedication.",
