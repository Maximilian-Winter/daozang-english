Ultimately, the ascent of the throat and the descent of the lower orifices lead nowhere. The Four Great [elements] of the body are all yin—where, then, does the Dao’s yang reside?\"*\n\nXuan asked: *\"Where does the yang reside?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"It lies in the dim, obscure void—where things appear and disappear like illusions. The Buddhist saying goes: ‘It does not belong to the middle, nor to the inner or outer.’ This is correct. Shao Kangjie [Emperor Renzong] also said: ‘When seen, it seems to exist; when sought, it vanishes.’ Seeking it from within is still yin; seeking it from without is not true yang. Ultimately, this matter is difficult to speak of.\"*\n\nXuan asked: *\"What the *Cāntóng Qì* [Paramount Concordance] speaks of—sun, moon, dragon, and tiger—is this semen and blood?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"No.\"*\n\n*\"Is it then vital essence (jīng)?\"*\n\n*\"No.\"*\n\nXuan said: *\"Then what is it?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"It is simply shénqì [spirit-qi].\"*\n\nThe Master continued: *\"Since this is a practice, you must press forward earnestly. Do not multiply the methods—for if you do, where will they lead in the end?\"*\n\nThe Master further said: *\"Practicing the method is like holding office; cultivating the Dao is like retiring into seclusion. How can one grasp two serpents with a single hand?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Since the time of Master Zǐyáng [Chen Tuan], the four generations of true persons have all been here.\"*\n\nXuan asked: *\"If there is the ability to dissolve into sun and moon, why say ‘here’?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"This is still the mortal body.\"*\n\nThe Master then spoke of the lineage:\n*\"Zǐyáng was from Tiāntái; Xìnglín was from Chángzhōu; Pílíng Shī was from Wéizhōu; Cuìxū was from Huìzhōu—or so they say, though some claim Hénɡzhōu.\"*\n\nSuddenly, the Master took *Dūtiān Dàléi Yùshū* [The Great Thunder Scripture of the Five Peaks] from beneath his seat and gave it to Xuan, saying: *\"Take this home and copy it swiftly—bring it back tomorrow. I see your lifelong devotion to the Dao; now fulfill your lifelong aspiration.\"*\n\nXuan asked: *\"Master Cuìxū, who bore the name Cuìxū, was also called Níhuán [‘Clay Pill’]. How so?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Cuìxū was his self-given name. He once treated people with níhuán [clay pills], so those in Húguǎng [Hubei-Hunan] called him Chén Níhuán.\"*\n\nXuan asked how Master Cuìxū obtained his teachings.\n\nThe Master said: *\"My teacher received the Thunder Scripture in the mountains of Lí Mǔ, but he never spoke the name or clan of the one who gave it—perhaps it was a divine transmission. The elixir method, however, came from Master Dàoguāng [Dàoguāng Andǎng]. My teacher once, in drunkenness, said: ‘I am a disciple of the Thunder Department’s Xīn Judge—what business do I have with Dàoguāng Andǎng?’\"*\n\nXuan asked how Master Cuìxū achieved dissolution.\n\nThe Master said: *\"On the fourteenth day of the fourth month of Jiādìng [1218], in Zhāngshān, Zhàngzhou, my teacher engaged in a dispute with an old man who carried a wine barrel. He entered the water and departed. That very day, a county magistrate from Táozhōu, who was then in Níngxiāng, Níngzhōu, saw him. My teacher had been a long-standing acquaintance of the magistrate’s father, and so he left a letter for the magistrate to deliver. Only later did they realize he had died here while appearing there. I was present at the time and witnessed it myself. The old man with the barrel had left an axe on the ground; after my teacher entered the water, there was no hope of rescue. I returned with a few others to search for the axe, but it too had vanished. At that time, my teacher was in Zhāngzhou, attending a gathering of cranes. Afterward, he told the host: ‘I have come to wrap my corpse for dissolution.’ The host did not take it seriously. He left behind four lines, commanding me to inscribe them in the gathering hall before departing.\"*\n\nThe inscription reads:\n*\"A thunderclap cracks the crown—\nChaos crumbles to dust, no trace remains.\nToday, the path is found, and I ride forth—\nMounting a hornless fire-dragon.\"*\n\nThe people of Huguang often urged my teacher to compose poetry, but they only saw words flow from his lips, perfectly formed, though he never took a brush in hand.\n\nI asked: *\"My time with you is brief, is it not?\"*\n*\"Six years!\"*\n*\"What have I gained in probing your Way?\"*\n*\"The Way is like the sea—\nBoundless, no thief can plunder its depths.\"*\n\nIn my leisurely moments, I saw my teacher drive away evils and heal sicknesses. Sometimes he gave them mud pellets, sometimes wooden tablets, stones, or charcoal—some edible, some not; some tangible, some not. Sometimes he provided talismans and water, sometimes only instructions. Those he neither gave nor instructed never recovered, but those he both gave to and instructed invariably succeeded.\n\nI did not know how he did it, yet I intuitively understood. I imitated his methods, and often they worked as well.\n\nHe said: *\"This is beyond what ordinary people know.\"*\n\nMy teacher asked: *\"Beyond the saliva, tears, and vital essence of blood and fluids—is there not a true body? One must abandon this to attain that. Beyond joy, anger, sorrow, love, hatred, and desire—is there not a true nature? It must be this and not that. In silent stillness, no thoughts arise; in tranquil repose, no musings remain. All day eating, yet no taste; all day clothed, yet no sensation. If I say to you, ‘Hold your mind here,’ then hunger, cold, satiety, and warmth become worries, and life and death, suffering and joy become the measure—do you think this is the Dao’s true vision? If you can know this and truly act thus, then you will know that Zhang Daoling, Xu Xun, and Ge Hong—even with wives and children—were immortals, and even with wine and meat—were immortals. Their outward lives were like others’, but their hearts were different from others. I blend with the world and harmonize with its light only to avoid standing apart!\"*\n\nThe fish longs to differ from the grass-fish—\nLeave the water and leap to shore, and it dies.\nThe tiger longs to differ from the grass-tiger—\nLeave the mountains and enter the market, and it is captured.\n\nI sighed: *\"Ah! Truly spoken.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe life and death of mortals are decreed by fate, and noble or humble status by heaven. Why do not people take joy in heaven’s will and know their fate, only to dread death while loving life, to abhor lowliness while craving nobility?\n\nFor cold and heat are entrusted to the seasons of heaven, this body is not mine to possess—it is truly heaven’s creation. When heaven grants its hearing to cold and heat, what can one do about it?\n\nThe Master said: *\"The *Dùrén Jīng* states: ‘The realms of desire, form, and formlessness—these are the three realms.’ The *Tiānxīn Fǎshū* states: ‘The realms of heaven, earth, and void—these are the three realms.’ But today’s people speak of upper, middle, and lower three realms—this shows their study is not thorough!\n\nOr they say the realms of heaven, earth, and water—this is even more erroneous!\n\nThe scripture says: ‘The domain of the winding springs, the Northern Capital of Luódēng.’ Thus, earth and water both belong to the lower realm—this is clear!\n\nEven to the point where they claim the Great Sovereign of the *Qīngdū* as the master of the earthly realm, and the Great Sovereign of *Fúshāng* as the master of the water realm.\n\nIf one speaks of the Great Celestial Sovereign of Jade, he is truly the master of the heavenly realm;\nThe august Earthly Sovereign, *Hòutǔ Huángdìzhǐ*, is truly the master of the earthly realm.\nThis is correct.\n\nAs for the Great Sovereign of *Qīngdū* and *Fúshāng*, they are merely overseers of a single bureau.\n\nThe Master said: *\"In the elixir’s oral instructions, the first principle is to gather *qi* and condense the mind.*\nHe also said: *‘To always hold fast is to gather *qi*; to always maintain silence is to condense the mind.’*\nHe also said: *‘When all minds are constantly condensed, it is called *líng*; when *qi* does not scatter, it is called *bǎo*.’*\nHe also said: *‘The Golden Elixir is *língbǎo*; *língbǎo* is the Golden Elixir.’*\nHe also said: *‘A distracted mind leads to a disordered spirit; disorder leads to chaos, and chaos prevents condensation.’*\nHe also said: *‘A tranquil mind brings harmonious *qi*; harmony leads to stillness, and stillness prevents scattering.’*\nHe also said: *‘Guard and cherish the primordial *qi*, as you would guard and cherish your eyes.’*\nHe also said: *‘Only when the mind dies can the spirit be truly alive; only when the *pò* is extinguished can the *hún* flourish.’*\nHe also said: *‘Let the mind always be as if foolish; always be lively and unrestrained, like a rolling ball on a board—this is called *yuántōng*.’*\nHe also said: *‘This mind is dull yet not still; dead yet not condensed.’*\nHe also said: *‘First, learn to be without mind; then, learn to forget the body.’*\n\nThe Master told his disciple: *\"You say the Eleven Luminaries Incantation is what the Most High spoke of?*\nThe disciple replied: *\"Indeed it is!\"*\nThe Master said: *\"Ah!\"*\n\n「But within that incantation, there is mention of *Gān Shí Tuī Liú Fú*—the \"reclining flow of the sweet and hard [stars].\" Yet *Gān Dé* (Sweet Virtue) and *Shí Shēn* (Hard Application) were both star diviners (*xīng wēng*), men of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Before *Gān* and *Shí* were born, this incantation already existed—when examined closely, could it truly be the Most High’s words?\n\nThe Master asked *Zǐyuán Liúyuán Zhǎng*: \"Do you truly believe that the *Hùnyuán Rúyì* [methods] of the mundane world are authentic?\"\nHe replied: \"Indeed.\"\nThe Master said: \"Ah! Within those methods, there is an incantation called *Běijí Zòushèng Zhēn Jūn Lǜlìng* (The Northern Pole’s *Lǜlìng* to Assist the Most Holy), and another, *Sāntiān Fújiào Fǔ Xuán Dàfǎshī Lǜlìng* (The Three Heavens’ *Lǜlìng* to Support Teaching and Assist the Mysterious Grand Master). If so, then it is indeed questionable. *Zòushèng* (Assist the Holy) was a figure of the Zhou era, and the *Tiānshī* (Celestial Master) of the Han. If the *Hùnyuán* [method] predated the Most High’s teachings, why would it invoke the *Lǜlìng* of *Lǎojūn* (Old Master Lao) at all? Much less the *Zòushèng* and the *Tiānshī*! Why then is it called *Hùnyuán*?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"My former teacher, *Níhuán Wēng*, once, when he was in the *Xuīmiào* (Imperial Ancestral Temple), encountered the *Dàdòng Zhēnrén* (Great Cavern True Person) *Sūn Jūn*, who told him: 'In ancient times, *Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn* (Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable) and *Lǎojūn* (Old Master Lao) spoke of few scriptures and teachings. Later disciples collected and compiled them, resulting in a single *zàng* (canon). For example, the *Běidǒu Jīng* (Scripture of the Northern Dipper) was composed by *Zhāng Zhèngyī*, and the *Nándǒu Jīng* (Scripture of the Southern Dipper) by *Wáng Cháng*. Generally, when instructing others in recitation, nothing surpasses the *Língbǎo Dùrén Jīng* (Scripture of the Soul-Treasure for Delivering People), where the *Yùhuáng Tiānzūn* (Jade Emperor) bestows his name.'\n\nThe Master told his disciple: \"Those who attain the *Dào* (Way) are like infants in the womb, while those who attain the *Fǎ* (method) are like generals seated in their war tents.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In the past, a Korean monk possessed a *dānjié* (elixir formula) that read: *'Not a formed substance, nor a formless one—when seen as *wū liú jū* (乌硉矹), this is the essence of creation’s bones.'*\n*Jìngyú Xuán* (静余玄) inquired further.\"",

When heaven grants its hearing to cold and heat, what can one do about it?\n\nThe Master said: *\"The *Dùrén Jīng* states: ‘The realms of desire, form, and formlessness—these are the three realms.’ The *Tiānxīn Fǎshū* states: ‘The realms of heaven, earth, and void—these are the three realms.’ But today’s people speak of upper, middle, and lower three realms—this shows their study is not thorough!\n\nOr they say the realms of heaven, earth, and water—this is even more erroneous!\n\nThe scripture says: ‘The domain of the winding springs, the Northern Capital of Luódēng.’ Thus, earth and water both belong to the lower realm—this is clear!\n\nEven to the point where they claim the Great Sovereign of the *Qīngdū* as the master of the earthly realm, and the Great Sovereign of *Fúshāng* as the master of the water realm.\n\nIf one speaks of the Great Celestial Sovereign of Jade, he is truly the master of the heavenly realm;\nThe august Earthly Sovereign, *Hòutǔ Huángdìzhǐ*, is truly the master of the earthly realm.\nThis is correct.\n\nAs for the Great Sovereign of *Qīngdū* and *Fúshāng*, they are merely overseers of a single bureau.\n\nThe Master said: *\"In the elixir’s oral instructions, the first principle is to gather *qi* and condense the mind.*\nHe also said: *‘To always hold fast is to gather *qi*; to always maintain silence is to condense the mind.’*\nHe also said: *‘When all minds are constantly condensed, it is called *líng*; when *qi* does not scatter, it is called *bǎo*.’*\nHe also said: *‘The Golden Elixir is *língbǎo*; *língbǎo* is the Golden Elixir.’*\nHe also said: *‘A distracted mind leads to a disordered spirit; disorder leads to chaos, and chaos prevents condensation.’*\nHe also said: *‘A tranquil mind brings harmonious *qi*; harmony leads to stillness, and stillness prevents scattering.’*\nHe also said: *‘Guard and cherish the primordial *qi*, as you would guard and cherish your eyes.’*\nHe also said: *‘Only when the mind dies can the spirit be truly alive; only when the *pò* is extinguished can the *hún* flourish.’*\nHe also said: *‘Let the mind always be as if foolish; always be lively and unrestrained, like a rolling ball on a board—this is called *yuántōng*.’*\nHe also said: *‘This mind is dull yet not still; dead yet not condensed.’*\nHe also said: *‘First, learn to be without mind; then, learn to forget the body.’*\n\nThe Master told his disciple: *\"You say the Eleven Luminaries Incantation is what the Most High spoke of?*\nThe disciple replied: *\"Indeed it is!\"*\nThe Master said: *\"Ah!\"*",

      "translated_text": "「But within that incantation, there is mention of *Gān Shí Tuī Liú Fú*—the \"reclining flow of the sweet and hard [stars].\" Yet *Gān Dé* (Sweet Virtue) and *Shí Shēn* (Hard Application) were both star diviners (*xīng wēng*), men of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Before *Gān* and *Shí* were born, this incantation already existed—when examined closely, could it truly be the Most High’s words?\n\nThe Master asked *Zǐyuán Liúyuán Zhǎng*: \"Do you truly believe that the *Hùnyuán Rúyì* [methods] of the mundane world are authentic?\"\nHe replied: \"Indeed.\"\nThe Master said: \"Ah! Within those methods, there is an incantation called *Běijí Zòushèng Zhēn Jūn Lǜlìng* (The Northern Pole’s *Lǜlìng* to Assist the Most Holy), and another, *Sāntiān Fújiào Fǔ Xuán Dàfǎshī Lǜlìng* (The Three Heavens’ *Lǜlìng* to Support Teaching and Assist the Mysterious Grand Master). If so, then it is indeed questionable. *Zòushèng* (Assist the Holy) was a figure of the Zhou era, and the *Tiānshī* (Celestial Master) of the Han. If the *Hùnyuán* [method] predated the Most High’s teachings, why would it invoke the *Lǜlìng* of *Lǎojūn* (Old Master Lao) at all? Much less the *Zòushèng* and the *Tiānshī*! Why then is it called *Hùnyuán*?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"My former teacher, *Níhuán Wēng*, once, when he was in the *Xuīmiào* (Imperial Ancestral Temple), encountered the *Dàdòng Zhēnrén* (Great Cavern True Person) *Sūn Jūn*, who told him: 'In ancient times, *Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn* (Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable) and *Lǎojūn* (Old Master Lao) spoke of few scriptures and teachings. Later disciples collected and compiled them, resulting in a single *zàng* (canon). For example, the *Běidǒu Jīng* (Scripture of the Northern Dipper) was composed by *Zhāng Zhèngyī*, and the *Nándǒu Jīng* (Scripture of the Southern Dipper) by *Wáng Cháng*. Generally, when instructing others in recitation, nothing surpasses the *Língbǎo Dùrén Jīng* (Scripture of the Soul-Treasure for Delivering People), where the *Yùhuáng Tiānzūn* (Jade Emperor) bestows his name.'\n\nThe Master told his disciple: \"Those who attain the *Dào* (Way) are like infants in the womb, while those who attain the *Fǎ* (method) are like generals seated in their war tents.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In the past, a Korean monk possessed a *dānjié* (elixir formula) that read: *'Not a formed substance, nor a formless one—when seen as *wū liú jū* (乌硉矹), this is the essence of creation’s bones.'*\n*Jìngyú Xuán* (静余玄) inquired further.\"",
