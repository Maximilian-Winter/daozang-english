  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences: Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiant Flower of the Sun and Moon**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences: Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiant Flower of the Sun and Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. Originally part of *The Oral Instructions on the Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences*, later separated into an independent text. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\n---\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang received the transmission of this scripture from the Four Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, who consulted the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Queen Mother addressed the Great Emperor, saying:\n\n\"In the era of the Supreme August, those who studied and beheld the treasure scriptures, ascending to the Jade Purity Heaven, all achieved this through the secret cultivation of the precious Dao and the concealment of its numinous mysteries—unspoken by mouth, unmanifest in form, silently resonating with the utmost stillness to attain the Perfected Ones above. Thus, the Dao values concealment and stillness, transforming without form, emerging without sound.\n\nSince I received the true scripture from the Nine Void-Heavens, countless eons have passed, yet it has been transmitted to fewer than three. By the end of the Central August Prime, it was inscribed in the nation of Luona within the Northern Prime Heaven, upon the Lingjing Mountain of the Bird of Renown in the Jialai Grotto, within the Numinous Palace. There, the qi of the Nine Mysteries and the Orthodox Unity congealed into characters.\n\nLater, the Sage Lord of the Nine Mysteries and Golden Portal beheld the numinous text and commanded the Immortal Capital to transcribe it with a covenant sworn to Heaven. Through cultivation, he attained the Dao and ascended to the Golden Portal. The Most High, deeming me reckless in divulging celestial treasures, stripped me of my true primordial title and demoted me to a wandering spirit-official. Only after five hundred years was I restored to my original perfection.\n\nThus, the Primordial Beginning established the Four Offices and the Five Thearchs’ palaces, deploying divine soldiers precisely to inspect leaks and punish with the Wind Blade. How could one not be cautious?\n\nLater disciples flourished like a forest, yet not one attained immortality. Why? All suffered from revealing the scriptural texts, scattering the celestial perfected ones. The Dao ceased to descend, and heavenly punishments silently manifested. Advancing or retreating, they lost their resolve, perishing alone in empty mountains—laboring in vain, their regret beyond words.\n\nThe Dao does not reveal itself without diligence, nor does it flourish without secrecy. Those who behold the true scriptures must cultivate in secret to seek the numinous. The divine and the perfected respond readily, and ascension to immortality may be calculated by days.\n\nConsider the Four Poles Perfected Ones: they mastered myriad precepts, treasured the Dao, and concealed its mysteries. Firmly grasping the numinous charts, their spirit and will stood resolute. Their names were inscribed in the Upper Clarity, their characters recorded in the Emperor’s Register. They ascended to the Four Poles—what doubt remains in receiving this transmission?\n\nThereupon, the Great Emperor transmitted *The Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences* in accordance with the covenant.\n\nThe Lord of the Western City now seals one copy within the Emei Mountains, in the secluded chamber.\n\nThe mysterious text of *The Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences* was born within the Great Void, manifesting upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mystic Garden, in the shade of the Accumulated Stones, within the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber. The Eight Pure Essences’ lofty and mysterious feathered chapters, their numinous texts dense as cavern peaks, their purple characters gleaming like a forest of jade, their divine radiance flowing through the Nine Primes, their golden tones resonating in the Purple Heaven, crimson auroras veiling the Jade Chamber, soaring mists surging in the congealed perfection—purple phoenixes flapping their wings, numinous winds wafting incense, fragrant qi streaming, penetrating the subtle to enter the mysterious. To the left, the spontaneous Golden Lads revolve; to the right, the Supreme Void Immortals are summoned. Divine consorts attend, the Great Flower holds the towel, Jade Lads assist in rank, the Four Offices approach the hall, the Two Effulgences pause their brilliance, the Three Dawns return their essence. Flying immortals gallop in turn, streaming luminosities encamp like clouds, radiant flowers intermingle, the Three Candles merge their light. The majesty of the text blazes, qi spreads through the Purple Court. The assembled perfected ones feast and offer rites, celebrating the Upper Clarity. This is the supreme of numinous texts, its virtue towering and lofty above the high spirits.\n\nThereupon, the Most High Jade Dawn Supreme Lord of the Great Dao fasted in the Upper Palace, swore a covenant to the Purple Gold Heaven, and received it from the Nine Mysteries. He gathered the Yellow Flower from the Eastern Well, plucked the Sun Root at the Golden Gate, revolved the Two Effulgences to infuse the mysterious, absorbed the flying essence to illuminate his countenance. Drawing the Great Void as his term, he matched the Three Luminaries in longevity, his celestial title exalted in the Most High, his purple record compiled in the Jade Dawn. He governed the myriad offices in the Emperor’s Chart, presided over the Jade Thearch among the Upper Immortals, ingested the Eight Pure Essences from the sun and moon, recited the jade chapters to revolve his spirit, and awaited the numinous perfected ones for his own delight. The scripture remained untransmitted for ten thousand eons.\n\nThis Dao is the wondrous method of soaring through empty space and treading the void to transcend the Upper Perfected. It should be transmitted only to those with the bone-record of attainment, destined to become Perfected Ones.\n\nAmong the millions of aspiring immortals, not one has glimpsed its chapters. The Golden Portal of Heaven, the Azure Mansion of the Square Cauldron, and the Earthly Palaces all inscribe their registers in reverse before birth—only then may one receive the true scripture.\n\nThose who obtain it immediately become Upper Perfected Ones and the patriarchs of the ten thousand immortals.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning transmitted the scripture to the Most High Jade Thearch, the Nine Heavenly Thearchs, and the Nine Heavenly Elders in the Empty Mystery, displaying it upon the Western Tortoise Mountain and mystically bestowing it upon the Queen Mother of the West. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao received it from the Nine Mysteries and transmitted it to the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang. The Golden Portal Thearch received it from the Northern Prime and transmitted it to the Prime Minister Lord Azure Lad. The Great Emperor transmitted it to the Four Poles Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Dao of the Mystic Antiquity is transmitted from qi to qi, from perfection to perfection.\n\nThe Prime Minister compiled and edited the numinous text, concealing it in the Great Existence Palace above the Nine Heavens, guarded by seven hundred Jade Lads and Jade Maidens. According to the statutes, after seven hundred years, a Perfected One may receive its transmission. The Four Offices, with the Five Thearchs’ divine soldiers—seven hundred in number—punish leaks and divulgence.\n\nThose who obtain this scripture and recklessly transmit it without following the statutes will have their seven ancestors held accountable, and their own bodies will perish in the Nine Springs.\n\nThe essence of the sun is red, round in form yet square in its luminous trace. Its qi waxes and wanes, its revolutions subtly diminish. Always, on the third, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—five times monthly—atop the Golden Gate, refine the Eight Rays of the Sun’s Soul and Radiant Essence with the Golden Essence, Stone Luminous Water, and the Mother of Mushroom Flowers.\"\n\nOn this day, the sun’s radiance scatters, its flying roots pour forth in torrents, and golden essence overflows, moistening all under heaven. Those who seek immortality must, on this day, gather and ingest the sun’s root. The numinous descends to the Jade Portal, essence fills the hidden passes, the body generates wondrous light, and one’s years become equal to the sun’s. Following this Way in secret, one ascends to the Golden Gate. The Golden Gate lies within the Western Pass of Heaven, the portal through which sun and moon commune with the numinous. The Thearch is named *Red Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother*—the Scripture of the Jade Womb.\n\nThe moon’s light is yellow, its qi square in essence yet round in form, revolving and waxing, its cycles complete yet ever-declining. Always on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, pass above the Eastern Well, bathe in the numinous radiance, refine and adorn the essence’s brilliance, and make resplendent the imperial splendor. On this day, yang essence scatters, yellow qi coils within, imperial splendor overflows, and all under heaven receives the true. Those who seek immortality must, on this day, gather the yellow radiance above the Eastern Well, ingest the yang essence from the sun’s soul, and let it flow through the nine apertures, while the spirit guards the five palaces of the viscera. Cultivating this Way, one ascends to the Moon’s Court. The Moon’s Soul resides within the Eastern Well, the portal through which sun and moon share their radiance. The Thearch is named *Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, Concealed Moon*—the Scripture of the Jade Embryo.\n\nFor the Way of gathering the sun’s radiance and flying roots, one day prior, purify the body, burn incense, draw nine *dou* of well-flower water, and expose it in the central courtyard. Inscribe the *Ninefold-Refined Stone Radiance, Water Mother, Jade Talisman* and place it in the water. Face west, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly intone the prayer:\n\n*\"Yang brightness refines essence,\nLight illumines the Purple Court,\nEight rays shine resplendent,\nSoul-mushrooms overflow.\nFive revolutions, three transformations,\nQi connects with the Great Numinous.\nFragrance flows in winding streams,\nShading and moistening the living.\nAdorned with the Golden Gate’s sash,\nFlying roots glow fresh.\nIngesting Stone Radiance,\nWater Mother irrigates essence.\nFollowing heaven’s revolutions,\nAccord with the sun’s splendor.\nNine apertures receive the true,\nLiberating the original form.\"*\n\nAfterward, leave the water exposed in the courtyard overnight. At noon the next day, take one *sheng* of the dew-water, face the sun, and ingest it. Knock the teeth twenty-four times, look up to the sun, and pray:\n\n*\"Yang essence now flows,\nFlying radiance renewed.\nImperial mushrooms overflow,\nShade coils within.\nGazing upward, I feast on dark moisture,\nFragrant splendor arrives.\nPalaces and chambers open wide,\nWashing away dust and clamor.\nThe body reflects jade’s light,\nThe face emits golden truth.\nClouds soar on feathered steps,\nAscending to the Sun’s Gate.\"*\n\nAfterward, face upward and draw in the sun’s essence forty-five times. Bathe the entire body with the remaining water, then return to the chamber. Face west, knock the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored streaming clouds descending to encircle the body. Within the five-colored clouds, a purple qi, large as an eye’s pupil, appears in layers of dozens of circles, gleaming amid the five hues. Together with the five qi, it descends and enters the adept’s mouth. Draw in the qi forty-five times, then swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:\n\n*\"Sun’s soul scatters light,\nFive colors pour in torrents.\nRefining the soul at the Golden Gate,\nThe round radiance towers.\nNuminous brilliance spills forth,\nReceiving brightness from the Celestial River.\nJade mushrooms overflow,\nOrchid moisture fragrant and sweet.\nI drink the imperial spring,\nNurse the flying radiance.\nPlucking roots, swallowing fruit,\nLifespan matches the numinous tree.\nForm clings to the great radiance,\nBody soars on flying clouds.\nFor a thousand ages, ten thousand kalpas,\nLet it never falter or err.\"*\n\nAfterward, bow nine times toward the Sun’s Gate. This is the Way of gathering the sun’s root, flying radiance, and the Great Yang’s essence—a wondrous and ancient Dao. Practicing it for one year, the face gains jade’s luster, and the body emits golden light. After seven years, the numinous descends, and one flies to the Sun’s Gate, where the Sun Youth speaks with the adept. Without one’s name inscribed in the Thearch’s register, written in green characters in the Azure Palace, one may not behold its chapters. To recklessly divulge this numinous text is to hold one’s nine ancestors accountable, while one’s own body suffers transgressions, enduring the Three Calamities, Five Sufferings, and ten thousand kalpas of irredeemable torment.\n\nThe *Ninefold-Refined Stone Radiance, Water Mother, Jade Talisman* is to be written in cinnabar on blue-green paper and placed in the water. On the day of practice, write it entirely in cinnabar on blue-green paper, face west, and ingest one talisman. In practicing this Way, avoid defilement and the five pungent vegetables, ensuring the five viscera remain pure and fragrant to receive the true numinous. If the sky is overcast and the sun absent, perform the practice indoors.\n\nFor the Way of gathering the moon’s imperial radiance, on the day the moon passes the Eastern Well, at dawn draw one jar of well-flower water and expose it in the central courtyard. At midnight, inscribe the *Yang Essence, Jade Embryo, Refined Immortal Talisman* and place it in the water. Face east, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and pray over the water:\n\n*\"Yellow qi, yin radiance,\nYang essence gleams bright.\nBathing the nine souls,\nAdorned with the Golden Dawn’s sash.\nRound brightness reveals,\nJade embryo refines immortals.\nRadiance intertwines,\nFragrance washes the ford.\nNine yangs transform as one,\nDark clouds scatter mist.\nPrimal radiance returns the numinous,\nWinding light reflects my form.\nAscending to the Upper Palace,\nGazing upon the jade pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, take one *sheng* of the water, face the moon, and ingest it. Clench the fists, visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence descending to crown and encircle the body. Within the five colors, a moon’s yellow qi, large as an eye’s pupil, appears in layers of dozens, amid the moon’s five-colored essence, and enters the Grotto Chamber through the mouth, encircling the five viscera. Face the moon and swallow its essence fifty times, then swallow saliva ten times. Knock the teeth ten times and softly intone:\n\n*\"Yellow qi flows essence,\nThreefold harmony congeals light.\nDark radiance returns to rectitude,\nAdorned with eight rays.\nRefining the soul at the Eastern Well,\nReceiving brightness from the flying emperor.\nGolden radiance scatters the numinous,\nFive lords stream fragrance.\nThe Lady descends with sweet wine,\nMoistening the ten directions.\nMighty mushrooms pour down,\nSix palaces brim full.\nGolden essence ninefold transforms,\nChanging scenes, altering countenance.\nRiding emptiness, descending mist,\nRoaming the Great Void.\nAscending to the Moon’s Court,\nPaired with the true in dual radiance.\nTransforming through the eight paths,\nExiting existence, entering non-being.\nTwo dawns share brilliance,\nEternally preserved without end.\"*\n\nWhen finished, rinse with the remaining water. After bathing, return to the chamber and face east to ingest the Yang Essence Jade Womb Refinement Immortal Talisman. Then knock the teeth twelve times and softly intone:\n\n*\"The hidden heavens embrace radiance,\nYellow qi thickly disperses.\nEssence congeals, luminous splendor,\nEight rays gleam resplendent.\nLustrous adornments of yellow blossoms,\nStone reflections wash and irrigate.\nJade mushrooms overflow,\nMoistening and filling the celestial vastness.\nAll under heaven receives refinement,\nDawn breaks at the morning’s first light.\nMounting the radiance, ascending the void,\nAttaining the ascent to the imperial palace.\nThe Eternal Fire descends to the world,\nTranscending the eight perils,\nSharing brilliance with the moon,\nEqual in rank with the moon.\"*\n\nWhen done, swallow qi fifty times and stop.\n\nThis is the Way of Ingesting Moonlight, the wondrous method of the Primordial Beginning. Practicing it for one year, the face will bear the luster of jade. After seven years, the numinous descends, and the body emits golden light. After nine years, one will fly and ascend to the moon’s realm, where the Moon Lad and the Five Lords, along with the Lady, will roam together with you. Without one’s name inscribed on the imperial register of the Upper Clarity, one may not partake in these mysteries. Those who practice this method may attain transcendence as an immortal. Revealing this sacred text lightly will bring seven generations of ancestors to account, and one’s own body will be consigned to the ghostly officials, forever sealed in the earthly prisons, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Yang Essence Jade Womb Refinement Immortal Talisman is written in yellow on white paper and placed in water. On the day of practice, all is written in yellow, and one faces east to ingest one talisman. If the sky is overcast and the moon is absent, practice may still be performed indoors. Missing a single day of practice will nullify a hundred days of prior effort.\n\nFor all scholars of the highest arts who gather the flying blossoms of the sun and moon: at evening repose, knock the teeth thirty-six times, clench the fists, close the eyes in darkness, and visualize the purple radiance of the sun above the left eye and the yellow qi of the moon above the right eye, shimmering and flickering, illuminating the realm of the head and face. Softly intone:\n\n*\"Dual radiance flows essence,\nLight reflects my form.\nFlying blossoms, imperial mushrooms,\nSweet fragrance fills and abounds.\nAbove, it crowns the Muddy Pellet,\nBelow, it spreads through the Yellow Court.\nThe Three Lights merge,\nThe Two Qi intertwine.\nEternally preserve the Crimson Palace,\nReverse aging and renew life,\nLive as long as the sun and moon,\nEqual in age to ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nWhen finished, practicing this consistently for one year will cause the Director of Destinies in the sun and the Five Stars in the moon to descend with the radiance of true numinosity and the blossoms of the flying emperor, bestowing them upon your body. Your face will take on a golden countenance, and your head will emit purple light. After nine years of unwavering practice, you will fly through the Great Void.\n\nThis most wondrous Way must not be transmitted to the unworthy.\n\nFor those cultivating the highest Way of ingesting the imperial blossoms of the sun and moon, on the days of the Grand Year’s ruling star, one’s life star, and the eight solar terms, write the Eight Pure Jade Talismans of the Two Radiant Essences of the Sun and Moon on bamboo membrane, facing the proper direction for each term, and ingest them at dawn. These talismans emerge from the Nine Orifices, shining upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Dark Garden, and beneath the Accumulated Stones. The Queen Mother received them from the Nine Mysteries to draw in the essence of the flying blossoms of the Two Radiant Essences.\n\nThus, the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity, the Upper Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, and the Perfected of Grand Void all practiced this Way, ascending to the rank of Highest Primordial Emperor, inscribed on the Purple Tablets of Jade Clarity, and attaining the numinous perfection of Grand Truth. This method is most wondrous and must not be transmitted to the lower world. Those who obtain it will fly through the mysterious void, ascend to the Gate of the Sun, and roam the Court of the Moon, their lifespan equal to the Two Radiant Essences, enduring as long as qi itself. Revealing this sacred text lightly will bring seven generations of ancestors to account, and one’s own body will bear the guilt, forever sealed among the ghostly officials.\n\nThe bamboo membrane is hollow and empty, connecting above to the qi of the Eight Pure Mysterious Radiance. The light of the Two Radiant Essences of the sun and moon flows and reflects upon it, thus the flying essence shines upon the bamboo membrane.\n\nPerforming the rites of the Feminine Unity Jade Seal, the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates of Practice, the Twelve Upper Aspirations, and the offering of qi to the numinous realm in the Way of seeking immortality—without these talismans, the numinous will not descend, qi will not alight, the Way will recede into the distance, and transcendence will never be attained.\n\nThe Yang Essence Flying Radiance Talisman: On the day of the Grand Year, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face the Grand Year, and ingest it. After three years, the stomach duct will become luminous, filled with true radiance, the numinous will descend to the Jade Chamber, and the face will daily emit sunlight. After seven years, one will fly and ascend to the Gate of the Sun.\n\nThe Yin Essence Flying Radiance Jade Talisman: On the day of the Grand Year, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face the Grand Year, and ingest it. After three years, flowing light will shine downward, illuminating the six viscera, the five organs will become luminous, and the face will bear jade light. After nine years, one will fly and ascend to the Court of the Moon.\n\nThe Flying Blossom Sun Radiance Jade Womb Numinous Talisman: On the day of one’s life star, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face one’s life star, and ingest it. After three years, flowing essence and purple light will illuminate the body, and the face will take on a golden countenance. After nine years, one will fly through the Great Void and ascend to the Gate of the Sun.\n\nThe Imperial Blossom Stone Radiance Inner Transformation Numinous Talisman: On the day of one’s life star, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face one’s life star, and ingest it. After three years, a halo of light will appear around the neck, illuminating a league in all directions. After nine years, one will converse with the Lady of the Moon, fly through the Great Void, and ascend to the Court of the Moon.\n\nThe Eight Pure Flying Essence Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face the true northeast, and ingest it. After one year, the nine orifices will become luminous. After three years, the divine blossoms will shine within. After nine years, one will unite with the Perfected in numinosity and fly to the Upper Clarity. It is also called the Celestial Luminaries of the Seven Primes.\n\nThe Seven Pure Flying Essence Spirit-Transforming Inner Talisman: On the day of the Spring Equinox, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face the true east, and ingest it. After one year, the spirits within the five organs will transform into Perfected Ones. After seven years, they will manifest and serve as your envoys. After nine years, inner and outer will be luminously interconnected, allowing you to see within yourself, to sit in death and stand in disappearance, and to fly as an immortal. It is also called the Jade Script of the Nine Phoenixes.\n\nThe Six Pure Flying Essence Numinous Communion Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Summer, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face the true southeast at dawn, and ingest it. After one year, the Lad of the Sun will manifest. After three years, you will converse with him in spirit and form. After nine years, the Perfected of the Nine Orifices will bestow upon you the true scriptures, allowing you to transform in the eight directions, to sit in death and stand in disappearance, and to fly to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Nine Heavens Dragon-Tiger Chapter.\n\nFivefold Pure Flying Essence Cavern-Heaven Numinous Talisman: On the day of the Summer Solstice, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face due south at dawn, and ingest it. After one year, you will see clearly for ten *li*. After three years, you will naturally know the transformations of spirit. After nine years, you will gaze through the Nine Heavens, pay homage to the Nine Heavenly Kings, converse with the numinous, and fly through the Nine Heavens. Also called the Nine Numinous Jade Script.\n\nFourfold Pure Flying Essence Jade Womb of Immortal Embryo Golden Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face the southwest at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, blood and marrow will congeal and transform, and the nine orifices will receive the true. After seven years, your form will change, and your countenance will gleam like golden light. After nine years, you will descend to the Flying Clouds, ride the void, and ascend to the Gate of the Sun. Also called the Golden Light Jade Perfection.\n\nThreefold Pure Flying Essence Summoning Immortal Upper Talisman: On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face due west at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, the immortal officials of the Five Marchmounts will arrive, and the perfected forms of the upper adepts will appear. Middle adepts will see them as misty and indistinct, now present, now gone. Lower adepts will perceive them in dreams. You will converse with the immortals. After nine years, the immortal officials will send cloud chariots to welcome you, and you will ascend to the Moon’s Court. Also called the Comprehensive Record of the Primordial Heaven.\n\nTwofold Pure Flying Essence Nine Orifices Stone Radiance Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Winter, write in black on bamboo membrane, face the northwest at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, you will be able to read in darkness, your eyes will be luminous and spiritually attuned, and you will see and converse with spirits. After nine years, the mysterious radiance of the sun and moon will arise within your five viscera, your entire body will shine with light, you will ride the void and fly, and your lifespan will equal that of the sun. Also called the Mysterious Radiance Spontaneous Golden Numinosity.\n\nOnefold Pure Flying Essence Yellow Qi Ascending Heaven Numinous Talisman: On the day of the Winter Solstice, write in black on bamboo membrane, face due north at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, you will understand the speech of the people of the Nine Heavens. After nine years, you will share a chariot with the Eight Purities, roam the Great Empyrean, and feast in the radiance of the Jade Dawn. Also called the Threefold Radiance Mysterious Essence Golden Splendor.\n\nThe above Eightfold Pure Flying Essence Twofold Radiance Jade Scripts are born within the Cavernous Void, luminous atop Tortoise Mountain’s peak, above the Dark Garden, and in the shade of the Accumulated Stones. They are the origin of the ten thousand *qi*, governing all the hidden scripts of the heavens, sun, and moon, and are concealed above the Nine Heavens, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who obtain these numinous scripts will share the lifespan of the sun and moon, transform and roam at will, emerge from being and enter non-being, their necks radiating purple light, their faces emitting golden countenances. The ten thousand spirits will bow in reverence, and the officials of the Ten Heavens will welcome them. After nine years of cultivation, they will ascend to the Great Void, ascend to the Golden Gates, and wander and feast in the chambers of the sun and moon. To lightly divulge these treasured scripts will bring retribution upon seven generations of ancestors, and one’s own body will be destroyed, suffering the three calamities and five agonies, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Practitioners, be cautious.\n\nFor all who practice this Dao, on the appointed day, write the talisman, face the proper direction, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the twofold radiance of the sun and moon above your own eyes. Above them are purple and yellow *qi*, swirling like smoke, crowning and enveloping your entire body. Then draw in the light of the sun and moon, and the purple and yellow *qi*, swallowing fifty times, and swallowing saliva ten times to conclude.\n\nSoftly recite the incantation:\nThe Eight Numinous revolve the mysterious net,\nThe Twofold Radiance returns to the Great Void.\nThe Three Dawns share the numinous brilliance,\nThe Seven Essences blaze with eightfold rays.\nRefined and transformed above the Golden Gate,\nBathed in the Eastern Well.\nFlowing splendor veils the cavern wilds,\nStone radiance scatters in the Upper Palace.\nEssence sprinkles beyond the Nine Heavens,\nVast mushrooms irrigate the ten directions.\nI look up to feast on the Eightfold Pure *qi*,\nRiding the heavens to gather the Flying Sovereign.\nSpirits descend, the six viscera flourish,\nReturned form gleams with golden countenance.\nLong preserve the root of the sun and moon,\nFor ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nConclude, then ingest the talisman. In practicing this Dao, avoid defilement. If this prohibition is violated, take a grain of true cinnabar, cast it into water, and bathe yourself before proceeding.\n\nThis is the secret Dao of the Upper Perfected. If divulged, the Dao departs; if kept hidden, the Dao abides. Those who study and cultivate must keep it secret to attain the rank of Upper Clarity immortal.\n\nFor all who study and obtain this method: if you can maintain a long fast and endure hardship, you will ascend to the mysterious by counting the days. If you possess this scripture but fail to diligently cultivate, think of the true, and contemplate the numinous—no different from the vulgar—you will not lose the hidden existence of a lower immortal, achieving corpse-liberation in broad daylight. When your life passes to the Great Yin beneath the earth, you may leave your bones to transform in the Southern Palace, for you must have a record in the bone register to obtain this scripture and ultimately become a divine immortal.\n\nThe Most High Great Dao Jade Dawn Lord received the Ninefold Mystery Great Void Numinous Script, the method of the Sun and Moon’s Imperial Splendor, the Twelve Upper Vows of the Thearch Lord, and the *qi* of the Eight Gates’ ritual petitions of the Mysterious Mother. He reported to the Luminous Dawn of the Nine Heavens, invoking the *qi* to summon the spirits. This is the *qi* of the moon’s splendor and the sun’s radiance, reflected in the Eastern Well. Those who practice this Dao will naturally receive the descent of the Eightfold Pure *qi*, and the flying roots of the sun and moon may certainly be gathered. The Twelve Upper Vows will be fulfilled, and the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother will swiftly lead to the rank of immortal. Without this method, one will harm the spirit through futile effort and gain nothing in the pursuit of immortality.\n\nIf you wish to transmit this, receive the master’s oral instructions. This Dao is subtle and wondrous, not practiced in the world. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Azure Palace before their birth, their names inscribed in the Eastern Flower, and they are destined to become Perfected of the Upper Clarity.\n\nRegularly, on the ninth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the seventh day of the third month, the sixth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth day of the sixth month, the third day of the seventh month, the second day of the eighth month, the first day of the ninth month, the tenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month—twelve days in a year—bathe, purify, and fast. At midnight, in a secluded chamber, ensure all is quiet and undisturbed, with no sound of people or dogs. Then arrange the eight positions. Place an eight-foot-four-inch purple-woven mat, with white cogon grass as a mat beneath. At each position, set three trays of incense, cakes, jujubes, and fruit, with one incense burner before each position. For eight positions, there are eight incense burners.\n\nInscribe eight bamboo slips and place them at the eight directions to invoke the officials of the Nine Heavens’ Luminous Morn.\n\nThe first slip reads: *\"Nine Heavens’ Primordial Jade Purity, Purple Dao of the Void Sovereign, Supreme Dao Lord, riding a single-scene chariot of eightfold primordial purple clouds, turning the canopy of the Luminous Morn, descending to attend the rites of Wang Jia. May Jia be granted to dwell eternally with the Mysterious Mother amidst the qi of life, reverently partaking of the eightfold primordial flying essence and the root of the sun and moon’s imperial radiance. By the twelve supreme vows, may he swiftly attain flight as an immortal and wander the Jade Purity.\"*\n\nWrite this in green ink on a bamboo slip and place it at the northwest position.\n\nThe second slip reads: *\"Nine Heavens’ Primordial Jade Purity, Winged Sun of the Void Sovereign, Supreme Dao Lord, riding a two-scene chariot of sevenfold primordial crimson clouds, turning the canopy of the Luminous Morn, descending to attend the rites of Wang Jia. May Jia be granted to abide with the Mysterious Mother between the sun and moon, reverently partaking of the sevenfold primordial flying essence and the root of the sun and moon’s imperial radiance.

Invoke the Fivefold Primordial Subtle Black Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the four-scene chariot of fivefold primordial blue-green clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nThen, facing southeast, bow twice, kneel, and read the fifth slip to completion. Invoke the Fourfold Primordial Subtle Supreme Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the five-scene chariot of fourfold primordial yellow clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nNext, facing due south, bow twice, kneel, and read the sixth slip to completion. Invoke the Threefold Primordial Subtle Central Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the six-scene chariot of threefold primordial green clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nNext, facing southwest, bow twice, kneel, and read the seventh slip to completion. Invoke the Twofold Primordial Proclaiming Subtle Lower Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the seven-scene chariot of twofold primordial purple clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nNext, facing due west, bow twice, kneel, and read the eighth slip to completion. Invoke the Onefold Primordial Cavern-Subtle True Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the human-scene chariot of onefold primordial numinous clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nHaving invoked all Eight Emperors, turn again to face north, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize: within the chamber, eightfold primordial clouds arise, dense and billowing, filling the room and encircling your body. Then, knock your teeth together thirty-six times, and raise your head to draw in the cloud-qi, swallowing twenty-four times before ceasing.\n\nRecite the prayer:\nOn this auspicious day and propitious hour,\nThe eightfold Dao’s qi is limpid and clear.\nSubtle dawn rides the revolving cycles,\nStreaming rosy clouds illumine the Purple Court.\nPrimordial scenes gleam through the Great Void,\nReining swift chariots of green.\nFlying roots refine the eight directions,\nAugust blossoms refine the soul’s essence.\nThe two images spout wondrous nectar,\nFlowing fragrance irrigates the Great Obscurity.\nThe Dark Mother binds the highest vow,\nEight slips present cinnabar sincerity.\nThe ritual feast summons the gods to partake,\nGazing upward to the eightfold primordial clouds.\nThe numinous descends ere the day’s end,\nSwiftly the mysterious light pours forth.\nWith this vow, ascend the Jade Palace,\nCompose the ode in the Eastern Flower Court.\nBestow the eight-scene chariot,\nPrimordial numina gird the flying carriage.\nRefine your thoughts to perceive the mysterious resonance,\nMay this vow not harm my life.\n\nWhen finished, face north and bow nine times to conclude.\n\nFor the remainder of the ritual, one must not recklessly share its offerings with outsiders. Perform this rite twelve times a year for three years, after which no further practice is required.\n\nThis Dao is most secret and not circulated in the world. Though one may study all scriptures, prepare talismans, and swallow qi, without offering this ritual to the Luminous Morn, the perfected will not descend, thoughts will not ascend in resonance, and all toil and devotion will waste one’s spirit and dissipate one’s qi, yielding no benefit in the pursuit of immortality.\n\nThose who obtain this method and perform the ritual for three years as prescribed will move the Nine Heavens to joy and delight the Eight Primordials. The divine perfected will respond and descend, and after eight years, one will attain the ability to ride the chariot and ascend lightly into the vastness of the Great Void.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones’ ritual methods employed golden liquor and jade blossoms, but as these are no longer found in the world, rare fruits and exquisite delicacies may suffice to move the divine perfected.\n\nThe August Lord opened the path of goodness, wishing to enact the eight slips precisely to concentrate the divine perfected and hope for the descent of the numinous immortals. Even now, the immortals of the Five Peaks and the divine maidens of the Divine Continent still pour golden liquor and arrange jade blossoms, uttering great vows, presenting the eight slips, awaiting the Primordial Simplicity, revering the Three Origins, aspiring to the Luminous Morn, becoming Jade Perfected, liberating the seven ancestors, and entering the Broad Cold Palace—how much more should those of the world’s vulgar and base, the humble and defiled, not abandon this practice upon hearing of it?\n\nThough form and spirit may accumulate goodness through countless lives, if the seven generations bear unresolved transgressions, one will still have no hope of immortality. One must make great vows, present the eight slips, offer ritual fruits, hope for the descent of the gods, and release the roots of past karma, that the body may attain deathlessness and surely become one of the highest immortals.\n\nThose without predestined affinity for immortality, whose names are not carved in the Upper Palace, will never behold this text. Those who obtain the divine scripture will be granted twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the divine perfected. Should one violate the prohibition against leakage, the transgressor will be punished with wind-knives, the seven ancestors will bear the blame, carrying stones to build mountains, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Let practitioners be cautious.\n\nWhen cultivating the Dao of the Eight Primordials and practicing the method of the eight slips, always enter the chamber at dawn on the days of the Beginning of Spring and Beginning of Autumn, face north, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the Primordial Simplicity’s First Sovereign: her head crowned with the essence of the sun’s circular radiance and jeweled splendor, her body clad in cloud-light and cloud-patterned primordial silk. Then visualize the Primordial Simplicity’s Second Sovereign: her head crowned with the essence of the moon’s pearl-like radiance and nightly splendor, her body clad in purple-light cloud robes and primordial silk. The two Primordials together ride clouds of purple and green, flying chariots with jade wheels, twelve phoenixes following. From the Upper Palace, thirty-six Jade Maidens accompany them, circling above the Jade Purity as they journey toward the northeast.\n\nThen bow eight times, knock the head eight times, and beat the cheeks eight times, softly reciting the prayer:\nThe Two Numinous Ones of the Great Beginning,\nPrimordial qi lofty and luminous,\nCircling the jade chariot,\nOn this auspicious day journeying in purity,\nAbove, the divine light ascends,\nBelow, it illumines my form.\nConnect my nine origins,\nDescend to me the eight essences.\nThe four convergences interpenetrate,\nFive treasures give birth to clouds.\nMay I ride the one-scene chariot,\nAscend to the Jade Court,\nBow to the Primordial Simplicity,\nReceive the immortal’s primordial numina.\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow eight times.\n\nOn the days of the Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox, enter the chamber at the meal hour, face east, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the Primordial Obscurity’s First Sovereign: her head crowned with the essence of the azure radiance of the Year Star’s nine qi, her body clad in flying clouds and ninefold-transforming primordial silk. Then visualize the Primordial Obscurity’s Second Sovereign: her head crowned with the essence of the white radiance of the Grand White Star’s primordial splendor, her body clad in flowing-light flying clouds and primordial robes. The two Primordials together ride clouds of dark and yellow, flying chariots with feathered canopies, twenty-four phoenixes following. From the Primordial Numinous Palace, thirty-six Jade Maidens accompany them, circling within the Jade Void as they journey toward the southeast.\n\nThen bow four times, knock the head four times, and beat the cheeks four times, softly reciting the prayer:\nThe Two Scenes of the Primordial Obscurity,\nLofty and revered primordial divinities,\nTransforming qi and dispersing numina,\nSoaring through the Golden Gate.\nThe Purple Void wields the reins,\nFive numina flank the chariot,\nCircling the Flower Court,\nIlluminating the nine clouds through the void.\nOn this auspicious day,\nThe Celestial Origin unfolds its array,\nMyriad blessings converge,\nMy vow arises naturally.\nFrom the Highest, the flowing descends,\nEternally preserving my primordial truth.\nRiding the scene, flying through space,\nAscending into the Jade Morn,\nBowing to the Highest Obscurity,\nReceiving the transformation of the highest immortals.\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow the eight qi to conclude.\n\nOn the days of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) and *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), enter the chamber at noon, face the southeast, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the Purple Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the radiant essence of the Cinnabar Origin and the Eight Luminous Stars, clad in a sash of dark and yellow nine-colored plain silk. Visualize the Yellow Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the quintessential essence of the Dark Morn and the Morning Star, clad in a sash of flying-cloud seamless plain brocade. The two Primordial Sovereigns together ride clouds of purple and azure, their jade wheels and chariots framed by nine dragons, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of the Upper Palace. They circle above the Purple Void, journeying eastward. Then bow twice, knock the head twice, and beat the cheeks twice, softly reciting the prayer:\n\nPurple and Yellow Void Numinous,\nTwo Primordial Sovereigns of lofty perfection,\nRiding the void and descending with the scene,\nWhistling the wind and summoning the mist,\nWandering the Jade Clarity,\nGazing through the Purple Heavens,\nPrimal blessings in supreme auspiciousness,\nHigh sages unfurl their array,\nFlowing essence by the billions,\nPurifying streams by the thousands,\nBelow embracing the boundless,\nAbove pervading the Nine Mysteries,\nBestow upon me the Eight Scenes,\nTo ascend in flight without hindrance,\nTo shine with the sun’s radiance,\nTo endure with the moon’s years.\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow the eight qi to conclude.\n\nOn the days of *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) and *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), enter the chamber at dusk, face west, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the White Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the threefold luminous essence of the Yellow Origin and the Quelling Star, clad in a robe of yellow-green cloud-patterned radiance. Visualize the Flying Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the flowing light of the Seven Luminaries and the Purple Origin, clad in a seven-colored cloud-silk plain gown. The two Primordial Sovereigns together ride clouds of azure rainbow, their flying jade canopies and purple parasols drawn by twelve winged unicorns, attended by thirty-two jade maidens of the Great Flower. They circle above the Cavern Clarity, journeying southwest. Then bow six times, knock the head six times, and beat the cheeks six times, reciting the prayer:\n\nFlying Scenes and Eight Primordials,\nWhite Origin knits its essence,\nPrimal qi conjoins in blessing,\nMerging with the Highest Clarity,\nFlowing clouds of two hues,\nIlluminating the numinous court of the heavens,\nThe Jade Emperor turns the reins,\nFraming the Purple Jade,\nCircling the Cinnabar Chamber,\nEight qi shining through the void,\nRevolving through the Celestial Origin,\nGazing upon my form,\nConveying me in the cloud-wheel,\nDescending to me the flying chariot,\nThat I may join the Eight Primordials,\nEqual in scene with the true numina.\n\nWhen finished, swallow the qi eight times to conclude.\n\nThis is the Dao of the Eight Primordials’ true journey and feast of scenes, the way of assembly in the Cloud Capital above. The lofty numinous names are transmitted orally, mouth to mouth. Without the golden script of green characters, or one’s name inscribed in the Mysterious Chart, one may not partake in its hearing. Those who practice this method will have the Eight Primordials attend their chamber. After eight years, the eight palaces will naturally become luminous, and one may ride the void and ascend the clouds, roaming the Highest Clarity.\n\nWhenever transmitting the *True Scripture of the Eight Primordials*, master and disciple must fast together for a hundred days—or thirty days at least—presenting eight taels of refined gold, thirty feet each of five-colored silk, and a set of ritual robes, to pledge the covenant of the Nine Heavens’ oath-bound spirits. To receive the inner names of the Eight Primordials, present twenty-two feet of silk inscribed with characters, to swear the oath before the Treasure Perfected. Without this offering, one may not recklessly reveal the names of the Eight Primordials. To lightly divulge the lofty numina is to condemn nine generations to retribution. Both transmitter and receiver will suffer the trials of the wind-blade, the true scenes will ascend on high, and one’s efforts in study will be in vain, with no descent to one’s form. Transmit and receive with clarity and caution, as in the covenant of the Four Poles.\n\nHere ends the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Scripture of the Eight Primordials: The Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiance of the Sun and Moon*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences: Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiant Flower of the Sun and Moon**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences: Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiant Flower of the Sun and Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. Originally part of *The Oral Instructions on the Supreme Cavern-Real Perfection Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences*, later separated into an independent text. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\n---\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang received the transmission of this scripture from the Four Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, who consulted the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Queen Mother addressed the Great Emperor, saying:\n\n\"In the era of the Supreme August, those who studied and beheld the treasure scriptures, ascending to the Jade Purity Heaven, all achieved this through the secret cultivation of the precious Dao and the concealment of its numinous mysteries—unspoken by mouth, unmanifest in form, silently resonating with the utmost stillness to attain the Perfected Ones above. Thus, the Dao values concealment and stillness, transforming without form, emerging without sound.\n\nSince I received the true scripture from the Nine Void-Heavens, countless eons have passed, yet it has been transmitted to fewer than three. By the end of the Central August Prime, it was inscribed in the nation of Luona within the Northern Prime Heaven, upon the Lingjing Mountain of the Bird of Renown in the Jialai Grotto, within the Numinous Palace. There, the qi of the Nine Mysteries and the Orthodox Unity congealed into characters.\n\nLater, the Sage Lord of the Nine Mysteries and Golden Portal beheld the numinous text and commanded the Immortal Capital to transcribe it with a covenant sworn to Heaven. Through cultivation, he attained the Dao and ascended to the Golden Portal. The Most High, deeming me reckless in divulging celestial treasures, stripped me of my true primordial title and demoted me to a wandering spirit-official. Only after five hundred years was I restored to my original perfection.\n\nThus, the Primordial Beginning established the Four Offices and the Five Thearchs’ palaces, deploying divine soldiers precisely to inspect leaks and punish with the Wind Blade. How could one not be cautious?\n\nLater disciples flourished like a forest, yet not one attained immortality. Why? All suffered from revealing the scriptural texts, scattering the celestial perfected ones. The Dao ceased to descend, and heavenly punishments silently manifested. Advancing or retreating, they lost their resolve, perishing alone in empty mountains—laboring in vain, their regret beyond words.\n\nThe Dao does not reveal itself without diligence, nor does it flourish without secrecy. Those who behold the true scriptures must cultivate in secret to seek the numinous. The divine and the perfected respond readily, and ascension to immortality may be calculated by days.\n\nConsider the Four Poles Perfected Ones: they mastered myriad precepts, treasured the Dao, and concealed its mysteries. Firmly grasping the numinous charts, their spirit and will stood resolute. Their names were inscribed in the Upper Clarity, their characters recorded in the Emperor’s Register. They ascended to the Four Poles—what doubt remains in receiving this transmission?\n\nThereupon, the Great Emperor transmitted *The Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences* in accordance with the covenant.\n\nThe Lord of the Western City now seals one copy within the Emei Mountains, in the secluded chamber.\n\nThe mysterious text of *The Scripture of the Eight Pure Essences* was born within the Great Void, manifesting upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mystic Garden, in the shade of the Accumulated Stones, within the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber. The Eight Pure Essences’ lofty and mysterious feathered chapters, their numinous texts dense as cavern peaks, their purple characters gleaming like a forest of jade, their divine radiance flowing through the Nine Primes, their golden tones resonating in the Purple Heaven, crimson auroras veiling the Jade Chamber, soaring mists surging in the congealed perfection—purple phoenixes flapping their wings, numinous winds wafting incense, fragrant qi streaming, penetrating the subtle to enter the mysterious. To the left, the spontaneous Golden Lads revolve; to the right, the Supreme Void Immortals are summoned. Divine consorts attend, the Great Flower holds the towel, Jade Lads assist in rank, the Four Offices approach the hall, the Two Effulgences pause their brilliance, the Three Dawns return their essence. Flying immortals gallop in turn, streaming luminosities encamp like clouds, radiant flowers intermingle, the Three Candles merge their light. The majesty of the text blazes, qi spreads through the Purple Court. The assembled perfected ones feast and offer rites, celebrating the Upper Clarity. This is the supreme of numinous texts, its virtue towering and lofty above the high spirits.\n\nThereupon, the Most High Jade Dawn Supreme Lord of the Great Dao fasted in the Upper Palace, swore a covenant to the Purple Gold Heaven, and received it from the Nine Mysteries. He gathered the Yellow Flower from the Eastern Well, plucked the Sun Root at the Golden Gate, revolved the Two Effulgences to infuse the mysterious, absorbed the flying essence to illuminate his countenance. Drawing the Great Void as his term, he matched the Three Luminaries in longevity, his celestial title exalted in the Most High, his purple record compiled in the Jade Dawn. He governed the myriad offices in the Emperor’s Chart, presided over the Jade Thearch among the Upper Immortals, ingested the Eight Pure Essences from the sun and moon, recited the jade chapters to revolve his spirit, and awaited the numinous perfected ones for his own delight. The scripture remained untransmitted for ten thousand eons.\n\nThis Dao is the wondrous method of soaring through empty space and treading the void to transcend the Upper Perfected. It should be transmitted only to those with the bone-record of attainment, destined to become Perfected Ones.\n\nAmong the millions of aspiring immortals, not one has glimpsed its chapters. The Golden Portal of Heaven, the Azure Mansion of the Square Cauldron, and the Earthly Palaces all inscribe their registers in reverse before birth—only then may one receive the true scripture.\n\nThose who obtain it immediately become Upper Perfected Ones and the patriarchs of the ten thousand immortals.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning transmitted the scripture to the Most High Jade Thearch, the Nine Heavenly Thearchs, and the Nine Heavenly Elders in the Empty Mystery, displaying it upon the Western Tortoise Mountain and mystically bestowing it upon the Queen Mother of the West. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao received it from the Nine Mysteries and transmitted it to the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang. The Golden Portal Thearch received it from the Northern Prime and transmitted it to the Prime Minister Lord Azure Lad. The Great Emperor transmitted it to the Four Poles Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Dao of the Mystic Antiquity is transmitted from qi to qi, from perfection to perfection.\n\nThe Prime Minister compiled and edited the numinous text, concealing it in the Great Existence Palace above the Nine Heavens, guarded by seven hundred Jade Lads and Jade Maidens. According to the statutes, after seven hundred years, a Perfected One may receive its transmission. The Four Offices, with the Five Thearchs’ divine soldiers—seven hundred in number—punish leaks and divulgence.\n\nThose who obtain this scripture and recklessly transmit it without following the statutes will have their seven ancestors held accountable, and their own bodies will perish in the Nine Springs.\n\nThe essence of the sun is red, round in form yet square in its luminous trace. Its qi waxes and wanes, its revolutions subtly diminish. Always, on the third, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—five times monthly—atop the Golden Gate, refine the Eight Rays of the Sun’s Soul and Radiant Essence with the Golden Essence, Stone Luminous Water, and the Mother of Mushroom Flowers.\"",

      "translated_text": "On this day, the sun’s radiance scatters, its flying roots pour forth in torrents, and golden essence overflows, moistening all under heaven. Those who seek immortality must, on this day, gather and ingest the sun’s root. The numinous descends to the Jade Portal, essence fills the hidden passes, the body generates wondrous light, and one’s years become equal to the sun’s. Following this Way in secret, one ascends to the Golden Gate. The Golden Gate lies within the Western Pass of Heaven, the portal through which sun and moon commune with the numinous. The Thearch is named *Red Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother*—the Scripture of the Jade Womb.\n\nThe moon’s light is yellow, its qi square in essence yet round in form, revolving and waxing, its cycles complete yet ever-declining. Always on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, pass above the Eastern Well, bathe in the numinous radiance, refine and adorn the essence’s brilliance, and make resplendent the imperial splendor. On this day, yang essence scatters, yellow qi coils within, imperial splendor overflows, and all under heaven receives the true. Those who seek immortality must, on this day, gather the yellow radiance above the Eastern Well, ingest the yang essence from the sun’s soul, and let it flow through the nine apertures, while the spirit guards the five palaces of the viscera. Cultivating this Way, one ascends to the Moon’s Court. The Moon’s Soul resides within the Eastern Well, the portal through which sun and moon share their radiance. The Thearch is named *Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, Concealed Moon*—the Scripture of the Jade Embryo.\n\nFor the Way of gathering the sun’s radiance and flying roots, one day prior, purify the body, burn incense, draw nine *dou* of well-flower water, and expose it in the central courtyard. Inscribe the *Ninefold-Refined Stone Radiance, Water Mother, Jade Talisman* and place it in the water. Face west, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly intone the prayer:\n\n*\"Yang brightness refines essence,\nLight illumines the Purple Court,\nEight rays shine resplendent,\nSoul-mushrooms overflow.\nFive revolutions, three transformations,\nQi connects with the Great Numinous.\nFragrance flows in winding streams,\nShading and moistening the living.\nAdorned with the Golden Gate’s sash,\nFlying roots glow fresh.\nIngesting Stone Radiance,\nWater Mother irrigates essence.\nFollowing heaven’s revolutions,\nAccord with the sun’s splendor.\nNine apertures receive the true,\nLiberating the original form.\"*\n\nAfterward, leave the water exposed in the courtyard overnight. At noon the next day, take one *sheng* of the dew-water, face the sun, and ingest it. Knock the teeth twenty-four times, look up to the sun, and pray:\n\n*\"Yang essence now flows,\nFlying radiance renewed.\nImperial mushrooms overflow,\nShade coils within.\nGazing upward, I feast on dark moisture,\nFragrant splendor arrives.\nPalaces and chambers open wide,\nWashing away dust and clamor.\nThe body reflects jade’s light,\nThe face emits golden truth.\nClouds soar on feathered steps,\nAscending to the Sun’s Gate.\"*\n\nAfterward, face upward and draw in the sun’s essence forty-five times. Bathe the entire body with the remaining water, then return to the chamber. Face west, knock the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored streaming clouds descending to encircle the body. Within the five-colored clouds, a purple qi, large as an eye’s pupil, appears in layers of dozens of circles, gleaming amid the five hues. Together with the five qi, it descends and enters the adept’s mouth. Draw in the qi forty-five times, then swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:\n\n*\"Sun’s soul scatters light,\nFive colors pour in torrents.\nRefining the soul at the Golden Gate,\nThe round radiance towers.\nNuminous brilliance spills forth,\nReceiving brightness from the Celestial River.\nJade mushrooms overflow,\nOrchid moisture fragrant and sweet.\nI drink the imperial spring,\nNurse the flying radiance.\nPlucking roots, swallowing fruit,\nLifespan matches the numinous tree.\nForm clings to the great radiance,\nBody soars on flying clouds.\nFor a thousand ages, ten thousand kalpas,\nLet it never falter or err.\"*\n\nAfterward, bow nine times toward the Sun’s Gate. This is the Way of gathering the sun’s root, flying radiance, and the Great Yang’s essence—a wondrous and ancient Dao. Practicing it for one year, the face gains jade’s luster, and the body emits golden light. After seven years, the numinous descends, and one flies to the Sun’s Gate, where the Sun Youth speaks with the adept. Without one’s name inscribed in the Thearch’s register, written in green characters in the Azure Palace, one may not behold its chapters. To recklessly divulge this numinous text is to hold one’s nine ancestors accountable, while one’s own body suffers transgressions, enduring the Three Calamities, Five Sufferings, and ten thousand kalpas of irredeemable torment.\n\nThe *Ninefold-Refined Stone Radiance, Water Mother, Jade Talisman* is to be written in cinnabar on blue-green paper and placed in the water. On the day of practice, write it entirely in cinnabar on blue-green paper, face west, and ingest one talisman. In practicing this Way, avoid defilement and the five pungent vegetables, ensuring the five viscera remain pure and fragrant to receive the true numinous. If the sky is overcast and the sun absent, perform the practice indoors.\n\nFor the Way of gathering the moon’s imperial radiance, on the day the moon passes the Eastern Well, at dawn draw one jar of well-flower water and expose it in the central courtyard. At midnight, inscribe the *Yang Essence, Jade Embryo, Refined Immortal Talisman* and place it in the water. Face east, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and pray over the water:\n\n*\"Yellow qi, yin radiance,\nYang essence gleams bright.\nBathing the nine souls,\nAdorned with the Golden Dawn’s sash.\nRound brightness reveals,\nJade embryo refines immortals.\nRadiance intertwines,\nFragrance washes the ford.\nNine yangs transform as one,\nDark clouds scatter mist.\nPrimal radiance returns the numinous,\nWinding light reflects my form.\nAscending to the Upper Palace,\nGazing upon the jade pavilion.\"*\n\nAfterward, take one *sheng* of the water, face the moon, and ingest it. Clench the fists, visualize the moon’s five-colored streaming essence descending to crown and encircle the body. Within the five colors, a moon’s yellow qi, large as an eye’s pupil, appears in layers of dozens, amid the moon’s five-colored essence, and enters the Grotto Chamber through the mouth, encircling the five viscera. Face the moon and swallow its essence fifty times, then swallow saliva ten times. Knock the teeth ten times and softly intone:\n\n*\"Yellow qi flows essence,\nThreefold harmony congeals light.\nDark radiance returns to rectitude,\nAdorned with eight rays.\nRefining the soul at the Eastern Well,\nReceiving brightness from the flying emperor.\nGolden radiance scatters the numinous,\nFive lords stream fragrance.\nThe Lady descends with sweet wine,\nMoistening the ten directions.\nMighty mushrooms pour down,\nSix palaces brim full.\nGolden essence ninefold transforms,\nChanging scenes, altering countenance.\nRiding emptiness, descending mist,\nRoaming the Great Void.\nAscending to the Moon’s Court,\nPaired with the true in dual radiance.\nTransforming through the eight paths,\nExiting existence, entering non-being.\nTwo dawns share brilliance,\nEternally preserved without end.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ancestors held accountable, and their own bodies will perish in the Nine Springs.\n\nThe essence of the sun is red, round in form yet square in its luminous trace. Its qi waxes and wanes, its revolutions subtly diminish. Always, on the third, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—five times monthly—atop the Golden Gate, refine the Eight Rays of the Sun’s Soul and Radiant Essence with the Golden Essence, Stone Luminous Water, and the Mother of Mushroom Flowers.\"",

      "translated_text": "When finished, rinse with the remaining water. After bathing, return to the chamber and face east to ingest the Yang Essence Jade Womb Refinement Immortal Talisman. Then knock the teeth twelve times and softly intone:\n\n*\"The hidden heavens embrace radiance,\nYellow qi thickly disperses.\nEssence congeals, luminous splendor,\nEight rays gleam resplendent.\nLustrous adornments of yellow blossoms,\nStone reflections wash and irrigate.\nJade mushrooms overflow,\nMoistening and filling the celestial vastness.\nAll under heaven receives refinement,\nDawn breaks at the morning’s first light.\nMounting the radiance, ascending the void,\nAttaining the ascent to the imperial palace.\nThe Eternal Fire descends to the world,\nTranscending the eight perils,\nSharing brilliance with the moon,\nEqual in rank with the moon.\"*\n\nWhen done, swallow qi fifty times and stop.\n\nThis is the Way of Ingesting Moonlight, the wondrous method of the Primordial Beginning. Practicing it for one year, the face will bear the luster of jade. After seven years, the numinous descends, and the body emits golden light. After nine years, one will fly and ascend to the moon’s realm, where the Moon Lad and the Five Lords, along with the Lady, will roam together with you. Without one’s name inscribed on the imperial register of the Upper Clarity, one may not partake in these mysteries. Those who practice this method may attain transcendence as an immortal. Revealing this sacred text lightly will bring seven generations of ancestors to account, and one’s own body will be consigned to the ghostly officials, forever sealed in the earthly prisons, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Yang Essence Jade Womb Refinement Immortal Talisman is written in yellow on white paper and placed in water. On the day of practice, all is written in yellow, and one faces east to ingest one talisman. If the sky is overcast and the moon is absent, practice may still be performed indoors. Missing a single day of practice will nullify a hundred days of prior effort.\n\nFor all scholars of the highest arts who gather the flying blossoms of the sun and moon: at evening repose, knock the teeth thirty-six times, clench the fists, close the eyes in darkness, and visualize the purple radiance of the sun above the left eye and the yellow qi of the moon above the right eye, shimmering and flickering, illuminating the realm of the head and face. Softly intone:\n\n*\"Dual radiance flows essence,\nLight reflects my form.\nFlying blossoms, imperial mushrooms,\nSweet fragrance fills and abounds.\nAbove, it crowns the Muddy Pellet,\nBelow, it spreads through the Yellow Court.\nThe Three Lights merge,\nThe Two Qi intertwine.\nEternally preserve the Crimson Palace,\nReverse aging and renew life,\nLive as long as the sun and moon,\nEqual in age to ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nWhen finished, practicing this consistently for one year will cause the Director of Destinies in the sun and the Five Stars in the moon to descend with the radiance of true numinosity and the blossoms of the flying emperor, bestowing them upon your body. Your face will take on a golden countenance, and your head will emit purple light. After nine years of unwavering practice, you will fly through the Great Void.\n\nThis most wondrous Way must not be transmitted to the unworthy.\n\nFor those cultivating the highest Way of ingesting the imperial blossoms of the sun and moon, on the days of the Grand Year’s ruling star, one’s life star, and the eight solar terms, write the Eight Pure Jade Talismans of the Two Radiant Essences of the Sun and Moon on bamboo membrane, facing the proper direction for each term, and ingest them at dawn. These talismans emerge from the Nine Orifices, shining upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Dark Garden, and beneath the Accumulated Stones. The Queen Mother received them from the Nine Mysteries to draw in the essence of the flying blossoms of the Two Radiant Essences.\n\nThus, the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity, the Upper Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, and the Perfected of Grand Void all practiced this Way, ascending to the rank of Highest Primordial Emperor, inscribed on the Purple Tablets of Jade Clarity, and attaining the numinous perfection of Grand Truth. This method is most wondrous and must not be transmitted to the lower world. Those who obtain it will fly through the mysterious void, ascend to the Gate of the Sun, and roam the Court of the Moon, their lifespan equal to the Two Radiant Essences, enduring as long as qi itself. Revealing this sacred text lightly will bring seven generations of ancestors to account, and one’s own body will bear the guilt, forever sealed among the ghostly officials.\n\nThe bamboo membrane is hollow and empty, connecting above to the qi of the Eight Pure Mysterious Radiance. The light of the Two Radiant Essences of the sun and moon flows and reflects upon it, thus the flying essence shines upon the bamboo membrane.\n\nPerforming the rites of the Feminine Unity Jade Seal, the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates of Practice, the Twelve Upper Aspirations, and the offering of qi to the numinous realm in the Way of seeking immortality—without these talismans, the numinous will not descend, qi will not alight, the Way will recede into the distance, and transcendence will never be attained.\n\nThe Yang Essence Flying Radiance Talisman: On the day of the Grand Year, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face the Grand Year, and ingest it. After three years, the stomach duct will become luminous, filled with true radiance, the numinous will descend to the Jade Chamber, and the face will daily emit sunlight. After seven years, one will fly and ascend to the Gate of the Sun.\n\nThe Yin Essence Flying Radiance Jade Talisman: On the day of the Grand Year, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face the Grand Year, and ingest it. After three years, flowing light will shine downward, illuminating the six viscera, the five organs will become luminous, and the face will bear jade light. After nine years, one will fly and ascend to the Court of the Moon.\n\nThe Flying Blossom Sun Radiance Jade Womb Numinous Talisman: On the day of one’s life star, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face one’s life star, and ingest it. After three years, flowing essence and purple light will illuminate the body, and the face will take on a golden countenance. After nine years, one will fly through the Great Void and ascend to the Gate of the Sun.\n\nThe Imperial Blossom Stone Radiance Inner Transformation Numinous Talisman: On the day of one’s life star, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face one’s life star, and ingest it. After three years, a halo of light will appear around the neck, illuminating a league in all directions. After nine years, one will converse with the Lady of the Moon, fly through the Great Void, and ascend to the Court of the Moon.\n\nThe Eight Pure Flying Essence Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face the true northeast, and ingest it. After one year, the nine orifices will become luminous. After three years, the divine blossoms will shine within. After nine years, one will unite with the Perfected in numinosity and fly to the Upper Clarity. It is also called the Celestial Luminaries of the Seven Primes.\n\nThe Seven Pure Flying Essence Spirit-Transforming Inner Talisman: On the day of the Spring Equinox, write in blue-green on bamboo membrane, face the true east, and ingest it. After one year, the spirits within the five organs will transform into Perfected Ones. After seven years, they will manifest and serve as your envoys. After nine years, inner and outer will be luminously interconnected, allowing you to see within yourself, to sit in death and stand in disappearance, and to fly as an immortal. It is also called the Jade Script of the Nine Phoenixes.\n\nThe Six Pure Flying Essence Numinous Communion Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Summer, write in vermilion on bamboo membrane, face the true southeast at dawn, and ingest it. After one year, the Lad of the Sun will manifest. After three years, you will converse with him in spirit and form. After nine years, the Perfected of the Nine Orifices will bestow upon you the true scriptures, allowing you to transform in the eight directions, to sit in death and stand in disappearance, and to fly to the Upper Clarity.",

Also called the Nine Numinous Jade Script.\n\nFourfold Pure Flying Essence Jade Womb of Immortal Embryo Golden Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face the southwest at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, blood and marrow will congeal and transform, and the nine orifices will receive the true. After seven years, your form will change, and your countenance will gleam like golden light. After nine years, you will descend to the Flying Clouds, ride the void, and ascend to the Gate of the Sun. Also called the Golden Light Jade Perfection.\n\nThreefold Pure Flying Essence Summoning Immortal Upper Talisman: On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, write in yellow on bamboo membrane, face due west at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, the immortal officials of the Five Marchmounts will arrive, and the perfected forms of the upper adepts will appear. Middle adepts will see them as misty and indistinct, now present, now gone. Lower adepts will perceive them in dreams. You will converse with the immortals. After nine years, the immortal officials will send cloud chariots to welcome you, and you will ascend to the Moon’s Court. Also called the Comprehensive Record of the Primordial Heaven.\n\nTwofold Pure Flying Essence Nine Orifices Stone Radiance Jade Talisman: On the day of the Beginning of Winter, write in black on bamboo membrane, face the northwest at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, you will be able to read in darkness, your eyes will be luminous and spiritually attuned, and you will see and converse with spirits. After nine years, the mysterious radiance of the sun and moon will arise within your five viscera, your entire body will shine with light, you will ride the void and fly, and your lifespan will equal that of the sun. Also called the Mysterious Radiance Spontaneous Golden Numinosity.\n\nOnefold Pure Flying Essence Yellow Qi Ascending Heaven Numinous Talisman: On the day of the Winter Solstice, write in black on bamboo membrane, face due north at dawn, and ingest it. After three years, you will understand the speech of the people of the Nine Heavens. After nine years, you will share a chariot with the Eight Purities, roam the Great Empyrean, and feast in the radiance of the Jade Dawn. Also called the Threefold Radiance Mysterious Essence Golden Splendor.\n\nThe above Eightfold Pure Flying Essence Twofold Radiance Jade Scripts are born within the Cavernous Void, luminous atop Tortoise Mountain’s peak, above the Dark Garden, and in the shade of the Accumulated Stones. They are the origin of the ten thousand *qi*, governing all the hidden scripts of the heavens, sun, and moon, and are concealed above the Nine Heavens, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who obtain these numinous scripts will share the lifespan of the sun and moon, transform and roam at will, emerge from being and enter non-being, their necks radiating purple light, their faces emitting golden countenances. The ten thousand spirits will bow in reverence, and the officials of the Ten Heavens will welcome them. After nine years of cultivation, they will ascend to the Great Void, ascend to the Golden Gates, and wander and feast in the chambers of the sun and moon. To lightly divulge these treasured scripts will bring retribution upon seven generations of ancestors, and one’s own body will be destroyed, suffering the three calamities and five agonies, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Practitioners, be cautious.\n\nFor all who practice this Dao, on the appointed day, write the talisman, face the proper direction, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the twofold radiance of the sun and moon above your own eyes. Above them are purple and yellow *qi*, swirling like smoke, crowning and enveloping your entire body. Then draw in the light of the sun and moon, and the purple and yellow *qi*, swallowing fifty times, and swallowing saliva ten times to conclude.\n\nSoftly recite the incantation:\nThe Eight Numinous revolve the mysterious net,\nThe Twofold Radiance returns to the Great Void.\nThe Three Dawns share the numinous brilliance,\nThe Seven Essences blaze with eightfold rays.\nRefined and transformed above the Golden Gate,\nBathed in the Eastern Well.\nFlowing splendor veils the cavern wilds,\nStone radiance scatters in the Upper Palace.\nEssence sprinkles beyond the Nine Heavens,\nVast mushrooms irrigate the ten directions.\nI look up to feast on the Eightfold Pure *qi*,\nRiding the heavens to gather the Flying Sovereign.\nSpirits descend, the six viscera flourish,\nReturned form gleams with golden countenance.\nLong preserve the root of the sun and moon,\nFor ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nConclude, then ingest the talisman. In practicing this Dao, avoid defilement. If this prohibition is violated, take a grain of true cinnabar, cast it into water, and bathe yourself before proceeding.\n\nThis is the secret Dao of the Upper Perfected. If divulged, the Dao departs; if kept hidden, the Dao abides. Those who study and cultivate must keep it secret to attain the rank of Upper Clarity immortal.\n\nFor all who study and obtain this method: if you can maintain a long fast and endure hardship, you will ascend to the mysterious by counting the days. If you possess this scripture but fail to diligently cultivate, think of the true, and contemplate the numinous—no different from the vulgar—you will not lose the hidden existence of a lower immortal, achieving corpse-liberation in broad daylight. When your life passes to the Great Yin beneath the earth, you may leave your bones to transform in the Southern Palace, for you must have a record in the bone register to obtain this scripture and ultimately become a divine immortal.\n\nThe Most High Great Dao Jade Dawn Lord received the Ninefold Mystery Great Void Numinous Script, the method of the Sun and Moon’s Imperial Splendor, the Twelve Upper Vows of the Thearch Lord, and the *qi* of the Eight Gates’ ritual petitions of the Mysterious Mother. He reported to the Luminous Dawn of the Nine Heavens, invoking the *qi* to summon the spirits. This is the *qi* of the moon’s splendor and the sun’s radiance, reflected in the Eastern Well. Those who practice this Dao will naturally receive the descent of the Eightfold Pure *qi*, and the flying roots of the sun and moon may certainly be gathered. The Twelve Upper Vows will be fulfilled, and the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother will swiftly lead to the rank of immortal. Without this method, one will harm the spirit through futile effort and gain nothing in the pursuit of immortality.\n\nIf you wish to transmit this, receive the master’s oral instructions. This Dao is subtle and wondrous, not practiced in the world. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Azure Palace before their birth, their names inscribed in the Eastern Flower, and they are destined to become Perfected of the Upper Clarity.\n\nRegularly, on the ninth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the seventh day of the third month, the sixth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth day of the sixth month, the third day of the seventh month, the second day of the eighth month, the first day of the ninth month, the tenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month—twelve days in a year—bathe, purify, and fast. At midnight, in a secluded chamber, ensure all is quiet and undisturbed, with no sound of people or dogs. Then arrange the eight positions. Place an eight-foot-four-inch purple-woven mat, with white cogon grass as a mat beneath. At each position, set three trays of incense, cakes, jujubes, and fruit, with one incense burner before each position. For eight positions, there are eight incense burners.",

After nine years, the Perfected of the Nine Orifices will bestow upon you the true scriptures, allowing you to transform in the eight directions, to sit in death and stand in disappearance, and to fly to the Upper Clarity.",

      "translated_text": "Next, facing due south, bow twice, kneel, and read the sixth slip to completion. Invoke the Threefold Primordial Subtle Central Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the six-scene chariot of threefold primordial green clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nNext, facing southwest, bow twice, kneel, and read the seventh slip to completion. Invoke the Twofold Primordial Proclaiming Subtle Lower Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the seven-scene chariot of twofold primordial purple clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nNext, facing due west, bow twice, kneel, and read the eighth slip to completion. Invoke the Onefold Primordial Cavern-Subtle True Emperor of the Luminous Morn, beseeching his descent to the ritual position to bestow upon Jia the attainment of immortality, that he may ride the human-scene chariot of onefold primordial numinous clouds and ascend to the Jade Purity to pay homage to the Nine Heavens.\n\nHaving invoked all Eight Emperors, turn again to face north, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize: within the chamber, eightfold primordial clouds arise, dense and billowing, filling the room and encircling your body. Then, knock your teeth together thirty-six times, and raise your head to draw in the cloud-qi, swallowing twenty-four times before ceasing.\n\nRecite the prayer:\nOn this auspicious day and propitious hour,\nThe eightfold Dao’s qi is limpid and clear.\nSubtle dawn rides the revolving cycles,\nStreaming rosy clouds illumine the Purple Court.\nPrimordial scenes gleam through the Great Void,\nReining swift chariots of green.\nFlying roots refine the eight directions,\nAugust blossoms refine the soul’s essence.\nThe two images spout wondrous nectar,\nFlowing fragrance irrigates the Great Obscurity.\nThe Dark Mother binds the highest vow,\nEight slips present cinnabar sincerity.\nThe ritual feast summons the gods to partake,\nGazing upward to the eightfold primordial clouds.\nThe numinous descends ere the day’s end,\nSwiftly the mysterious light pours forth.\nWith this vow, ascend the Jade Palace,\nCompose the ode in the Eastern Flower Court.\nBestow the eight-scene chariot,\nPrimordial numina gird the flying carriage.\nRefine your thoughts to perceive the mysterious resonance,\nMay this vow not harm my life.\n\nWhen finished, face north and bow nine times to conclude.\n\nFor the remainder of the ritual, one must not recklessly share its offerings with outsiders. Perform this rite twelve times a year for three years, after which no further practice is required.\n\nThis Dao is most secret and not circulated in the world. Though one may study all scriptures, prepare talismans, and swallow qi, without offering this ritual to the Luminous Morn, the perfected will not descend, thoughts will not ascend in resonance, and all toil and devotion will waste one’s spirit and dissipate one’s qi, yielding no benefit in the pursuit of immortality.\n\nThose who obtain this method and perform the ritual for three years as prescribed will move the Nine Heavens to joy and delight the Eight Primordials. The divine perfected will respond and descend, and after eight years, one will attain the ability to ride the chariot and ascend lightly into the vastness of the Great Void.\n\nThe ancient perfected ones’ ritual methods employed golden liquor and jade blossoms, but as these are no longer found in the world, rare fruits and exquisite delicacies may suffice to move the divine perfected.\n\nThe August Lord opened the path of goodness, wishing to enact the eight slips precisely to concentrate the divine perfected and hope for the descent of the numinous immortals. Even now, the immortals of the Five Peaks and the divine maidens of the Divine Continent still pour golden liquor and arrange jade blossoms, uttering great vows, presenting the eight slips, awaiting the Primordial Simplicity, revering the Three Origins, aspiring to the Luminous Morn, becoming Jade Perfected, liberating the seven ancestors, and entering the Broad Cold Palace—how much more should those of the world’s vulgar and base, the humble and defiled, not abandon this practice upon hearing of it?\n\nThough form and spirit may accumulate goodness through countless lives, if the seven generations bear unresolved transgressions, one will still have no hope of immortality. One must make great vows, present the eight slips, offer ritual fruits, hope for the descent of the gods, and release the roots of past karma, that the body may attain deathlessness and surely become one of the highest immortals.\n\nThose without predestined affinity for immortality, whose names are not carved in the Upper Palace, will never behold this text. Those who obtain the divine scripture will be granted twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens to attend and guard the divine perfected. Should one violate the prohibition against leakage, the transgressor will be punished with wind-knives, the seven ancestors will bear the blame, carrying stones to build mountains, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Let practitioners be cautious.\n\nWhen cultivating the Dao of the Eight Primordials and practicing the method of the eight slips, always enter the chamber at dawn on the days of the Beginning of Spring and Beginning of Autumn, face north, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the Primordial Simplicity’s First Sovereign: her head crowned with the essence of the sun’s circular radiance and jeweled splendor, her body clad in cloud-light and cloud-patterned primordial silk.

Visualize the Purple Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the radiant essence of the Cinnabar Origin and the Eight Luminous Stars, clad in a sash of dark and yellow nine-colored plain silk. Visualize the Yellow Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the quintessential essence of the Dark Morn and the Morning Star, clad in a sash of flying-cloud seamless plain brocade. The two Primordial Sovereigns together ride clouds of purple and azure, their jade wheels and chariots framed by nine dragons, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of the Upper Palace. They circle above the Purple Void, journeying eastward. Then bow twice, knock the head twice, and beat the cheeks twice, softly reciting the prayer:\n\nPurple and Yellow Void Numinous,\nTwo Primordial Sovereigns of lofty perfection,\nRiding the void and descending with the scene,\nWhistling the wind and summoning the mist,\nWandering the Jade Clarity,\nGazing through the Purple Heavens,\nPrimal blessings in supreme auspiciousness,\nHigh sages unfurl their array,\nFlowing essence by the billions,\nPurifying streams by the thousands,\nBelow embracing the boundless,\nAbove pervading the Nine Mysteries,\nBestow upon me the Eight Scenes,\nTo ascend in flight without hindrance,\nTo shine with the sun’s radiance,\nTo endure with the moon’s years.\n\nWhen finished, raise the head and swallow the eight qi to conclude.\n\nOn the days of *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) and *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), enter the chamber at dusk, face west, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the White Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the threefold luminous essence of the Yellow Origin and the Quelling Star, clad in a robe of yellow-green cloud-patterned radiance. Visualize the Flying Primordial Sovereign, her head crowned with the flowing light of the Seven Luminaries and the Purple Origin, clad in a seven-colored cloud-silk plain gown. The two Primordial Sovereigns together ride clouds of azure rainbow, their flying jade canopies and purple parasols drawn by twelve winged unicorns, attended by thirty-two jade maidens of the Great Flower. They circle above the Cavern Clarity, journeying southwest. Then bow six times, knock the head six times, and beat the cheeks six times, reciting the prayer:\n\nFlying Scenes and Eight Primordials,\nWhite Origin knits its essence,\nPrimal qi conjoins in blessing,\nMerging with the Highest Clarity,\nFlowing clouds of two hues,\nIlluminating the numinous court of the heavens,\nThe Jade Emperor turns the reins,\nFraming the Purple Jade,\nCircling the Cinnabar Chamber,\nEight qi shining through the void,\nRevolving through the Celestial Origin,\nGazing upon my form,\nConveying me in the cloud-wheel,\nDescending to me the flying chariot,\nThat I may join the Eight Primordials,\nEqual in scene with the true numina.\n\nWhen finished, swallow the qi eight times to conclude.\n\nThis is the Dao of the Eight Primordials’ true journey and feast of scenes, the way of assembly in the Cloud Capital above. The lofty numinous names are transmitted orally, mouth to mouth. Without the golden script of green characters, or one’s name inscribed in the Mysterious Chart, one may not partake in its hearing. Those who practice this method will have the Eight Primordials attend their chamber. After eight years, the eight palaces will naturally become luminous, and one may ride the void and ascend the clouds, roaming the Highest Clarity.\n\nWhenever transmitting the *True Scripture of the Eight Primordials*, master and disciple must fast together for a hundred days—or thirty days at least—presenting eight taels of refined gold, thirty feet each of five-colored silk, and a set of ritual robes, to pledge the covenant of the Nine Heavens’ oath-bound spirits. To receive the inner names of the Eight Primordials, present twenty-two feet of silk inscribed with characters, to swear the oath before the Treasure Perfected. Without this offering, one may not recklessly reveal the names of the Eight Primordials. To lightly divulge the lofty numina is to condemn nine generations to retribution. Both transmitter and receiver will suffer the trials of the wind-blade, the true scenes will ascend on high, and one’s efforts in study will be in vain, with no descent to one’s form. Transmit and receive with clarity and caution, as in the covenant of the Four Poles.\n\nHere ends the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Scripture of the Eight Primordials: The Oral Instructions on Ingesting the Radiance of the Sun and Moon*.",
