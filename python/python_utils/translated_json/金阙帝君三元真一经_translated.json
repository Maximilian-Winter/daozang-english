It expounds the method of preserving the Three Primordial Oneness. One scroll. Source: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dòngzhēn* Section, *Methods* Category. Also found in *Yunjiji Qiqian*, Volume 50.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sutra of Jinque Emperor’s Three Primordial Oneness**\n*Transmitted by Qianzǐ to Qingtong Jun of the Eastern Sea*\n\nThe reason the True Person reveres *Oneness* as *True* is this:\nThe *Upper One* is the Heavenly Emperor of one’s own body,\nThe *Middle One* is the Vermilion Palace’s Danhuang Sovereign,\nThe *Lower One* is the Yellow Court’s Primordial King.\n\nTogether, they oversee the twenty-four *qi* within the body,\nto correspond with the twenty-four True Ones of *Taixi*.\n\nFor *qi* is the condensation of empty vapors into spirit.\n\nEach of the Three Primordial Lords commands ten thousand chariots and myriad cavalry,\nwith cloud-chariots and feathered canopies,\nconstantly entering the Purple Palace to ascend to *Shangqing*,\nregistering in the Primordial Diagram,\nranked as True Persons, soaring through the Nine Heavens.\n\nIf one preserves this with unwavering steadfastness,\nthen the Three Onenesses shall manifest.\n\nWhen the Three Onenesses manifest,\nthen the ten thousand chariots and myriad cavalry arrive.\nThe feathered canopies may be commanded,\nthe cloud-chariots may be ridden,\nascending to Heaven in broad daylight,\nto construct *Taixi*.\n\nWithin *Taixi* are the twenty-four *qi*,\nmingled and congealed in yellow chaos,\nabout to coalesce and transform—\nsometimes suddenly dividing into streams.\n\nWithin the *qi* are the twenty-four True Persons,\nall emanations of the Three Onenesses’ *qi*,\nthus achieving division and transformation.\n\nIf one preserves the Three Onenesses within the body,\nthen the Three Onenesses of *Taixi*—the Sovereign Lords—\ndescend and appear before you, speaking with you.\n\nWithin the body, there are also twenty-four True Persons,\nformed by the division and transformation of the body’s pure, luminous *qi*.\nIf the cloud-chariot comes to welcome you,\nascending to *Taixi*,\nthe twenty-four True Persons of *Taixi*\nshall all merge with the body’s spirits in the Yellow Chaos,\ntogether witnessing the division and ascent,\nharmonizing the virtue of inner and outer.\n\nThey enter and exit *Shangqing*,\nrest in *Taixi*,\nand must also traverse the *Dòngfáng* [Inner Chamber].\nWithin the *Dòngfáng* are rooms of golden gates, purple doors, and dark essence—\nthe abiding place of the Three Onenesses’ august Lords within the body.\nThose who traverse it shall see one spirit more swiftly.\n\nThe True Person of the *Dòngfáng* must preserve *Oneness* as the root,\nand those who preserve the True Person must regard the *Dòngfáng* as the canopy.\nThus, the Three Onenesses rely upon each other,\nthe *Dòngfáng* awaits in harmony—\nthough their dwellings differ,\ntheir attainment of the Dao is equally interdependent.\n\nIf one merely obtains one method\nand fixes the mind with unyielding resolve,\none may enter *Taiqing* alone,\nbecoming a *Taiqing* Xianwang,\nbut cannot roam *Taixi* or float to *Shangqing*.\n\nThe *Upper One* is the ultimate of True Emperors,\nthe *Middle One* is the supreme of True Sovereigns,\nthe *Lower One* is the marvel of True Kings.\n\nThe Heavenly Sovereign attains the ultimate,\nthus ascending to *Huangji* [Supreme Polarity];\nThe Earthly Sovereign attains the supreme,\nthus ascending to *Zhengyi* [Upright Oneness];\nThe Human Sovereign attains the marvel,\nthus ascending to *Zhongmiào* [Multifarious Wonders].\n\nThe Three Sovereigns embody the True and preserve Oneness,\nthus Oneness hides no form—\nits truth is ultimate.\n\nThe Three Onenesses are all illuminated;\nfrom Oneness, life is born—\nthus, all who study the Three Sovereigns’ teachings\nhold Oneness as supreme.\n\nPreserving True Oneness,\nthe mind is pure, the spirit condensed,\nthe essence profound, the perception divine—\nthus, no stray thoughts arise,\nand the essence-intent does not scatter.\n\nBut if, within three months, one gazes inward,\nfixing the mind on a single spirit,\nthe spirit’s light generates outside the body,\nand one plays with it—\nthis is the concentration of thought,\nthe unification of *qi* in harmony,\nthe utmost purity—\nand swift attainment.\n\nSince the dispersion of purity and the separation of the True,\nfalsehoods have gradually arisen,\ncompeting minds and chaos have generated—\nthus, Oneness does not manifest fully,\nand the spirit does not respond immediately.\n\nIt is not that one does not wish to dwell upon it;\nthose who preserve it are not focused,\nthose who ponder it are not discerning—\nthus, even after years of effort,\nonly a faint resemblance is achieved.\n\nIf one can practice *heart-fasting* and distance from the world,\nconcentrating the mind without distraction,\nthen within three months, one shall sense Oneness\nand behold it face-to-face.\n\nThe Three Primordials are the jade-like True Ones of the Nine Heavens,\nthe orthodox Dao of the Most High.\nThus, the Great Dao of *Zhengyi* emerges from the True Emperor,\nthe orthodox True Dao generates the Great Spirit,\nand the Three Primordials resolve transformation—\nthus, all True Ones return to Oneness,\nand the mysterious work is accomplished.\n\nThis is the origin of the orthodox Dao,\nthe primordial root of *yuanqi*.\n\nThe method of the Three Onenesses\nencompasses the Dao within the Three Primordials,\nsummarizing the numinous scriptures,\ngrasping the precious spirit-sutras.\n\nThe first key is *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,\nthe second key is *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,\nthe third key is *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.\n\nThus, the *Upper One* Emperor treasures *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,\nthe *Middle One* Danhuang Sovereign treasures *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,\nthe *Lower One* Primordial King treasures *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.\n\nThese three texts are the utmost essence of the True Dao,\nthe ultimate chapters of the Three Onenesses,\nand the forbidden keys of *Shangqing*.\n\nMysterious and nameless,\nits Dao is not distant.\n\nFrom preserving Oneness, the Three Onenesses manifest.\nSince you have seen Oneness,\nyou may seek this sutra\nand shall be secretly instructed in the method of preserving the Three Onenesses.\n\nThis is the first scripture of the True Writings of *Shangqing Jinque Emperor*,\nthe marvelous keys of all True Ones.\n\nIf you can preserve Oneness,\nOneness shall also preserve you;\nIf you can see Oneness,\nOneness shall also see you.\n\nIn all your comings and goings,\nin myriad affairs,\nalways remember Oneness.\n\nIn eating and drinking, remember Oneness;\nIn joy and sorrow, remember Oneness;\nIn grief and anger, remember Oneness;\nIn sickness and health, remember Oneness;\nIn peril and danger, remember Oneness;\nIn crossing fire and water, remember Oneness;\nIn riding chariots and horses, remember Oneness;\nIn haste, remember Oneness.\n\nWhen humans remember Oneness,\ntheir movements and gazes are countless—\nyet if their thoughts are concentrated,\nthe virtue is complete.\n\nAlas, most people lack steadfast resolve,\nand thus cannot endure.\nThey know the name of Oneness but cannot preserve it,\nand though they preserve it, their resolve is not firm—\nmany boast in their hearts\nyet cannot maintain their preservation.\n\nThus, when the Three Oneness departs, the **正气 (Zhengqi/True Vitality)** leaves.\nHe who loses the True Vitality falls prey to **邪气 (Xieqi/Perverse Qi)**,\nand when Perverse Qi enters, the day of death draws near.\n\nCommon folk who study the **Dao (Way)**, often seek vain superficiality,\nand do not believe that the True Oneness is most precious.\nThough they may initially have resolve,\nlater they must falter and fail—\nfor their resolve is not steadfast,\nand thus Perverse Qi invades.\n\nThe **戒 (precept)** of guarding Oneness lies in its lack of concentration;\nconcentration, though brief, cannot last long,\nand when it cannot endure with precision,\nthe Three Oneness departs.\nThe body becomes an empty dwelling without master—\nhow long can such calamity endure?\n\n**Qi** congeals into **精 (Jing/Essence)**;\nEssence coalesces into **神 (Shen/Spirit)**;\nSpirit transforms into the **婴儿 (Infant)**;\nthe Infant ascends to become the **真人 (Zhenren/True Person)**;\nthe True Person ascends to the **赤子 (Chizi/Red Boy)**—\nthis is the True Oneness.\n\nThe heavens possess the **三玄 (Three Mysteries)**, namely the sun, moon, and stars,\nand also hold **三精 (Three Essences)**, which are the means of longevity.\nHumans possess **三宝 (Three Treasures)**, the three **丹田 (Dantian/Elixir Fields)**,\nalso called the **三真 (Three Truths)**, which are the means of eternal existence.\n\nThe *灵宝经 (Lingbao Scripture)* states:\n*\"Heavenly Essence, Earthly Truth—\nthe Three Treasures endure eternally.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\nThe space between the two brows is the **上丹田 (Upper Elixir Field)**, called the **绛宫 (Xianggong/Crimson

palace,\nthe **真人 (True Person)** in the Crimson Palace of the Middle Elixir Field,\nand the **婴儿 (Infant)** in the Lower Elixir Field’s palace.\n\nAbove the space between the two brows,\nretreat

Mud Pellet Palace)**.\nTo retreat inward means to turn toward the back of the neck.\n\nThe **丹田泥丸宫 (Elixir Field’s Mud Pellet Palace)** is centered at one inch in each of the four directions,\nwhere **紫气 (Ziqí/Purple Vitality)** surges heavenward,\nilluminating the outer realm for **九万里 (90,000 li)**.\nIt covers the **北斗七星 (Big Dipper’s Seven Stars)** as a canopy,\nwith the **杓柄 (Ladle Handle)** pointing forward to the east.\n\nIts transformations—great and small—\nits shifting form and elusive presence—\nare sustained by the mind’s intent.\n\nThe **上元赤子 (Red Boy of the Upper Primordium)** resides within,\nbeneath the Dipper’s canopy.\nThe Red Boy’s taboo name is **玄凝天 (Xuanning Tian/Mysterious Congealed Heaven)**,\nhis given name is **三元先 (Sanyuan Xian/Three Primordial First)**,\nand his rank is **泥丸天帝君 (Nihuan Tian Dijun/Mud Pellet Heavenly Sovereign)**.\n\nTo his right stands a **帝卿 (Dijing/Imperial Minister)** in opposition,\nthe **精神 (Shenling/Spirit-Essence)** of teeth, tongue, and brain—\nascended and born from transformation.\nHis taboo name is **肇勒精 (Zhaole Jing/Originating Restraining Essence)**,\nhis given name is **仲玄生 (Zhongxuan Sheng/Middle Mysterious Birth)**,\nand he ascends to become the **帝卿君 (Dijing/Imperial Minister)**.\n\nThese two govern the Mud Pellet Palace together,\nboth wearing **赤绣衣 (Chixiuyi/Scarlet Embroidered Robes)**,\ntheir appearance like that of an infant just born.\nThe **天帝君 (Tian Dijun/Heavenly Sovereign)** holds the **上清神虎符 (Shangqing Shen Hufu/High Purity Spirit Tiger Talisman)**,\nwhile the Imperial Minister

times a day,\nand receive their duties from the Primordial King.\n\nThe method of guarding Oneness begins on the **立春 (Lichun/Start of Spring)** day,\nat the **夜半 (Yeban/Midnight)** hour.\nSit facing east, upright and still.\nBlow **气 (Qi)** nine times through the **九过 (Nine Passages)**,\nand swallow **津液 (Jinye/Body Fluids)** thirty-five times.\nWhen complete,\nfocus on the **北斗七星 (Big Dipper’s Seven Stars)**,\nas they descend slowly upon your head.\nTurn your gaze upward to the heavens,\nwith the **杓柄 (Ladle Handle)** pointing directly forward to the east.\n\nStore the **阴精 (Yin Jing/Yin Essence)** and **真人 (Zhenren/True Person)** stars,\nclose to the crown of your head.\nThe **阳明 (Yangming/Bright Yang)** and **玄冥 (Xuanming/Mysterious Darkness)** stars\nshould be stored above them.\n\nThe **阳明 (Yangming)** and **阴精 (Yin Jing)** stars are behind the others,\nwhile the **玄冥 (Xuanming)** and **真人 (Zhenren)** stars are in front.\nThus, the positions of storage and contemplation are fixed.\n\nAgain, focus on the **三一之尊君 (San Yi Zhenjun/Venerable Sovereign of the Three Oneness)**,\nand suddenly transformations arise.\nThe three appear together within the Dipper’s canopy,\nand in an instant,\nthe **三卿君 (San Qingjun/Three Ministers)** emerge like the **三尊 (San Zhen/Three Venerables)**.\nIn another instant,\nyou see all six ascend to **玄冥 (Xuanming/Mysterious

Primordium)** holds the **上卿 (Shangqing/Upper Minister)**,\nthe **中元 (Zhongyuan/Middle Primordium)** holds the **中卿 (Zhongqing/Middle Minister)**,\nand the **下元 (Xianyuan/Lower Primordium)** holds the **下卿 (Xiaqing/Lower Minister)**.\n\nI now swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Upper Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, ascending back to the **Nihuan Palace**.\n\nNext, I swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Middle Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, descending to hover within the **Jiangong Palace**.\n\nNext, I swallow my **qi** in one breath, and after a long while, the two of the **Lower Primordium** emerge from the **qi** and enter my mouth, descending to hover within the **Lower Elixir Field**.\n\nI then visualize the **Heavenly Pass Star**, positioning it seven *chi* away from my mouth, aligning it directly before me, as the **Three of Oneness** enter my **Three Palaces**.\n\nWhen complete, I focus and meditate on the **True One** in its proper place, sitting or lying down, keeping it ever in mind. Whatever desire arises, I let it unfold in my heart, and whatever I seek, I let it unfold in my heart as well.\n\nI focus my meditation, keeping it still and silent—like a quiet chamber at night, yet also possible to practice by day.\n\nAt the **Establishment of Summer**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing south as I did at the **Establishment of Spring** with precise meditation.\n\nAt the **Establishment of Autumn**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing west as I did at the **Establishment of Summer** with precise meditation.\n\nAt the **Establishment of Winter**, I focus on the **Three of Oneness**, facing north as I did at the **Establishment of Autumn** with precise meditation.\n\nI focus on the **Three of Oneness**, each in their proper station. When complete, I softly recite:\n\n*\"The Five Directions command the Dipper,\nThe spirits gather the Seven Stars,\nThe Three Venerables condense and transform,\nAscending to summon the Purple Court,\nThe Six Spirits wander,\nThe Three Palaces form the Elixir City,\nThe Emperor of Mysterious Passage descends,\nThe Yellow Tranquility of the Lower Cavern is pierced,\nThe Celestial True Ones guard and defend,\nSummoning the Six Ding,\nDivine Immortals ascend together,\nRiding the smoke to the Three Pure Ones,\nThe Four Limbs tempered and refined,\nThe Five Viscera self-generated.\"*\n\nThus concludes the **True One of the Three Primordia Scripture**. The **Golden Threshold Emperor’s Three Primordia True One Scripture** is complete.",

attainment.\n\nSince the dispersion of purity and the separation of the True,\nfalsehoods have gradually arisen,\ncompeting minds and chaos have generated—\nthus, Oneness does not manifest fully,\nand the spirit does not respond immediately.\n\nIt is not that one does not wish to dwell upon it;\nthose who preserve it are not focused,\nthose who ponder it are not discerning—\nthus, even after years of effort,\nonly a faint resemblance is achieved.\n\nIf one can practice *heart-fasting* and distance from the world,\nconcentrating the mind without distraction,\nthen within three months, one shall sense Oneness\nand behold it face-to-face.\n\nThe Three Primordials are the jade-like True Ones of the Nine Heavens,\nthe orthodox Dao of the Most High.\nThus, the Great Dao of *Zhengyi* emerges from the True Emperor,\nthe orthodox True Dao generates the Great Spirit,\nand the Three Primordials resolve transformation—\nthus, all True Ones return to Oneness,\nand the mysterious work is accomplished.\n\nThis is the origin of the orthodox Dao,\nthe primordial root of *yuanqi*.\n\nThe method of the Three Onenesses\nencompasses the Dao within the Three Primordials,\nsummarizing the numinous scriptures,\ngrasping the precious spirit-sutras.\n\nThe first key is *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,\nthe second key is *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,\nthe third key is *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.\n\nThus, the *Upper One* Emperor treasures *The Great Cavern True Sutra*,\nthe *Middle One* Danhuang Sovereign treasures *The Great Marvelous Sutra*,\nthe *Lower One* Primordial King treasures *The Most High Subtle Spirit*.\n\nThese three texts are the utmost essence of the True Dao,\nthe ultimate chapters of the Three Onenesses,\nand the forbidden keys of *Shangqing*.\n\nMysterious and nameless,\nits Dao is not distant.\n\nFrom preserving Oneness, the Three Onenesses manifest.\nSince you have seen Oneness,\nyou may seek this sutra\nand shall be secretly instructed in the method of preserving the Three Onenesses.\n\nThis is the first scripture of the True Writings of *Shangqing Jinque Emperor*,\nthe marvelous keys of all True Ones.\n\nIf you can preserve Oneness,\nOneness shall also preserve you;\nIf you can see Oneness,\nOneness shall also see you.\n\nIn all your comings and goings,\nin myriad affairs,\nalways remember Oneness.\n\nIn eating and drinking, remember Oneness;\nIn joy and sorrow, remember Oneness;\nIn grief and anger, remember Oneness;\nIn sickness and health, remember Oneness;\nIn peril and danger, remember Oneness;\nIn crossing fire and water, remember Oneness;\nIn riding chariots and horses, remember Oneness;\nIn haste, remember Oneness.\n\nWhen humans remember Oneness,\ntheir movements and gazes are countless—\nyet if their thoughts are concentrated,\nthe virtue is complete.\n\nAlas, most people lack steadfast resolve,\nand thus cannot endure.\nThey know the name of Oneness but cannot preserve it,\nand though they preserve it, their resolve is not firm—\nmany boast in their hearts\nyet cannot maintain their preservation.",
