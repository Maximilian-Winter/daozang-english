  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Anonymous commentary. Two fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Tai Xuan Section. Collated with the *Wenyuan Ge Siku Quanshu* edition of Yu Mei’s *Zhouyi Cantong Qi Fahui* (hereafter *Fahui* edition).\n\n### *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One\n**Anonymous Commentary**\n\n\"Zhou\" denotes the eternal Dao.\n\"Yi\" signifies transformation and change.\nThis refers to the great cyclical elixir: the firing process employs a full celestial revolution, hence the term *Zhou Yi*.\nMercury is the sun—south, the *Li* fire, belongs to *ji*, the essence of the Great Yang as the Azure Dragon.\nLead is the moon—north, the *Kan* water, belongs to *wu*, the essence of the Great Yin as the White Tiger.\nIt is also cinnabar as the sun and mercury as the moon, thus \"sun and moon\" form the character *yi*.\n\"Can\" means \"to blend,\" blending the three substances of water, earth, and metal.\n\"Tong\" means \"unity,\" as they become one family, like tallying tokens or a contract, binding into a single body—hence *Cantong Qi*.\nFormerly, the Perfected One titled it the *Dragon and Tiger Upper Scripture*.\nThe Dragon is mercury, another name for quicksilver;\nthe Tiger is the Metal Duke, also cinnabar.\nRed cinnabar is the Red Dragon; white mercury is the White Tiger.\nQuicksilver is liquid silver, hence called the White Tiger.\nLater, the Wei Lord renamed it the *Cantong Qi*, attributing it to the *Zhouyi*, for the *Yi* encompasses hardness and softness, outer and inner, ruler and minister, father and son, water and fire, the Five Phases—its divine elixir arises from nothing beyond yin and yang and the Five Phases, thus its attribution to the *Zhouyi*.\n\"Jing\" means constancy. As a constant transmission from the sages, it is called a *jing*.\n\nThus, Lingyangzi on Mount Kongtong transmitted it to Attendant Xu, who passed it to Master Chunyu. Master Chunyu, gazing upon the hexagrams, modeled the vessel after heaven and earth, pairing it with *Qian* and *Kun*;\nthe medicines after *Kan* and *Li*, pairing them with water and fire, thus as sun and moon;\nthe crucible after Venus, also as the Quelling Star;\nthe furnace as the city walls.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams determined the waxing and waning, the measures of yin and yang, the solstices and equinoxes, the inversion of the crucible—hence the chapter title *Five Correlations*, correlating and explicating the preceding text. Compiled into a later fascicle, together with the first three, to represent the Three Powers, the crucible and medicine, and to symbolize the Three Luminaries.\nThe first fascicle discusses the formation of gold and mercury, the ascent and descent of sun and moon;\nthe second fascicle discusses the augmentation of firing times and the ten-month gestation;\nthe third fascicle, composed by Master Chunyu, further explicates the first two, likely from the original transmission of the Wei Lord.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Yi*.\n*Qian* and *Kun* refer to the crucible.\n*Qian* is the upper cauldron; *Kun* is the lower cauldron.\nThe *Yi* symbolizes gold and mercury as sun and moon, as medicinal substances.\nThe *Firing Decision* states: *Qian* takes form in the northwest, borrowing yang to dwell in the yin position;\n*Kun* takes form in the southwest, borrowing yin to dwell in the yang position—thus *Qian* borrows yin, and *Kun* borrows yang.\n*Qian* borrowing yin means that in the fifth month, one yin line is born;\n*Kun* borrowing yang means that in the eleventh month, one yang line is born.\nThus *Qian* initiates the fire, and *Kun* proceeds until *Zhen* receives the tally, concluding at the fifteenth day;\nthereafter *Kun* initiates the fire, also concluding at the fifteenth day.\n*Qian* emerges, *Kun* enters—opening and closing the crucible—hence they are the gates, both meanings applicable.\n\nThe parents of all hexagrams.\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the sixty-four hexagrams; thus the great elixir cannot be nurtured without the crucible.\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: *Qian* is the father, *Kun* the mother;\n*Qian* is heaven, *Kun* earth.\nWithin the cosmos, nothing is not nurtured by *Qian* and *Kun*. All things grow through the yin and yang of heaven and earth—hence they are called parents.\n\n*Kan* and *Li* frame the enclosure.\nThis speaks of subduing mercury into the elixir, placing water above and fire below, or steeping the crucible in water to receive the qi of water and fire.\nThus the song says: \"Above, water becomes broth, flowing pearls guard the embankment.\"\nIt also refers to the medicinal substances: *Kan* is the Metal Duke, *Li* is vermilion mercury. Using these two treasures as the elixir, water and fire frame the upper and lower cauldrons.\n\"Kuang\" means to assist—both meanings are applicable.\n\nThe hub turns the axle; the enclosure is the vessel—male and female.\nThe hub is the vessel.\nThus *Qian* is yang, the female above;\n*Kun* is yin, the male below.\nThe crucible and cauldron refer to the firing process turning the vessel, like the sun and moon revolving within *Qian* and *Kun*, or like a wheel’s axle turning.\n\nThe four hexagrams serve as bolts and keys.\nThe four hexagrams are *Qian* and *Kun* symbolizing the vessel, *Kan* and *Li* symbolizing the medicine.\n\"Chong\" is the vessel; \"yue\" is the crucible.\nBolts and keys are installed on all four sides to secure it tightly.\nThus it says: the rope (*suo*) is the vessel; the key (*yue*) is the lock.\nLord Lao said: the rope is the *yao*; the key is the flute.\nThe hollow flute is blown, the *yao* breathes air into it, producing the tones of the pentatonic scale.\nThis means the crucible’s interior is hollow like a flute, using the *yao* fire’s qi to circulate it, like breath blowing a flute.\n\nCovering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang.\nYin and yang are the two medicines, gold and mercury.\n\"Mao\" means pressing within the crucible with gold flowers and the like.\n\"Fu\" means relying on the upper and lower veiling, called the secure boundary.\nThus *Qian* and *Kan* are yang; *Kun* and *Li* are yin.\nThus it says: the Dao of yin and yang, like the key circulating the *yao* fire’s qi, completes the elixir.\n\nLike a charioteer holding the bit and reins.\nThis means guarding the crucible, fearing loss.\nThe bit in the mouth must be tightly closed; the boundary must be firm like reins held in hand to circulate it—hence it does not cease.\n\nThere are the plumb line, the square, and the compass, following the wheel tracks.\nThe plumb line sets the boundary.\nIt accompanies the twelve hours in their turning, like the axle of a chariot.\nThe wheel tracks are the axle.\nThe level ensures the axle remains true, thus it turns along the tracks.\nThe inner governs the outer:\nThis means the crucible within the furnace is governed by the outer fire, and the medicine within the crucible is governed by the outer fire and water—hence it is said that the inner governs the outer.\nThe outer must have a secure boundary, then water and fire are harmonized to subdue and govern one another; the four principles are interconnected.\nThus it proceeds through the *liji* cycles.\n*Ji* means \"month.\"\nIf speaking of sixty years as one *ji*, it is called *li* in terms of months.\nSixty hexagrams form one *ji*; for daily and nightly fire circulation, one hexagram is used per day, completing one cycle of the elixir over eleven months.\nThe lunar nodes have five or six:\nFive or six refers to the thirty days that make a month.\nEach month, the crucible is opened once for observation, the medicine is washed and refined, then returned to the crucible to form the first great elixir of the vessel.\nThe warp and weft serve the sun’s command.\nThis means the fire circulation follows the sun’s decree: *jing* is holding fast, and the morning is chosen by the day.\nThe weft follows the five stars, meaning all is held in accordance with the constellations.\nThus the moon receives the sun’s transformation, giving birth to the myriad things.\nTherefore, one selects the *yuan* day for plowing and favor, the fire day for killing mercury, the completion day for pounding, the harvest day for refining, the closing day for sealing in the crucible, the establishing day for offering to the furnace, and the king or minister days for ingesting the medicine.\nIn the eleventh month, the fire is kindled on the *shangyuan* day, following the sequence of *jia* days.\nFor example, if the *shangyuan* falls on *jiazi* before or after the winter solstice, and *jiayi* is also observed, the fire is kindled at midnight.\nAdditionally, the sixty-four hexagrams are combined:\n\"Combined\" refers to the night.\nIt means that following the sequence of *jia* days, fifty days are counted, and over sixty days, sixty hexagrams are traversed—one hexagram per hour—along with the prior *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* hexagrams, completing the sixty-four.\nThis is the daily fire circulation, and a month also uses sixty-four hexagrams.\nTwo hexagrams are used per day, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nA day uses sixty-four hours, where an hour is defined as changing the talisman every five days, breaking it down into smaller units to total sixty hours.\nFirmness and softness have outer and inner:\n*Qian* is firm and *Kun* is soft, representing the movement of yin and yang.\nThe east is the outer, from *zi* ending at *si*; the west is the inner, from *wu* ending at *hai*.\nMoreover, yang is the outer above, while yin is the inner below.\nAgain, firmness is the outer vessel, and softness is the inner medicine.\nThese three principles are all interconnected.\nOn the new moon, *Zhun* governs the affairs:\nThis means each day has one governing affair and one governing talisman.\n*Zhen* is the talisman for the first day of the new moon, with *Kan* above and *Zhen* below.\n*Kan* is the mercury medicine, and *Zhen* is the crucible from *zi* to *wu*; the vessel faces upward, and *Zhun* governs the affairs.\n*Zhen* is the governing talisman, thus it governs the day’s affairs.\nThe same applies to a month.\nIn the eleventh month, the *Kan* hexagram governs.\n*Kan* has three lines: the upper and lower are yin, and the middle is yang.\nIn the eleventh month, the yang line is born amid abundant yin, externally governing the two yin lines to enter, while the yang line commands them to emerge.\nBy the fifth month, the *Li* hexagram governs.\n*Li* has three lines: the upper and lower are yang, and the middle is yin.\nA single yin line is born amid abundant yang, yin governs the *Zhun* of yang, yin emerges and yang enters—hence at dawn, *Zhun* is used.\nAt dusk, *Meng* is received.\nAt dusk, *Gen* above is the governing talisman, with *Kan* below, forming the *Meng* hexagram.\nFrom after *wu* to *zi*, the vessel is turned downward to form the *Meng* hexagram, governing the affairs—thus it is said that *Meng* is received.\nIn the twelve hours of day and night, six hours are *Gen-Meng*, and six hours are *Zhen-Zhun*—hence *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night.\nThus *Yi* is used as the crucible vessel, with *Gen* above and *Zhen* below, forming the *Shan Lei Yi* hexagram.\n*Kan* is used as the medicine, *Kan* being mercury within *Zhen* and *Gen*.\nEach day and night uses one hexagram:\nThis means that in the twelve hours of a day, *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night, two hexagrams are used.\nA month thus uses sixty hexagrams.\nTheir use follows an order:\nThis means that in a day, a month, or a year, all employ the sixty hexagrams.\nA month begins with *Zhun* followed by *Meng*, the second month with *Xu* followed by *Song*, and so on until the elixir is completed at *Jiji*—hence it is called an order.\nThe earlier discussion of *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night refers to the turning of the crucible vessel.\nThe later discussion of order refers to following the hexagrams and lines to determine the fire times.\nFrom *Ji* to *Wei*, until dawn and dusk.\n\nThe *Ji* is the *Jiji* hexagram, and the *Wei* is the *Weiji* hexagram. *Jiji* means water above fire: mercury belongs to *Kan*, originally yang yet dwelling in the yin position. Within yin there is yang, which symbolizes cinnabar as the essence of the Great Yang, residing in the south and belonging to *Li*. *Li* contains yin within yang, thus *Li* is yin, being yin dwelling in the yang position. Now, when it transforms so that mercury is in the north and cinnabar in the south, the position changes mercury into cinnabar, returning the north to the south and restoring its original place—hence it is called *Jiji*. *Weiji* means fire above water: originally, mercury has not yet settled into its proper position, for mercury is born from cinnabar, belongs to *Li*, and is now yin, dwelling in the north. As it has not yet returned to the south, to its original position and fundamental nature, it is called *Weiji*. Moreover, when circulating through the sixty hexagrams, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, these two hexagrams mark the transition from the end of the lunar month to the new moon, cycling anew. *Shuang* means brightness. These two hexagrams embody the Dao of one yin and one yang. When the end is reached, it returns to the beginning.\n\nThis means that when the *Jiji* and *Weiji* hexagrams conclude one month, the following month again begins with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. This pattern holds for all twelve months. Thus, in the eleventh month, the *Kun* and *Fu* hexagrams commence, and at the month’s end, the next month’s new moon also concludes with the *Fu* hexagram. The end of one month becomes the beginning of the next, and each month thereafter follows the same sequence.\n\nThe celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure of time: a day consists of twelve hours, completing a full cycle of 365 degrees. A day’s *chen* refers to the twelve branches. Two hexagrams are used, each with six lines, and each line governs one *chen*, so the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams with their lines suffice for the twelve hours.\n\nMovement and stillness have their early and late phases. The movement of the vessel is determined by reversing before and after midnight: yang movement is early, yin stillness is late. Spring and summer likewise pertain to yang movement, while autumn and winter pertain to yin stillness.\n\nSpring and summer correspond to the inner body. Spring and summer are yang, beginning with the eleventh month after the winter solstice, when the first month *Zi* is established. Moving leftward for four months, the yang qi reaches its culmination in the east, which is the inner aspect. This spans from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. The firing process begins at *Zi* and moves leftward, ending at *Chen* and *Si*, where the yang qi is exhausted and mercury dies.\n\nAutumn and winter correspond to the outer aspect. Autumn and winter are yin, beginning after the summer solstice in the fifth month and ending at *Hai*, where the yin qi dissipates. Yin arises at *Wu* and ends at *Hai*, thus its image lies in the outer. The west is the outer. This spans from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. The process begins at *Wu* and concludes at *Xu* and *Hai*, where the yin path is extinguished. Mercury seeks to subside, for *Hai* and *Zi* are the spirits of water, *Kun* is black, and *Hai* is its proper position. *Qian* is where mercury ultimately subsides, completing the twelve-month cycle at the *Qian* position. The interaction of yin and yang, beginning with *Qian* and ending with *Kun*, follows the natural principle—thus the Great Return Elixir is accomplished.\n\nRewards and punishments align with spring and autumn, while darkness and brightness follow cold and heat. Spring and summer, being yang and bright, employ the martial fire as reward. Autumn and winter, being yin and dark, employ the civil fire as punishment. Darkness refers to night, brightness to dawn. This applies to a year, a month, or a day: the firing process must accord with the cold and heat of the seasons. Cold corresponds to civil fire, heat to martial fire. After the summer solstice, charcoal is added to use martial fire; after the winter solstice, charcoal is reduced to use civil fire—thus following the cold and heat.\n\nThe line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, and joy or anger arise in accordance with the time. The firing process follows the hexagrams and their line statements, applying fire according to each line. Fire possesses benevolence and righteousness: benevolence is the civil fire of joy, righteousness the martial fire of anger. Moreover, spring and summer correspond to benevolence and civil fire, bringing joy; autumn and winter correspond to righteousness and martial fire, bringing anger. This is the use of civil and martial fire. When the principle is upheld, there is joy; when the line statements are violated, there is anger. Just as when a ruler gains a loyal minister, the people rejoice and wind and rain are harmonious; but when a ruler gains a treacherous minister, there is constant anger and the cosmos is unsettled. The Dao of the elixir is the same: the use of civil and martial fire must follow the principle.\n\nThus, the sequence of the four seasons’ qi is observed. Qi here refers to fire. When the fire qi of the four seasons is applied, the four sequences of qi are fulfilled. By following the five phases, the principle is attained. Aligning the qi and fire of the five phases ensures the principle is realized.\n\nIn the conjoining of the Great Elixir and Great Medicine, success or failure in subjugation and refinement lies with the fire. If the fire is balanced and civil and martial fires are properly applied, the medicine will be free of flaws. If the fire is not aligned, even a refined medicine will scatter and fly away. Therefore, diligent care must be devoted to the fire. Just as when a state is at peace, the people rejoice, but when a state is unstable, all things suffer—so it is with the elixir.\n\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. *Qian* is heaven, *Kun* is earth—these are the crucible vessel. The establishment of positions refers to the union of yin and yang. The *Yi* is the sun and moon, which are the medicine. The medicine resides within the crucible, within *Qian* and *Kun*. *Kan* is the moon, which is lead. *Li* is the sun, which is mercury. The character *yi* (易) is formed by placing the sun above and the moon below, symbolizing the sun and moon within the crucible—hence it is said that the *Yi* operates within them.\n\nHeaven and earth are *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* is heaven, the upper lid of the crucible. *Kun* is earth, the lower lid of the crucible. The establishment of positions refers to arranging the positions where yin and yang unite. This means the crucible’s rim is crafted with male and female interlocking, embodying the union of yin and yang. The establishment of positions refers to the furnace’s arrangement of directions, stellar positions, and degrees, circulating *Qian* and *Kun* to determine yin and yang. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nThe great elixir is spoken of as the essence of the sun and moon, hence the sun and moon are called *Yi*. *Kan* (the moon) is metal, *Li* (the sun) is mercury, thus *Kan* and *Li* are used as the medicine. *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the crucible, so these four trigrams differ from the sixty-four hexagrams and have their own singular function. It is also said that water and fire must attack above and below, circulating the crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*—hence their dual function. Mercury resides within the crucible, requiring the action of water and fire to subdue and refine it into the great returning elixir.\n\nThe two functions originate from the foundational lines and positions: *Kan* and *Li* are the medicine, *Qian* and *Kun* are the crucible. Their line positions differ from those of the sixty-four hexagrams, being the original lines and positions. They circulate through the six voids. This means the two medicines, *Kan* and *Li*, within the crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*, are constantly assailed by water and fire, revolving and flying through east, west, south, north, above, and below—hence the six voids. The six voids are the six positions. Their movement is ever uncertain, with no fixed ascent or descent. This describes mercury’s reversal within the crucible. In a single day of twelve hours, six hours ascend and six descend, with no constant rule. From *zi* to *wu* is descent; from *wu* to *hai* is ascent. When yang departs, yin arrives; when yin departs, yang arrives—endlessly reversing, hence there is no fixed ascent or descent. Mercury, concealed within the crucible, is assailed above by water and fire and pressed below by civil and martial fire, yet through this ceaseless transformation it becomes the great returning elixir.\n\nMercury lies hidden and submerged, for the Metal Elder conceals itself within mercury, and mercury, receiving the Metal Elder, is submerged. The two substances mutually subdue and conceal themselves within the crucible—hence their hidden submersion. The Dipper transforms within. The Dipper refers to the balance scale placed atop the furnace, resembling the Northern Dipper in the sky. The Dipper’s handle follows the monthly establishment, turning each day and each hour just as it does each month. For example, if the crucible is opened at the end of the previous month, the Dipper’s handle points to *zi*; the following month it points to *chou*, and so on in sequence. The timing must be determined by the water clock. The crucible’s fire is regulated likewise, for the crucible, like the Northern Dipper, possesses the power of transformation.\n\nIt envelops and nurtures the myriad things, serving as the guiding principle of the Dao. \"Envelop\" refers to gold flowers and the like embracing mercury, as a child meets its mother, dragon and tiger devouring one another—hence it is called the Dao. Earth, gold flowers, and other substances are also used as clay to envelop gold and mercury within the crucible. \"Nurtures\" means it contains the myriad things. Once the elixir is completed, it is named the Purple Gold Sand Great Returning Divine Elixir, transmuting all things, reviving withered bones, turning earth and stone into treasure, and those who ingest it attain perfection—thus it is the guiding principle of the Dao.\n\nTo use the primordial to control the existent, the function of *qi* is emptiness. Yang is the primordial, yin is the existent. The existent is *Kan*-metal, the primordial is *Li*-mercury. These are the positions of *Kan* and *Li*, water and fire. Emptiness is the Dao. The Dao is the designation of emptiness, void, and the primordial, which transforms and gives birth to the myriad things. The primordial refers to the yang form; when the human primordial is perceived, it is called the harmonious *qi*. The existent is yin, congealed and obstructed, called the harmonious dual *qi*. When these interact, wind and rain are formed. Thus mercury, though yang, reverts to metal. Metal is the true yang elixir. Yet mercury and gold are yin; when yang obtains yin, it is called using the primordial to control the existent. *Qi* is fire, also belonging to yang. When gold and mercury are subdued by fire, the fire becomes empty, and the primordial medicine becomes the existent—hence the function of *qi* is emptiness.\n\nThus, one infers the waxing and waning. Waxing and waning refer to the ascent and descent of yin and yang. When waning, charcoal is removed; when waxing, charcoal is added. When ascending, the vessel is turned upward; when descending, it is turned downward. *Kan* and *Li* vanish and perish. *Kan* is metal, *Li* is mercury. When mercury receives the gold flower, they unite—hence their vanishing and perishing. This is no reckless fabrication; the discourse does not arise in vain. The transmitted methods and texts are not carelessly spoken but are based on the line images of yin and yang. Gold and mercury, being of the same kind, arise together—thus no empty theories are established, only true discourse.\n\nDrawing verification from signs, transmitting the method to the divine. Based on the line images and fire regulation, each month’s verification shows changes, communicating with the divine—thus mutual instruction occurs. \"Transmitting\" refers to the method. By following this method, the great returning elixir is achieved. Inferring categories and structuring characters, the original principle serves as proof. The great returning elixir is all derived from inferring yin and yang to obtain the images of *Kan* and *Li*, structuring them into the character *Yi* to take those of the same kind—gold and mercury unite to form the three elixirs, without unrelated verification.\n\n*Kan* is the essence of the moon, *Wu*; *Li* is the radiance of the sun, *Ji*—the sun and moon form *Yi*. Lead’s essence resembles the moon, belonging to *Kan* and *Wu*; mercury’s radiance resembles the sun, belonging to *Li* and *Ji*. Thus, the essence and radiance of the sun and moon combine to form the character *Yi*. Moreover, the two treasures of yin and yang: from the ninth to the eleventh month is the position of *Kan-Wu*, the extreme of yin. Yin’s essence ascends to become the moon, belonging to metal and water. Thus, the classics speak of metal as the nine-times refined essence of lead, not referring to true gold essence. The classics state: \"Suddenly use the treasure within the Dao, not the gold of the world.\" If the great elixir contains miscellaneous gold and silver, it cannot be ingested. Only mercury alone, when refined into the golden elixir, is the divine medicine. Though it is said to use nine-times transmuted silver essence, the lead has already become ash. It borrows the *qi* of silver to assist yang with yin.\n\nFrom the third to the fifth month is the position of *Li-Ji*, the culmination of yang. Yang’s essence ascends to become the sun, belonging to mercury and fire—hence the sun and moon form *Yi*. When the elixir obtains the union of gold and mercury, its essence and radiance naturally transform. Hard and soft unite. *Kan*-yang mercury is hard, *Li*-yin lead is soft—thus yin and yang unite to form the great elixir.\n\nEarth reigns over the four seasons. Earth is the flower, and also the crucible. Furthermore, the four yellows belong to earth, which dominates the four seasons—yet this does not mean yellow earth serves as the crucible. If an iron or metal crucible is used, its interior must be coated with yellow earth. Raw gold is thus employed, for it is also the golden flower, and yellow sprouts are called earth.\n\nThe net encompasses beginning and end. The beginning is the new moon, the end the dark moon; the net is the vessel. Again, the crucible’s interior is coated with yellow earth, and above it are applied golden flowers and yellow sprouts, sealed with yellow earth. Green, red, white, and black each occupy one direction: green is the east’s wood, the Azure Dragon, mercury; red is the south’s fire, cinnabar; white is the west’s White Tiger, the essence of metal; black is the north’s water, lead. Thus gold and mercury each reside in their respective directions, yet also belong to *wu-ji* and dwell in the central palace, all deriving from the central palace’s *wu-ji* power. Though gold and mercury bear two names, they pertain to the four directions and likewise belong to the central palace *wu-ji*, formed by earth’s agency.\n\nFor the medicine of true yang or solitary transformation, no additional ingredients are needed—only mercury and gold paired together. With time and fire-nurturing, they naturally transmute into the elixir. The process requires coating with yellow earth and sealing the medicine with earth; golden flowers and yellow sprouts should be applied half an inch thick. Golden flowers are true lead, formed when lead enters mercury. Yellow sprouts are made from calcined yellow lead. Since *Kan*-lead belongs to *wu* and *Li*-mercury to *ji*, they precisely correspond to *wu-ji*, thus inheriting earth’s power to transform mercury into the elixir.\n\nSome claim that cinnabar or sulfur transforms mercury into vermilion, calling sulfur supreme—this is incorrect. The *Yi* is imagery. \"Hanging images manifest brightness, none greater than the sun and moon.\" Thus the sun is vermilion mercury, and the moon belongs to lead-silver. Among the seventy-two minerals, none surpass lead and mercury, hence they are called by the names of sun and moon. Therefore, \"sun and moon\" form the character *yi*, entrusted to the *Zhou Yi*. Thus the Master said: \"Hanging images manifest brightness, none greater than the sun and moon.\" The brightness of hanging images is most wondrous in the *Yi*, which is likened to gold and mercury.\n\n\"Exhausting spirit to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.\" Exhausting spirit is fire, for fire transforms all things. \"Yang departs\" refers to the eleventh month of *Kun*, when one yang line is born, culminating in *Qian* as *Kun* ends—thus *Qian* departs. \"Yin arrives\" refers to the fifth month, when one yin line is born. Therefore, when yang departs, *Qian* wanes; when yin arrives, *Kun* waxes. That which comes extends; that which goes contracts. All this involves adding and calling forth changes in the hexagrams to direct the fire.\n\n\"Like spokes converging to turn the wheel\": this speaks of directing the fire to turn the vessel, as a wheel turns. The spokes are the thirty spokes sharing one hub—thirty days make a month, and the hub is the vessel. Thus the vessel turns for one month. \"Emerging and entering alternate in expansion and contraction\": yang emerges and yin enters. Emerging from *Zhen* completes *Qian*; entering *Xun* completes *Kun*. Waning becomes contraction; waxing becomes expansion. Directing the fire uses the elixir to form hexagrams.\n\nAnother method, the \"special method\": each month, open the crucible and double the raw mercury, driving the mercury into the vessel. Starting from one *liang*, continue for a full year, following the nine-fold addition and driving method. After one year, the fire turns it crimson; when subdued, it melts into a black ingot. Crushed and ground, it is returned to the crucible. Fired for another month, it turns purple—then cease.\n\nThere is also the \"true yang method\": take equal parts lead and mercury, beginning at the winter solstice. By the summer solstice, gradually increase the fire’s intensity, stopping at the next winter solstice. Each month, open it once to observe its state. After one cycle, the mercury alone rises above the lead in purple hue—this is called the \"true yang elixir of yang’s origin.\" Take this true yang and place it again in a pure golden-flower vessel. After another month, the purple color is complete.\n\nAnother method: each month, \"close the tiger and release the dragon,\" employing the \"augmenting dragon and restraining tiger\" technique. The dragon is mercury; the tiger is lead. Add realgar and return it to the crucible to form the elixir. These are the three methods—this *Contract* discusses the method of true yang.\n\nThe hexagrams contain three hundred eighty-four lines, each line corresponding to a tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams, which comprise three hundred eighty-four line images. One *jin* of medicine contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Calculating one day’s circulation completes one celestial revolution, with the small fire’s *qi* sufficient. Calculating one full year, the medicine receives the great fire’s *qi* in full, and the elixir is complete. This images the natural cyclical elixir, born by receiving the *qi* of the great yang.\n\nThe tally refers to using two hexagrams each day and month: one hexagram governs affairs, the other governs the tally. The tally also refers to the five tallies, golden flowers, and the like. It is said that the tally of heaven and earth is gold and mercury. The tally’s reckoning is measurement. The *Yi*’s elixir requires one full year to complete. The body directs the fire, taking the celestial revolution’s degrees. When the number is complete, the elixir is formed—this elixir has two meanings.\n\nThis *Triple Concordance* states: half a *jin* of mercury and half a *jin* of flowers combine to form the elixir, completed in one year. If it is white snow, nine transmutations take three years to form the \"special yang elixir.\" The upper limit is a hundred *jin*; the lower, one or two *jin*, completed in fifteen months.\n\n\"From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally.\" The dark moon ends *Kun*; the new moon transforms *Kun*.\n\nA single line constitutes *Zhen*; *Zhen* serves as the direct tally, while *Fu* serves as the direct affair. On this day, the twelve branches revolve. From *zi* to *si*, the Yang Way is complete, and the Yin Way arises—*ren-wu* ignites the fire. Another hexagram serves until *hai* concludes its duty. At the dawn of each new moon’s first day, *Zhen* stirs, like a tally, like a seal, determining the appointed task. At this juncture, it connects.\n\nConfucius said: “Heaven and Earth harmonize in union.” Thus, the crucible for fire must seal its juncture tightly. Heaven and Earth mate their essence; sun and moon mutually grasp and sustain. Heaven and Earth are the crucible. Essence is the quintessence of the elixir. Sun and moon are gold and mercury. *Dan* means to probe; *fu* means to sustain. It speaks of the two treasures within the vessel, amid the crucible of Heaven and Earth, revolving the fire of Great Yang to transform them. Let the two medicines of sun and moon mate their *qi* and essence, probing and sustaining one another to form the elixir. As Heaven’s *qi* descends and Earth’s *qi* ascends, sun and moon conjoin, Yin and Yang unite in mating—then auspicious transformations respond, mirroring the image of the elixir’s Way. This is called the time when *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally, answering the mandate, when firm and yielding mate, gold and mercury both emit their essence, linking sun and moon, Heaven and Earth mating their essence, all things transforming and coming to life. The Way of the elixir is likewise, all born of Yin and Yang.\n\nThe potent Yang spreads its mysterious bestowal: the potent Yang is mercury, the mysterious is lead. Lead essence refers to the essence of the nine leads, which, when met with fire, becomes water. It enters the mercury; the lead essence bestows and receives the mercury. The mercury, having obtained lead, disperses and enters the lead. After congealing, refining, and grinding, it is placed in the crucible, where fire is applied to form the Great Return Elixir. The yielding Yin transforms into the yellow wrap: the yielding Yin is the Metal Duke. When the Metal Duke obtains mercury, in the space of a fierce fire’s meal, it emits golden blossoms, called the mysterious yellow flowers. When these flowers are melted to wrap the mercury and placed in the crucible after fire is applied, they sizzle and crackle, forming layers like fish scales or golden blossoms. As their resisting sounds settle, the mercury submits to the fire, and the purple color signals the elixir’s completion. If not yet purple, continue firing—hence the following text says: “Sizzling like an infant longing for its mother, before half a *lou-ke* has passed, fish scales rise in playful waves.”\n\nThe *Central Chapter of the Golden and Azure* states: This discussion of potent Yang refers to realgar. The mysterious is mercury; the yielding is orpiment. It says to grind realgar into mud for the upper lid, mix orpiment with burned alum powder for the lower lid, and blend both with vinegar paste to encase dry cinnabar sand in a ball shape, then place it in a golden crucible. If not, use a clay vessel and apply fire for a full year to form the Purple Gold Return Elixir. It can transmute the five metals and, when ingested, grant longevity. Yet this *Canticle* does not use male and female but takes lead essence as the root, nurturing mercury alone to form the True Yang, the Divine Elixir of the One. Immortals ascend in feathered transformation.\n\nThe *Central Chapter* says: “When you wish to refine it, take yellow sprouts as the root.” The sprouts are lead essence. The *Lower Chapter* further says: “Refine and remove the Wu-du.” Based on this line, one should not use male and female but only the two treasures of lead and mercury. Thus, the Western Regions value yellow elixir, while China values cinnabar mercury as lead elixir. China’s product is called the Central Elixir.\n\nOnce the primordial chaos has conjoined, the root foundation is planted at the outset. The tree is mercury; the root foundation is the yellow sprout. *Quan-yu* means beginning. *Kun* is the crucible. It speaks of mercury obtaining the blossom and yellow sprout, conjoining in primordial chaos within the crucible to spontaneously form the elixir—hence all things arise from the primordial beginning. The primordial beginning is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, nurtured by *Qian* and *Kun*; thus, *Qian* and *Kun* are the vessel that gives birth and matures the elixir. It also says: *Kun* is orpiment. Mixed with gold, it forms the elixir—hence it is called the root foundation.\n\nCultivate and nurture within the calyx: when gold and mercury obtain fire for a year, their texture resembles severe frost, also like rising fish scales. Concentrate the spirit to form the body. The body is the substance. *Ning* speaks of gold and mercury obtaining fire: first liquid, then congealed, uniting as one body to become the divine elixir. Thus, in the eleventh month, a single Yang line is born. The *Yi* says: “At the first six, treading frost, solid ice—Yin begins to congeal.” Therefore, the elixir’s inception is taken at the first day of the eleventh month’s *shangyuan*, at the *zi* hour when a Yang line is born. Fire is applied to restrain the Yin of mercury, subdued by Yang to congeal as one body.\n\nAll creatures emerge along the path, none that wriggle do not follow. It speaks of the eleventh month, when a single Yang line is born and one line of *Kun* transforms into *Zhen*—Yang *qi* stirs. *Zhen* is thunder, is spring; hibernating insects all stir, none that do not follow the *qi* of Yin and Yang. Mercury is likened to a wriggling creature; when it obtains the fire *qi* of Great Yang and the fire of a single Yang line is applied, mercury, being a fusion of Yin and Yang, resonates and stirs, desiring to fly. The “all creatures” refers to all those who collectively craft the elixir—thus, though mercury desires to fly, it is restrained by the fire applied by the many. Desiring to fly yet desiring to submit, it wriggles forth from *Zhen*, stirred by the many yet unfree. It likens all things that wriggle and stir to being born of the Dao—thus, when immortals obtain the elixir, their transformations into golden bones and jade bodies all arise from the elixir’s transmutation.\n\nThereupon, Zhongni praised the vast chaos: *Qian* and *Kun* attain penetrating emptiness. *Qian* and *Kun* are the cauldron; *dong* is the furnace. *Xu* means to contain fire—it speaks of gold and mercury obtaining fire, circulating freely within the vessel. Investigating antiquity, it accords with the Primordial Sovereign. The *Guansui* established the initial beginning. The Primordial Sovereign is the First Sovereign, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign Lord Lao, who established this method of refining and restraining the divine elixir. Refining mercury into the elixir enables one to achieve longevity, as described in the *Zhouyi Cantongqi Zhu*, Volume One—ingesting it grants feathered transformation.\n\nThe term *guan* means \"to close.\" *Sui* refers to mercury, also called the \"wifely maiden.\" Closing the mercury within the crucible, one nurtures it with gentle fire to prevent it from scattering. As the *Book of Songs* says: *\"Guan-guan cry the turtledoves.\"* Male and female summon one another—this illustrates how mercury, when harmonized with the golden flower, achieves union, thus forming the elixir through the mutual summoning of male and female. Without the primordial male and female, how could one subdue and transform them into the elixir?\n\nThe male is mercury; the female is the essence of lead. The Nine Primordial Lords state: \"Taking mercury alone is called 'solitary yang.' Taking only the lead flower is called 'solitary yin.'\" Thus, lead and mercury require each other to form the elixir. Another scripture says: \"Refining the essence of lead secures my body and life; sevenfold-returned cinnabar transforms my ordinary nature.\" It also states: \"Transmuting mercury into the elixir allows one to sit upon the jade altar.\" The elixir cannot be formed without yin and yang; without them, it will never attain principle. When the two ingredients combine to form the elixir, they perfectly accord with the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nThe scriptures say: \"Borrow the qi of lead to form the elixir, but one must later remove the lead.\" Taking the mercury elixir alone may also have its principles. If it is ninefold-transformed lead flower, it may be taken for a long time. If it is first-generation flower buds used as the seed principle, one must still remove the lead, lest it harm the practitioner. The method for removing lead involves forming cinnabar, subduing the fire, and then shaping it into pellets. The medicine is pelletized, and the cinnabar is washed with yellow lead water. Placed on a crucible with fire on all sides, the lead naturally melts and drains away, leaving the mercury alone, seated in crystalline purity. Once the lead is removed, it is returned to the vessel and nurtured for sixty days to form the elixir. When it turns purple, the process is complete.\n\nWithin the vessel, it is sometimes heated with intense fire, and a water basin is placed above. The medicine remains at the center, or the lead may rise to form a lead cake atop it—this is called the \"lead shedding its embryo\" method. Thus it is said: \"Use the essence of lead as the seed.\" After the mercury is subdued and transformed into the elixir, the lead naturally separates. Over time, the lead turns to ash; or if the fire is too strong, the flower buds may transform into mercury encased in lead, forming the elixir within. The lead ash may also rise to the top, though few practitioners today grasp this method.\n\nSome speak of using sevenfold-returned cinnabar mixed with ninefold-refined lead powder, placed in the crucible and fired. Without understanding its principles, ignorant of yin and yang, or miscalculating the fire’s measures, the mercury will fly away, leaving only the lead, its color resembling yellow lead. They then claim the mercury has been subdued by fire to form the elixir. Those who ingest this will grow heavy in the waist, their bodies sluggish, their yin essence depleted, and they will lose all hope of attaining longevity. Testing it with subdued fire reveals the truth: if lead is burned with fire, it produces a red liquid that, when cooled, becomes soft, white, and heavy. If subdued fire is used, it returns to its original color, red or purple like powder, crumbling at the touch. Thus, one knows that only mercury subdued by fire may be ingested.\n\nThe great elixir arises solely from lead. Only when the lead is exhausted and the mercury subdued may it be taken. Without lead, there is no principle to be attained. The lead must be ninefold-transformed refined flower—this is not common white lead. If it has undergone seven returns, that is also excellent.\n\nThe phrase *\"crown and marriage, qi intertwined\"* speaks of mercury subdued by lead, like husband and wife. Mercury is the husband; lead is the wife—hence \"crown and marriage.\" *Qi* refers to fire. When fire is applied, they unite and intertwine like husband and wife. Only when the qi of yin and yang meet do they conjoin. A full year brings forth the sprout.\n\n*Yuan* means a full cycle. Sixty days make one *yuan*. The *Zhu Jia Jing* states: \"Sixty *jiazi* form one Great *Yuan*.\" When mercury undergoes a year of fire qi, yin and yang unite in intercourse, giving rise to form. The sprout emerges, flourishing into the elixir, its red strands beautiful in principle. This refers to mercury beginning its gradual growth in the eleventh month.\n\nAs for *\"determining the qi of the *yuan* through the movement of hexagrams,\"* each five-day period constitutes a *xun*, and fifteen *xun* make one *jiazi*. Six *xun* of six *jia* complete one day and sixty hours. Each day’s movement must fulfill one full cycle of qi.\n\nThe sage does not act in vain. The sage—here referring to the Most High Perfected One—transforms the great elixir to grant humans longevity and feathered transformation. Only mercury possesses numinous mutability; none but the sage could comprehend it. Thus, this method was established not in vain.\n\n*\"Above, observe the manifest celestial tally.\"* The tally refers to the direct tally. Master Xu gazed upward at the hexagrams to determine yin and yang. The upper crucible’s bottom is dark and mysterious like the heavens; the lower crucible resembles the earth. Within them reside the sun and moon, representing the Three Powers. Thus, they are entrusted to manifest in heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations. Mercury is likened to the sun, lead to the moon, and the vessel to the stars. The upper and lower crucibles represent heaven and earth. Thus, the great elixir embodies the essence of the sun and moon, communicating with natural transformations as if tally and contract. Hence, it is called the \"manifest celestial tally.\" The tally is heaven’s pledge, and thus the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes* were established.\n\nThe celestial tally has advance and retreat. Advance and retreat refer to the direct tally, determining yin and yang and adjusting the charcoal measures. In the eleventh month, one yang line advances while one yin line retreats; by the fifth month, one yin line advances while one yang line retreats. During retreat, charcoal is reduced by one and a half catties; during advance, it is increased by no more than three catties.\n\n*\"Contracting and extending in accord with the seasons\"* speaks of the new moon to the full moon as extension, and the full moon to the dark moon as contraction. During contraction, yin wanes; during extension, yang waxes. When yang waxes, charcoal is added; when yin wanes, charcoal is reduced. The fire formulas are clearly expounded.\n\nThus, *\"The *Book of Changes* governs the heart of heaven.\"* The *Changes* are the sun and moon—lead and mercury. Within the vessel, which is like heaven, they reside at heaven’s heart. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* comprehensively discusses the affairs of heaven and earth, establishing images to exhaust words and words to exhaust meaning. This concludes the preceding discussion.\n\nFrom here onward, the elixir’s meaning discusses fire until *\"losing its companion.\"* The hexagram *Fu* establishes the initial sprouting.\n\nThe hexagram *Fu* clarifies the initial kindling of fire. In the eleventh month, the *Kun* hexagram transforms one yang line into the *Zhen* hexagram, becoming *Fu*. \"Beginning\" means inception. The inception arises from the *Fu* hexagram, gradually establishing the sprout, which then grows until it culminates in *Qian*. The eldest son inherits the father’s body—this is illustrated by the *Zhen* hexagram. *Zhen* is the eldest son of *Qian*. It is said that *Kun*’s single line transforms into *Zhen*, and by the fourth month, it becomes the *Qian* hexagram, thus inheriting the father’s body. The foundation is laid through the mother—this is illustrated by the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun* is the mother of *Zhen*, and thus the foundation is laid through the mother, transforming into *Zhen*.\n\nThe waxing and waning correspond to the pitch pipes. *Huangzhong* is the name of the pitch pipe for the eleventh month, and thus *Huangzhong* is the pitch pipe for the birth of the first yang line. By the fifth month, it corresponds to the waning of the *Linzhong* pitch pipe. In the twelfth month, the second yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Dalu*, corresponding to the *Lin* hexagram. In the first month, the third yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Taicu*, corresponding to the *Tai* hexagram. In the second month, the fourth yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Jiazhong*, corresponding to the *Dazhuang* hexagram. In the third month, the fifth yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Guxi*, corresponding to the *Guai* hexagram. In the fourth month, the sixth yang line is born, and as yang nears its end, yin qi arises; the pitch pipe is *Zhonglü*, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram. This is the waxing of yang from *Kun*’s single line. By the fifth month, the *Qian* hexagram’s yang lines transform, and the first yin line is born; the pitch pipe is *Ruibin*, corresponding to the *Gou* hexagram. In the sixth month, the second yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Linzhong*, corresponding to the *Zhu* hexagram. In the seventh month, the third yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Yize*, corresponding to the *Pi* hexagram. In the eighth month, the fourth yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Nanlü*, corresponding to the *Guan* hexagram. In the ninth month, the fifth yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Yingshe*, corresponding to the *Bo* hexagram. In the tenth month, yin qi perishes and yang qi arises, corresponding to the *Yingzhong* pitch pipe and the *Kun* hexagram. Thus, yin is waning, and yang is waxing, cycling endlessly.\n\nThe operation of these two hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun*, guides the observation of fire. Therefore, the true person’s movements are governed by fire, and this fire is the qi of yin and yang. If the fire is too swift, the medicine scorches and is lost; if too slow, it may not be subdued. Thus, the waxing and waning must correspond to the pitch pipes, and the charcoal quantity must ensure the medicine neither loses its color nor its moisture.\n\nTherefore, in one year, the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams are used, and these two hexagrams have twelve lines, each line governing one month. Furthermore, in one month, two hexagrams are used, each governing two and a half days, with *Qian* and *Kun* each governing fifteen days. In one day, two hexagrams are used, each hexagram governing one period. Thus, the waxing and waning of the year, month, and day must be observed, and the addition or reduction of charcoal must correspond to the pitch pipes without error.\n\nThe ascent and descent are based on the pivot of the Dipper. From *zi* to *si*, yang descends; from *wu* to *hai*, yin ascends. When ascending, the crucible’s opening faces upward; when descending, the crucible’s opening faces downward. This refers to the inverted wheel of the vessel, and it is also like placing the Dipper’s handle atop the furnace. It turns in accordance with the monthly establishment and the twelve periods, applying fire accordingly.\n\nOn the third day, the moon emerges as dawn—*Zhen* receives *geng* in the west. This is explained by the *Zhen* hexagram. On the third day, the moon emerges in the west at the *geng* position. \"Dawn\" means brightness. *Geng* belongs to *Zhen*, for *Kun*’s single line transforms into *Zhen*, and thus one yang line is born, so *Zhen* is bright. On the first day, fire is kindled, and the yang fire and yang line receive the fire qi, transforming one *liang* of mercury. On the second day, yin arises again, and the mercury seeks to fly. On the third day, the yang line is again subdued, and the mercury is again restrained. Within fifteen days, the mercury flies and is subdued in alternation. Beyond fifteen days, the mercury is half-subdued, resembling the full moon. It is slightly dry but not yet fully subdued by fire.\n\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the first quarter is level as a string. This is explained by the *Dui* hexagram. *Dui* is the metal of the west, and its hexagram has one yin line above and two yang lines below. Due to the two yang lines, the moon emerges at *ding* on the eighth day. *Ding* belongs to *Dui*. It is said that when mercury receives the fire qi of the eighth day, metal and mercury merge into a liquid, level but not yet transformed.\n\nBy the fifteenth day, the *Qian* body is established, and it is full in the *jia* eastern direction. This is explained by the *Qian* hexagram. By the fifteenth day, fire transforms *Kun* into *Qian*, so the metal and mercury are slightly dry by the fifteenth day, aligning with the firm hexagram, like the full half-moon. Moreover, on this day, the sun rises in the east, and the three yang lines are complete, thus it is said to be full in *jia*, which belongs to *Qian*.\n\nThe toad and hare shine brightly; the two qi of the sun and moon are paired. The toad is the essence of the moon, which is lead. The hare is the essence of the sun, which is mercury. It speaks of the two essences of the sun and moon, thus they are said to be paired. \"Shine\" means brightness. Though the mercury is dry by the fifteenth day, like water, it is round, full, and clear, yet fire has not yet been applied. If making yellow or white elixir, the mercury is subdued by fire for one month; if making the great elixir, the mercury is subdued by fire for three hundred and fifty days. Yet the elixir is not yet formed, likened to the essence of the moon’s water, which cannot shine on its own but borrows the sun’s illumination. Though mercury is numinous, without the nine-fold refined essence of lead, it cannot subdue fire and transform into the elixir on its own. Thus, the scripture says: To cover the sparrowhawk, one must obtain the young; to plant grain, one must obtain the millet—without the proper kind, nothing grows. Mercury, without lead as its seed, cannot form the elixir; yellow and white, without gold and silver, cannot become treasure. It is like the hare, the essence of the sun, emitting light to shine upon the moon, thus it is said the hare shines brightly.\n\nThe toad observes the hexagram’s nodes, while the hare emits its radiance. \"Observes\" means to see. Lead observes mercury, and mercury is lead. Observing mercury, mercury is exchanged, and thus lead is obtained. Lead then emits light, and once subdued by fire, both emit their essence and radiance, like the moon, though bright, borrowing the sun’s illumination to shine upon the world. By the moon’s darkening, the sun and moon share the same lodging, and their two lights shine together, yet their transformation is not called brightness.\n\nWhen the moon wanes, they part, and in parting, there is brightness. On the eighth day, the hare’s form fades; by the fifteenth day, the toad is fully visible—hence it is called radiant. By the sixteenth day, the hare’s shadow vanishes, its light withdrawn, so the toad observes the hexagram’s nodes.\n\nThe seventh and eighth days mark the Way’s completion, bending and descending low. This hexagram clarifies the proper positions of yin and yang. By the fifteenth day, yang is diminished; when the moon is full, it begins to wane, its form gradually fading. It transforms from *qian* to *xun*, bending the firm into the yielding.\n\nThe seventh and eighth days span from the fifteenth to the full moon, just as the beginning and middle employ this principle. Thus, this hexagram is borrowed to complete the *qian* hexagram’s image, hence it is said: *Qian* follows the Way from the new moon. On the sixteenth day, the transition of governance occurs, and *xun* appears at dawn’s first light. As the *xun* hexagram reveals its yielding nature—by the sixteenth day, *qian* alters one line to become *xun*. A single yin line emerges, transforming the firm into the yielding. *Xun* receives *qian*’s transformation, thus it is said to receive governance. Governance means leadership, for *xun* takes the lead.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, the moon rises in *xun* and travels to the *xin* position, where dawn breaks. It is said that by the sixteenth day, the light is about to be subdued by fire to form the elixir. *Gen* aligns with the south at *bing*; the lower crescent appears on the twenty-third day. As the *gen* hexagram reveals its stillness—one yang line above, two yin lines below—two yin lines emerge, and *qian* gradually diminishes, transforming into *gen*. On the twenty-third day, the moon reaches *bing*, where dawn breaks. It is said that by the twenty-third day, mercury, like an unmoving mountain, crystallizes into fish scales, ready for the yellow and white to be subdued by fire. *Gen* means stillness.\n\nBy the thirtieth day, *kun* at *yi* in the northeast loses its companion. As the *kun* hexagram reveals its end—*qian* is entirely diminished, three yin lines arise, transforming into *kun*. *Kun* is yin, and yin’s inception belongs to *kun*, which corresponds to *yi*. On the thirtieth day, the moon wanes at *yi*. *Yi* is *kun*’s position, residing in the southwest. Now appearing in the east at *yi*, the dark and new moons intersect, shifting from *gen* to *kun*—hence it is said: in the northeast, it loses its companion. The *Book of Changes*’ *Kun* hexagram states: “In the northeast, it loses its companion, yet in the end, there is celebration.” Celebration comes when yin joins yang, illustrating how lead and mercury, after uniting with fire, ultimately form the elixir in joy. If crafting the yellow and white, a month’s work suffices. If making the Great Elixir, a year’s fire and qi complete it, and the Lesser Returning Elixir is achieved.\n\nFor the moon, a month’s end transforms *qian* into *kun*, cycling endlessly. After a full year, the celestial fire is complete. When the cycle ends, succession follows, and at the juncture, the dragon is reborn. The cycle’s end marks the month’s conclusion. Succession begins at the new moon’s division, where lines intersect. From *kun*, one line gives rise to *zhen*, which is the dragon—hence the dragon’s rebirth. The previous month concludes, and fresh mercury is added. For the Golden Elixir, dragon and tiger are added, entering the crucible for refinement. Again, *kun*’s initial six lines yield one yang line, rising as the *Fu* hexagram. Thus, when *kun*’s cycle ends, *zhen* receives renewal, continuing as before, emerging from *kun*’s juncture.\n\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*:\n*Jia* is yang’s beginning, *ren* its end; *yi* is yin’s beginning, *gui* its end. *Qian* governs *jia* and *ren*; *kun* governs *yi* and *gui*. *Qian* knows the Great Beginning, while *kun* takes its end, illustrating a full cycle of transformation. These also serve as medicinal substances: *jia* and *yi* are the Azure Dragon (mercury), *ren* and *gui* the Dark Warrior (lead), the two substances paired. *Qian* and *kun* encompass beginning and end. Whether a year, a month, or a day, fire is directed by the two hexagrams *qian* and *kun*. The initial fire begins with *qian* and *kun*—this is the starting point. These two hexagrams are ever used, for *qian* is yin’s inception, *kun* yang’s inception. *Qian* arises at the beginning; beginning is the start. *Kun* governs the end; the end is the month’s close. Thus, *qian* and *kun* cycle endlessly, binding together.\n\nSeven and eight make fifteen—seven and eight are the fifteenth day, when mercury receives fifteen days of fire. Nine and six also correspond. The four combine to make thirty, and the *Yi*’s qi seeks concealment. Nine and six, with seven and eight, total thirty, completing a month’s fire cycle. The *Yi* is the medicine. The fire’s virtue directs the qi of yin and yang, gradually concealing it each month—subduing the fire. Thus, when yang vanishes, yin hides, completing a month’s cycle. Seven is young yang, eight young yin; nine old yang, six old yin. The four combine to make thirty, forming a month, hence the qi of yin and yang waxes and wanes. Like the midwinter season, when grasses and trees wither. Assisting yang, one entreats the merchants; the lord deeply conceals himself.\n\nAs the seasons flow with the节令,\nseal the mouth and speak no words.\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,\nthe Great Mystery’s primal form eludes description.\nEmpty and still, it cannot be seen—\nits frame and bounds dissolve into nothingness.\nErrors and missteps unravel the threads of affairs,\nwords turn back to wound the speaker.\nDistinguish and order these Four Images,\nto enlighten those blind to what comes after.\nThe Eight Trigrams array their radiance,\ntheir revolutions never stray from the center.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams array their positions,\nthe furnace spans the eight directions.\nRadiance is fire.\nThus the Great One arranges the trigrams across the eight directions,\ncirculating fire through the twelve branches.\nKan is yang within yin, Li is yin within yang,\nnever straying from the Dao of one yin and one yang.\nThe cauldron stands at the center,\nas fire revolves around it without losing the center.\nThus Qian is *jia*, Kun is *yi*—Heaven and Earth take their places;\nGen is *bing*, Dui is *ding*—mountain and marsh exchange qi;\nZhen is *geng*, Xun is *xin*—thunder and wind press upon each other;\nKan is *wu*, Li is *ji*—water and fire do not repel,\nso the sun and moon traverse the Eight Trigrams along the ecliptic,\nnever straying from the center.\n\nThe primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive—\nprimal essence is mercury,\nsubtle as pure, refined essence.\nIt mirrors the scrutiny of yin and yang’s two qi,\nits color and luster exquisitely fine,\nthe numen of Heaven and Earth.\nIts subtlety defies all threads of inquiry,\nit cannot be seen.\nYet by calculation and verification, its signs are confirmed.\nWhen circulating fire through the trigrams,\nall follows the celestial measures,\ntaking the true tally as proof.\n\nAt rest, observe its images,\ngauge its forms by the standard.\nImages are the sun and moon forming patterns in the heavens,\ntaking shape upon the earth.\nWhen circulating fire and observing the cauldron,\ndo not lose the proper form.\nTrace the qi of yin and yang,\nmove in accord with the seasons—\nthus the *Yi* observes their qi and images,\nexamines their completed forms,\nto serve as the standard.\nThis is how Master Xu gazed upward at the trigram images,\naligning the elixir path to this principle.\n\nErect the gnomon to serve as the model—\nthe model is the law.\n\nOn the furnace, install a tube. By day, fashion it into the twelve earthly branches to serve as a water clock. At the hour of *zi*, the rat’s head appears, and the branches manifest in sequential order. As the fire circulates and turns, it shifts one branch per movement, marking the twelve branches without error. Observe and divine to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\nThis means to divine the twelve hexagrams according to the water clock, fixing auspice or inauspice. Issue commands in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of moving lines. The *times* refer to the twelve hours; the *commands* follow the four seasons, never neglecting the cyclic measures of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Thus, in spring one nurtures, in autumn one harvests, in summer one grows, in winter one stores. When yang reaches its extreme, it becomes excess; when yin reaches its extreme, it turns perverse. All is threaded as one, never straying from the Way of the four seasons.\n\nAs in the *Xun* hexagram, where *geng* comes first, or the *Gu* hexagram, where *jia* comes first—when circulating fire and turning the vessel, all follows the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*. Further, when generation, transformation, and activation occur, they align with the seasons and respond to the commands.\n\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*;\nthe *patterns* are the celestial configurations.\nThe *Hetu* is the eight trigrams.\nThis means that when circulating fire, one must constantly observe the positions of the eight trigrams, for as the *Yi* says: *\"Observe the celestial patterns to examine the changes of the times.\"*\n\nBelow, arrange the earth’s forms and flows.\n*Arrange* means to position.\nThis speaks of placing the furnace, the crucible, the medicine courtyard, and the like—one must choose a renowned mountain, select an auspicious site, and align with the land’s topography and water flow, facing the propitious direction for good fortune.\n\nIn the midst, consider human nature,\ndiscussing the union of the elixir and the love of the Way.\n\nTo examine means to investigate. Those who jointly cultivate the elixir must scrutinize one another’s dispositions. Only when their aspirations are harmonious and their devotion to the Way is pure may they collaborate in the work of the elixir. This is the synthesis and examination of the Three Powers. The Three Powers are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\nThe task of compounding the elixir and refining the medicine is no trifling matter. Above, one selects an auspicious time and observes the celestial configurations. Below, one surveys the land, positioning the site to face the sun and turn from the shade. In the midst, one examines human nature, ensuring that temperaments are gentle and kind. The sublimation of the elixir and the refinement of the stone are matters that commune with the divine. To neglect the selection of mountains and earth is to deplete one’s essence and harm the practitioner. To fail in determining yin and yang is to risk peril and failure in the elixir. Where the heart harbors misgivings, even companions will doubt. If two people are thus in accord, they must not act hastily in their joint endeavor.\n\nThus, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* emerged as diagrams, and the sages—like the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao when siting the capital—established their enterprise at Luoyang. When the Three Powers are fully prepared, there will be no omens of fortune or misfortune. In action, one follows the nodal points of the trigrams—these *nodes* refer to the winter and summer solstices. After the summer solstice, one relies on the *Qian* and *Kun* trigrams to circulate fire, for all transformations in the circulation of fire are based on the movements of the *Qian* and *Kun* lines. In stillness, one adheres to the *Xiang* commentary. Thus, the *Xiang* speaks of images, while the lines speak of change; yang moves and yin is still, and one follows the nodal points of the trigrams. This means that the circulation of fire must follow the dynamic and static transformations of yin and yang, just as the *Xiang* commentary describes movement and stillness.\n\nWhen *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. How could one not follow this? If one circulates fire in accordance with *Qian* and *Kun*, applying firmness and yielding in due measure, what could not be achieved? Thus, the Way of *Qian* bestows benevolence, and the Way of *Kun* bestows righteousness; when the world is ordered, how could the four seasons not proceed in harmony? Just as when ruler and minister, through virtuous governance, bring peace to the myriad families, how could the realm not enjoy tranquility and prosperity?\n\n**The Primacy of Governance**\n*Governance* means to unify; *rule* means to order; *primacy* means the beginning. This speaks of constantly upholding governance in accordance with principle, preserving order from beginning to end.\n\n**Sealing with Meticulous Care**\n*Sealing* refers to the key; *binding* means to fasten; *subtle* means fine. This speaks of securing the crucible as if locking it with a key, ensuring that every detail is tightly bound so that the essence does not escape.\n\n**Unfolding and Displaying the Treasure**\nThis means that once a month, one opens the vessel to grind, refine, and wash the ingredients. One augments the dragon and restrains the tiger, applies the earthen seal, and then repeats the process of the previous month. Having arranged the two treasures within the vessel, when the days are fulfilled, one opens it to reveal the completed elixir.\n\n**The Pivotal Handle of the Essential Way**\nThe *pivotal handle* is the guiding principle. One places a balance beam atop the furnace, with the handle of the Northern Dipper aligned to receive the dripping water. The handle of the Dipper points to the lunar station of the month, and the turning of the Dipper’s handle assists in the circulation of fire within the crucible. The *binding* refers to the attachment at the Dipper’s side. One also subjugates mercury to form a \"heavenly silver vessel,\" fastening it with a small, elongated chain like a belt, constantly binding the crucible and suspending the mercury within the furnace. If the mercury threatens to escape, one must immediately quench it with water. Likewise, if the elixir vessel or crucible becomes scorching hot, one must quench it with water. The Western King governs metal, which is tempered by firmness; this analogy illustrates the need to subjugate mercury and prevent the loss of primordial essence.\n\nMoreover, the *Yi* is the guiding principle of transformation, and the reversal of the elixir is likewise governed by it.\n\n**The Rise of Fortune and Misfortune within the Lines and Images**\nOne acts in accordance with the lines and images of the trigrams, moving in harmony with yin and yang. Within the crucible, fortune and misfortune arise from adherence or deviation.\n\n**The Five Planets in Disarray or Alignment, Responding to Stimuli**\nThe *Five Planets* are the five stars. The vessel corresponds to Saturn, the fire to Mars, the water placed above to the Northern Star, the golden flowers to Venus, and the mercury to Jupiter. If the four seasons respond appropriately, there will be no failures or setbacks; without the elixir, there would be no resonance.\n\n**The Twenty-Eight Constellations in Discord, with Excess and Reversal**\nThe *Twenty-Eight Constellations* are the twenty-eight lunar stations. *Excess* means extravagance. If one is indulgent and negligent, the medicine will scatter. *Reversal* refers to inverting the crucible once a day. Thus, the circulation of fire must follow the twenty-eight lunar stations.\n\n**The Literary Glory Compiles the Records**\n*Literary Glory* refers to the six stars beside the Northern Dipper, which govern the six ministries. All records and compilations are collectively overseen, and the movements of the stars are consulted. This analogy illustrates that the Way of the elixir is likewise governed by celestial configurations.\n\n**The Censorate Demands Accountability from the Assistants**\nThe *assistants* are the auxiliary stars of the Northern Dipper. This refers to the crucible, where the Dipper is placed above and the vessel below, symbolizing the Northern Dipper and its platform. The *Three Terraces* are star names. The *three nails* represent the alignment, each with its own governance, with the literary star presiding.\n\n**The Hundred Officials Each Oversee Their Respective Domains**\n*Domains* refer to jurisdictions; *offices* refer to responsibilities. This speaks of the great elixir, which draws its symbols from Heaven and Earth, the constellations, the sun, and the moon, each with its own governance. The *records* are the overseers.\n\n**The Sun Harmonizes the Essences of the Five Phases**\nThe *sun* is mercury. Mercury responds to the essences of the Five Phases, ascending to become the sun. Cinnabar is fire, and its essence transforms into the Azure Dragon, the essence of wood. Mercury is the essence of water. In its form, mercury is white like silver and is called \"liquid silver,\" the essence of metal. When it transforms into golden flowers, it becomes the essence of earth. Thus, it harmonizes the essences of the Five Phases.\n\n**The Moon Receives the Measures of the Six Pitch-Pipes**\nThe *moon* is Metal Elder, belonging to yin. Yin’s six measures govern mercury, while yang’s six pitch-pipes regulate it. Metal and mercury contain the true qi of yin and yang, thus receiving the virtue of the pitch-pipes and measures to become the elixir.\n\n**Five and Six Make Thirty Degrees, Completing the Cycle to Begin Anew**\nFive multiplied by six equals thirty days, which is one month. One borrows the numbers five and six to represent a month, thus observing the process within a single month. *Degrees* refer to the divisions of the celestial sphere. One calculates the degrees traversed in a day, a month, or a year, all of which complete a full cycle of the heavens. The sun moves one degree per day, completing a full cycle in 360 days. The moon moves twelve degrees per day. Another account states that it moves thirteen degrees per day, completing a full cycle in one month.\n\nThe heavens traverse 360 degrees and one-quarter of a degree in a single day and night. A full celestial cycle spans thirty days, during which the sun and moon conjoin once. In the first month, they conjoin in *hai*; in the second month, in *xu*. Moving leftward, they conjoin in *zi* in the twelfth month. Thus, the firing process follows the degrees of the twenty-eight lunar lodges, observed throughout their course. *Terminus and inception* refer to the completion of a month’s degrees and the beginning of the next. The root of all things lies in their end, the thread of existence and dissolution. Yang is the beginning; yin, the end. When yang reaches its peak and yin its extreme, eliminating the per\n\nThus *Laozi* states: \"That which is seen yet unseen is called *yi*.\" *Yi* is the Dao of *xi* and *yi*—the subtle and imperceptible. Though invisible, it is not distant to seek; only through the awakening of the heart is it grasped. The standard is like a silver crucible, where subdued mercury turns white, the mercury residing within the vessel. Each moment—one division, one quarter-degree—when placed upon the tripod marks a *ke*. A day and night comprise twenty-four *ke*; a month, seven hundred twenty. By this reckoning, mercury dies in one month, subdued by fire to become treasure. This is the division of *ke*, not the water-clock’s measure. A day consists of one hundred *ke*. When mercury is subdued, by month’s end the vessel glows crimson, its red radiance turning white. Should faint black specks remain, it is not yet subdued—proceed with the method of yellow and white. First, coagulate mercury into cinnabar and place it in the vessel. \"Seen yet unseen\" refers to the elixir, which remains invisible.\n\nWithin the yellow, principle gradually permeates, moistening and nourishing to reach the skin. This speaks of gold and mercury tempered by fire. As jade transforms, after long days and months with abundant fire, the elixir gradually forms—purple, lustrous, and moist. When ingested, it suffuses the skin. \"At first rectify, then refine to the end\" means that at the month’s beginning, the principle is rightly placed in the vessel, and at its close, it is further refined. \"The stem stands, yet cannot be grasped\"—*gan* is the blossom of *qian*. It signifies that the original *qian*-blossom buds may be ground and added, or fire-melted blossoms turned to liquid and combined with mercury. Alternatively, dry mercury and cinnabar first, then grind them with blossom buds into powder. Like flour, it may be placed in the tripod. Without the root as its kind, there is no foundation; a single misstep renders all futile. On the day the elixir forms, it enters the *gan* to be grasped. Yet even if the *gan* is as one whose talent, though refined, conflicts with the Dao and conduct, who clings to self-will and relies on power and prestige, it remains unfit for the cultivation of the elixir’s flourishing.\n\nThus, to cultivate the elixir, one must obtain its root-kind—without the original root, it is difficult to succeed. The root is the golden blossom and yellow sprout. One is concealed—#79 veiled, unknown to the vulgar. That \"one\" is the Dao. Therefore, \"one who knows the One completes all things.\" The One is mercury, which belongs to the Water of the north. The number of Water is one; one is the method. The One is also lead—black lead, which belongs to Water, whose number is likewise one. Within lead lies concealed white gold; the child within lead contains its mother in two senses, hence the vulgar #81 cannot know it.\n\nSupreme virtue is originally non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. Inferior virtue acts, yet its function never ceases.\n\nThe person of supreme virtue is one of nameless origin; they act without contrivance, desire without thought. Their mind is like dead ashes, their form like withered wood. Seated in oblivion, they inwardly illuminate, yearning only for long life. They seek no profit or sustenance, yet cultivate the elixir’s defense. Their resolve lies in attainment, focused solely on the One, never scrutinizing external affairs.\n\nThe person of inferior virtue is one of manifest renown, acting with purpose and seeking. Though their mouth professes love for the Dao, their heart covets alchemical gold and silver. They prize fame and wealth, indulging in sensual pleasures and learning. Once they obtain the elixir’s method, they flaunt it, using it ceaselessly, leaking the celestial tally and drifting far from the Dao.\n\nIf the elixir-cultivator conceals their virtue to align with the Dao, they merge with the Great Dao, and the elixir’s method is surely perfected. To reveal the named elixir is to invite the law’s penalty and failure.\n\nWhen the upper is sealed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is sealed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. \"Being\" is the medicine; \"non-being\" is emptiness. When the upper is sealed and called \"being,\" it is the upper crucible where the medicine ascends. When the lower is sealed, it is the lower crucible, and the medicine is empty. By reversing the vessel thus, water serves above and below, and the divine elixir resides above. The upper holds the lower’s non-being—such is the principle.\n\nThis method of the two apertures also requires the breath’s #82 sighing. The two apertures refer to the upper and lower crucibles. Opening and closing the mercury within the crucible, the fire’s qi produces a moaning sound—hence the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl. Dragon and tiger are within, thus they mutually require one another.\n\nFrom the head to the north, the fire is circulated through the hexagrams, crucibles, ruler and minister, and the Dao’s virtue—this is the elixir’s path, most revered and noble, hence called the virtue of ruler and minister. What follows gradually expounds the elixir’s meaning.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the numinous illumination. The white is mercury; the black is Metal Elder. When Metal Elder guards, it obtains the mercury, and thus the numinous illumination arrives.\n\nThe white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. The essence of metal is mercury. As the grandson of metal, it is also called \"moist silver,\" hence \"essence of metal.\" The black is Metal Elder—Metal Elder belongs to the Water of the north, thus called the foundation of water. The white, as silver, is of one meaning.\n\nMoreover, the essence of metal is when mercury enters Metal Elder and spouts a blossom, called the essence of metal, also named the \"mysterious-yellow blossom\" or \"golden blossom.\" Thus, when Metal Elder obtains mercury, the essence of the golden blossom flows forth. Seeing Metal Elder’s black color, it is the root-foundation of mercury, which sprouts the yellow sprout—hence named Metal Elder.\n\nThe yellow blossom is also called \"Single Gate,\" \"Purple Powder,\" \"Standing Control Stone,\" \"Stone Gall,\" \"Flowing Pearl,\" \"Autumn Stone,\" \"Mysterious White,\" \"Yellow Lightness,\" \"Tally of Heaven and Earth,\" \"Pact of Heaven and Earth,\" \"River Chariot,\" \"Golden Dog,\" or \"Golden Tiger.\" It has many names, which cannot all be recorded.\n\nThus, in compounding the elixir, one cannot do without the blossom and sprout as the root. For anointing the crucible, covering and sealing its edges, and other methods, if even one step is missing, it will not succeed.\n\nWater is the pivot of the Dao, and its number is named One. As lead and mercury both belong to the northern Water phase, the number of Water is One—this means Heavenly One generates Water. Moreover, the Dao generates the One, and the One is the beginning of the Five Phases, the pivot and mechanism of the Dao. Thus, one catty each of lead and mercury is used. According to this scripture, using one catty of mercury accords with Heaven’s measure and the numbers of the *Book of Changes*; this is the Yin Prime Elixir, with one catty as one dose. If one catty of cinnabar is used, with yellow lead as the covering base, it is called the Yang Prime Elixir. For an elixir of pure Yang transformation, yellow sprout is used. Otherwise, one *liang* of golden blossom serves as the foundation, added month by month, totaling thirty catties after nine months—this is also called the Special Nine Cycles Method. Thus, the methods of Returning Elixir number several schools; though their transformations differ, their crafting follows the same principle. Those who grasp the reason, all produce the Great Elixir. Yet only when fire is mastered does it become the supreme immortal medicine.\n\nAt the beginning of Yin and Yang, the Mysterious contains the yellow sprout. As lead belongs to Water, it is called \"Mysterious.\" Within raw lead lies the yellow sprout, resembling gold in form—hence the name \"yellow sprout.\" Lead is the master of the Five Metals and the northern River Chariot. Thus, lead is black on the outside but harbors golden blossom within. Yin is Metal Elder, and Yang is mercury. The Five Metals refer to lead, also called Metal Elder. Metal Elder is another name for lead. Since lead contains the five colors within, it produces five-colored gold—hence the name \"Five Metals.\" It governs mercury, belongs to Water, and can carry the elixir boat. Like a chariot, it is called the River Chariot. As it holds gold within, it harbors the golden blossom. When transformed by yellow lead, it congeals like a mirror, and when struck, resembles horse’s teeth—thus called yellow sprout. If one values the yellow sprout, one must first refine raw lead to obtain its golden blossom and yellow sprout, though both emerge from lead, their crafting differs.\n\nFor golden blossom: take nine-cycled lead, remove impurities, and refine it until it resembles a mirror. For one catty of lead, add four *liang* of mercury—some say two *liang*. The teachings vary: some advocate equal parts, others a four-six ratio. Most are incorrect; only three or four parts are precious. Thus, the ancients kept this secret: when adding mercury, swiftly apply fire for half a day, and the golden blossom will emerge like mica, displaying the five colors of mysterious yellow. Use an iron ladle to gather it. If the golden blossom’s color remains unchanged like gold, it is mercury blossom. If, after congealing, its color shifts to greenish, the green is lead blossom. Such blossom is unfit, and no blossom will emerge. Where there is mercury, there is blossom; when the blossom is exhausted, add more mercury until sufficient, then stop. Some say nine-cycled lead is unnecessary—this is mostly incorrect. Otherwise, at least three cycles are needed to produce blossom.\n\nAccording to this *Contract*, take one catty of blossom, melt it into liquid, add one catty of mercury to congeal it, then grind it into powder and place it in the crucible. For a pure Yang elixir, mix the blossom with lead sand and seal it for one hundred days until the blossom turns red and brown. For one *liang* of blossom, add one *liang* of raw mercury, grind them into powder, and place in the crucible. The sealed blossom is called Autumn Stone or Standing Control Stone. If crafting the Special Method, apply the blossom to coat the crucible and add raw mercury without limit—this too can form the elixir. For yellow sprout: take one catty of capital lead, add four *liang* of mercury, and place in a Shouzhou porcelain bowl. Apply intense fire to melt it into a mirror-like liquid, then cool the bowl until it congeals into a golden color, resembling horse’s teeth when struck. Its use is like that of golden blossom. Other teachings are mostly erroneous. The sealed blossom and sprout must be placed in lead sand.\n\nThe method of refining gold through nine cycles involves frying lead into sand and smelting sand back into lead—repeating this nine times is called the Nine Lead Method, which cannot be fully expounded here.\n\n\"Mysterious containing\" refers to mercury as the Mysterious, and the lead blossom as the contained. The blossom is the yellow sprout—hence \"Mysterious containing yellow sprout.\" \"Clad in coarse cloth yet harboring jade\" describes one who appears as a madman. Lead’s exterior is black with a yellow hue, like coarse cloth. \"Harboring jade\" refers to its inner whiteness. Like a madman clad in coarse cloth, lead’s whiteness resembles jade—hence the \"madman.\"\n\nGold is the mother of Water, and the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Gold here is silver, and Water is lead. Lead contains silver, making it the mother of lead; lead is the child of silver, thus concealing the child’s embryo. Water is the child of gold, and the child resides in the mother’s womb. The mother is silver, and Water is lead; silver is the child, thus dwelling in the mother’s womb. Therefore, silver is the fine matchmaker of the Seven Treasures and the marrow of Yin and Yang.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Do not ruin my lead, nor abandon my life-metal. Do not break my chariot, nor forsake my return home.\" It also says: \"If the lead is not true, mercury will be hard to befriend. If the lead is genuine, the household retainer will not be lost.\" The Green-Waisted Envoy and the Red-Blood General unite the two families, gathering different clans into one flock. Thus, the Great Elixir cannot be formed without lead.\n\nWhen using lead, one must obtain refined, salty lead. If it is white and greasy, it can yield blossom and sprout. If it is spent, it will be pale and yield no blossom. \"Mysterious lead with a green waist\" refers to malachite. The \"Red-Blood General\" is realgar. One is mercury, the other is golden blossom. *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume One, concludes.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* variants from the *Yuying’s Elucidation* edition

\"Concealment\" (*Elucidation*: \"Seclusion\").\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Three (Anonymous)\n\nThe Perfected One attains the utmost subtlety, now present, now absent. The absence is yang lead; the presence is yin mercury. Moreover, silver pertains to the yang treasure, while the Perfected One is the Supreme Treasure Person. Knowing that within lead lies the treasure, one transforms mercury into the elixir.\n\nThe great abyss billows in mist, now sinking, now floating. Advancing, it #1 spreads and disperses, each guarding its own boundary. The great abyss refers to molten lead turned to liquid, into which mercury is cast. Now sinking, now floating—this is the method of forming golden flowers: mercury enters the lead liquid, dispersing within the lead, thus bound by the lead and unable to escape its confines. Hence, one knows that to compound the elixir, one must first refine lead into flowers to subdue mercury.\n\nAnother interpretation of the great abyss refers to the ash pool where lead yields silver. Thus, the scripture states: \"In the ash pool, with blazing heat, lead sinks and silver floats. Pure white, the treasure appears, capable of forging yellow gold.\" Both meanings are valid.\n\nGathered, it resembles white; wrought, it turns vermilion. Lead serves as #2 the outer guard, silk enveloping #3 the steadfast core. This speaks of molten lead, white in its liquid state, which, when mercury is introduced and worked, changes color to crimson. Lead acts as the outer guard like silk, enclosing the refined mercury within, preventing its flight. Thus, it remains steadfast and abides, white guarding black.\n\nHere concludes the discussion of forming flower buds; what follows concerns the entry into the crucible.\n\nRound or square, a *cun* in diameter, they merge and support one another. Born before Heaven and Earth. *Born* here means intermingled. It refers to mercury entering the lead flowers, blending and supporting one another, later to be placed within the Mysterious White Metal Flower Crucible. Mercury is the essence of metal, one *cun* in diameter and round, weighing one *jin*—the measure used in the *Cantong Qi*. *Before* refers to the crucible. The upper lid is Heaven; the lower lid, Earth. Thus, once Heaven and Earth are established, the myriad things are born. Within the cosmos, nothing exists that is not nurtured by Heaven and Earth. The Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth, and the elixir belongs to the Dao. Therefore, it must be nurtured by Heaven and Earth, which is why the crucible is discussed first to cultivate the great elixir.\n\nLofty and revered. The crucible rests within the Supreme One’s furnace, atop the Three Terraces, uniquely exalted—thus, lofty and revered. The virtue of the Dao is likewise exalted and revered, hence the elixir’s path is supremely noble and high.\n\nSurrounding it are #4 walls and gates. The walls are the Supreme One’s furnace. The furnace has four sides, #5 each opening into eight gates to channel the eight winds. It holds twelve protrusions symbolizing the twelve hours, twelve cavities symbolizing the twelve earthly branches, and four tiers corresponding to the four seasons—hence, walls and gates.\n\nIts form resembles Penglai’s gourd. The *gourd* is the crucible, also akin to a *touhu* vase, shaped like a crucible in various styles. Some resemble melons, others are square or edged, each with its purpose. A small, elongated handle is used for dipping water and weighing. If refining fire for yellow and white, a silver crucible is employed. The reed tube is two *cun* in diameter, one and a half *cun* long, holding one *jin* of mercury. *Penglai* refers to the furnace, modeled after the Five Peaks, resembling Mount Penglai.\n\nEncircling it, #6 sealed and bound, the four passages are secured. *Encircling* refers to the crucible’s four—or two—handles. The lower seal confines the mercury within, preventing its escape. Guarding it, tightly sealed. #7 *Sealed* refers to the sealed boundary; *guarding* refers to tending the fire. One must not slacken by day, for a breach in the seal is most urgent. If the seal is not firm and tight, the medicine will entirely escape. If the seal is secure and dense, only the essence remains, leaving only lead elixir. If the silver crucible is not carefully sealed, only the elixir remains while the mercury flees entirely.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Six-and-one\" refers to six parts to one, making seven measures, the sealed boundary like lacquer, not the seven kinds of clay. Such as the eight stones, four spirits, golden blossom, jade powder, and the like. For the elixir, *yushi* powder and *chishizhi* are used for the upper and lower layers, with ash salt. For this elixir, only golden flowers and yellow buds suffice. Otherwise, lead and cinnabar are finely ground and fermented like mud, applied atop salt ash. For silver crucibles and reed tubes, use *dapeng* cinnabar mixed with refined silver powder and steel sand. Other texts mention non-ash, wood, *rong* salt, and the like—these are incorrect.\n\nSeal against deceit and deviation. This means the sealed boundary must be firm and tight, so there shall be no loss or deficiency. \"Deviation\" refers to flying away and loss. The winding chambers connect in sequence, to guard against the unforeseen. \"Unforeseen\" means loss. It speaks of interlocking male and female parts, fitting together like dog’s teeth. Externally, an elephant’s trunk is applied. Stir deeply and exhort earnestly—firmness and tightness are paramount. This may be contemplated with profound thought, but not with anxious toil.\n\nWhen the *qi* of spirit fills the chamber, none can retain it. Those who preserve it prosper; those who lose it perish. \"Spirit *qi*\" is fire. \"Chamber\" is the furnace. \"Fills\" means the martial fire is abundant. If the fire is too strong, the mercury’s power cannot withstand it. Nothing is more slippery and swift than mercury—once gone, it leaves no trace, and no place can be found to seek it. Thus, the boundary must be as firm and tight as lacquer.\n\nIf the crucible is pierced or damaged, one must grasp the fire’s nature across the four seasons, balancing civil and martial fires in due time—this is why profound contemplation is unnecessary. When present, it flourishes; when perfected, it becomes the elixir; when lost, it vanishes. Before attempting to refine and sublimate, first refine the crucible and vessel, then ensure the sealed boundary is secure. When fire and *qi* are harmonized, and one’s diligence is unwavering, how could there be loss or failure?\n\nMovement and stillness, rest and activity—these ever accompany the practitioner. This speaks of repeatedly handling the crucible and managing the fire, which must always be overseen by three people. Thus, when yang moves and yin is still, or when advancing and retreating, one must not leave the furnace. Even when movement occurs, there is no true rest—hence, it ever accompanies the practitioner.\n\nThis is not the method of traversing the hidden treasuries; it is inner contemplation with focused thought. \"Traversing\" means to pass through. It speaks of managing the fire and moving *qi*, all in accordance with the methods of the stellar lodges and hidden treasuries. Moreover, the chamber must be purified: expel ghosts by burning, inscribe the nine furnaces, draw the true forms of the Five Peaks, the true scripts of the eight directions, the Jade Maidens and Heavenly Lads, the Eight Lords and Nine Perfected, the Twelve Divine Kings, and the Three Great Generals. Step the void altar in the eight directions, hang mirrors on all sides, plant swords at the four quarters, burn incense, and maintain purity and precepts. Concentrate the mind to constantly visualize the Most High, the Nine Perfected, Eight Sages, Jade Maidens, Immortal Lads, Heavenly Soldiers, and Mighty Warriors. To the left and right, the Green Dragon and White Tiger; before and behind, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior—all within a single chamber.\n\nIf one grasps the wondrous principle of the elixir, one need not draw these images. Some set up a Supreme Unity furnace, merely purifying the mind and visualizing the host of sages—this too suffices for the furnace’s work.\n\nTread the steps of the Dipper’s lodges. This means that when first igniting the fire in the altar chamber, or when thunder, rain, evil winds, and the like arise, one must perform the Yu Step. Step the stars of the Dipper—three steps, nine traces. The six jia days follow the sequence of days and hours. All major operations follow the twelve earthly branches in order, cycling through the sixty jia-zi. From the primordial to this point, the discussion of crucibles, sealed boundaries, fire management, and methods of operation is reiterated thrice—this is to urge the practitioner to be meticulous.\n\nAt first, the method is civil; later, martial—gradually nurturing the fire ensures nothing is lost. The Way of yin suppresses one and nine, its turbid chaos playing with the primordial womb. \"The Way of yin\" refers to the yin primordial method. \"One\" is the essence of lead, belonging to the northern Kan water, whose number is one. \"Nine\" is mercury. Mercury is born of cinnabar, belonging to the southern Li fire, whose number is nine. Melt the essence of lead into water, then cast it into the refined mercury to blend them. The chaotic mercury is pressed into the lead, which then conceals the mercury within itself, like a child dwelling in the womb, unable to flee. Enveloped by the lead’s womb, it moves up and down—hence, it is said to \"play with the womb.\"\n\nConsuming *qi*, the intestines and stomach resound; exhaling the true, inhaling the deviant. \"Deviant\" is lead; \"true\" is mercury; \"*qi*\" is fire. It speaks of mercury uniting with fire *qi* to become one body. Thus, the dragon exhales and the tiger inhales—this refers to the breathing of dragon and tiger. Mercury within lead causes the head to resound in the intestines and stomach. After the sun is full, the mercury is exhaled onto the lead, taking the form of cinnabar, its color crimson-purple—this is called the True Yang Elixir. The common analogy is that one exhales the dead and inhales the living.\n\nDay and night, one does not sleep; the yang brightness never rests. \"Yang brightness\" is fire. It speaks of the fire within a year, extending up to three years, never ceasing day or night. The common analogy is that one practices *qi*-absorption day and night without rest.\n\nThe body grows weary, the spirit dazed, as if in a stupor. It speaks of mercury within the lead’s blossoming sap, subjected to day and night of fire—its state is dazed, as if in a stupor. It also analogizes the practitioner tending the furnace fire day and night without rest, becoming exhausted, the spirit and emotions dazed as if in a stupor.\n\nFurthermore, in making the elixir or yellow and white, one must first refine mercury into cinnabar. For the elixir, use three years of left-flavored [mercury] mixed with golden blossoms and branches, also placed in silver vessels to branch. Continuously scrape the dry mercury from the four sides. For yellow and white, use equal parts mother [lead] to branch the mercury into cinnabar, like stone. Place the cinnabar in the vessel, subdue the fire for one hundred twenty days to make a treasure. If unfit for use as medicine, it is because of the presence of metallic lead.\n\nFor the nine-cycle elixir, branch the mercury into cinnabar, grind it finely, place it in the crucible, and cover it with the Five Talismans. The correct discussion of this scripture is as above. When gold and mercury enter the crucible, the common analogy is that absorbing *qi* severs the root—spirit and essence grow dazed, the body weary and stuporous.\n\nThe hundred vessels boil and surge, unable to settle in clarity. It speaks of mercury within lead, in the crucible under fire’s pressure, constantly surging and boiling. The mercury rushes into the lead, unable to settle in clarity within the hundred vessels. The common analogy is that from consuming *qi* to this point, when *qi* reaches the cinnabar field and fills it, the hundred vessels constantly roar like thunder, like boiling water—yet even after a long time, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nVain movement and weariness prevent the elixir from being ingested. If the spirit is as if in a stupor, there is ultimately no principle of eternal life.\n\nPile earth to erect an altar, morning and evening offer reverent sacrifices. It speaks of erecting an altar within the elixir courtyard, offering sacrifices morning and evening. The common analogy is that one seeking the Dao erects an altar, toiling diligently in sacrifice—yet still cannot attain the Dao.\n\nGhostly beings manifest forms, dreams and sleep stir emotions.\n\nThe adept diligently tends the furnace flame, ever with concentrated mind, and so gains the protection of spirits and gods, who in nightly dreams divinely instruct the mercury. The common analogy is that one who erects an altar and offers sacrifices may likewise be moved by spirits appearing in dreams—yet this is called attaining the Dao.\n\nHeart gladdened, will rejoicing, one deems it certain to prolong the term. *Term* here means the span of years. For the toil of body and mind gains the aid of spirits, and the heart’s intent rejoices. Once the divine elixir is formed, its ingestion surely extends years without death. The common analogy is that one moved by spirits appearing in dreams feels joy in the heart and speaks of attaining longevity. Yet suddenly the mandate of heaven is cut short, and the body decays, exposed to the elements.\n\nIt speaks of mercury, after a year of subduing fire, disgorging lead above, subdued and dead to form the elixir—called the elixir of True Yang. Thus it is said: subduing fire exposes the form to decay. The scripture states: “In the tenth month, it sheds its womb.” This is mercury, its fire complete, shedding above the lead. The common analogy is that one who seeks the Dao, ingesting *qi*, resting and toiling, erecting altars and offering diligent sacrifices, moved by dreams of spirits manifesting, cherishes joy in the heart and deems it the Way of longevity. Yet such as these cannot escape death. Without ingesting the great elixir, in the end they cannot avoid decay and exposure in death.\n\nEvery action taken is an endeavor, yet perversion and rebellion lose the pivotal mechanism. It speaks of subduing mercury to form the elixir—if perverse and not attaining principle, one’s *qi*, intent, and heart become depleted, rebelling and losing the secret method of the pivotal mechanism. Should one seek the method without clarity, one wastes fire and squanders wealth, suddenly losing the path of life and cutting short one’s mandate. Even if the elixir is obtained but its toxins are not understood, hasty ingestion leads to poisoning and the loss of life. This is like those who fail to grasp the principle of the elixir: they waste their efforts in vain, ingesting *qi* and erecting altars, yet in the end cannot escape death, losing the essential mechanism.\n\nThe methods are exceedingly numerous, numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands. It speaks of flying elixirs and alchemical stones in myriad formulas, yet the secrets of the great elixir are no more than one or two. These are contained within the *Cantong Qi*, which also expounds two or three methods, clarifying only the yin-yang properties of metals and stones. When mercury is subdued by fire and the elixir turns purple, this is the great returning elixir. No matter what the various formulas claim, they ultimately do not depart from lead and mercury. Simply learning to refine lead essence—when mastered—is to subdue mercury. In their original kind, they are not inherently completed; the wonder lies in human craftsmanship. Thus, those who study the Dao must broadly collect scriptures and formulas, never ashamed to seek guidance from inferiors, for the Dao will not be achieved otherwise. If one clings to arrogance and insists on a single principle, one cannot succeed—or if one does, it will not be wondrous. Therefore, the elixir does not depart from lead and mercury.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nWhite mercury begets cinnabar,\nBlack mercury transforms into yellow elixir.\nWithin it, the numbers nine by nine,\nFive and three transformations unfold.\nWhen it reaches the purple river chariot,\nYellow gold finds no place to rest.\n\nThus, the great elixir does not depart from lead and mercury; it is merely a matter of transformation by human hands. Moreover, if the great elixir can transmute the five metals into mercury to form treasure, only then is it the great returning elixir. Yet it is rare to see one today who, having learned a single method and subdued mercury to the point of fire, claims it as the great returning elixir—without further methods, how foolish, how foolish!\n\nThe great elixir must not be adulterated with gold, silver, or mineral drugs, for then it becomes the supreme poisonous divine elixir. If mixed with various stones, it can only treat illness, yet its toxins harm the body. Only by harmonizing lead and mercury is it the elixir of longevity. Yet I have seen fools who, having learned only the method of harmonizing lead and subduing mercury, claim that frying lead nine times makes the elixir, or burning mercury seven times makes cinnabar. They mix them in the crucible, regulating the male and female, praising the solidity of the stone, or refining yellow elixir, sometimes even taking silver as powder and using gold as mud, blending them with equal parts of male and female, flying and refining them in a bottle. After a year of fire and nurturing, when the time is complete, not even half is achieved—only gold, silver, and lead remain, the rest turned to ash, the numinous mercury having flown away entirely. Such blind fools claim it is a divine elixir, yet after ingestion, the body grows heavy and the waist sinks, toxins suddenly erupting, leading to injury and death. They say this is divine punishment for transgression. How profoundly ignorant of the properties of the medicine! Human life is most precious; once dead, there is no rebirth. To ingest poison is to harm the body—how can the path to immortality be hoped for?\n\nYet if one understands that lead and mercury form the elixir—even if not yet refined—merely subduing them by fire makes the medicine of longevity. Even if one knows to use lead, if it is not properly obtained, and the lead within mercury is not removed, the lead remains and can be ingested. Thus, lead is but temporarily borrowed as a root—how could it be fit for consumption? Therefore, though the methods are many, one must broadly deliberate and not act hastily. To obtain a minor method and then claim it surpasses all others is incorrect.\n\nTo go against the Yellow and the Old, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals—flying elixirs and alchemical stones originated with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, then with the Most High Lord Lao. The \"nine transformations\" refer to the names of Daoist adepts who study and ingest the elixir. The \"Nine Capitals\" are the nine teachings of the elixir scriptures, which Lord Lao transmitted at the pass to Yin Xi, expounding the methods of three transformations, five cycles, nine returns, and seven reversions, along with various elixir methods. Not limited to one or two, whether before or after, if one does not follow the regulations, it is said to go against and twist the scriptural methods.\n\nThe enlightened comprehend its meaning, clearly knowing the path. Let those who study elixir methods be enlightened and understand the method. By collecting many immortal scriptures, they awaken to the principle and thus know the path.\n\nDiligently follow it, day and night without rest. After three years of endeavor, one ascends lightly and travels afar. Unburned by fire, undrenched by water. Able to appear and disappear, ever joyful without sorrow. The Dao is achieved, virtue is perfected, one conceals oneself and awaits the time. It speaks of those who love the Dao, diligently seeking elixir methods, tending the furnace fire day and night without laziness. After three years, the elixir is obtained, and upon ingestion, one attains immortality—Dao achieved, virtue perfected. Unharmed by water or fire, able to sit or stand at will, with a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, commanding ghosts and spirits, lifespan equal to heaven and earth, ever joyful without sorrow. One withdraws from the mortal world, awaiting the time to ascend.\n\nThe Great One summons, moving residence to the Central Continent. The Great One is the immortal lord; the Central Continent is the immortal palace. After ingesting the elixir, with golden bones and jade marrow, one is no longer a mortal body. By practicing hidden virtue, meditating in stillness, cutting off thoughts, refining *qi*, and riding the clouds, the Great One sends jade lads and jade maidens to summon one into the immortal palace.\n\nAs one’s merit accumulates, one ascends, receiving charts and records. It speaks of ingesting half a dose and remaining among mortals, awaiting the fulfillment of three thousand merits before consuming the full dose to ascend to heaven. The \"records\" are the precepts of immortals; the \"charts\" are the true forms of the Five Peaks. One *jin* of the chart is one dose; four *liang* of the great returning elixir is one dose—this refers to two *jin* of medicine.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed, expounding the *Yi* to clarify it. The *Fire Record* refers to the great returning divine elixir, which takes the *Zhou Yi* as its model to clarify the use of hexagrams and trigrams, the turning of the crucible, and the movement of fire. Thus, it relies on the *Zhou Yi* to illuminate its wonders, and it is not falsely composed.\n\nThe *Reclining Moon Method* employs the crucible and furnace. The furnace is a cauldron. The crucible is said to resemble an upturned moon or a melon in shape; there is also the *Taiyi* crucible. The White Tiger serves as the pivot for refinement. The *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The White Tiger is *yushi* (arsenic).\" *Ao* means to decoct. It speaks of using *yushi* as the mechanism for mercury. This is unlikely. For *yushi* is highly toxic; if one refines mercury to whiteness, one should use that which grows naturally in storks’ nests, or employ purple *yushi* and *wuzhuo* grass ash to leach mercury—otherwise, the Three Poisons Ash, Five Alums, and Two Auxiliary Medicines. For the Great Elixir and Great Medicine, *yushi* should not be used. Regarding the White Tiger, there are two interpretations. If it refers to whiteness, then silver is used as the gourd vessel, and silver is called the White Tiger. According to this *Contract*, the White Tiger consists of *jinhua* (golden blossom) and *xuanbai* (mysterious white), ground into a paste and applied to the crucible as the mechanism for mercury. *Ao* refers to fire.\n\nThe *Flowing Pearl* receives the sun. Mercury is the essence of the sun, born of the sun, radiant and flowing, smooth as a pearl—hence the name *Flowing Pearl*. Lead enters mercury to undergo the Nine Cycles, and the blossom receives the sun to become the *Flowing Pearl*. Alternatively, when *xuanbai* is placed in a cauldron to hold mercury, it forms sand-like pearls, also called *Flowing Pearl*. Mercury is the essence of the sun, thus it is said to receive the sun.\n\nThe Green Dragon accompanies it. The Green Dragon is mercury. Mercury belongs to water, and water corresponds to the number one. Cinnabar belongs to fire, and fire corresponds to the number two. One and two make three, and three corresponds to wood, which occupies the eastern position—hence the name Green Dragon. When the dragon is combined with the *Flowing Pearl* to form the elixir, it accompanies it, just as the White Tiger does. The White Tiger is the essence of the Nine Leads, serving as the mechanism for mercury. It is the refined lead that, when melted into liquid and poured into the Green Dragon’s mercury, after encountering fire, blossoms into five colors—called the *Flowing Pearl*, also known as the *Tally of Heaven and Earth*. This tally transforms the layered blossoms of mercury into the elixir, called the *Returning Elixir*. The *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The Green Dragon is *zengqing* (malachite).\" This is unlikely. If making the Nine Elixirs, one first uses *zengqing* as water, but this scripture does not employ it.\n\nRaising the east to unite with the west, the hun and po naturally seek one another. The east is the Green Dragon, belonging to wood, which governs the liver; the liver is the yang spirit, called the *hun*, and the *hun* is mercury. The west is the White Tiger, belonging to metal, which governs the lungs; the lungs are the yin spirit, called the *po*, and the *po* is lead. Thus, lead and mercury combine, and the *hun* and *po* seek one another. According to the scripture’s reference to the east and west seeking union, how could it be *yushi* or *zengqing*?\n\nThe upper crescent corresponds to the number eight of *Dui*, and the lower crescent also corresponds to eight. When the essences of the two crescents merge, the bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* are complete. Two eights make one *jin*, and the Dao of the *Yi* stands upright without inclining. A *jin* has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, which also corresponds to the count of the *Yi*’s lines. The *Formula* states: \"The upper crescent’s eight metals are half a *jin* of mercury. The lower crescent’s eight metals are half a *jin* of lead blossom.\" *Dui* governs metal, thus two eights make one *jin*. A *jin* has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, symbolizing the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the *Yi*. Mercury is the sun, and lead is the moon; sun and moon form the character *yi* (change), thus the *Yi* does not incline.\n\nMercury, by origin, belongs to metal; within mercury is metal, and red metal belongs to the south—hence the name *Red Metal*. Lead belongs to metal because within lead is silver, and white silver belongs to the west—hence the name *White Metal*. It is also called *Metal* because it contains *jinhua* (golden blossom). Another interpretation speaks of the *White Method*: the upper crescent’s *Dui* is eight, and the lower crescent’s *Dui* is eight, totaling sixteen *liang* of silver used to make a gourd vessel for the dry mercury method. *Dui* means union, thus *Qian* and *Kun* are complete. *Qian* and *Kun* are the vessel. The correct explanation refers to the weight of the medicine in *jin* and *liang*.\n\nWhen metal enters fierce fire, its color does not lose its radiance. The nature of mercury and metal is fundamentally indestructible; when subjected to fire, it does not lose its radiance. After the elixir is formed, its color does not change when exposed to fire—if there are impurities, it will change. It is also said that gold and silver vessels are not damaged by fire. Another saying holds that when gold and silver are used to make the elixir, the metal does not lose its nature.\n\nSince the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed their brightness. This metaphor speaks of the sun and moon, which since the opening of heaven and earth have remained constantly bright. It compares the medicine in the crucible, which, when opened for viewing each month, suffers no loss.\n\nMetal does not lose its weight, and the sun and moon retain their forms. Mercury is metal. Its body is as heavy as metal, and mercury itself possesses the forms of the sun and moon: within cinnabar it is the sun, and within mercury it is the moon—thus mercury is the sun and moon, and it is metal.\n\nRarely does one see fools clinging to this metal, claiming that the Great Elixir requires gold. Thus, they dare not attempt it, unaware that this \"metal\" refers to mercury and *jinhua*. An ancient song says: \"Suddenly use the treasure within the Return, not the gold within the mistake. How could one use true gold and silver to make the elixir? Those who speak of using them are greatly mistaken.\"\n\nMetal is originally born of the moon. It speaks of *jinhua* being born of lead, and lead is the water of the north, which is the moon—thus metal is originally born of the moon. Metal is the blossom of lead.\n\nAt the new moon, it receives the tally of the sun. The sun is mercury. The *Kun* hexagram’s lines all transform into *Zhen* from the first line of the new moon; *Zhen* is the *Direct Tally*, and *Fu* is the *Direct Matter*. *Zhen* is the lower vessel that holds mercury, thus it is said to receive and employ the new moon. In the morning, the *Zhen* hexagram is used; in the evening, the *Gen* hexagram is used. These two hexagrams are employed for one day and one month.\n\nAnother interpretation holds that when mercury enters lead, it blossoms into *jinhua*, called the *Tally of Heaven and Earth*—thus it is said that at the new moon, it receives the tally of the sun.\n\nMetal returns to its mother. It speaks of mercury, which is originally the grandson of metal and the child of cinnabar.\n\nJade is the mother of mercury; now, by firing mercury into cinnabar and transforming cinnabar into gold, it returns to its mother. From gold it reverts to cinnabar, called *golden cinnabar*. The Way of the Returned Elixir is complete.\n\nOn the last day of the lunar month, it is enveloped and stored. It speaks of the last day of the month when the fire-qi is full—this is one small celestial cycle. When the numbers of yin and yang are complete, refinement begins anew. Again, from the first day of the new month, it is enveloped and stored, concealing its walls and enclosure, submerged in the cavernous void. The walls are the *Taiyi* furnace; the enclosure is the *Taiyi* crucible; the void is the southern fire constellation. It speaks of gold and mercury concealed within the crucible, receiving the fire of the cavern, latent and hidden, thus called submerged.\n\nGold recovers its original nature. It speaks of mercury, which originally belongs to gold; now, nourished by the fire of yin and yang, it transforms into golden cinnabar, thus recovering its original nature. The radiance of the crucible then shines. *Xi* means beauty. It speaks of the elixir nearing completion: mercury becomes cinnabar, and the crucible’s medicine gains luminous power and virtue—thus people rejoice.\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three. *Zi* is mercury; *wu* is cinnabar. Cinnabar belongs to fire, and the number of fire is two. Mercury belongs to water, and the number of water is one. One and two make three—thus they combine to make three. It is also that mercury has one name but two designations, residing in the south and north.\n\n*Wu* and *ji* are called five. *Wu* is yang and belongs to silver; *ji* is yin and belongs to lead, which is the water of the north, and the number of water is one. Within it is silver, which is white, and the number of metal is four. One and four make five—thus it is called five. It is also the golden blossom within lead and mercury, hence called five.\n\nWhen three and five harmonize, the eight minerals establish the guiding principle. Three is mercury; five is the golden blossom. The above two explanations combine three and five—thus it is called eight. The eighth month is when metal is at its peak—hence the eight minerals. The world does not understand, claiming that the Great Returned Elixir uses eight minerals—this is a grave error. For when mercury obtains gold, they harmonize together, forming the guiding principle of the elixir.\n\nBreathing in desire for one another, they longingly become husband and wife. It speaks of mercury belonging to wood and lead belonging to metal. Metal is the husband of wood; wood is the wife of metal. The dragon exhales, the tiger inhales—they covet and restrain one another, thus longingly becoming husband and wife. The dragon is mercury; the tiger is the golden blossom. Thus it is known that the Great Return does not rely on yin and yang of the same kind subduing one another. Therefore, no other minerals may assist mercury—only gold and mercury will suffice.\n\nYellow earth is the father of gold. Yellow earth is metal, used to coat the interior of the crucible with *xuanbai* and golden blossom—called the *golden crucible*. It is not that gold or silver are used to make the crucible; rather, earth gives birth to all things, and metal is born of earth—thus it is the father of gold. Gold is mercury transformed into golden cinnabar.\n\nAnother interpretation: it is called the golden transformation of yellow sprouts, bearing the names *wu* and *ji*, which belong to earth. They are used to harmonize mercury and coat the interior of the crucible. Another *Jue* states: yellow earth refers to the flowing *xiongci* of the four yellows. The four yellows belong to earth; earth rules the four seasons, its original form established by fire. Each rules for eighteen days, entrusted to the four seasons, and is used as clay to coat the interior of the crucible. This *Treatise* treasures not the four yellows.\n\nFlowing pearls are the mother of water. Flowing pearls are the golden blossom; water is mercury. Mercury belongs to water—thus it is the mother of water. Another name for flowing pearls and golden blossom, when obtained by mercury, also becomes the mother of mercury.\n\nWater takes earth as its ghost; earth fills water so it does not rise. The *Caotang Annotation* states: use an abundance of yellow earth to press down. Otherwise, according to various *Jue*, one may also use the *Five Talismans of Metal* and the like to cover and support—thus it is known that earth refers to golden blossom, yellow sprouts, and the like, while water is mercury. When subdued by earth, it does not rise. It is not that sulphur, which belongs to earth, is used to transform mercury into cinnabar.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire. The Vermilion Bird is fire—the southern constellation, the essence of fire. It holds balance and regulates victory and defeat. Victory and defeat refer to ascent and descent. When ascending, add charcoal; when descending, remove charcoal. *Pingping* means observing the Dipper’s handle to determine the time by the clepsydra, thus knowing when to regulate the fire.\n\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished, and both die to return to the fertile earth. Water is lead; fire is mercury.\n\nWater, when met with fire, melts into liquid—thus it is said to prevail. When mercury enters within and meets fire, the mercury dies and becomes cinnabar. This cinnabar resembles earth or ash, hence it returns to the fertile earth.\n\nThe three natures unite in harmony, their original essence sharing a common ancestor. Earth is the ancestor, the golden blossom. One mercury, two gold, three vermilion—all belong to the same lineage. The three natures together honor earth as their ancestor, thus the ancestor and lineage reunite.\n\n*Jusheng* extends years; the returning elixir may be ingested. *Ju* means great. It surpasses all other elixirs, hence it is called *jusheng*. *Jusheng* is a solar name, also an alternate name for the returning elixir. It is also called the Tenfold Victorious Elixir, Purple Powder, or Golden Sand. When the elixir is completed and consumed, it extends life and grants longevity—ingestion leads to immortality. The nature of gold does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. Mercury is originally of gold’s nature; now transformed into golden sand, this sand is most revered and precious, the supreme treasure among all things. It transmutes the five metals, so when gold and mercury form the elixir and one consumes it, one’s lifespan matches heaven and earth. The elixir undergoes a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes; those who consume it transcend decay, achieving immortality without death.\n\nGuardians who consume it gain long life. Those who follow the Dao and ingest this great returning golden elixir attain extended longevity, transforming into feathered immortals who soar through the skies.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules. Earth refers to yellow earth as the crucible, or an iron crucible lined with yellow earth. It may also be lined with yellow sprouts or covered with yellow sprout padding, thus it guards boundaries and sets the rules, ruling as king through the four seasons. Moreover, earth refers to the dual yellows—male and female. The male acts as a general, guarding the four frontiers, hence it is said to guard boundaries. Boundaries refer to the color that envelops mercury. *Gui* refers to the roundness of mercury; *ju* refers to the squareness of gold. Earth governs them, hence the term *boundary*. Both interpretations are valid.\n\nWhen golden sand enters the five viscera—golden sand being the great returning elixir—it is said that mercury, originally of gold’s essence, after three years of fire, transforms into golden sand. The five viscera refer to the five organs. When one consumes golden sand, it enters the five organs and four limbs. It disperses like wind and rain, causing all impurities to perish. If the body harbors filth, grain qi remains unexpelled, and the seven illnesses, nine worms, and three corpses persist, these impurities will perish upon contact with the elixir. Additionally, if the elixir contains arsenolite, realgar, or malachite, or if fire toxins remain unremoved, they too will cause impurities to perish. Some may not die—perhaps due to a one-year elixir, or the absence of other toxins, or because the individual has long practiced virtue, purifying their intestines and organs, thus avoiding death. Therefore, when crafting the great elixir, do not mix it with mineral medicines.\n\nIf creating yellow and white alchemy or transmuting the five metals to solidify mercury, if the toxins are not removed, it will not solidify.\n\nBlack spreads to the four limbs, and the complexion becomes radiant and lustrous. After consuming the elixir, the old regain a youthful countenance; the four limbs become moist and supple, sinews firm, and marrow full. White hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow. The elderly revert to youth, robust and vigorous. At sixty, one becomes like a young man; at seventy, an old woman becomes a maiden. A maiden is a virgin—after consuming the elixir, her complexion resembles that of a virgin. An old woman is called *yu*; at seventy, *qi*; at ninety, *yi*. By transforming one’s form, one escapes worldly calamities and is called a *zhenren*.\n\nHumans are endowed with the essence of yin and yang. Now, refining the essence of yin and yang into an elixir, those who consume it transform in appearance, grow feathers, conceal themselves, and undergo metamorphosis. They command ghosts and spirits, attain longevity, and endure. Yin and yang cannot mold them; water and fire cannot harm them. They bid eternal farewell to death, their lifespan matching heaven and earth. With golden bones and jade marrow, they are called *zhenren*. This is the boundless merit of the great elixir—even the three disasters cannot harm them.\n\nWhen lead powder is cast into charcoal, its color spoils and reverts to lead. This illustrates that mercury is originally of gold’s nature. Now, when burned, it becomes gold; transformed into gold, it becomes sand; and from sand, it becomes golden sand. The returning elixir is like lead powder, originally made from roasted lead mixed with salt and vinegar, then heated over fire until it reverts to lead.\n\nIce and snow, when met with warm water, dissolve into the Great Mystery. The Great Mystery is water. Like ice and snow meeting yang, they transform back into water, self-regulating and undergoing change. It is also said that when the mysterious subdues gold and mercury to form the elixir, how can it not succeed?\n\nGold takes sand as its essence, harmonizing with mercury. Gold refers to lead blossoms refined over time. When lead blossoms are extracted, they are called golden sand. Mixing sand with mercury and burning it into yellow cinnabar yields yellow sprouts, also called golden sand. Alternatively, heating yellow cinnabar to extract lead, roasting lead into sand, or smelting lead into sand and combining it with mercury—all these methods are valid.\n\nThose who do not understand may say: grind gold and silver into powder to make sand and mix it with mercury. This is gravely mistaken. Such is the method for creating *goulou* yellow and white alchemy. For elixir-making, only golden blossoms and yellow sprouts will suffice.\n\nThe *Caotang* states: using cinnabar or mixing gold with mercury cannot achieve melting. Transformation arises from the genuine; beginning and end follow naturally. It is said that gold and mercury are genuine, inherently capable of transforming into the elixir. From start to finish, they follow one another—without this genuineness, they cannot enter the realm of precious wonders.\n\nTo create an elixir for immortality, one must use substances of the same kind. If compounding the great elixir with mercury, it is difficult to control its slipperiness. Moreover, as it belongs to the Greater Yang, without its lead-gold counterpart, it will never achieve the proper principle.\n\nThe gold belongs to Greater Yin; only when yang obtains yin does it become of the same kind. The Great Returning Elixir mirrors the natural generation of heaven. The Returning Elixir arises naturally—cinnabar is born in lands where cinnabar exists, taking four thousand three hundred and twenty years to form. At its birth, its radiance illuminates mountains, shining through a thousand *li*. On the days of the Three Origins, the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Officials of the Upper Origin, the various heavenly immortals, and the Jade Clarity Immortal Officials descend to inspect it—something no mortal of a few lifetimes could obtain.\n\nAt its birth, above it lies malachite; to its left, realgar; to its right, orpiment; below, gold sand; to the south, cinnabar; to the north, mercury. These are the surging and intermingling *qi* of heaven and earth’s Greater Yin and Greater Yang. After one thousand eighty years, gold ore forms; the ore takes another one thousand eighty years to produce cinnabar; the cinnabar takes another one thousand eighty years to produce mercury; the mercury takes another one thousand eighty years to produce the Natural Returning Elixir—altogether four thousand three hundred and twenty years.\n\nCalculating that one year has twelve months and four thousand three hundred and twenty hours, with one hour corresponding to one year, then one year’s fire *qi* completes the Lesser Returning Elixir; two years’ fire *qi* completes the Middle Returning Elixir; three years’ fire *qi* completes the Great Returning Elixir. This employs the *qian* and *kun* hexagrams to circulate the fire. The two hexagrams have twelve lines, each line governing two and a half days; two lines govern five days, and five days make one *xun*. Together, they total sixty hours. One line is thirty hours; two lines are sixty hours. Calculating one month as three hundred sixty hours mirrors one year’s three hundred sixty days. Thus, one month’s fire *qi* is sufficient, and so the elixir opens once a month.\n\nBy this reckoning, one year equals four thousand three hundred and twenty years. When the fire *qi* is sufficient, the Great Returning Elixir is completed. Using three Greater Origins and a half, plus one Lesser Origin—ten years of fire *qi*—accounts for intercalary months and varying month lengths. One thousand three hundred and twenty years make one Greater Origin; sixty years make one Lesser Origin. Now, in crafting the Great Returning Elixir, this *qi* and fire calculation is employed.\n\nMoreover, cinnabar and mercury are especially born in the south, for the south faces Greater Yang, where the sun’s *qi* is abundant and generates them. *The Record of the Ten Continents* states: In Funan, Linyi, and the Five Indias, cinnabar appears like tiles and pebbles. Today, Chen and Jin prefectures, as well as the Five Han regions, have it in great abundance. In the foreign lands south of the mountains, one *dou* and one *sheng* of mercury yields a hundred *jin*. In Chen and Jin prefectures, one *dou* of mercury weighs a hundred *jin*. By this, the mercury of Chenzhou and Wuxi is the finest.\n\nThis mercury may be raw or cooked. If it flows out naturally, it is clear and white, sharp and suitable for elixirs. If it is steamed and distilled, it becomes white and turbid, dull and unfit for medicinal use—only good for powder-makers and goldsmiths. Thus, in refining the Great Elixir and great medicines, one must take luminous cinnabar and distill mercury from it to make the elixir.\n\nThe cinnabar should be large, three to four *cun* on each side, with veins resembling horse teeth—this is luminous cinnabar, transparent to sunlight. If it is the size of a child’s fist and resembles human teeth, it is called *zhu xiong*. If it is as small as millet grains, it is called cinnabar. If it is white outside and red inside, it is called White Horse-Teeth Cinnabar. Any cinnabar of purple hue is acceptable. The bright red and luminous kind is best; the next, resembling pomegranate seeds, is also usable. All other stones are likewise suitable.\n\n*The Five Metals Formula* states: Gold is hollowed by silver; silver is refined by copper; copper is distinguished by iron; iron is united by tin. Copper is subdued by mercury and free from worry; mercury is moistened by gold; gold is activated by realgar; silver is perfected by realgar. Copper, when matched with realgar, shares an uncommon nature; iron, when matched with realgar, averts danger. Gold, when controlled by orpiment, is momentarily restrained; silver, when matched with orpiment, transforms doubt. Copper, when matched with orpiment, corrects its errors; iron, when matched with orpiment, becomes firm; tin, when matched with orpiment, becomes fittingly lustrous. Thus, substances of the same kind are known to be compatible; those not of the same kind are difficult to subdue. Therefore, the Great Returning Elixir cannot be formed without the mutual restraint of yin and yang.\n\nHence, the scripture says: Subduing mercury into an elixir allows one to sit upon the Jade Altar. If mercury is refined alone into an elixir, it is the True Unity Method, also called the Wish-Fulfilling Method or the True Unity Independent Practice. Master Nine Origins says: Single refinement is not permitted. Thus, using lead for single refinement, mercury is called Solitary Yang and requires yin medicine.\n\nMoreover, *The Formula* states: Use silver as the same kind. Take eight *liang* of silver powder, seven *liang* of mercury, and one *liang* of realgar. Each month, remove the tiger and add the dragon. The dragon is raw mercury; the tiger is subdued mercury. Refining with *qian* silver is also a good method. Calculating the Great Elixir, there is no principle to it.\n\nAnother method: Use a silver vessel to support mercury until it becomes cinnabar, then use refined orpiment and realgar as mud to wrap the cinnabar-mercury and place it in a silver container. Seal it with halloysite and red halloysite, and cover it with red salt—this is called Independent Practice. This method is also of the same kind, though it is mostly a minor purple elixir. Whether it truly succeeds, whether it is toxic, and whether it is suitable for long-term consumption remain uncertain.\n\nAnother method: Mix gold with mercury and realgar. Another method: Mix cinnabar with mercury, adding cinnabar each month—this is called the Crimson Dragon’s Repeated Descent, the White Tiger’s Drinking. Another method: Mix equal parts cinnabar and mercury, adding raw sulfur every seven days. Once it becomes cinnabar, place it in a jar. There is also a method using silver, cinnabar, and mercury, adding refined realgar and red salt for twelve months—all of the same kind.\n\nIf following this *Contract*, it is not only gold and mercury that are truly of the same kind. Planting grain requires millet as seed. Just as sowing grain requires millet as seed, making medicine requires lead elixir as seed. Once the elixir is formed, use the elixir as seed; the rest are not of the same kind. To subdue a hen, use its egg. This means that to subdue a hen, one must obtain a hen’s egg. Thus, the Returning Elixir must use golden blossoms as its same kind to be completed.\n\nTransforming through kindred nature comes effortlessly; things take form as if shaped by cold forging. When of the same kind, work is easily applied; without the proper seed, no treasure can be made. Thus, the quail does not hatch the phoenix, nor does the fox or hare nurse the horse. Water does not flow upward in flame, nor does fire, though black, moisten downward. This speaks of lead and mercury in union—affairs must harmonize. Once the elixir is achieved, use the elixir as seed, so that things transform through nature, forming as if smelted. If the kind is the same, how could it not become treasure? Those of different kinds—can the quail hatch the phoenix? Can the fox or hare bear the horse? Water does not flow upward, and fire does not burn downward. Thus, we know that only the same kind succeeds; the unlike cannot.\n\nIn the world, many scholars possess lofty and wondrous talents. Yet by chance, they do not encounter the right opportunity, wasting fire and squandering wealth. This speaks of how many in the world desire to learn the divine elixir of longevity, admiring the arts of the furnace. Without meeting a enlightened master to reveal the true method, they rely on their own talent, learning but a minor technique and proceeding by guesswork. Some claim to use gold and silver, others male and female mercury, empty cinnabar, and the like. Some say it takes a year, others sixty days, while others speak of nine cycles without clarity in weight. Some, having merely subdued mercury, claim it is the great elixir; others achieve the elixir but fail to subdue the fire. Some, upon failure, grow disheartened and abandon the work; others feel shame and refuse to seek guidance. Through such negligence, the scriptures remain obscure, their progress mired in doubt, leading to failure and loss—discarding fire and wasting wealth. Such cases are many. They rely on fabricated texts, proceeding recklessly by their own notions. The proper origin and cause are absent, and their measures lack steadfast discipline.\n\nThose who refine and prepare chalcanthite, mica, and reputed magnetite—along with sulfur from Yuzhang and lead in its natural flow—engage in mutual smelting and refinement. Those who claim devotion to the Dao and the furnace-fire arts, lacking true instructions, encounter some minor method or seek out ancient texts and various cryptic sayings. They cling to this *Contract*, declaring gold to be silver, calling water \"wood,\" naming the tiger \"reputed,\" calling the dragon \"malachite,\" referring to earth as \"realgar,\" calling golden blossoms \"white silver,\" designating yellow sprouts as \"sulfur,\" and labeling autumn stone as \"reputed stone.\" They claim chalcanthite comes from Pu Prefecture, or else from Qiang Dao. Those who use jadeite do so on their own conjecture, insisting they understand—yet how could they know the divine formulas are profoundly guarded, their true words concealed and obscured? How could chalcanthite emerge from lead, or autumn stone and yellow sprouts both arise from the body of the Golden Lord?\n\nThe *Scripture* states that Yuzhang refers to Dao Prefecture, which in ancient times belonged to Yuzhang County in Rao Prefecture—not today’s Hong Prefecture. Yuzhang, along with Dao and Yong Prefectures, produces cinnabar and mercury; today, people mistakenly use materials from Hong Prefecture. To take the earth of Yuzhang as vessels, and to pound mica, reputed stone, magnetite, sulfur, and chalcanthite into an elixir—is this not a grave error? Proceeding by conjecture, the *Scripture* thus says: \"Hold to it with proper method and ritual, for I dare not fully disclose the procedures.\" How could the secrets be revealed so directly? Such practitioners are scarcely worth discussing.\n\nWan is another name for mercury. The \"drumming of the five-stone bronze\" refers to its use as the *jin shu* (exhaust-pivot). The *jin shu* is a vessel. Those who, ignorant of its principles, recklessly employ the five metals as their crucible—how could they succeed? The Five Planets and the five metals all emerge from stone, hence the term \"five stones.\" It is not that drummed stone can produce gold or bronze. If refining mercury into silver, one must use a silver vessel; if making the elixir, a clay crucible is required. Using lead without refining the *xuanbai* (mysterious white), merely coating the interior with golden flowers, will achieve nothing. Different lineages do not share the same seed—how could they unite in one body? A thousand attempts will meet with ten thousand failures; what was meant to transmute will instead become delusion. Those who rely on arrogance and luck will never encounter the Way—only the sage truly knows. From youth to white-haired age, they grasp at straws in vain, mired in doubt. Things not of the same kind—how can they be mixed to succeed? A thousand attempts, ten thousand failures, until old age brings no satisfaction, the heart filled with longing and lingering uncertainty. Others, too proud to submit to a teacher, amass scriptures, formulas, and the *Cantong Qi*, exhaust their wealth, and haphazardly mix various stones—yet even in old age, they achieve nothing.\n\nTurning from the Dao to cling to delusion, treading crooked paths into perverse byways: this describes those who seek the *Cantong Qi* and esoteric formulas, only to claim, \"The method is not found here.\" Failing to recognize the true scripture, they bend and twist onto false roads, grasping the Dao while lost in confusion. Is this not the case? Peering through a tube yields no broad vision—how can one thus gauge what lies ahead? It means that those who cling to a single method, or obtain one scripture or one formula, immediately call it wondrous. Yet this is like gazing at the heavens through a tube—how can it compare to a sweeping view of distant horizons?\n\nAs for the supreme sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the eight trigrams, modeling them on Heaven and Earth. Fuxi, the Great Hao of the Wood Virtue, looked up to emulate celestial patterns; the dragon-horse emerged from the River bearing the Diagram, and thus he established the eight trigrams. Later, Shennong doubled the trigrams, expanding them into sixty-four. The *Appended Judgments* states: \"Heaven engenders transformations, and the sage takes them as his model.\" King Wen, of the imperial lineage, elaborated the line statements. Later, King Wen of Zhou expanded the *Yi* and determined the line texts and silk words. Confucius, the foremost among sages, composed the *Ten Wings* to aid it. Confucius, the greatest of all sages, thus created the *Ten Wings*—the line texts, Images, Great Commentary, hexagram statements, and lesser Images—totaling ten scrolls, known as the *Ten Wings*. Later, Confucius praised the Dao of the *Yi*, lost in the Images and Symbols. The *Yi* is the subtle and wondrous essence, a book that illuminates the dark and commands destiny. Thus, in the Xia it was called the *Lianshan*, in the Yin the *Guicang*, in the Zhou the *Zhouyi*, in the Han the *Tai Xuan Shu*, and in the Jin the *Tong Lin*. Therefore, the supreme subtlety of the elixir path is entrusted to the imagery of the *Yi*.\n\nThe Three Lords were raised by Heaven, each rising in turn to govern their time. Yet even among them, there are gradations in their steps, and their merits and powers cannot be equaled. The world’s greatest sages—none surpass Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius—were Heaven’s chosen instruments, who drew trigrams, expanded the lines, and composed the *Ten Wings*. They understood the waxing and waning of fortune, yet dared not presume to control the furnace fire or share in its radiance. How much less could lesser men casually grasp the workings of creation? This Dao is profound and obscure; only by personally receiving the fire formulas can one succeed in its practice.\n\nMoreover, before the Three Sovereigns, people were simple and unadorned; after the Five Emperors, worldly methods grew increasingly shallow. Thus, the ancients used two ingredients to complete the elixir, while later generations came to know many stones. This is why their merits and powers cannot be compared. Their creations followed in the footsteps of those before...\n\nThe creation of works follows in the footsteps of predecessors, for without like substances, nothing can be accomplished. Weighing and measuring must be precise to the *zhu*. A *zhu* is one part of a medicinal pound, which contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—this corresponds to the celestial degrees, so the division of *zhu* must align with the cosmic measures.\n\nWhat has form is easy to estimate: when mercury obtains the golden flower, it takes shape as cinnabar or the elixir bell, as in the making of yellow and white where gold and silver are blended with mercury—such things are readily gauged. But what lacks signs is difficult to plan. *Mou* means strategy; *zhao*, the foundation. If mercury does not obtain gold, its foundation is hard to strategize. Even water and fire, though visible, cannot be easily regulated—how much more so mercury, which is so wondrously transformative and without trace, making it truly difficult to devise or contemplate.\n\nWhen the crafting of elixirs is made exemplary, it becomes the established canon for the world. *Fa* means standard. The perfected ones’ alchemical methods are recorded in scriptures, yet people in the world fail to comprehend them. The *Songs* are ancient verses, and the *Book* is the *Cantong Qi*; thus, the *Cantong Qi* elaborates on the ancient verses, and both have been transmitted within it. Though the elixir formulas are clear, people do not grasp their principles and instead devise their own misguided interpretations—just as Confucius edited the *Songs* and established the *Rites* to serve as enduring standards. If one does not understand the *Cantong Qi*, the Dao of the elixir will not succeed, or if it does, it will not endure, for the wondrous transformations of its principles will remain unattained.\n\nThe foundational materials—white mercury, gold, lead, and mercury—require prior knowledge, which comes only through a teacher’s instruction. The unrefined substances are not understood without a master; thus, Master Xu himself said he only grasped the Way after learning from his teacher. Now, the *Cantong Qi* and other esoteric scriptures often conceal their secrets, scattering them before or after, so their texts appear disordered. Without prior clarity, one can only awaken through the teachings of an experienced master.\n\nIt is like setting up tents in the wilderness without any shelter—what use is there in fabricating empty notions? Or like climbing a high tower with eyes closed—no insight is gained. Those who pursue this elixir path may ascend to great heights, yet if they spend without accomplishment and remain blind to understanding, all is in vain.\n\nThe *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, yet their aims do not differ in essence. Though the texts are earnestly expounded, the common people do not ponder them deeply. The *Fire Records* are alchemical scriptures: though the divine elixir and great medicines number over six hundred methods, their paths may vary, but they ultimately converge in a single principle. Fearing that people would not comprehend, the texts repeat their explanations. Why not speak plainly? Because the divine elixir is sacred and weighty, and its secrets were not revealed directly for fear of leaking celestial mysteries. Moreover, the Way of longevity might be severed, and people might cease cultivating the Dao, slandering the world by claiming no elixir of immortality exists. Yet the truth lies close at hand—ordinary people simply do not reflect deeply enough to seek the yin and yang of gold and mercury, which can be understood through a single metal or mineral.\n\nI humbly transmit the words of the worthy ones; how dare I fabricate false teachings? The *words* refer to the scriptures and the *Cantong Qi*. This book speaks truthfully, without deception, and passes it on to later generations. Those who read it with discernment must think for themselves and awaken.\n\nIf one were to seal their tongue and sever the Way, they would incur the sin of execution. Yet if I were to speak plainly from the outset, I fear people would not follow the Dao, and so I sealed my tongue and remained silent. I also feared that the Way would be severed and I would be punished. When I set my thoughts to bamboo and silk, I feared leaking the celestial tally. The tally is mercury—it is the heart of Heaven’s mercury, which also generates the five tally-signs.\n\nHesitating between two paths, I could only sigh in admiration and stitch my thoughts together in foolishness. I began to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk, circulating the text, but feared that revealing too much would sever the Way and bring punishment upon myself. Thus, I wavered between two courses. My thoughts were stitched together in writing, so I concealed my words and spoke in disarray.\n\nFrom the beginning, there was a method and procedure, yet I dared not lay it all bare. The method of refining the elixir has its own rules and steps. Unwilling to expose the full procedure, I only outlined its essentials, revealing the branches to hint at the root. The work has its method, but I could not explain it entirely—only the guiding principles, the branches that disclose the pattern. Thus, the way of restraint is expressed through the heart of Heaven; symbols are established to convey meaning. If no symbols were set forth, the heart of Heaven would remain unseen. Therefore, I reveal the branches to make its outward form known.\n\nFrom this point onward, I discuss directly the formation of the elixir from gold and mercury, hence the careful exposition of its steps. Gold serves as the embankment, and when water enters, it flows with ease. The gold here refers to the nine-times-refined essence of lead—golden flower buds. Using golden flowers as an embankment can restrain mercury; this embankment is the method of containment, able to hold the mercury in place, hence the term \"embankment.\" To refine mercury into the elixir, one does not use gold or silver to contain the mercury—that would be the method of yellow and white alchemy. It is also said that gold is used as the crucible, called the \"embankment,\" which is the silver kettle method. This is not what the elixir requires. Only when mercury is harmonized with golden flowers, entering and blending without loss, can it flow with ease.\n\nOriginally, it was said that \"water\" was a miswriting of \"wood,\" which is incorrect. It was also said that azurite was used as wood, but this remains unclear. There are fifteen measures of gold, using fifteen taels of golden flowers. Mercury is volatile and difficult to control, so golden flowers are used. Otherwise, yellow buds serve as the root for containment, using yin to restrain yang. The measure of water is the same: water here is mercury, also fifteen taels, symbolizing the number of a single month.\n\nThe *Caotang* states that \"water\" is a miswriting of \"wood,\" suggesting the use of fifteen taels of azurite, divided into five portions of three taels each. It says three portions of golden flowers (nine taels) and two portions of azurite (six taels) are used, with one catty of mercury. If we speak of the elixir’s method as true, only azurite remains in doubt. The oral instructions all say not to use mineral drugs, so one must carefully consider whether azurite is appropriate. Azurite brightens the eyes and summons spirits—it is the essence of gold, so its use would not be amiss. But if \"water\" is a miswriting for \"wood,\" calling it azurite may be incorrect. It is also said that gold is mercury, which makes sense, and that wood is azurite, using fifteen taels—this requires further verification.\n\nAs the *Caotang* Immortal was no ordinary man, his commentary should not be mistaken. If mercury were taken as wood and called the Azure Dragon, where would the measure of mercury be? If there are measures for both gold and mercury, the lines would naturally correspond, and the tally would not be azurite but true mercury. The ancients practiced using only azurite to refine mercury into the elixir, but this *Cantong Qi* discusses only the two substances, gold and mercury, with no mention of azurite.\n\nWhen setting up the crucible, determine the weights precisely: five portions of water with a surplus. \"Five portions\" means three taels per portion, totaling fifteen taels. The \"surplus\" adds one tael to make a catty. There are 384 grains, corresponding to the *Yi*, so a full catty is used. Earlier, it was said to use fifteen taels, symbolizing half a month, but this does not align with the Way of the *Yi*. When adding the surplus to make sixteen taels, it becomes a full catty, fixed in measure. Another explanation of the \"surplus\" is that a catty of mercury weighs the same as gold: two inches of gold can weigh one tael. Five portions are mercury, and the remaining five portions are gold, as in the previous eleven, four, six, and five taels, totaling fifteen taels as before.\n\nAfter the Qian trigram is established, fifteen taels of Kun complete the formation. Thirty days make a month, hence fifteen taels each for gold and mercury. These two are taken as true—only gold and mercury are genuine. Based on this, one might say that \"wood\" refers to azurite, but this does not align with the numerical system.\n\nThe weight of gold remains as it was initially. The bodies of gold and mercury should always retain their original weight, so they must be weighed frequently. Do not let the weight be lost—if it is, the fire must be hastened; if hastened, it must be slightly reduced. If the third does not enter, the two waters accompany it. The three substances contain and receive one another, transforming in a manner divine.\n\nOne is gold, two is mercury—water is the third, but it is not a third ingredient. It is said that the third does not enter, and the two are true. How could there be three substances? Only the two, gold and mercury, are refined by fire. After ten months of gestation and sixty days of transformation, they become the True Yang Divine Elixir.\n\nBeneath lies the qi of Great Yang—qi here means fire. The crucible’s base holds the fire. The success or failure of the refinement depends on the fire. If the fire is too hasty, there will be loss; if too restrained, it will not cease, like driving chickens or herding mercury—it is difficult to achieve the proper fire. As previously stated, the fire of the four seasons requires careful attention. Simply let the fire progress from civil to martial, and it will suffice.\n\nSteam it for a brief moment: first it liquefies, then it congeals, and it is called the Yellow Chariot. The unmelting flowers become liquid, and the warmed mercury is added. Another method says to remove the fire after adding azurite powder, let it cool, grind it finely, place it in the crucible, and gradually apply fire as if steaming. After the months are fulfilled, it becomes the elixir, golden and purple in color—hence the name Yellow Chariot.\n\nIt is also said: the Yellow Chariot resembles a carriage, and when one ingests the medicine, it elevates the person—hence the name Yellow Chariot. Furthermore, when mercury is initially subdued, it briefly liquefies and then congeals, its color faintly tinged with greenish-yellow—this too is called the Yellow Chariot.\n\nThis annotation, along with the preceding discussion on using gold as a barrier, has fully addressed the weights of ingredients, their preparation, and their placement in the crucible. If one still fails to comprehend, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nAs the months and years draw to a close, one’s nature is destroyed and lifespan harmed. This means that when the time is fulfilled, the nature of mercury is broken and subdued by fire. Its form becomes like ash and dust, resembling the dust on a bright window.\n\nAfter ten months, it emerges from the womb, with mercury alone rising above the lead, crimson as the two primal forces. Beginning at the winter solstice, progressing through civil fire to the summer solstice, then through martial fire to the next winter solstice, the mercury is then opened and rises above the lead—this is called the True Yang Elixir. It appears like dust and ash; the medicine is collected and returned to the crucible.\n\nIf the mercury’s fire and qi are insufficient, it remains black as dead charcoal. At this stage, many lose heart, abandoning the process without realizing what follows. Simply continue firing the medicine, and its color will shift to purple.\n\nJust as in refining the Minor Return Elixir, where subduing the fire also turns it to black ash, from which it transforms to brown and later to a red-purple hue, later practitioners often stop upon seeing black. When mercury becomes powder, it is light as dust, losing its original form—do not doubt this. Simply allow it to be nurtured by fire over the course of years, months, and days, and its color will naturally transform into the elixir. When ground, it will be known by its weight.\n\nWith a year of firing, it becomes dust. Placed in the Red Gate for another year, it becomes the Great Elixir. Refine and combine them, then introduce them into the Red Gate. The Gate refers to the red earth crucible, coated with golden flowers to turn it red. Thus, the previous dust-like medicine and residue are cast and refined before being placed in the crucible.\n\nThe *Two Primordials* states: when refining the elixir, collect the residual lead sand. Alternatively, pound yellow earth into mud and coat the crucible. For the True Yang medicine, after sixty days of martial fire, the elixir turns purple; if not yet purple, continue firing until it becomes a deep purple-red, which is the highest grade, while green-black is the lowest.\n\nFor the Elixir of the Two Primordials, if it is to be covered, or for the Nine-Cycled Elixir, each cycle requires four taels of Mysterious White and golden flowers for covering. For the Purple Wandering Elixir, red salt is used as the covering—this is called the Red Gate. Seal its junctures firmly, ensuring it is secure and tight. This means the seals must be made sturdy and dense.\n\nThe blazing fire is kindled below, meaning the fire beneath should burn steadily, not too fiercely. As recorded elsewhere, begin with a minor martial fire for seventy days. Day and night, the sound remains keen. This means that when mercury receives fire, it emits a sound like an infant’s cry. If the crying ceases, the mercury has been subdued by fire, so the fire must not stop day or night.\n\nBegin with civil fire for cultivation—here, \"begin\" refers to the initial stage, which is civil fire. As recorded elsewhere, civil fire is used for 360 days. The middle stage is also civil fire, as previously mentioned with \"blazing\"—why then is civil fire needed? Because the mercury has been subdued by fire, a minor martial fire is now required. In the end, martial fire is employed.\n\nAt the close of the month and the end of the year, martial fire is necessary, followed by a greater martial fire. The crucible must match the color of the fire. For the Pure Yang Elixir, a great martial fire is required to subdue the fire, after which it must be transformed into an ingot, ground into powder, and fired for one cycle—this process ideally requires three years of firing. One year of firing also suffices for ingestion, but without transformation, three years of firing yield the superior elixir. As recorded elsewhere, thirty days of martial fire equate to one year of firing.\n\nObserve with utmost care, carefully regulating the heat. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node concludes, inspect closely. Open and examine it once each month, then wash and return it to the crucible. A node represents one month, hence the twelve nodes.\n\nWhen the qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po. Here, \"qi\" refers to fire, and \"exhausted\" means depleted. After twelve months of firing, the mercury dies and is subdued by fire. The hun is the mercury, and the po is the lead—thus, over a year, the hun and po disperse and transform into the Great Elixir.\n\nIts color shifts further to purple, resplendently forming the Return Elixir. The Return Elixir is purple and is also called Purple Gold Sand, Purple Powder, or the River Chariot.\n\nFour names it bears: Giant Victory. \"Giant Victory\" is a solar name, for mercury resembles the sun as Giant Victory. Five names it holds: Ten Victories Elixir. Six names it claims: Great Flowing Numinous Sand, so called because the Elder Lord, crossing the passes and fording the rivers to the Western Lands of Flowing Sands, bequeathed this method to Yin Xi, naming it Flowing Numinous Sand.\n\nIf its hue is not purple-red, it cannot be called the Great Medicine; if not yet crimson-purple, continue firing. Should its color resemble yellow cinnabar or red earth, it is not yet the Elixir—merely a minor subdued-fire mercury medicine.\n\nYin and yang consume one another. Yang mercury and yin metal: when metal meets mercury, they mutually consume and subdue each other, forming the Elixir. The Dao of intercourse is natural. When metal and mercury intermingle, the Elixir forms of itself—this too grants longevity and cures all ailments.\n\nIf mercury is merely subdued by fire and dried, it serves only as paste or powder, prolonging life but not constituting the Great Elixir. The Great Elixir is mercury, the grandson of metal and the son of cinnabar. Now restored to its original state, it resembles the body of metal, crimson-purple as cinnabar—hence the name Return Elixir. \"Elixir\" denotes the color red; \"Return\" signifies the meaning of returning. Thus it is called Return Elixir. Without this, how could it be the Return Elixir?\n\nRefine the powder into a single pellet, the *daogui* most divine. Once toxins are removed, form it with jujube pulp—or, if not, with Yellow Dragon Paste. Shape the pellet the size of a *wutong* seed. One pellet is one *daogui*. A *gui* is a small tael of gold; one *daogui* harmonizes the twenty-four qi. When the Elixir is complete, take one *daogui* and forge it into gold. If it fails to transmute the Five Metals, do not consume it rashly. The raw Elixir is toxic; without numinous transformation, continue firing until it becomes gold. Only when it achieves a deep purple hue is it called the Great Return Elixir. Ingesting one pellet grants communion with the divine.\n\nFurther, one *daogui* transmutes the Five Metals and one *jin* of raw mercury into yellow gold. At this stage, four *liang* make one dose. For those who wish to remain among mortals, take half a dose. For those who aspire to ascend to heaven, consume the full dose.\n\nExpounding the Five Phases, concise yet unburdensome. Pouring water to extinguish fire, suddenly the radiance is quenched. The Great Elixir’s expounding does not exceed the Five Phases. Mercury belongs to water, cinnabar to fire, lead and silver to metal, malachite to wood, realgar to earth—yet the Great Elixir employs only the two treasures: metal and mercury. These two inherently bear the names of the Five Phases: cinnabar belongs to fire, mercury to wood, black lead to water, white silver to metal, and the cyclical branches *wu* and *ji* correspond to earth—thus the Five Phases. \"Pouring\" means to irrigate. Water is yin, fire is yang; when water irrigates fire, yin enters and extinguishes yang—hence the radiance is quenched. Water is the flower of metal, fire is true mercury; when metal obtains mercury, water irrigates the midst of fire—thus it is unburdensome. This is not a case of water above and fire below.\n\nSun and moon mutually press and thin, ever abiding between darkness and dawn. The sun is mercury, the moon is metal; they abide within a month’s span, awaiting the fire’s waxing and waning. Dawn is the moon’s beginning, dusk its end. Between one yin and one yang, they naturally press and thin. When water waxes, *kan* encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, *li* plunges into twilight. *Kan* is water, the moon; *li* is fire, the sun. Yang is *qian*, the morning’s brightness; yin is *kun*, the evening’s obscurity. When yang prevails, water reigns; after six days, *kun* arrives—thus yang is encroached upon and fire wanes.\n\nNames define essence; words arise from nature. Mercury, born of the Great Yang, contains a vermilion hue—hence the name \"Elixir.\" Moist as water, white as silver—thus it is called \"quicksilver.\" Its white-red essence resembles silver’s nature—hence the name \"quicksilver.\" When metal returns to its original nature, it earns the title Return Elixir. Mercury, by nature, is metal. \"Elixir\" denotes the color red; \"Return\" signifies returning. Subdued mercury becomes vermilion, vermilion transforms into the Elixir—hence the name Return Elixir. This is the True Yang, called the Outer Return Elixir.\n\nHumans are endowed with primordial harmony, the original qi, emptiness and spontaneity—life arises from the void. After ingesting the Elixir, one returns to the primordial void, ascending to heaven—hence the name Return Elixir. Danqiu is the name of an immortal’s abode. Though one consumes the Outer Return Elixir, one must also take the Inner Return Elixir—restoring essence to replenish the brain. Only by consuming both can one attain longevity.\n\nI dare not fabricate falsely, but emulate the sages’ writings. Master Xu said: \"I record this *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Scripture* and the method of the Great Return. I dare not falsely attribute it, but emulate the sages’ writings—such as the *Book of Changes*.\" The ancient sages’ original text speaks of the \"Ancient Record.\" It speaks of Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger is the flower of metal, the Dragon is the mercury of metal—thus the ancients titled it the *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Scripture*. Another interpretation states: quicksilver and cinnabar bear the names Dragon and Tiger—cinnabar is the Red Dragon, mercury the White Tiger. Mercury also has two names: as the essence of wood, it is called the Azure Dragon; white as silver, it is called the White Tiger. Thus the flower of metal also bears the names Dragon and Tiger.\n\nIf lead does not meet mercury, the flower of metal remains colorless, and no flower emerges. Even if later it turns blue-black, it is still called Dragon and Tiger. Thus, in making the Elixir, the flower serves as the Tiger, mercury as the Dragon. Taking the Dragon to subdue the Dragon, the Tiger to subdue the Tiger—without these two treasures, nothing can be subdued. Even if one uses realgar or orpiment, it is of no avail; though they may turn to ash over time, they lack the principle of subjugation—serving only as auxiliary agents to imbue color and capture qi.\n\nThe *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The Tiger refers to arsenolite, called the White Tiger, while azurite is termed the Azure Dragon.\" If azurite and arsenolite are said to be true agents, then what are gold and mercury called? This cannot be so. Speaking directly of Dragon and Tiger simply means that neither gold flower nor mercury requires gold, silver, or other minerals. The Yellow Emperor praised the gold flower. If the Tiger were not the gold flower, how could the Yellow Emperor have extolled mercury? Mercury is slippery, volatile, and difficult to subdue; as the gold flower, formed when lead enters mercury, it shares the same nature and possesses metallic properties. Thus, it can absorb mercury, restrain it, and together they transform into the Elixir.\n\nThere are several methods for producing the gold flower. If one obtains the fine, white, and unctuous lead from Raozhou, it may be used after three roastings over a fierce fire. Otherwise, refine the raw lead until it is half-cooked, then place it in an inverted crescent furnace. Apply intense heat below to slightly remove the excess skin, leaving some black residue before adding mercury. Once the fire is applied, within the time it takes to eat a meal, the gold flower will burst forth. If this flower is then melted into a liquid and mercury is added again, the flower will display five colors, known as the \"Tally of Heaven and Earth\" or \"Flowing Pearls\"—this is the transformation of mercury into the Elixir by the flower.\n\nIf the flower is used in a single cycle, it must be dense and rich, following the method of the \"Pure Yang Elixir.\" For every tael of flower, mix one tael of mercury, grind them into powder, and place them in the crucible. Inside the crucible, use yellow sprouts (lead oxide), leaving the unrefined flower as is; a single substance suffices to make a paste to coat the crucible’s interior. Add mercury and nurture it for a month. Then, add two taels of raw mercury for every two taels of flower, increasing the mercury by one part each month. When the mercury turns ashen and black, continue adding gold for a hundred days, then refine it with nine cycles of lead cinnabar to subdue the fire, turning it yellow with a slight red hue. Once a month, moisten it with water. If using an earthen crucible, no moistening is needed; if using wrought iron, it must be softened into malleable iron. Bury it head-deep in an earthen pit, and apply great fire until it glows red for a day and night to temper it. For an earthen crucible, use sweet clay, yellow earth slurry, and powdered Shouzhou porcelain in equal parts, adjusting the thickness according to size. After drying, coat it with a paste of ground lead cinnabar, then gradually heat it until it turns red and is fully tempered. Apply a lining of flower sprouts inside, then add the previously subdued medicine.\n\nNine months suffice, though even three to five months may yield results depending on quantity. Once subdued, return the medicine to the crucible for another hundred and fifty days, gradually increasing the fire from gentle to fierce, and finally applying the strongest fire for one or two days. Melt this medicine into a rod, crush it, and return it to the crucible for another month—even if not melted, it may still be ingested.\n\nWhen adding mercury, the fire must be nurturing, not fierce. For the method of \"Yin’s True Yang,\" use twice-refined flower. Otherwise, use single-refined flower or melt nine cycles of lead into a liquid, calculating one catty of lead to one catty of mercury. From this winter solstice to the next, when the process is complete, apply fierce fire for one full cycle. The mercury will rise to the surface of the lead; collect this medicine. Return it to the crucible and apply martial fire for sixty days to produce the \"True Yang Elixir.\"\n\nWhen the Elixir is complete, for the \"Yang’s True Yin\" method, use cinnabar covered with red lead; for the \"Yin’s True Yang\" method or the \"Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls,\" simply refine the mercury until dry, grind it, and place it in the crucible, covering it with gold flower and dark white. Open it once a month, using four taels of charcoal daily. For the \"Divine Water of Good Snow\" method, fire is not recorded.\n\nIn this scripture, only the melted flower is added to mercury. In the \"Two Ultimates\" method, only cinnabar, arsenolite, and realgar are used, with slight variations—omission is also permissible. Thus, the Yellow Emperor valued only this gold flower.\n\nThe Huainan method refines \"autumn stone.\" Autumn stone is produced by adding the aforementioned gold flower to lead cinnabar for a hundred days. It is also called autumn stone because the gold flower belongs to the west, and the west corresponds to autumn. Liu Yan states: The *Caotang Commentary* says arsenolite, but this cannot be correct. Arsenolite is extremely toxic—how could it be used in medicine? Only in the \"Elixir of Four Spirits and Eight Stones\" and by mercury refiners is it employed; it should not be used here, so autumn stone is acceptable. How could the Prince of Huainan have used arsenolite? The Prince of Huainan prized it, just as dark white emerges from lead and is called chalcanthite. Some claim it comes from Pu Prefecture—is this not mistaken?\n\nThe Prince of Huainan was Liu An, the son of King Li of Han, enfeoffed in Huainan and thus known as the Prince of Huainan. Fond of the Dao, he was moved by the Eight Immortals to receive their teachings. He abandoned his throne to follow them to Shouzhou, where he successfully refined the Elixir and departed. The Eight Immortals Mountain remains there today. The Prince’s Yang Elixir used \"yellow sprouts.\" Yellow sprouts are refined lead and red lead, also called capital cinnabar: one catty of red lead to four taels of mercury, placed in a Shouzhou porcelain jar and fired fiercely. Within the time it takes to eat a meal, it becomes a mirror-like liquid. When cooled, it solidifies like yellow gold, and when broken, resembles horse teeth—hence the name \"yellow sprouts.\"\n\nThe Prince’s Yang Elixir used gold flower and autumn stone, though refining red lead was the primary method, equal in efficacy to the gold flower with only slight differences. Some say the gold flower is the yellow sprout—this is also acceptable, though with minor distinctions. Others remove sulfur, realgar, and orpiment—this is entirely mistaken. They merely use sulfur to restrain mercury into cinnabar, unaware of the origin of yellow sprouts. The *Records of the Ten Immortals* clearly states that lead, mercury, chalcanthite, and yellow alum are used in this scripture—they should not be employed. Only refined lead and red lead constitute the true Prince’s Yang.\n\nDuring the Han, the Governor of Yizhou, Chang, was fond of the Dao and used alchemy to save people, thus elevating the status of the Yang Elixir and naming it \"yellow sprouts.\" Therefore, those who properly regulate lead can achieve the Great Return Elixir. The wise act with singular purpose; the unworthy perish with their mothers.\n\nThose who practice the singular method refine mercury alone into the elixir, not employing the two blues or the four yellows. The \"mother\" refers to golden blossom. Thus, the true persons of highest antiquity spoke only of mercury, subjected to the fire of sun and moon over long duration, nurtured into the elixir, then combined with malachite for further refinement—such were the superior worthies of ancient times. Today’s unworthy later worthies claim that the power of golden blossom and yellow sprouts is identical, hence they are called unworthy, forbidden to perish with their mothers. The ancients did not complete the elixir in a year or two. According to the *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs*, golden blossom is also used to coat the crucible and nurture mercury—how could mercury alone, placed in an empty crucible, achieve completion? How then would it earn the names of Yin-Yang, Dragon-Tiger? This merely requires additional refinement.\n\nIf discussing the singular method, its wondrous name is \"Solitary Yang.\" The Nine Primordial Lords state: \"The elixir of Solitary Yang cannot be rashly ingested; it must borrow Yin to complete the elixir.\" If lead is exhausted, how can one cling to the singular method? The original Yin medicine, like the singular method, is exceedingly cold in nature. After the elixir forms, a hot toxic nature arises. Since lead belongs to Water and mercury to Fire, Water must extinguish Fire. Once the elixir is formed, its original toxicity is also subdued. When dry mercury takes on a color like red glass, it becomes a rarity of the world, ground into powder or made into paste. After ingesting five ounces, one’s bones become as cold as ice, resembling a chronically ill person. Dry mercury and silver may be treasures of the world, but how do they embody the principle of longevity? The scriptural formulas make this clear.\n\nOnly through the union of Yin-Yang, Dragon-Tiger can the elixir be achieved—how could mercury transform alone? Thus, mercury serves as the primary agent, golden blossom as the sovereign, malachite and the like as ministers, and realgar as the assistant. Sovereign and ministers work in concert, transforming impurities and subduing restraints to form the elixir. Entering the body, it disperses like wind and rain, instantly replenishing marrow and mending sinews—thus enabling immortality and deathlessness.\n\nMoreover, Heaven is Yang, Earth is Yin; the sun is Yang, the moon is Yin. The Way is called the interplay of one Yin and one Yang, and the mutual transformation of these two qi generates the myriad things—neither can be lacking. How could one discard Heaven to keep Earth, or abandon the sun to retain the moon? Therefore, the elixir formed from gold, mercury, realgar, and malachite is most wondrous. Without realgar and malachite, the elixir is most revered and weighty.\n\nThe Dao of ancient and modern times is one—this is but a casual remark in conversation. From antiquity to the present, only mercury alone is refined into the elixir, borrowing the phrase about lead blossom for subjugation. Upon closer examination, golden blossom is equal in measure to mercury—why then do they fail to comprehend in conversation? Scholars must redouble their efforts and reflect deeply. The essential teachings are laid bare, shining clearly without deceiving me.\n\n\"Shining\" means \"illuminating.\" I reveal this method and urge you to ponder this scripture deeply—I do not deceive you. Those who \"redouble their efforts\" refer to past practitioners of the singular method who nurtured it to the present, now applying the power of golden blossom and yellow sprouts to achieve the Great Return Elixir.\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Three, concludes.\n\nVariant readings:\n1. \"Advancing\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"advancing and retreating.\"\n2. \"Lead as\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"lead\" as \"refined.\"\n3. \"Wrapped in silk\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"wrapped in white.\"\n4. \"Beside\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"alongside.\"\n5. \"Face,\" originally \"and,\" emended according to context.\n6. \"Surrounding\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"surrounding\" as \"market.\"\n   (Subsequent identical variants are emended without annotation.)\n7. \"Securely sealed\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"sealed securely.\"\n8. \"Interconnected\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"interlinked.\"\n9. \"Filling the hall\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"filling the chamber.\"\n10. \"Treading the steps of the Dipper and lunar lodges\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"treading the Dipper and pacing the lunar lodges.\"\n11. \"External evil\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"external\" as \"outer.\"\n12. \"Yang Brightness\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"dark and new moon.\"\n13. \"With weariness\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"with\" as \"daily.\"\n14. \"Joyful in intent\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"and intent joyful.\"\n15. \"Self-declaring\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"declaring\" as \"calling.\"\n16. \"Actions and errors invariably occur\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"errors\" as \"measures\" and \"occur\" as \"violate.\"\n17. \"Over ten thousand words\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"over ten thousand clauses.\"\n18. \"Following it\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"following\" as \"practicing.\"\n19. \"Unceasing\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"unresting.\"\n20. \"Cultivation\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"ingestion.\"\n21. \"Merit completion\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"completion\" as \"fulfillment.\"\n22. \"Should receive the talismanic charts\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"should reap and receive the charts.\"\n23. \"Method\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"practice.\"\n24. \"Crucible furnace\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"furnace\" as \"stove.\"\n25. \"Receive\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"mercury.\"\n26. \"Seeking one another\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"restraining one another.\"\n27. \"Wood,\" supplied according to context below.\n28. \"Number\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"Gen.\"\n29. \"Calculation\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"calculation\" as \"count.\"\n\n30. \"Already\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"with.\"\n31. \"Moon's waxing\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"moon\" as \"sun.\"\n32. \"Receiving the sun's talisman at the new moon\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"on the first day of the lunar month, one receives the sun's talisman.\"\n33. \"Reverse\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"return.\"\n34. \"Encompassing and dwelling\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"embracing one another.\"\n35. \"Outer walls\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"enclosing walls.\"\n36. \"Play\" in the *Fahui* edition remains \"play.\"\n37. \"Name\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"number.\"\n38. \"Greed and desire\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"greed and vigor.\"\n39. \"Lingering contemplation\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"lingering stillness.\"\n40. \"With\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"already.\"\n41. \"With\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"still.\"\n42. \"Decay and ruin\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"ruin and decay.\"\n43. \"Temples and hair\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"hair turning white.\"\n44. \"Regeneration and renewal of teeth\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"teeth falling out and regrowing in their original place.\"\n45. \"In the charcoal\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"charcoal\" as \"fire.\"\n46. \"Use\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"with.\"\n47. \"With millet\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"millet\" as \"glutinous millet.\"\n48. \"Brooding hen\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"brooding\" as \"covering.\"\n49. \"Its offspring\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"offspring\" as \"eggs.\"\n50. \"Naturally turning\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"turning\" as \"assisting.\"\n51. \"Effort is easily applied to the same kind; non-seeds are difficult to make into treasure\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"Those of the same kind follow one another; when affairs diverge, treasure is not achieved,\" and additionally includes the two preceding lines: \"Can fish eyes be pearls?

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Anonymous commentary. Two fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Tai Xuan Section. Collated with the *Wenyuan Ge Siku Quanshu* edition of Yu Mei’s *Zhouyi Cantong Qi Fahui* (hereafter *Fahui* edition).\n\n### *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One\n**Anonymous Commentary**\n\n\"Zhou\" denotes the eternal Dao.\n\"Yi\" signifies transformation and change.\nThis refers to the great cyclical elixir: the firing process employs a full celestial revolution, hence the term *Zhou Yi*.\nMercury is the sun—south, the *Li* fire, belongs to *ji*, the essence of the Great Yang as the Azure Dragon.\nLead is the moon—north, the *Kan* water, belongs to *wu*, the essence of the Great Yin as the White Tiger.\nIt is also cinnabar as the sun and mercury as the moon, thus \"sun and moon\" form the character *yi*.\n\"Can\" means \"to blend,\" blending the three substances of water, earth, and metal.\n\"Tong\" means \"unity,\" as they become one family, like tallying tokens or a contract, binding into a single body—hence *Cantong Qi*.\nFormerly, the Perfected One titled it the *Dragon and Tiger Upper Scripture*.\nThe Dragon is mercury, another name for quicksilver;\nthe Tiger is the Metal Duke, also cinnabar.\nRed cinnabar is the Red Dragon; white mercury is the White Tiger.\nQuicksilver is liquid silver, hence called the White Tiger.\nLater, the Wei Lord renamed it the *Cantong Qi*, attributing it to the *Zhouyi*, for the *Yi* encompasses hardness and softness, outer and inner, ruler and minister, father and son, water and fire, the Five Phases—its divine elixir arises from nothing beyond yin and yang and the Five Phases, thus its attribution to the *Zhouyi*.\n\"Jing\" means constancy. As a constant transmission from the sages, it is called a *jing*.\n\nThus, Lingyangzi on Mount Kongtong transmitted it to Attendant Xu, who passed it to Master Chunyu. Master Chunyu, gazing upon the hexagrams, modeled the vessel after heaven and earth, pairing it with *Qian* and *Kun*;\nthe medicines after *Kan* and *Li*, pairing them with water and fire, thus as sun and moon;\nthe crucible after Venus, also as the Quelling Star;\nthe furnace as the city walls.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams determined the waxing and waning, the measures of yin and yang, the solstices and equinoxes, the inversion of the crucible—hence the chapter title *Five Correlations*, correlating and explicating the preceding text. Compiled into a later fascicle, together with the first three, to represent the Three Powers, the crucible and medicine, and to symbolize the Three Luminaries.\nThe first fascicle discusses the formation of gold and mercury, the ascent and descent of sun and moon;\nthe second fascicle discusses the augmentation of firing times and the ten-month gestation;\nthe third fascicle, composed by Master Chunyu, further explicates the first two, likely from the original transmission of the Wei Lord.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Yi*.\n*Qian* and *Kun* refer to the crucible.\n*Qian* is the upper cauldron; *Kun* is the lower cauldron.\nThe *Yi* symbolizes gold and mercury as sun and moon, as medicinal substances.\nThe *Firing Decision* states: *Qian* takes form in the northwest, borrowing yang to dwell in the yin position;\n*Kun* takes form in the southwest, borrowing yin to dwell in the yang position—thus *Qian* borrows yin, and *Kun* borrows yang.\n*Qian* borrowing yin means that in the fifth month, one yin line is born;\n*Kun* borrowing yang means that in the eleventh month, one yang line is born.\nThus *Qian* initiates the fire, and *Kun* proceeds until *Zhen* receives the tally, concluding at the fifteenth day;\nthereafter *Kun* initiates the fire, also concluding at the fifteenth day.\n*Qian* emerges, *Kun* enters—opening and closing the crucible—hence they are the gates, both meanings applicable.\n\nThe parents of all hexagrams.\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of the sixty-four hexagrams; thus the great elixir cannot be nurtured without the crucible.\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: *Qian* is the father, *Kun* the mother;\n*Qian* is heaven, *Kun* earth.\nWithin the cosmos, nothing is not nurtured by *Qian* and *Kun*. All things grow through the yin and yang of heaven and earth—hence they are called parents.\n\n*Kan* and *Li* frame the enclosure.\nThis speaks of subduing mercury into the elixir, placing water above and fire below, or steeping the crucible in water to receive the qi of water and fire.\nThus the song says: \"Above, water becomes broth, flowing pearls guard the embankment.\"\nIt also refers to the medicinal substances: *Kan* is the Metal Duke, *Li* is vermilion mercury. Using these two treasures as the elixir, water and fire frame the upper and lower cauldrons.\n\"Kuang\" means to assist—both meanings are applicable.\n\nThe hub turns the axle; the enclosure is the vessel—male and female.\nThe hub is the vessel.\nThus *Qian* is yang, the female above;\n*Kun* is yin, the male below.\nThe crucible and cauldron refer to the firing process turning the vessel, like the sun and moon revolving within *Qian* and *Kun*, or like a wheel’s axle turning.\n\nThe four hexagrams serve as bolts and keys.\nThe four hexagrams are *Qian* and *Kun* symbolizing the vessel, *Kan* and *Li* symbolizing the medicine.\n\"Chong\" is the vessel; \"yue\" is the crucible.\nBolts and keys are installed on all four sides to secure it tightly.\nThus it says: the rope (*suo*) is the vessel; the key (*yue*) is the lock.\nLord Lao said: the rope is the *yao*; the key is the flute.\nThe hollow flute is blown, the *yao* breathes air into it, producing the tones of the pentatonic scale.\nThis means the crucible’s interior is hollow like a flute, using the *yao* fire’s qi to circulate it, like breath blowing a flute.\n\nCovering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang.\nYin and yang are the two medicines, gold and mercury.\n\"Mao\" means pressing within the crucible with gold flowers and the like.\n\"Fu\" means relying on the upper and lower veiling, called the secure boundary.\nThus *Qian* and *Kan* are yang; *Kun* and *Li* are yin.\nThus it says: the Dao of yin and yang, like the key circulating the *yao* fire’s qi, completes the elixir.\n\nLike a charioteer holding the bit and reins.\nThis means guarding the crucible, fearing loss.\nThe bit in the mouth must be tightly closed; the boundary must be firm like reins held in hand to circulate it—hence it does not cease.",

the four principles are interconnected.\nThus it proceeds through the *liji* cycles.\n*Ji* means \"month.\"\nIf speaking of sixty years as one *ji*, it is called *li* in terms of months.\nSixty hexagrams form one *ji*; for daily and nightly fire circulation, one hexagram is used per day, completing one cycle of the elixir over eleven months.\nThe lunar nodes have five or six:\nFive or six refers to the thirty days that make a month.\nEach month, the crucible is opened once for observation, the medicine is washed and refined, then returned to the crucible to form the first great elixir of the vessel.\nThe warp and weft serve the sun’s command.\nThis means the fire circulation follows the sun’s decree: *jing* is holding fast, and the morning is chosen by the day.\nThe weft follows the five stars, meaning all is held in accordance with the constellations.\nThus the moon receives the sun’s transformation, giving birth to the myriad things.\nTherefore, one selects the *yuan* day for plowing and favor, the fire day for killing mercury, the completion day for pounding, the harvest day for refining, the closing day for sealing in the crucible, the establishing day for offering to the furnace, and the king or minister days for ingesting the medicine.\nIn the eleventh month, the fire is kindled on the *shangyuan* day, following the sequence of *jia* days.\nFor example, if the *shangyuan* falls on *jiazi* before or after the winter solstice, and *jiayi* is also observed, the fire is kindled at midnight.\nAdditionally, the sixty-four hexagrams are combined:\n\"Combined\" refers to the night.\nIt means that following the sequence of *jia* days, fifty days are counted, and over sixty days, sixty hexagrams are traversed—one hexagram per hour—along with the prior *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* hexagrams, completing the sixty-four.\nThis is the daily fire circulation, and a month also uses sixty-four hexagrams.\nTwo hexagrams are used per day, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nA day uses sixty-four hours, where an hour is defined as changing the talisman every five days, breaking it down into smaller units to total sixty hours.\nFirmness and softness have outer and inner:\n*Qian* is firm and *Kun* is soft, representing the movement of yin and yang.\nThe east is the outer, from *zi* ending at *si*; the west is the inner, from *wu* ending at *hai*.\nMoreover, yang is the outer above, while yin is the inner below.\nAgain, firmness is the outer vessel, and softness is the inner medicine.\nThese three principles are all interconnected.\nOn the new moon, *Zhun* governs the affairs:\nThis means each day has one governing affair and one governing talisman.\n*Zhen* is the talisman for the first day of the new moon, with *Kan* above and *Zhen* below.\n*Kan* is the mercury medicine, and *Zhen* is the crucible from *zi* to *wu*; the vessel faces upward, and *Zhun* governs the affairs.\n*Zhen* is the governing talisman, thus it governs the day’s affairs.\nThe same applies to a month.\nIn the eleventh month, the *Kan* hexagram governs.\n*Kan* has three lines: the upper and lower are yin, and the middle is yang.\nIn the eleventh month, the yang line is born amid abundant yin, externally governing the two yin lines to enter, while the yang line commands them to emerge.\nBy the fifth month, the *Li* hexagram governs.\n*Li* has three lines: the upper and lower are yang, and the middle is yin.\nA single yin line is born amid abundant yang, yin governs the *Zhun* of yang, yin emerges and yang enters—hence at dawn, *Zhun* is used.\nAt dusk, *Meng* is received.\nAt dusk, *Gen* above is the governing talisman, with *Kan* below, forming the *Meng* hexagram.\nFrom after *wu* to *zi*, the vessel is turned downward to form the *Meng* hexagram, governing the affairs—thus it is said that *Meng* is received.\nIn the twelve hours of day and night, six hours are *Gen-Meng*, and six hours are *Zhen-Zhun*—hence *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night.\nThus *Yi* is used as the crucible vessel, with *Gen* above and *Zhen* below, forming the *Shan Lei Yi* hexagram.\n*Kan* is used as the medicine, *Kan* being mercury within *Zhen* and *Gen*.\nEach day and night uses one hexagram:\nThis means that in the twelve hours of a day, *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night, two hexagrams are used.\nA month thus uses sixty hexagrams.\nTheir use follows an order:\nThis means that in a day, a month, or a year, all employ the sixty hexagrams.\nA month begins with *Zhun* followed by *Meng*, the second month with *Xu* followed by *Song*, and so on until the elixir is completed at *Jiji*—hence it is called an order.\nThe earlier discussion of *Zhun* by day and *Meng* by night refers to the turning of the crucible vessel.\nThe later discussion of order refers to following the hexagrams and lines to determine the fire times.\nFrom *Ji* to *Wei*, until dawn and dusk.",

      "translated_text": "The *Ji* is the *Jiji* hexagram, and the *Wei* is the *Weiji* hexagram. *Jiji* means water above fire: mercury belongs to *Kan*, originally yang yet dwelling in the yin position. Within yin there is yang, which symbolizes cinnabar as the essence of the Great Yang, residing in the south and belonging to *Li*. *Li* contains yin within yang, thus *Li* is yin, being yin dwelling in the yang position. Now, when it transforms so that mercury is in the north and cinnabar in the south, the position changes mercury into cinnabar, returning the north to the south and restoring its original place—hence it is called *Jiji*. *Weiji* means fire above water: originally, mercury has not yet settled into its proper position, for mercury is born from cinnabar, belongs to *Li*, and is now yin, dwelling in the north. As it has not yet returned to the south, to its original position and fundamental nature, it is called *Weiji*. Moreover, when circulating through the sixty hexagrams, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, these two hexagrams mark the transition from the end of the lunar month to the new moon, cycling anew. *Shuang* means brightness. These two hexagrams embody the Dao of one yin and one yang. When the end is reached, it returns to the beginning.\n\nThis means that when the *Jiji* and *Weiji* hexagrams conclude one month, the following month again begins with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. This pattern holds for all twelve months. Thus, in the eleventh month, the *Kun* and *Fu* hexagrams commence, and at the month’s end, the next month’s new moon also concludes with the *Fu* hexagram. The end of one month becomes the beginning of the next, and each month thereafter follows the same sequence.\n\nThe celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure of time: a day consists of twelve hours, completing a full cycle of 365 degrees. A day’s *chen* refers to the twelve branches. Two hexagrams are used, each with six lines, and each line governs one *chen*, so the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams with their lines suffice for the twelve hours.\n\nMovement and stillness have their early and late phases. The movement of the vessel is determined by reversing before and after midnight: yang movement is early, yin stillness is late. Spring and summer likewise pertain to yang movement, while autumn and winter pertain to yin stillness.\n\nSpring and summer correspond to the inner body. Spring and summer are yang, beginning with the eleventh month after the winter solstice, when the first month *Zi* is established. Moving leftward for four months, the yang qi reaches its culmination in the east, which is the inner aspect. This spans from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. The firing process begins at *Zi* and moves leftward, ending at *Chen* and *Si*, where the yang qi is exhausted and mercury dies.\n\nAutumn and winter correspond to the outer aspect. Autumn and winter are yin, beginning after the summer solstice in the fifth month and ending at *Hai*, where the yin qi dissipates. Yin arises at *Wu* and ends at *Hai*, thus its image lies in the outer. The west is the outer. This spans from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. The process begins at *Wu* and concludes at *Xu* and *Hai*, where the yin path is extinguished. Mercury seeks to subside, for *Hai* and *Zi* are the spirits of water, *Kun* is black, and *Hai* is its proper position. *Qian* is where mercury ultimately subsides, completing the twelve-month cycle at the *Qian* position. The interaction of yin and yang, beginning with *Qian* and ending with *Kun*, follows the natural principle—thus the Great Return Elixir is accomplished.\n\nRewards and punishments align with spring and autumn, while darkness and brightness follow cold and heat. Spring and summer, being yang and bright, employ the martial fire as reward. Autumn and winter, being yin and dark, employ the civil fire as punishment. Darkness refers to night, brightness to dawn. This applies to a year, a month, or a day: the firing process must accord with the cold and heat of the seasons. Cold corresponds to civil fire, heat to martial fire. After the summer solstice, charcoal is added to use martial fire; after the winter solstice, charcoal is reduced to use civil fire—thus following the cold and heat.\n\nThe line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, and joy or anger arise in accordance with the time. The firing process follows the hexagrams and their line statements, applying fire according to each line. Fire possesses benevolence and righteousness: benevolence is the civil fire of joy, righteousness the martial fire of anger. Moreover, spring and summer correspond to benevolence and civil fire, bringing joy; autumn and winter correspond to righteousness and martial fire, bringing anger. This is the use of civil and martial fire. When the principle is upheld, there is joy; when the line statements are violated, there is anger. Just as when a ruler gains a loyal minister, the people rejoice and wind and rain are harmonious; but when a ruler gains a treacherous minister, there is constant anger and the cosmos is unsettled. The Dao of the elixir is the same: the use of civil and martial fire must follow the principle.\n\nThus, the sequence of the four seasons’ qi is observed. Qi here refers to fire. When the fire qi of the four seasons is applied, the four sequences of qi are fulfilled. By following the five phases, the principle is attained. Aligning the qi and fire of the five phases ensures the principle is realized.\n\nIn the conjoining of the Great Elixir and Great Medicine, success or failure in subjugation and refinement lies with the fire. If the fire is balanced and civil and martial fires are properly applied, the medicine will be free of flaws. If the fire is not aligned, even a refined medicine will scatter and fly away. Therefore, diligent care must be devoted to the fire. Just as when a state is at peace, the people rejoice, but when a state is unstable, all things suffer—so it is with the elixir.\n\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. *Qian* is heaven, *Kun* is earth—these are the crucible vessel. The establishment of positions refers to the union of yin and yang. The *Yi* is the sun and moon, which are the medicine. The medicine resides within the crucible, within *Qian* and *Kun*. *Kan* is the moon, which is lead. *Li* is the sun, which is mercury. The character *yi* (易) is formed by placing the sun above and the moon below, symbolizing the sun and moon within the crucible—hence it is said that the *Yi* operates within them.\n\nHeaven and earth are *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* is heaven, the upper lid of the crucible. *Kun* is earth, the lower lid of the crucible. The establishment of positions refers to arranging the positions where yin and yang unite. This means the crucible’s rim is crafted with male and female interlocking, embodying the union of yin and yang. The establishment of positions refers to the furnace’s arrangement of directions, stellar positions, and degrees, circulating *Qian* and *Kun* to determine yin and yang. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*.",

      "translated_text": "The great elixir is spoken of as the essence of the sun and moon, hence the sun and moon are called *Yi*. *Kan* (the moon) is metal, *Li* (the sun) is mercury, thus *Kan* and *Li* are used as the medicine. *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the crucible, so these four trigrams differ from the sixty-four hexagrams and have their own singular function. It is also said that water and fire must attack above and below, circulating the crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*—hence their dual function. Mercury resides within the crucible, requiring the action of water and fire to subdue and refine it into the great returning elixir.\n\nThe two functions originate from the foundational lines and positions: *Kan* and *Li* are the medicine, *Qian* and *Kun* are the crucible. Their line positions differ from those of the sixty-four hexagrams, being the original lines and positions. They circulate through the six voids. This means the two medicines, *Kan* and *Li*, within the crucible of *Qian* and *Kun*, are constantly assailed by water and fire, revolving and flying through east, west, south, north, above, and below—hence the six voids. The six voids are the six positions. Their movement is ever uncertain, with no fixed ascent or descent. This describes mercury’s reversal within the crucible. In a single day of twelve hours, six hours ascend and six descend, with no constant rule. From *zi* to *wu* is descent; from *wu* to *hai* is ascent. When yang departs, yin arrives; when yin departs, yang arrives—endlessly reversing, hence there is no fixed ascent or descent. Mercury, concealed within the crucible, is assailed above by water and fire and pressed below by civil and martial fire, yet through this ceaseless transformation it becomes the great returning elixir.\n\nMercury lies hidden and submerged, for the Metal Elder conceals itself within mercury, and mercury, receiving the Metal Elder, is submerged. The two substances mutually subdue and conceal themselves within the crucible—hence their hidden submersion. The Dipper transforms within. The Dipper refers to the balance scale placed atop the furnace, resembling the Northern Dipper in the sky. The Dipper’s handle follows the monthly establishment, turning each day and each hour just as it does each month. For example, if the crucible is opened at the end of the previous month, the Dipper’s handle points to *zi*; the following month it points to *chou*, and so on in sequence. The timing must be determined by the water clock. The crucible’s fire is regulated likewise, for the crucible, like the Northern Dipper, possesses the power of transformation.\n\nIt envelops and nurtures the myriad things, serving as the guiding principle of the Dao. \"Envelop\" refers to gold flowers and the like embracing mercury, as a child meets its mother, dragon and tiger devouring one another—hence it is called the Dao. Earth, gold flowers, and other substances are also used as clay to envelop gold and mercury within the crucible. \"Nurtures\" means it contains the myriad things. Once the elixir is completed, it is named the Purple Gold Sand Great Returning Divine Elixir, transmuting all things, reviving withered bones, turning earth and stone into treasure, and those who ingest it attain perfection—thus it is the guiding principle of the Dao.\n\nTo use the primordial to control the existent, the function of *qi* is emptiness. Yang is the primordial, yin is the existent. The existent is *Kan*-metal, the primordial is *Li*-mercury. These are the positions of *Kan* and *Li*, water and fire. Emptiness is the Dao. The Dao is the designation of emptiness, void, and the primordial, which transforms and gives birth to the myriad things. The primordial refers to the yang form; when the human primordial is perceived, it is called the harmonious *qi*. The existent is yin, congealed and obstructed, called the harmonious dual *qi*. When these interact, wind and rain are formed. Thus mercury, though yang, reverts to metal. Metal is the true yang elixir. Yet mercury and gold are yin; when yang obtains yin, it is called using the primordial to control the existent. *Qi* is fire, also belonging to yang. When gold and mercury are subdued by fire, the fire becomes empty, and the primordial medicine becomes the existent—hence the function of *qi* is emptiness.\n\nThus, one infers the waxing and waning. Waxing and waning refer to the ascent and descent of yin and yang. When waning, charcoal is removed; when waxing, charcoal is added. When ascending, the vessel is turned upward; when descending, it is turned downward. *Kan* and *Li* vanish and perish. *Kan* is metal, *Li* is mercury. When mercury receives the gold flower, they unite—hence their vanishing and perishing. This is no reckless fabrication; the discourse does not arise in vain. The transmitted methods and texts are not carelessly spoken but are based on the line images of yin and yang. Gold and mercury, being of the same kind, arise together—thus no empty theories are established, only true discourse.\n\nDrawing verification from signs, transmitting the method to the divine. Based on the line images and fire regulation, each month’s verification shows changes, communicating with the divine—thus mutual instruction occurs. \"Transmitting\" refers to the method. By following this method, the great returning elixir is achieved. Inferring categories and structuring characters, the original principle serves as proof. The great returning elixir is all derived from inferring yin and yang to obtain the images of *Kan* and *Li*, structuring them into the character *Yi* to take those of the same kind—gold and mercury unite to form the three elixirs, without unrelated verification.\n\n*Kan* is the essence of the moon, *Wu*; *Li* is the radiance of the sun, *Ji*—the sun and moon form *Yi*. Lead’s essence resembles the moon, belonging to *Kan* and *Wu*; mercury’s radiance resembles the sun, belonging to *Li* and *Ji*. Thus, the essence and radiance of the sun and moon combine to form the character *Yi*. Moreover, the two treasures of yin and yang: from the ninth to the eleventh month is the position of *Kan-Wu*, the extreme of yin. Yin’s essence ascends to become the moon, belonging to metal and water. Thus, the classics speak of metal as the nine-times refined essence of lead, not referring to true gold essence. The classics state: \"Suddenly use the treasure within the Dao, not the gold of the world.\" If the great elixir contains miscellaneous gold and silver, it cannot be ingested. Only mercury alone, when refined into the golden elixir, is the divine medicine. Though it is said to use nine-times transmuted silver essence, the lead has already become ash. It borrows the *qi* of silver to assist yang with yin.\n\nFrom the third to the fifth month is the position of *Li-Ji*, the culmination of yang. Yang’s essence ascends to become the sun, belonging to mercury and fire—hence the sun and moon form *Yi*. When the elixir obtains the union of gold and mercury, its essence and radiance naturally transform. Hard and soft unite. *Kan*-yang mercury is hard, *Li*-yin lead is soft—thus yin and yang unite to form the great elixir.",

This means the crucible’s rim is crafted with male and female interlocking, embodying the union of yin and yang. The establishment of positions refers to the furnace’s arrangement of directions, stellar positions, and degrees, circulating *Qian* and *Kun* to determine yin and yang. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*.",

      "translated_text": "Earth reigns over the four seasons. Earth is the flower, and also the crucible. Furthermore, the four yellows belong to earth, which dominates the four seasons—yet this does not mean yellow earth serves as the crucible. If an iron or metal crucible is used, its interior must be coated with yellow earth. Raw gold is thus employed, for it is also the golden flower, and yellow sprouts are called earth.\n\nThe net encompasses beginning and end. The beginning is the new moon, the end the dark moon; the net is the vessel. Again, the crucible’s interior is coated with yellow earth, and above it are applied golden flowers and yellow sprouts, sealed with yellow earth. Green, red, white, and black each occupy one direction: green is the east’s wood, the Azure Dragon, mercury; red is the south’s fire, cinnabar; white is the west’s White Tiger, the essence of metal; black is the north’s water, lead. Thus gold and mercury each reside in their respective directions, yet also belong to *wu-ji* and dwell in the central palace, all deriving from the central palace’s *wu-ji* power. Though gold and mercury bear two names, they pertain to the four directions and likewise belong to the central palace *wu-ji*, formed by earth’s agency.\n\nFor the medicine of true yang or solitary transformation, no additional ingredients are needed—only mercury and gold paired together. With time and fire-nurturing, they naturally transmute into the elixir. The process requires coating with yellow earth and sealing the medicine with earth; golden flowers and yellow sprouts should be applied half an inch thick. Golden flowers are true lead, formed when lead enters mercury. Yellow sprouts are made from calcined yellow lead. Since *Kan*-lead belongs to *wu* and *Li*-mercury to *ji*, they precisely correspond to *wu-ji*, thus inheriting earth’s power to transform mercury into the elixir.\n\nSome claim that cinnabar or sulfur transforms mercury into vermilion, calling sulfur supreme—this is incorrect. The *Yi* is imagery. \"Hanging images manifest brightness, none greater than the sun and moon.\" Thus the sun is vermilion mercury, and the moon belongs to lead-silver. Among the seventy-two minerals, none surpass lead and mercury, hence they are called by the names of sun and moon. Therefore, \"sun and moon\" form the character *yi*, entrusted to the *Zhou Yi*. Thus the Master said: \"Hanging images manifest brightness, none greater than the sun and moon.\" The brightness of hanging images is most wondrous in the *Yi*, which is likened to gold and mercury.\n\n\"Exhausting spirit to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.\" Exhausting spirit is fire, for fire transforms all things. \"Yang departs\" refers to the eleventh month of *Kun*, when one yang line is born, culminating in *Qian* as *Kun* ends—thus *Qian* departs. \"Yin arrives\" refers to the fifth month, when one yin line is born. Therefore, when yang departs, *Qian* wanes; when yin arrives, *Kun* waxes. That which comes extends; that which goes contracts. All this involves adding and calling forth changes in the hexagrams to direct the fire.\n\n\"Like spokes converging to turn the wheel\": this speaks of directing the fire to turn the vessel, as a wheel turns. The spokes are the thirty spokes sharing one hub—thirty days make a month, and the hub is the vessel. Thus the vessel turns for one month. \"Emerging and entering alternate in expansion and contraction\": yang emerges and yin enters. Emerging from *Zhen* completes *Qian*; entering *Xun* completes *Kun*. Waning becomes contraction; waxing becomes expansion. Directing the fire uses the elixir to form hexagrams.\n\nAnother method, the \"special method\": each month, open the crucible and double the raw mercury, driving the mercury into the vessel. Starting from one *liang*, continue for a full year, following the nine-fold addition and driving method. After one year, the fire turns it crimson; when subdued, it melts into a black ingot. Crushed and ground, it is returned to the crucible. Fired for another month, it turns purple—then cease.\n\nThere is also the \"true yang method\": take equal parts lead and mercury, beginning at the winter solstice. By the summer solstice, gradually increase the fire’s intensity, stopping at the next winter solstice. Each month, open it once to observe its state. After one cycle, the mercury alone rises above the lead in purple hue—this is called the \"true yang elixir of yang’s origin.\" Take this true yang and place it again in a pure golden-flower vessel. After another month, the purple color is complete.\n\nAnother method: each month, \"close the tiger and release the dragon,\" employing the \"augmenting dragon and restraining tiger\" technique. The dragon is mercury; the tiger is lead. Add realgar and return it to the crucible to form the elixir. These are the three methods—this *Contract* discusses the method of true yang.\n\nThe hexagrams contain three hundred eighty-four lines, each line corresponding to a tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams, which comprise three hundred eighty-four line images. One *jin* of medicine contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Calculating one day’s circulation completes one celestial revolution, with the small fire’s *qi* sufficient. Calculating one full year, the medicine receives the great fire’s *qi* in full, and the elixir is complete. This images the natural cyclical elixir, born by receiving the *qi* of the great yang.\n\nThe tally refers to using two hexagrams each day and month: one hexagram governs affairs, the other governs the tally. The tally also refers to the five tallies, golden flowers, and the like. It is said that the tally of heaven and earth is gold and mercury. The tally’s reckoning is measurement. The *Yi*’s elixir requires one full year to complete. The body directs the fire, taking the celestial revolution’s degrees. When the number is complete, the elixir is formed—this elixir has two meanings.\n\nThis *Triple Concordance* states: half a *jin* of mercury and half a *jin* of flowers combine to form the elixir, completed in one year. If it is white snow, nine transmutations take three years to form the \"special yang elixir.\" The upper limit is a hundred *jin*; the lower, one or two *jin*, completed in fifteen months.\n\n\"From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally.\" The dark moon ends *Kun*; the new moon transforms *Kun*.",
      "overlap_context": " lead has already become ash.

      "translated_text": "A single line constitutes *Zhen*; *Zhen* serves as the direct tally, while *Fu* serves as the direct affair. On this day, the twelve branches revolve. From *zi* to *si*, the Yang Way is complete, and the Yin Way arises—*ren-wu* ignites the fire. Another hexagram serves until *hai* concludes its duty. At the dawn of each new moon’s first day, *Zhen* stirs, like a tally, like a seal, determining the appointed task. At this juncture, it connects.\n\nConfucius said: “Heaven and Earth harmonize in union.” Thus, the crucible for fire must seal its juncture tightly. Heaven and Earth mate their essence; sun and moon mutually grasp and sustain. Heaven and Earth are the crucible. Essence is the quintessence of the elixir. Sun and moon are gold and mercury. *Dan* means to probe; *fu* means to sustain. It speaks of the two treasures within the vessel, amid the crucible of Heaven and Earth, revolving the fire of Great Yang to transform them. Let the two medicines of sun and moon mate their *qi* and essence, probing and sustaining one another to form the elixir. As Heaven’s *qi* descends and Earth’s *qi* ascends, sun and moon conjoin, Yin and Yang unite in mating—then auspicious transformations respond, mirroring the image of the elixir’s Way. This is called the time when *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally, answering the mandate, when firm and yielding mate, gold and mercury both emit their essence, linking sun and moon, Heaven and Earth mating their essence, all things transforming and coming to life. The Way of the elixir is likewise, all born of Yin and Yang.\n\nThe potent Yang spreads its mysterious bestowal: the potent Yang is mercury, the mysterious is lead. Lead essence refers to the essence of the nine leads, which, when met with fire, becomes water. It enters the mercury; the lead essence bestows and receives the mercury. The mercury, having obtained lead, disperses and enters the lead. After congealing, refining, and grinding, it is placed in the crucible, where fire is applied to form the Great Return Elixir. The yielding Yin transforms into the yellow wrap: the yielding Yin is the Metal Duke. When the Metal Duke obtains mercury, in the space of a fierce fire’s meal, it emits golden blossoms, called the mysterious yellow flowers. When these flowers are melted to wrap the mercury and placed in the crucible after fire is applied, they sizzle and crackle, forming layers like fish scales or golden blossoms. As their resisting sounds settle, the mercury submits to the fire, and the purple color signals the elixir’s completion. If not yet purple, continue firing—hence the following text says: “Sizzling like an infant longing for its mother, before half a *lou-ke* has passed, fish scales rise in playful waves.”\n\nThe *Central Chapter of the Golden and Azure* states: This discussion of potent Yang refers to realgar. The mysterious is mercury; the yielding is orpiment. It says to grind realgar into mud for the upper lid, mix orpiment with burned alum powder for the lower lid, and blend both with vinegar paste to encase dry cinnabar sand in a ball shape, then place it in a golden crucible. If not, use a clay vessel and apply fire for a full year to form the Purple Gold Return Elixir. It can transmute the five metals and, when ingested, grant longevity. Yet this *Canticle* does not use male and female but takes lead essence as the root, nurturing mercury alone to form the True Yang, the Divine Elixir of the One. Immortals ascend in feathered transformation.\n\nThe *Central Chapter* says: “When you wish to refine it, take yellow sprouts as the root.” The sprouts are lead essence. The *Lower Chapter* further says: “Refine and remove the Wu-du.” Based on this line, one should not use male and female but only the two treasures of lead and mercury. Thus, the Western Regions value yellow elixir, while China values cinnabar mercury as lead elixir. China’s product is called the Central Elixir.\n\nOnce the primordial chaos has conjoined, the root foundation is planted at the outset. The tree is mercury; the root foundation is the yellow sprout. *Quan-yu* means beginning. *Kun* is the crucible. It speaks of mercury obtaining the blossom and yellow sprout, conjoining in primordial chaos within the crucible to spontaneously form the elixir—hence all things arise from the primordial beginning. The primordial beginning is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, nurtured by *Qian* and *Kun*; thus, *Qian* and *Kun* are the vessel that gives birth and matures the elixir. It also says: *Kun* is orpiment. Mixed with gold, it forms the elixir—hence it is called the root foundation.\n\nCultivate and nurture within the calyx: when gold and mercury obtain fire for a year, their texture resembles severe frost, also like rising fish scales. Concentrate the spirit to form the body. The body is the substance. *Ning* speaks of gold and mercury obtaining fire: first liquid, then congealed, uniting as one body to become the divine elixir. Thus, in the eleventh month, a single Yang line is born. The *Yi* says: “At the first six, treading frost, solid ice—Yin begins to congeal.” Therefore, the elixir’s inception is taken at the first day of the eleventh month’s *shangyuan*, at the *zi* hour when a Yang line is born. Fire is applied to restrain the Yin of mercury, subdued by Yang to congeal as one body.\n\nAll creatures emerge along the path, none that wriggle do not follow. It speaks of the eleventh month, when a single Yang line is born and one line of *Kun* transforms into *Zhen*—Yang *qi* stirs. *Zhen* is thunder, is spring; hibernating insects all stir, none that do not follow the *qi* of Yin and Yang. Mercury is likened to a wriggling creature; when it obtains the fire *qi* of Great Yang and the fire of a single Yang line is applied, mercury, being a fusion of Yin and Yang, resonates and stirs, desiring to fly. The “all creatures” refers to all those who collectively craft the elixir—thus, though mercury desires to fly, it is restrained by the fire applied by the many. Desiring to fly yet desiring to submit, it wriggles forth from *Zhen*, stirred by the many yet unfree. It likens all things that wriggle and stir to being born of the Dao—thus, when immortals obtain the elixir, their transformations into golden bones and jade bodies all arise from the elixir’s transmutation.\n\nThereupon, Zhongni praised the vast chaos: *Qian* and *Kun* attain penetrating emptiness. *Qian* and *Kun* are the cauldron; *dong* is the furnace. *Xu* means to contain fire—it speaks of gold and mercury obtaining fire, circulating freely within the vessel. Investigating antiquity, it accords with the Primordial Sovereign. The *Guansui* established the initial beginning. The Primordial Sovereign is the First Sovereign, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign Lord Lao, who established this method of refining and restraining the divine elixir. Refining mercury into the elixir enables one to achieve longevity, as described in the *Zhouyi Cantongqi Zhu*, Volume One—ingesting it grants feathered transformation.",

      "translated_text": "The term *guan* means \"to close.\" *Sui* refers to mercury, also called the \"wifely maiden.\" Closing the mercury within the crucible, one nurtures it with gentle fire to prevent it from scattering. As the *Book of Songs* says: *\"Guan-guan cry the turtledoves.\"* Male and female summon one another—this illustrates how mercury, when harmonized with the golden flower, achieves union, thus forming the elixir through the mutual summoning of male and female. Without the primordial male and female, how could one subdue and transform them into the elixir?\n\nThe male is mercury; the female is the essence of lead. The Nine Primordial Lords state: \"Taking mercury alone is called 'solitary yang.' Taking only the lead flower is called 'solitary yin.'\" Thus, lead and mercury require each other to form the elixir. Another scripture says: \"Refining the essence of lead secures my body and life; sevenfold-returned cinnabar transforms my ordinary nature.\" It also states: \"Transmuting mercury into the elixir allows one to sit upon the jade altar.\" The elixir cannot be formed without yin and yang; without them, it will never attain principle. When the two ingredients combine to form the elixir, they perfectly accord with the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nThe scriptures say: \"Borrow the qi of lead to form the elixir, but one must later remove the lead.\" Taking the mercury elixir alone may also have its principles. If it is ninefold-transformed lead flower, it may be taken for a long time. If it is first-generation flower buds used as the seed principle, one must still remove the lead, lest it harm the practitioner. The method for removing lead involves forming cinnabar, subduing the fire, and then shaping it into pellets. The medicine is pelletized, and the cinnabar is washed with yellow lead water. Placed on a crucible with fire on all sides, the lead naturally melts and drains away, leaving the mercury alone, seated in crystalline purity. Once the lead is removed, it is returned to the vessel and nurtured for sixty days to form the elixir. When it turns purple, the process is complete.\n\nWithin the vessel, it is sometimes heated with intense fire, and a water basin is placed above. The medicine remains at the center, or the lead may rise to form a lead cake atop it—this is called the \"lead shedding its embryo\" method. Thus it is said: \"Use the essence of lead as the seed.\" After the mercury is subdued and transformed into the elixir, the lead naturally separates. Over time, the lead turns to ash; or if the fire is too strong, the flower buds may transform into mercury encased in lead, forming the elixir within. The lead ash may also rise to the top, though few practitioners today grasp this method.\n\nSome speak of using sevenfold-returned cinnabar mixed with ninefold-refined lead powder, placed in the crucible and fired. Without understanding its principles, ignorant of yin and yang, or miscalculating the fire’s measures, the mercury will fly away, leaving only the lead, its color resembling yellow lead. They then claim the mercury has been subdued by fire to form the elixir. Those who ingest this will grow heavy in the waist, their bodies sluggish, their yin essence depleted, and they will lose all hope of attaining longevity. Testing it with subdued fire reveals the truth: if lead is burned with fire, it produces a red liquid that, when cooled, becomes soft, white, and heavy. If subdued fire is used, it returns to its original color, red or purple like powder, crumbling at the touch. Thus, one knows that only mercury subdued by fire may be ingested.\n\nThe great elixir arises solely from lead. Only when the lead is exhausted and the mercury subdued may it be taken. Without lead, there is no principle to be attained. The lead must be ninefold-transformed refined flower—this is not common white lead. If it has undergone seven returns, that is also excellent.\n\nThe phrase *\"crown and marriage, qi intertwined\"* speaks of mercury subdued by lead, like husband and wife. Mercury is the husband; lead is the wife—hence \"crown and marriage.\" *Qi* refers to fire. When fire is applied, they unite and intertwine like husband and wife. Only when the qi of yin and yang meet do they conjoin. A full year brings forth the sprout.\n\n*Yuan* means a full cycle. Sixty days make one *yuan*. The *Zhu Jia Jing* states: \"Sixty *jiazi* form one Great *Yuan*.\" When mercury undergoes a year of fire qi, yin and yang unite in intercourse, giving rise to form. The sprout emerges, flourishing into the elixir, its red strands beautiful in principle. This refers to mercury beginning its gradual growth in the eleventh month.\n\nAs for *\"determining the qi of the *yuan* through the movement of hexagrams,\"* each five-day period constitutes a *xun*, and fifteen *xun* make one *jiazi*. Six *xun* of six *jia* complete one day and sixty hours. Each day’s movement must fulfill one full cycle of qi.\n\nThe sage does not act in vain. The sage—here referring to the Most High Perfected One—transforms the great elixir to grant humans longevity and feathered transformation. Only mercury possesses numinous mutability; none but the sage could comprehend it. Thus, this method was established not in vain.\n\n*\"Above, observe the manifest celestial tally.\"* The tally refers to the direct tally. Master Xu gazed upward at the hexagrams to determine yin and yang. The upper crucible’s bottom is dark and mysterious like the heavens; the lower crucible resembles the earth. Within them reside the sun and moon, representing the Three Powers. Thus, they are entrusted to manifest in heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations. Mercury is likened to the sun, lead to the moon, and the vessel to the stars. The upper and lower crucibles represent heaven and earth. Thus, the great elixir embodies the essence of the sun and moon, communicating with natural transformations as if tally and contract. Hence, it is called the \"manifest celestial tally.\" The tally is heaven’s pledge, and thus the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes* were established.\n\nThe celestial tally has advance and retreat. Advance and retreat refer to the direct tally, determining yin and yang and adjusting the charcoal measures. In the eleventh month, one yang line advances while one yin line retreats; by the fifth month, one yin line advances while one yang line retreats. During retreat, charcoal is reduced by one and a half catties; during advance, it is increased by no more than three catties.\n\n*\"Contracting and extending in accord with the seasons\"* speaks of the new moon to the full moon as extension, and the full moon to the dark moon as contraction. During contraction, yin wanes; during extension, yang waxes. When yang waxes, charcoal is added; when yin wanes, charcoal is reduced. The fire formulas are clearly expounded.\n\nThus, *\"The *Book of Changes* governs the heart of heaven.\"* The *Changes* are the sun and moon—lead and mercury. Within the vessel, which is like heaven, they reside at heaven’s heart. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* comprehensively discusses the affairs of heaven and earth, establishing images to exhaust words and words to exhaust meaning. This concludes the preceding discussion.\n\nFrom here onward, the elixir’s meaning discusses fire until *\"losing its companion.\"* The hexagram *Fu* establishes the initial sprouting.",

      "translated_text": "The hexagram *Fu* clarifies the initial kindling of fire. In the eleventh month, the *Kun* hexagram transforms one yang line into the *Zhen* hexagram, becoming *Fu*. \"Beginning\" means inception. The inception arises from the *Fu* hexagram, gradually establishing the sprout, which then grows until it culminates in *Qian*. The eldest son inherits the father’s body—this is illustrated by the *Zhen* hexagram. *Zhen* is the eldest son of *Qian*. It is said that *Kun*’s single line transforms into *Zhen*, and by the fourth month, it becomes the *Qian* hexagram, thus inheriting the father’s body. The foundation is laid through the mother—this is illustrated by the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun* is the mother of *Zhen*, and thus the foundation is laid through the mother, transforming into *Zhen*.\n\nThe waxing and waning correspond to the pitch pipes. *Huangzhong* is the name of the pitch pipe for the eleventh month, and thus *Huangzhong* is the pitch pipe for the birth of the first yang line. By the fifth month, it corresponds to the waning of the *Linzhong* pitch pipe. In the twelfth month, the second yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Dalu*, corresponding to the *Lin* hexagram. In the first month, the third yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Taicu*, corresponding to the *Tai* hexagram. In the second month, the fourth yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Jiazhong*, corresponding to the *Dazhuang* hexagram. In the third month, the fifth yang line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Guxi*, corresponding to the *Guai* hexagram. In the fourth month, the sixth yang line is born, and as yang nears its end, yin qi arises; the pitch pipe is *Zhonglü*, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram. This is the waxing of yang from *Kun*’s single line. By the fifth month, the *Qian* hexagram’s yang lines transform, and the first yin line is born; the pitch pipe is *Ruibin*, corresponding to the *Gou* hexagram. In the sixth month, the second yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Linzhong*, corresponding to the *Zhu* hexagram. In the seventh month, the third yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Yize*, corresponding to the *Pi* hexagram. In the eighth month, the fourth yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Nanlü*, corresponding to the *Guan* hexagram. In the ninth month, the fifth yin line is born, and the pitch pipe is *Yingshe*, corresponding to the *Bo* hexagram. In the tenth month, yin qi perishes and yang qi arises, corresponding to the *Yingzhong* pitch pipe and the *Kun* hexagram. Thus, yin is waning, and yang is waxing, cycling endlessly.\n\nThe operation of these two hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun*, guides the observation of fire. Therefore, the true person’s movements are governed by fire, and this fire is the qi of yin and yang. If the fire is too swift, the medicine scorches and is lost; if too slow, it may not be subdued. Thus, the waxing and waning must correspond to the pitch pipes, and the charcoal quantity must ensure the medicine neither loses its color nor its moisture.\n\nTherefore, in one year, the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams are used, and these two hexagrams have twelve lines, each line governing one month. Furthermore, in one month, two hexagrams are used, each governing two and a half days, with *Qian* and *Kun* each governing fifteen days. In one day, two hexagrams are used, each hexagram governing one period. Thus, the waxing and waning of the year, month, and day must be observed, and the addition or reduction of charcoal must correspond to the pitch pipes without error.\n\nThe ascent and descent are based on the pivot of the Dipper. From *zi* to *si*, yang descends; from *wu* to *hai*, yin ascends. When ascending, the crucible’s opening faces upward; when descending, the crucible’s opening faces downward. This refers to the inverted wheel of the vessel, and it is also like placing the Dipper’s handle atop the furnace. It turns in accordance with the monthly establishment and the twelve periods, applying fire accordingly.\n\nOn the third day, the moon emerges as dawn—*Zhen* receives *geng* in the west. This is explained by the *Zhen* hexagram. On the third day, the moon emerges in the west at the *geng* position. \"Dawn\" means brightness. *Geng* belongs to *Zhen*, for *Kun*’s single line transforms into *Zhen*, and thus one yang line is born, so *Zhen* is bright. On the first day, fire is kindled, and the yang fire and yang line receive the fire qi, transforming one *liang* of mercury. On the second day, yin arises again, and the mercury seeks to fly. On the third day, the yang line is again subdued, and the mercury is again restrained. Within fifteen days, the mercury flies and is subdued in alternation. Beyond fifteen days, the mercury is half-subdued, resembling the full moon. It is slightly dry but not yet fully subdued by fire.\n\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the first quarter is level as a string. This is explained by the *Dui* hexagram. *Dui* is the metal of the west, and its hexagram has one yin line above and two yang lines below. Due to the two yang lines, the moon emerges at *ding* on the eighth day. *Ding* belongs to *Dui*. It is said that when mercury receives the fire qi of the eighth day, metal and mercury merge into a liquid, level but not yet transformed.\n\nBy the fifteenth day, the *Qian* body is established, and it is full in the *jia* eastern direction. This is explained by the *Qian* hexagram. By the fifteenth day, fire transforms *Kun* into *Qian*, so the metal and mercury are slightly dry by the fifteenth day, aligning with the firm hexagram, like the full half-moon. Moreover, on this day, the sun rises in the east, and the three yang lines are complete, thus it is said to be full in *jia*, which belongs to *Qian*.\n\nThe toad and hare shine brightly; the two qi of the sun and moon are paired. The toad is the essence of the moon, which is lead. The hare is the essence of the sun, which is mercury. It speaks of the two essences of the sun and moon, thus they are said to be paired. \"Shine\" means brightness. Though the mercury is dry by the fifteenth day, like water, it is round, full, and clear, yet fire has not yet been applied. If making yellow or white elixir, the mercury is subdued by fire for one month; if making the great elixir, the mercury is subdued by fire for three hundred and fifty days. Yet the elixir is not yet formed, likened to the essence of the moon’s water, which cannot shine on its own but borrows the sun’s illumination. Though mercury is numinous, without the nine-fold refined essence of lead, it cannot subdue fire and transform into the elixir on its own. Thus, the scripture says: To cover the sparrowhawk, one must obtain the young; to plant grain, one must obtain the millet—without the proper kind, nothing grows. Mercury, without lead as its seed, cannot form the elixir; yellow and white, without gold and silver, cannot become treasure. It is like the hare, the essence of the sun, emitting light to shine upon the moon, thus it is said the hare shines brightly.\n\nThe toad observes the hexagram’s nodes, while the hare emits its radiance. \"Observes\" means to see. Lead observes mercury, and mercury is lead. Observing mercury, mercury is exchanged, and thus lead is obtained. Lead then emits light, and once subdued by fire, both emit their essence and radiance, like the moon, though bright, borrowing the sun’s illumination to shine upon the world. By the moon’s darkening, the sun and moon share the same lodging, and their two lights shine together, yet their transformation is not called brightness.",

      "translated_text": "When the moon wanes, they part, and in parting, there is brightness. On the eighth day, the hare’s form fades; by the fifteenth day, the toad is fully visible—hence it is called radiant. By the sixteenth day, the hare’s shadow vanishes, its light withdrawn, so the toad observes the hexagram’s nodes.\n\nThe seventh and eighth days mark the Way’s completion, bending and descending low. This hexagram clarifies the proper positions of yin and yang. By the fifteenth day, yang is diminished; when the moon is full, it begins to wane, its form gradually fading. It transforms from *qian* to *xun*, bending the firm into the yielding.\n\nThe seventh and eighth days span from the fifteenth to the full moon, just as the beginning and middle employ this principle. Thus, this hexagram is borrowed to complete the *qian* hexagram’s image, hence it is said: *Qian* follows the Way from the new moon. On the sixteenth day, the transition of governance occurs, and *xun* appears at dawn’s first light. As the *xun* hexagram reveals its yielding nature—by the sixteenth day, *qian* alters one line to become *xun*. A single yin line emerges, transforming the firm into the yielding. *Xun* receives *qian*’s transformation, thus it is said to receive governance. Governance means leadership, for *xun* takes the lead.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, the moon rises in *xun* and travels to the *xin* position, where dawn breaks. It is said that by the sixteenth day, the light is about to be subdued by fire to form the elixir. *Gen* aligns with the south at *bing*; the lower crescent appears on the twenty-third day. As the *gen* hexagram reveals its stillness—one yang line above, two yin lines below—two yin lines emerge, and *qian* gradually diminishes, transforming into *gen*. On the twenty-third day, the moon reaches *bing*, where dawn breaks. It is said that by the twenty-third day, mercury, like an unmoving mountain, crystallizes into fish scales, ready for the yellow and white to be subdued by fire. *Gen* means stillness.\n\nBy the thirtieth day, *kun* at *yi* in the northeast loses its companion. As the *kun* hexagram reveals its end—*qian* is entirely diminished, three yin lines arise, transforming into *kun*. *Kun* is yin, and yin’s inception belongs to *kun*, which corresponds to *yi*. On the thirtieth day, the moon wanes at *yi*. *Yi* is *kun*’s position, residing in the southwest. Now appearing in the east at *yi*, the dark and new moons intersect, shifting from *gen* to *kun*—hence it is said: in the northeast, it loses its companion. The *Book of Changes*’ *Kun* hexagram states: “In the northeast, it loses its companion, yet in the end, there is celebration.” Celebration comes when yin joins yang, illustrating how lead and mercury, after uniting with fire, ultimately form the elixir in joy. If crafting the yellow and white, a month’s work suffices. If making the Great Elixir, a year’s fire and qi complete it, and the Lesser Returning Elixir is achieved.\n\nFor the moon, a month’s end transforms *qian* into *kun*, cycling endlessly. After a full year, the celestial fire is complete. When the cycle ends, succession follows, and at the juncture, the dragon is reborn. The cycle’s end marks the month’s conclusion. Succession begins at the new moon’s division, where lines intersect. From *kun*, one line gives rise to *zhen*, which is the dragon—hence the dragon’s rebirth. The previous month concludes, and fresh mercury is added. For the Golden Elixir, dragon and tiger are added, entering the crucible for refinement. Again, *kun*’s initial six lines yield one yang line, rising as the *Fu* hexagram. Thus, when *kun*’s cycle ends, *zhen* receives renewal, continuing as before, emerging from *kun*’s juncture.\n\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*:\n*Jia* is yang’s beginning, *ren* its end; *yi* is yin’s beginning, *gui* its end. *Qian* governs *jia* and *ren*; *kun* governs *yi* and *gui*. *Qian* knows the Great Beginning, while *kun* takes its end, illustrating a full cycle of transformation. These also serve as medicinal substances: *jia* and *yi* are the Azure Dragon (mercury), *ren* and *gui* the Dark Warrior (lead), the two substances paired. *Qian* and *kun* encompass beginning and end. Whether a year, a month, or a day, fire is directed by the two hexagrams *qian* and *kun*. The initial fire begins with *qian* and *kun*—this is the starting point. These two hexagrams are ever used, for *qian* is yin’s inception, *kun* yang’s inception. *Qian* arises at the beginning; beginning is the start. *Kun* governs the end; the end is the month’s close. Thus, *qian* and *kun* cycle endlessly, binding together.\n\nSeven and eight make fifteen—seven and eight are the fifteenth day, when mercury receives fifteen days of fire. Nine and six also correspond. The four combine to make thirty, and the *Yi*’s qi seeks concealment. Nine and six, with seven and eight, total thirty, completing a month’s fire cycle. The *Yi* is the medicine. The fire’s virtue directs the qi of yin and yang, gradually concealing it each month—subduing the fire. Thus, when yang vanishes, yin hides, completing a month’s cycle. Seven is young yang, eight young yin; nine old yang, six old yin. The four combine to make thirty, forming a month, hence the qi of yin and yang waxes and wanes. Like the midwinter season, when grasses and trees wither. Assisting yang, one entreats the merchants; the lord deeply conceals himself.",
      "overlap_context": "while the hare emits its radiance. \"Observes\" means to see. Lead observes mercury, and mercury is lead. Observing mercury, mercury is exchanged, and thus lead is obtained. Lead then emits light, and once subdued by fire, both emit their essence and radiance, like the moon, though bright, borrowing the sun’s illumination to shine upon the world. By the moon’s darkening, the sun and moon share the same lodging, and their two lights shine together, yet their transformation is not called brightness.",

      "translated_text": "To examine means to investigate. Those who jointly cultivate the elixir must scrutinize one another’s dispositions. Only when their aspirations are harmonious and their devotion to the Way is pure may they collaborate in the work of the elixir. This is the synthesis and examination of the Three Powers. The Three Powers are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\nThe task of compounding the elixir and refining the medicine is no trifling matter. Above, one selects an auspicious time and observes the celestial configurations. Below, one surveys the land, positioning the site to face the sun and turn from the shade. In the midst, one examines human nature, ensuring that temperaments are gentle and kind. The sublimation of the elixir and the refinement of the stone are matters that commune with the divine. To neglect the selection of mountains and earth is to deplete one’s essence and harm the practitioner. To fail in determining yin and yang is to risk peril and failure in the elixir. Where the heart harbors misgivings, even companions will doubt. If two people are thus in accord, they must not act hastily in their joint endeavor.\n\nThus, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* emerged as diagrams, and the sages—like the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao when siting the capital—established their enterprise at Luoyang. When the Three Powers are fully prepared, there will be no omens of fortune or misfortune. In action, one follows the nodal points of the trigrams—these *nodes* refer to the winter and summer solstices. After the summer solstice, one relies on the *Qian* and *Kun* trigrams to circulate fire, for all transformations in the circulation of fire are based on the movements of the *Qian* and *Kun* lines. In stillness, one adheres to the *Xiang* commentary. Thus, the *Xiang* speaks of images, while the lines speak of change; yang moves and yin is still, and one follows the nodal points of the trigrams. This means that the circulation of fire must follow the dynamic and static transformations of yin and yang, just as the *Xiang* commentary describes movement and stillness.\n\nWhen *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. How could one not follow this? If one circulates fire in accordance with *Qian* and *Kun*, applying firmness and yielding in due measure, what could not be achieved? Thus, the Way of *Qian* bestows benevolence, and the Way of *Kun* bestows righteousness; when the world is ordered, how could the four seasons not proceed in harmony? Just as when ruler and minister, through virtuous governance, bring peace to the myriad families, how could the realm not enjoy tranquility and prosperity?\n\n**The Primacy of Governance**\n*Governance* means to unify; *rule* means to order; *primacy* means the beginning. This speaks of constantly upholding governance in accordance with principle, preserving order from beginning to end.\n\n**Sealing with Meticulous Care**\n*Sealing* refers to the key; *binding* means to fasten; *subtle* means fine. This speaks of securing the crucible as if locking it with a key, ensuring that every detail is tightly bound so that the essence does not escape.\n\n**Unfolding and Displaying the Treasure**\nThis means that once a month, one opens the vessel to grind, refine, and wash the ingredients. One augments the dragon and restrains the tiger, applies the earthen seal, and then repeats the process of the previous month. Having arranged the two treasures within the vessel, when the days are fulfilled, one opens it to reveal the completed elixir.\n\n**The Pivotal Handle of the Essential Way**\nThe *pivotal handle* is the guiding principle. One places a balance beam atop the furnace, with the handle of the Northern Dipper aligned to receive the dripping water. The handle of the Dipper points to the lunar station of the month, and the turning of the Dipper’s handle assists in the circulation of fire within the crucible. The *binding* refers to the attachment at the Dipper’s side. One also subjugates mercury to form a \"heavenly silver vessel,\" fastening it with a small, elongated chain like a belt, constantly binding the crucible and suspending the mercury within the furnace. If the mercury threatens to escape, one must immediately quench it with water. Likewise, if the elixir vessel or crucible becomes scorching hot, one must quench it with water. The Western King governs metal, which is tempered by firmness; this analogy illustrates the need to subjugate mercury and prevent the loss of primordial essence.\n\nMoreover, the *Yi* is the guiding principle of transformation, and the reversal of the elixir is likewise governed by it.\n\n**The Rise of Fortune and Misfortune within the Lines and Images**\nOne acts in accordance with the lines and images of the trigrams, moving in harmony with yin and yang. Within the crucible, fortune and misfortune arise from adherence or deviation.\n\n**The Five Planets in Disarray or Alignment, Responding to Stimuli**\nThe *Five Planets* are the five stars. The vessel corresponds to Saturn, the fire to Mars, the water placed above to the Northern Star, the golden flowers to Venus, and the mercury to Jupiter. If the four seasons respond appropriately, there will be no failures or setbacks; without the elixir, there would be no resonance.\n\n**The Twenty-Eight Constellations in Discord, with Excess and Reversal**\nThe *Twenty-Eight Constellations* are the twenty-eight lunar stations. *Excess* means extravagance. If one is indulgent and negligent, the medicine will scatter. *Reversal* refers to inverting the crucible once a day. Thus, the circulation of fire must follow the twenty-eight lunar stations.\n\n**The Literary Glory Compiles the Records**\n*Literary Glory* refers to the six stars beside the Northern Dipper, which govern the six ministries. All records and compilations are collectively overseen, and the movements of the stars are consulted. This analogy illustrates that the Way of the elixir is likewise governed by celestial configurations.\n\n**The Censorate Demands Accountability from the Assistants**\nThe *assistants* are the auxiliary stars of the Northern Dipper. This refers to the crucible, where the Dipper is placed above and the vessel below, symbolizing the Northern Dipper and its platform. The *Three Terraces* are star names. The *three nails* represent the alignment, each with its own governance, with the literary star presiding.\n\n**The Hundred Officials Each Oversee Their Respective Domains**\n*Domains* refer to jurisdictions; *offices* refer to responsibilities. This speaks of the great elixir, which draws its symbols from Heaven and Earth, the constellations, the sun, and the moon, each with its own governance. The *records* are the overseers.\n\n**The Sun Harmonizes the Essences of the Five Phases**\nThe *sun* is mercury. Mercury responds to the essences of the Five Phases, ascending to become the sun. Cinnabar is fire, and its essence transforms into the Azure Dragon, the essence of wood. Mercury is the essence of water.

      "translated_text": "Thus *Laozi* states: \"That which is seen yet unseen is called *yi*.\" *Yi* is the Dao of *xi* and *yi*—the subtle and imperceptible. Though invisible, it is not distant to seek; only through the awakening of the heart is it grasped. The standard is like a silver crucible, where subdued mercury turns white, the mercury residing within the vessel. Each moment—one division, one quarter-degree—when placed upon the tripod marks a *ke*. A day and night comprise twenty-four *ke*; a month, seven hundred twenty. By this reckoning, mercury dies in one month, subdued by fire to become treasure. This is the division of *ke*, not the water-clock’s measure. A day consists of one hundred *ke*. When mercury is subdued, by month’s end the vessel glows crimson, its red radiance turning white. Should faint black specks remain, it is not yet subdued—proceed with the method of yellow and white. First, coagulate mercury into cinnabar and place it in the vessel. \"Seen yet unseen\" refers to the elixir, which remains invisible.\n\nWithin the yellow, principle gradually permeates, moistening and nourishing to reach the skin. This speaks of gold and mercury tempered by fire. As jade transforms, after long days and months with abundant fire, the elixir gradually forms—purple, lustrous, and moist. When ingested, it suffuses the skin. \"At first rectify, then refine to the end\" means that at the month’s beginning, the principle is rightly placed in the vessel, and at its close, it is further refined. \"The stem stands, yet cannot be grasped\"—*gan* is the blossom of *qian*. It signifies that the original *qian*-blossom buds may be ground and added, or fire-melted blossoms turned to liquid and combined with mercury. Alternatively, dry mercury and cinnabar first, then grind them with blossom buds into powder. Like flour, it may be placed in the tripod. Without the root as its kind, there is no foundation; a single misstep renders all futile. On the day the elixir forms, it enters the *gan* to be grasped. Yet even if the *gan* is as one whose talent, though refined, conflicts with the Dao and conduct, who clings to self-will and relies on power and prestige, it remains unfit for the cultivation of the elixir’s flourishing.\n\nThus, to cultivate the elixir, one must obtain its root-kind—without the original root, it is difficult to succeed. The root is the golden blossom and yellow sprout. One is concealed—#79 veiled, unknown to the vulgar. That \"one\" is the Dao. Therefore, \"one who knows the One completes all things.\" The One is mercury, which belongs to the Water of the north. The number of Water is one; one is the method. The One is also lead—black lead, which belongs to Water, whose number is likewise one. Within lead lies concealed white gold; the child within lead contains its mother in two senses, hence the vulgar #81 cannot know it.\n\nSupreme virtue is originally non-action, not seeking through scrutiny.

      "translated_text": "The person of supreme virtue is one of nameless origin; they act without contrivance, desire without thought. Their mind is like dead ashes, their form like withered wood. Seated in oblivion, they inwardly illuminate, yearning only for long life. They seek no profit or sustenance, yet cultivate the elixir’s defense. Their resolve lies in attainment, focused solely on the One, never scrutinizing external affairs.\n\nThe person of inferior virtue is one of manifest renown, acting with purpose and seeking. Though their mouth professes love for the Dao, their heart covets alchemical gold and silver. They prize fame and wealth, indulging in sensual pleasures and learning. Once they obtain the elixir’s method, they flaunt it, using it ceaselessly, leaking the celestial tally and drifting far from the Dao.\n\nIf the elixir-cultivator conceals their virtue to align with the Dao, they merge with the Great Dao, and the elixir’s method is surely perfected. To reveal the named elixir is to invite the law’s penalty and failure.\n\nWhen the upper is sealed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is sealed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. \"Being\" is the medicine; \"non-being\" is emptiness. When the upper is sealed and called \"being,\" it is the upper crucible where the medicine ascends. When the lower is sealed, it is the lower crucible, and the medicine is empty. By reversing the vessel thus, water serves above and below, and the divine elixir resides above. The upper holds the lower’s non-being—such is the principle.\n\nThis method of the two apertures also requires the breath’s #82 sighing. The two apertures refer to the upper and lower crucibles. Opening and closing the mercury within the crucible, the fire’s qi produces a moaning sound—hence the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl. Dragon and tiger are within, thus they mutually require one another.\n\nFrom the head to the north, the fire is circulated through the hexagrams, crucibles, ruler and minister, and the Dao’s virtue—this is the elixir’s path, most revered and noble, hence called the virtue of ruler and minister. What follows gradually expounds the elixir’s meaning.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the numinous illumination. The white is mercury; the black is Metal Elder. When Metal Elder guards, it obtains the mercury, and thus the numinous illumination arrives.\n\nThe white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. The essence of metal is mercury. As the grandson of metal, it is also called \"moist silver,\" hence \"essence of metal.\" The black is Metal Elder—Metal Elder belongs to the Water of the north, thus called the foundation of water. The white, as silver, is of one meaning.\n\nMoreover, the essence of metal is when mercury enters Metal Elder and spouts a blossom, called the essence of metal, also named the \"mysterious-yellow blossom\" or \"golden blossom.\" Thus, when Metal Elder obtains mercury, the essence of the golden blossom flows forth. Seeing Metal Elder’s black color, it is the root-foundation of mercury, which sprouts the yellow sprout—hence named Metal Elder.\n\nThe yellow blossom is also called \"Single Gate,\" \"Purple Powder,\" \"Standing Control Stone,\" \"Stone Gall,\" \"Flowing Pearl,\" \"Autumn Stone,\" \"Mysterious White,\" \"Yellow Lightness,\" \"Tally of Heaven and Earth,\" \"Pact of Heaven and Earth,\" \"River Chariot,\" \"Golden Dog,\" or \"Golden Tiger.\" It has many names, which cannot all be recorded.\n\nThus, in compounding the elixir, one cannot do without the blossom and sprout as the root.

      "translated_text": "Water is the pivot of the Dao, and its number is named One. As lead and mercury both belong to the northern Water phase, the number of Water is One—this means Heavenly One generates Water. Moreover, the Dao generates the One, and the One is the beginning of the Five Phases, the pivot and mechanism of the Dao. Thus, one catty each of lead and mercury is used. According to this scripture, using one catty of mercury accords with Heaven’s measure and the numbers of the *Book of Changes*; this is the Yin Prime Elixir, with one catty as one dose. If one catty of cinnabar is used, with yellow lead as the covering base, it is called the Yang Prime Elixir. For an elixir of pure Yang transformation, yellow sprout is used. Otherwise, one *liang* of golden blossom serves as the foundation, added month by month, totaling thirty catties after nine months—this is also called the Special Nine Cycles Method. Thus, the methods of Returning Elixir number several schools; though their transformations differ, their crafting follows the same principle. Those who grasp the reason, all produce the Great Elixir. Yet only when fire is mastered does it become the supreme immortal medicine.\n\nAt the beginning of Yin and Yang, the Mysterious contains the yellow sprout. As lead belongs to Water, it is called \"Mysterious.\" Within raw lead lies the yellow sprout, resembling gold in form—hence the name \"yellow sprout.\" Lead is the master of the Five Metals and the northern River Chariot. Thus, lead is black on the outside but harbors golden blossom within. Yin is Metal Elder, and Yang is mercury. The Five Metals refer to lead, also called Metal Elder. Metal Elder is another name for lead. Since lead contains the five colors within, it produces five-colored gold—hence the name \"Five Metals.\" It governs mercury, belongs to Water, and can carry the elixir boat. Like a chariot, it is called the River Chariot. As it holds gold within, it harbors the golden blossom. When transformed by yellow lead, it congeals like a mirror, and when struck, resembles horse’s teeth—thus called yellow sprout. If one values the yellow sprout, one must first refine raw lead to obtain its golden blossom and yellow sprout, though both emerge from lead, their crafting differs.\n\nFor golden blossom: take nine-cycled lead, remove impurities, and refine it until it resembles a mirror. For one catty of lead, add four *liang* of mercury—some say two *liang*. The teachings vary: some advocate equal parts, others a four-six ratio. Most are incorrect; only three or four parts are precious. Thus, the ancients kept this secret: when adding mercury, swiftly apply fire for half a day, and the golden blossom will emerge like mica, displaying the five colors of mysterious yellow. Use an iron ladle to gather it. If the golden blossom’s color remains unchanged like gold, it is mercury blossom. If, after congealing, its color shifts to greenish, the green is lead blossom. Such blossom is unfit, and no blossom will emerge. Where there is mercury, there is blossom; when the blossom is exhausted, add more mercury until sufficient, then stop. Some say nine-cycled lead is unnecessary—this is mostly incorrect. Otherwise, at least three cycles are needed to produce blossom.\n\nAccording to this *Contract*, take one catty of blossom, melt it into liquid, add one catty of mercury to congeal it, then grind it into powder and place it in the crucible. For a pure Yang elixir, mix the blossom with lead sand and seal it for one hundred days until the blossom turns red and brown. For one *liang* of blossom, add one *liang* of raw mercury, grind them into powder, and place in the crucible. The sealed blossom is called Autumn Stone or Standing Control Stone. If crafting the Special Method, apply the blossom to coat the crucible and add raw mercury without limit—this too can form the elixir. For yellow sprout: take one catty of capital lead, add four *liang* of mercury, and place in a Shouzhou porcelain bowl. Apply intense fire to melt it into a mirror-like liquid, then cool the bowl until it congeals into a golden color, resembling horse’s teeth when struck. Its use is like that of golden blossom. Other teachings are mostly erroneous. The sealed blossom and sprout must be placed in lead sand.\n\nThe method of refining gold through nine cycles involves frying lead into sand and smelting sand back into lead—repeating this nine times is called the Nine Lead Method, which cannot be fully expounded here.\n\n\"Mysterious containing\" refers to mercury as the Mysterious, and the lead blossom as the contained. The blossom is the yellow sprout—hence \"Mysterious containing yellow sprout.\" \"Clad in coarse cloth yet harboring jade\" describes one who appears as a madman. Lead’s exterior is black with a yellow hue, like coarse cloth. \"Harboring jade\" refers to its inner whiteness. Like a madman clad in coarse cloth, lead’s whiteness resembles jade—hence the \"madman.\"\n\nGold is the mother of Water, and the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Gold here is silver, and Water is lead. Lead contains silver, making it the mother of lead; lead is the child of silver, thus concealing the child’s embryo. Water is the child of gold, and the child resides in the mother’s womb. The mother is silver, and Water is lead; silver is the child, thus dwelling in the mother’s womb. Therefore, silver is the fine matchmaker of the Seven Treasures and the marrow of Yin and Yang.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Do not ruin my lead, nor abandon my life-metal. Do not break my chariot, nor forsake my return home.\" It also says: \"If the lead is not true, mercury will be hard to befriend. If the lead is genuine, the household retainer will not be lost.\" The Green-Waisted Envoy and the Red-Blood General unite the two families, gathering different clans into one flock. Thus, the Great Elixir cannot be formed without lead.\n\nWhen using lead, one must obtain refined, salty lead. If it is white and greasy, it can yield blossom and sprout. If it is spent, it will be pale and yield no blossom. \"Mysterious lead with a green waist\" refers to malachite. The \"Red-Blood General\" is realgar. One is mercury, the other is golden blossom. *Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume One, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One attains the utmost subtlety, now present, now absent. The absence is yang lead; the presence is yin mercury. Moreover, silver pertains to the yang treasure, while the Perfected One is the Supreme Treasure Person. Knowing that within lead lies the treasure, one transforms mercury into the elixir.\n\nThe great abyss billows in mist, now sinking, now floating. Advancing, it #1 spreads and disperses, each guarding its own boundary. The great abyss refers to molten lead turned to liquid, into which mercury is cast. Now sinking, now floating—this is the method of forming golden flowers: mercury enters the lead liquid, dispersing within the lead, thus bound by the lead and unable to escape its confines. Hence, one knows that to compound the elixir, one must first refine lead into flowers to subdue mercury.\n\nAnother interpretation of the great abyss refers to the ash pool where lead yields silver. Thus, the scripture states: \"In the ash pool, with blazing heat, lead sinks and silver floats. Pure white, the treasure appears, capable of forging yellow gold.\" Both meanings are valid.\n\nGathered, it resembles white; wrought, it turns vermilion. Lead serves as #2 the outer guard, silk enveloping #3 the steadfast core. This speaks of molten lead, white in its liquid state, which, when mercury is introduced and worked, changes color to crimson. Lead acts as the outer guard like silk, enclosing the refined mercury within, preventing its flight. Thus, it remains steadfast and abides, white guarding black.\n\nHere concludes the discussion of forming flower buds; what follows concerns the entry into the crucible.\n\nRound or square, a *cun* in diameter, they merge and support one another. Born before Heaven and Earth. *Born* here means intermingled. It refers to mercury entering the lead flowers, blending and supporting one another, later to be placed within the Mysterious White Metal Flower Crucible. Mercury is the essence of metal, one *cun* in diameter and round, weighing one *jin*—the measure used in the *Cantong Qi*. *Before* refers to the crucible. The upper lid is Heaven; the lower lid, Earth. Thus, once Heaven and Earth are established, the myriad things are born. Within the cosmos, nothing exists that is not nurtured by Heaven and Earth. The Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth, and the elixir belongs to the Dao. Therefore, it must be nurtured by Heaven and Earth, which is why the crucible is discussed first to cultivate the great elixir.\n\nLofty and revered. The crucible rests within the Supreme One’s furnace, atop the Three Terraces, uniquely exalted—thus, lofty and revered. The virtue of the Dao is likewise exalted and revered, hence the elixir’s path is supremely noble and high.\n\nSurrounding it are #4 walls and gates. The walls are the Supreme One’s furnace. The furnace has four sides, #5 each opening into eight gates to channel the eight winds. It holds twelve protrusions symbolizing the twelve hours, twelve cavities symbolizing the twelve earthly branches, and four tiers corresponding to the four seasons—hence, walls and gates.\n\nIts form resembles Penglai’s gourd. The *gourd* is the crucible, also akin to a *touhu* vase, shaped like a crucible in various styles. Some resemble melons, others are square or edged, each with its purpose. A small, elongated handle is used for dipping water and weighing. If refining fire for yellow and white, a silver crucible is employed. The reed tube is two *cun* in diameter, one and a half *cun* long, holding one *jin* of mercury. *Penglai* refers to the furnace, modeled after the Five Peaks, resembling Mount Penglai.\n\nEncircling it, #6 sealed and bound, the four passages are secured. *Encircling* refers to the crucible’s four—or two—handles. The lower seal confines the mercury within, preventing its escape. Guarding it, tightly sealed. #7 *Sealed* refers to the sealed boundary; *guarding* refers to tending the fire. One must not slacken by day, for a breach in the seal is most urgent. If the seal is not firm and tight, the medicine will entirely escape. If the seal is secure and dense, only the essence remains, leaving only lead elixir. If the silver crucible is not carefully sealed, only the elixir remains while the mercury flees entirely.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Six-and-one\" refers to six parts to one, making seven measures, the sealed boundary like lacquer, not the seven kinds of clay. Such as the eight stones, four spirits, golden blossom, jade powder, and the like. For the elixir, *yushi* powder and *chishizhi* are used for the upper and lower layers, with ash salt. For this elixir, only golden flowers and yellow buds suffice. Otherwise, lead and cinnabar are finely ground and fermented like mud, applied atop salt ash. For silver crucibles and reed tubes, use *dapeng* cinnabar mixed with refined silver powder and steel sand. Other texts mention non-ash, wood, *rong* salt, and the like—these are incorrect.",

      "translated_text": "Seal against deceit and deviation. This means the sealed boundary must be firm and tight, so there shall be no loss or deficiency. \"Deviation\" refers to flying away and loss. The winding chambers connect in sequence, to guard against the unforeseen. \"Unforeseen\" means loss. It speaks of interlocking male and female parts, fitting together like dog’s teeth. Externally, an elephant’s trunk is applied. Stir deeply and exhort earnestly—firmness and tightness are paramount. This may be contemplated with profound thought, but not with anxious toil.\n\nWhen the *qi* of spirit fills the chamber, none can retain it. Those who preserve it prosper; those who lose it perish. \"Spirit *qi*\" is fire. \"Chamber\" is the furnace. \"Fills\" means the martial fire is abundant. If the fire is too strong, the mercury’s power cannot withstand it. Nothing is more slippery and swift than mercury—once gone, it leaves no trace, and no place can be found to seek it. Thus, the boundary must be as firm and tight as lacquer.\n\nIf the crucible is pierced or damaged, one must grasp the fire’s nature across the four seasons, balancing civil and martial fires in due time—this is why profound contemplation is unnecessary. When present, it flourishes; when perfected, it becomes the elixir; when lost, it vanishes. Before attempting to refine and sublimate, first refine the crucible and vessel, then ensure the sealed boundary is secure. When fire and *qi* are harmonized, and one’s diligence is unwavering, how could there be loss or failure?\n\nMovement and stillness, rest and activity—these ever accompany the practitioner. This speaks of repeatedly handling the crucible and managing the fire, which must always be overseen by three people. Thus, when yang moves and yin is still, or when advancing and retreating, one must not leave the furnace. Even when movement occurs, there is no true rest—hence, it ever accompanies the practitioner.\n\nThis is not the method of traversing the hidden treasuries; it is inner contemplation with focused thought. \"Traversing\" means to pass through. It speaks of managing the fire and moving *qi*, all in accordance with the methods of the stellar lodges and hidden treasuries. Moreover, the chamber must be purified: expel ghosts by burning, inscribe the nine furnaces, draw the true forms of the Five Peaks, the true scripts of the eight directions, the Jade Maidens and Heavenly Lads, the Eight Lords and Nine Perfected, the Twelve Divine Kings, and the Three Great Generals. Step the void altar in the eight directions, hang mirrors on all sides, plant swords at the four quarters, burn incense, and maintain purity and precepts. Concentrate the mind to constantly visualize the Most High, the Nine Perfected, Eight Sages, Jade Maidens, Immortal Lads, Heavenly Soldiers, and Mighty Warriors. To the left and right, the Green Dragon and White Tiger; before and behind, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior—all within a single chamber.\n\nIf one grasps the wondrous principle of the elixir, one need not draw these images. Some set up a Supreme Unity furnace, merely purifying the mind and visualizing the host of sages—this too suffices for the furnace’s work.\n\nTread the steps of the Dipper’s lodges. This means that when first igniting the fire in the altar chamber, or when thunder, rain, evil winds, and the like arise, one must perform the Yu Step. Step the stars of the Dipper—three steps, nine traces. The six jia days follow the sequence of days and hours. All major operations follow the twelve earthly branches in order, cycling through the sixty jia-zi. From the primordial to this point, the discussion of crucibles, sealed boundaries, fire management, and methods of operation is reiterated thrice—this is to urge the practitioner to be meticulous.\n\nAt first, the method is civil; later, martial—gradually nurturing the fire ensures nothing is lost. The Way of yin suppresses one and nine, its turbid chaos playing with the primordial womb. \"The Way of yin\" refers to the yin primordial method. \"One\" is the essence of lead, belonging to the northern Kan water, whose number is one. \"Nine\" is mercury. Mercury is born of cinnabar, belonging to the southern Li fire, whose number is nine. Melt the essence of lead into water, then cast it into the refined mercury to blend them. The chaotic mercury is pressed into the lead, which then conceals the mercury within itself, like a child dwelling in the womb, unable to flee. Enveloped by the lead’s womb, it moves up and down—hence, it is said to \"play with the womb.\"\n\nConsuming *qi*, the intestines and stomach resound; exhaling the true, inhaling the deviant. \"Deviant\" is lead; \"true\" is mercury; \"*qi*\" is fire. It speaks of mercury uniting with fire *qi* to become one body. Thus, the dragon exhales and the tiger inhales—this refers to the breathing of dragon and tiger. Mercury within lead causes the head to resound in the intestines and stomach. After the sun is full, the mercury is exhaled onto the lead, taking the form of cinnabar, its color crimson-purple—this is called the True Yang Elixir. The common analogy is that one exhales the dead and inhales the living.\n\nDay and night, one does not sleep; the yang brightness never rests. \"Yang brightness\" is fire. It speaks of the fire within a year, extending up to three years, never ceasing day or night. The common analogy is that one practices *qi*-absorption day and night without rest.\n\nThe body grows weary, the spirit dazed, as if in a stupor. It speaks of mercury within the lead’s blossoming sap, subjected to day and night of fire—its state is dazed, as if in a stupor. It also analogizes the practitioner tending the furnace fire day and night without rest, becoming exhausted, the spirit and emotions dazed as if in a stupor.\n\nFurthermore, in making the elixir or yellow and white, one must first refine mercury into cinnabar. For the elixir, use three years of left-flavored [mercury] mixed with golden blossoms and branches, also placed in silver vessels to branch. Continuously scrape the dry mercury from the four sides. For yellow and white, use equal parts mother [lead] to branch the mercury into cinnabar, like stone. Place the cinnabar in the vessel, subdue the fire for one hundred twenty days to make a treasure. If unfit for use as medicine, it is because of the presence of metallic lead.\n\nFor the nine-cycle elixir, branch the mercury into cinnabar, grind it finely, place it in the crucible, and cover it with the Five Talismans. The correct discussion of this scripture is as above. When gold and mercury enter the crucible, the common analogy is that absorbing *qi* severs the root—spirit and essence grow dazed, the body weary and stuporous.\n\nThe hundred vessels boil and surge, unable to settle in clarity. It speaks of mercury within lead, in the crucible under fire’s pressure, constantly surging and boiling. The mercury rushes into the lead, unable to settle in clarity within the hundred vessels. The common analogy is that from consuming *qi* to this point, when *qi* reaches the cinnabar field and fills it, the hundred vessels constantly roar like thunder, like boiling water—yet even after a long time, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nVain movement and weariness prevent the elixir from being ingested. If the spirit is as if in a stupor, there is ultimately no principle of eternal life.\n\nPile earth to erect an altar, morning and evening offer reverent sacrifices. It speaks of erecting an altar within the elixir courtyard, offering sacrifices morning and evening. The common analogy is that one seeking the Dao erects an altar, toiling diligently in sacrifice—yet still cannot attain the Dao.\n\nGhostly beings manifest forms, dreams and sleep stir emotions.",

For this elixir, only golden flowers and yellow buds suffice. Otherwise, lead and cinnabar are finely ground and fermented like mud, applied atop salt ash. For silver crucibles and reed tubes, use *dapeng* cinnabar mixed with refined silver powder and steel sand. Other texts mention non-ash, wood, *rong* salt, and the like—these are incorrect.",

Thus it is said: subduing fire exposes the form to decay. The scripture states: “In the tenth month, it sheds its womb.” This is mercury, its fire complete, shedding above the lead. The common analogy is that one who seeks the Dao, ingesting *qi*, resting and toiling, erecting altars and offering diligent sacrifices, moved by dreams of spirits manifesting, cherishes joy in the heart and deems it the Way of longevity.

      "translated_text": "Every action taken is an endeavor, yet perversion and rebellion lose the pivotal mechanism. It speaks of subduing mercury to form the elixir—if perverse and not attaining principle, one’s *qi*, intent, and heart become depleted, rebelling and losing the secret method of the pivotal mechanism. Should one seek the method without clarity, one wastes fire and squanders wealth, suddenly losing the path of life and cutting short one’s mandate. Even if the elixir is obtained but its toxins are not understood, hasty ingestion leads to poisoning and the loss of life. This is like those who fail to grasp the principle of the elixir: they waste their efforts in vain, ingesting *qi* and erecting altars, yet in the end cannot escape death, losing the essential mechanism.\n\nThe methods are exceedingly numerous, numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands. It speaks of flying elixirs and alchemical stones in myriad formulas, yet the secrets of the great elixir are no more than one or two. These are contained within the *Cantong Qi*, which also expounds two or three methods, clarifying only the yin-yang properties of metals and stones. When mercury is subdued by fire and the elixir turns purple, this is the great returning elixir. No matter what the various formulas claim, they ultimately do not depart from lead and mercury. Simply learning to refine lead essence—when mastered—is to subdue mercury. In their original kind, they are not inherently completed; the wonder lies in human craftsmanship. Thus, those who study the Dao must broadly collect scriptures and formulas, never ashamed to seek guidance from inferiors, for the Dao will not be achieved otherwise. If one clings to arrogance and insists on a single principle, one cannot succeed—or if one does, it will not be wondrous. Therefore, the elixir does not depart from lead and mercury.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nWhite mercury begets cinnabar,\nBlack mercury transforms into yellow elixir.\nWithin it, the numbers nine by nine,\nFive and three transformations unfold.\nWhen it reaches the purple river chariot,\nYellow gold finds no place to rest.\n\nThus, the great elixir does not depart from lead and mercury; it is merely a matter of transformation by human hands. Moreover, if the great elixir can transmute the five metals into mercury to form treasure, only then is it the great returning elixir. Yet it is rare to see one today who, having learned a single method and subdued mercury to the point of fire, claims it as the great returning elixir—without further methods, how foolish, how foolish!\n\nThe great elixir must not be adulterated with gold, silver, or mineral drugs, for then it becomes the supreme poisonous divine elixir. If mixed with various stones, it can only treat illness, yet its toxins harm the body. Only by harmonizing lead and mercury is it the elixir of longevity. Yet I have seen fools who, having learned only the method of harmonizing lead and subduing mercury, claim that frying lead nine times makes the elixir, or burning mercury seven times makes cinnabar. They mix them in the crucible, regulating the male and female, praising the solidity of the stone, or refining yellow elixir, sometimes even taking silver as powder and using gold as mud, blending them with equal parts of male and female, flying and refining them in a bottle. After a year of fire and nurturing, when the time is complete, not even half is achieved—only gold, silver, and lead remain, the rest turned to ash, the numinous mercury having flown away entirely. Such blind fools claim it is a divine elixir, yet after ingestion, the body grows heavy and the waist sinks, toxins suddenly erupting, leading to injury and death. They say this is divine punishment for transgression. How profoundly ignorant of the properties of the medicine! Human life is most precious; once dead, there is no rebirth. To ingest poison is to harm the body—how can the path to immortality be hoped for?\n\nYet if one understands that lead and mercury form the elixir—even if not yet refined—merely subduing them by fire makes the medicine of longevity. Even if one knows to use lead, if it is not properly obtained, and the lead within mercury is not removed, the lead remains and can be ingested. Thus, lead is but temporarily borrowed as a root—how could it be fit for consumption? Therefore, though the methods are many, one must broadly deliberate and not act hastily. To obtain a minor method and then claim it surpasses all others is incorrect.\n\nTo go against the Yellow and the Old, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals—flying elixirs and alchemical stones originated with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, then with the Most High Lord Lao. The \"nine transformations\" refer to the names of Daoist adepts who study and ingest the elixir. The \"Nine Capitals\" are the nine teachings of the elixir scriptures, which Lord Lao transmitted at the pass to Yin Xi, expounding the methods of three transformations, five cycles, nine returns, and seven reversions, along with various elixir methods. Not limited to one or two, whether before or after, if one does not follow the regulations, it is said to go against and twist the scriptural methods.\n\nThe enlightened comprehend its meaning, clearly knowing the path. Let those who study elixir methods be enlightened and understand the method. By collecting many immortal scriptures, they awaken to the principle and thus know the path.\n\nDiligently follow it, day and night without rest. After three years of endeavor, one ascends lightly and travels afar. Unburned by fire, undrenched by water. Able to appear and disappear, ever joyful without sorrow. The Dao is achieved, virtue is perfected, one conceals oneself and awaits the time. It speaks of those who love the Dao, diligently seeking elixir methods, tending the furnace fire day and night without laziness. After three years, the elixir is obtained, and upon ingestion, one attains immortality—Dao achieved, virtue perfected. Unharmed by water or fire, able to sit or stand at will, with a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, commanding ghosts and spirits, lifespan equal to heaven and earth, ever joyful without sorrow. One withdraws from the mortal world, awaiting the time to ascend.\n\nThe Great One summons, moving residence to the Central Continent. The Great One is the immortal lord; the Central Continent is the immortal palace. After ingesting the elixir, with golden bones and jade marrow, one is no longer a mortal body. By practicing hidden virtue, meditating in stillness, cutting off thoughts, refining *qi*, and riding the clouds, the Great One sends jade lads and jade maidens to summon one into the immortal palace.\n\nAs one’s merit accumulates, one ascends, receiving charts and records. It speaks of ingesting half a dose and remaining among mortals, awaiting the fulfillment of three thousand merits before consuming the full dose to ascend to heaven. The \"records\" are the precepts of immortals; the \"charts\" are the true forms of the Five Peaks. One *jin* of the chart is one dose; four *liang* of the great returning elixir is one dose—this refers to two *jin* of medicine.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed, expounding the *Yi* to clarify it. The *Fire Record* refers to the great returning divine elixir, which takes the *Zhou Yi* as its model to clarify the use of hexagrams and trigrams, the turning of the crucible, and the movement of fire. Thus, it relies on the *Zhou Yi* to illuminate its wonders, and it is not falsely composed.",

      "translated_text": "The *Reclining Moon Method* employs the crucible and furnace. The furnace is a cauldron. The crucible is said to resemble an upturned moon or a melon in shape; there is also the *Taiyi* crucible. The White Tiger serves as the pivot for refinement. The *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The White Tiger is *yushi* (arsenic).\" *Ao* means to decoct. It speaks of using *yushi* as the mechanism for mercury. This is unlikely. For *yushi* is highly toxic; if one refines mercury to whiteness, one should use that which grows naturally in storks’ nests, or employ purple *yushi* and *wuzhuo* grass ash to leach mercury—otherwise, the Three Poisons Ash, Five Alums, and Two Auxiliary Medicines. For the Great Elixir and Great Medicine, *yushi* should not be used. Regarding the White Tiger, there are two interpretations. If it refers to whiteness, then silver is used as the gourd vessel, and silver is called the White Tiger. According to this *Contract*, the White Tiger consists of *jinhua* (golden blossom) and *xuanbai* (mysterious white), ground into a paste and applied to the crucible as the mechanism for mercury. *Ao* refers to fire.\n\nThe *Flowing Pearl* receives the sun. Mercury is the essence of the sun, born of the sun, radiant and flowing, smooth as a pearl—hence the name *Flowing Pearl*. Lead enters mercury to undergo the Nine Cycles, and the blossom receives the sun to become the *Flowing Pearl*. Alternatively, when *xuanbai* is placed in a cauldron to hold mercury, it forms sand-like pearls, also called *Flowing Pearl*. Mercury is the essence of the sun, thus it is said to receive the sun.\n\nThe Green Dragon accompanies it. The Green Dragon is mercury. Mercury belongs to water, and water corresponds to the number one. Cinnabar belongs to fire, and fire corresponds to the number two. One and two make three, and three corresponds to wood, which occupies the eastern position—hence the name Green Dragon. When the dragon is combined with the *Flowing Pearl* to form the elixir, it accompanies it, just as the White Tiger does. The White Tiger is the essence of the Nine Leads, serving as the mechanism for mercury. It is the refined lead that, when melted into liquid and poured into the Green Dragon’s mercury, after encountering fire, blossoms into five colors—called the *Flowing Pearl*, also known as the *Tally of Heaven and Earth*. This tally transforms the layered blossoms of mercury into the elixir, called the *Returning Elixir*. The *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The Green Dragon is *zengqing* (malachite).\" This is unlikely. If making the Nine Elixirs, one first uses *zengqing* as water, but this scripture does not employ it.\n\nRaising the east to unite with the west, the hun and po naturally seek one another. The east is the Green Dragon, belonging to wood, which governs the liver; the liver is the yang spirit, called the *hun*, and the *hun* is mercury. The west is the White Tiger, belonging to metal, which governs the lungs; the lungs are the yin spirit, called the *po*, and the *po* is lead. Thus, lead and mercury combine, and the *hun* and *po* seek one another. According to the scripture’s reference to the east and west seeking union, how could it be *yushi* or *zengqing*?\n\nThe upper crescent corresponds to the number eight of *Dui*, and the lower crescent also corresponds to eight. When the essences of the two crescents merge, the bodies of *Qian* and *Kun* are complete. Two eights make one *jin*, and the Dao of the *Yi* stands upright without inclining. A *jin* has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, which also corresponds to the count of the *Yi*’s lines. The *Formula* states: \"The upper crescent’s eight metals are half a *jin* of mercury. The lower crescent’s eight metals are half a *jin* of lead blossom.\" *Dui* governs metal, thus two eights make one *jin*. A *jin* has three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, symbolizing the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the *Yi*. Mercury is the sun, and lead is the moon; sun and moon form the character *yi* (change), thus the *Yi* does not incline.\n\nMercury, by origin, belongs to metal; within mercury is metal, and red metal belongs to the south—hence the name *Red Metal*. Lead belongs to metal because within lead is silver, and white silver belongs to the west—hence the name *White Metal*. It is also called *Metal* because it contains *jinhua* (golden blossom). Another interpretation speaks of the *White Method*: the upper crescent’s *Dui* is eight, and the lower crescent’s *Dui* is eight, totaling sixteen *liang* of silver used to make a gourd vessel for the dry mercury method. *Dui* means union, thus *Qian* and *Kun* are complete. *Qian* and *Kun* are the vessel. The correct explanation refers to the weight of the medicine in *jin* and *liang*.\n\nWhen metal enters fierce fire, its color does not lose its radiance. The nature of mercury and metal is fundamentally indestructible; when subjected to fire, it does not lose its radiance. After the elixir is formed, its color does not change when exposed to fire—if there are impurities, it will change. It is also said that gold and silver vessels are not damaged by fire. Another saying holds that when gold and silver are used to make the elixir, the metal does not lose its nature.\n\nSince the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed their brightness. This metaphor speaks of the sun and moon, which since the opening of heaven and earth have remained constantly bright. It compares the medicine in the crucible, which, when opened for viewing each month, suffers no loss.\n\nMetal does not lose its weight, and the sun and moon retain their forms. Mercury is metal. Its body is as heavy as metal, and mercury itself possesses the forms of the sun and moon: within cinnabar it is the sun, and within mercury it is the moon—thus mercury is the sun and moon, and it is metal.\n\nRarely does one see fools clinging to this metal, claiming that the Great Elixir requires gold. Thus, they dare not attempt it, unaware that this \"metal\" refers to mercury and *jinhua*. An ancient song says: \"Suddenly use the treasure within the Return, not the gold within the mistake. How could one use true gold and silver to make the elixir? Those who speak of using them are greatly mistaken.\"\n\nMetal is originally born of the moon. It speaks of *jinhua* being born of lead, and lead is the water of the north, which is the moon—thus metal is originally born of the moon. Metal is the blossom of lead.\n\nAt the new moon, it receives the tally of the sun. The sun is mercury. The *Kun* hexagram’s lines all transform into *Zhen* from the first line of the new moon; *Zhen* is the *Direct Tally*, and *Fu* is the *Direct Matter*. *Zhen* is the lower vessel that holds mercury, thus it is said to receive and employ the new moon. In the morning, the *Zhen* hexagram is used; in the evening, the *Gen* hexagram is used. These two hexagrams are employed for one day and one month.\n\nAnother interpretation holds that when mercury enters lead, it blossoms into *jinhua*, called the *Tally of Heaven and Earth*—thus it is said that at the new moon, it receives the tally of the sun.\n\nMetal returns to its mother. It speaks of mercury, which is originally the grandson of metal and the child of cinnabar.",
      "overlap_context": "e *jin* of the chart is one dose; four *liang* of the great returning elixir is one dose—this refers to two *jin* of medicine.\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed, expounding the *Yi* to clarify it. The *Fire Record* refers to the great returning divine elixir, which takes the *Zhou Yi* as its model to clarify the use of hexagrams and trigrams, the turning of the crucible, and the movement of fire. Thus, it relies on the *Zhou Yi* to illuminate its wonders, and it is not falsely composed.",

      "translated_text": "Jade is the mother of mercury; now, by firing mercury into cinnabar and transforming cinnabar into gold, it returns to its mother. From gold it reverts to cinnabar, called *golden cinnabar*. The Way of the Returned Elixir is complete.\n\nOn the last day of the lunar month, it is enveloped and stored. It speaks of the last day of the month when the fire-qi is full—this is one small celestial cycle. When the numbers of yin and yang are complete, refinement begins anew. Again, from the first day of the new month, it is enveloped and stored, concealing its walls and enclosure, submerged in the cavernous void. The walls are the *Taiyi* furnace; the enclosure is the *Taiyi* crucible; the void is the southern fire constellation. It speaks of gold and mercury concealed within the crucible, receiving the fire of the cavern, latent and hidden, thus called submerged.\n\nGold recovers its original nature. It speaks of mercury, which originally belongs to gold; now, nourished by the fire of yin and yang, it transforms into golden cinnabar, thus recovering its original nature. The radiance of the crucible then shines. *Xi* means beauty. It speaks of the elixir nearing completion: mercury becomes cinnabar, and the crucible’s medicine gains luminous power and virtue—thus people rejoice.\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three. *Zi* is mercury; *wu* is cinnabar. Cinnabar belongs to fire, and the number of fire is two. Mercury belongs to water, and the number of water is one. One and two make three—thus they combine to make three. It is also that mercury has one name but two designations, residing in the south and north.\n\n*Wu* and *ji* are called five. *Wu* is yang and belongs to silver; *ji* is yin and belongs to lead, which is the water of the north, and the number of water is one. Within it is silver, which is white, and the number of metal is four. One and four make five—thus it is called five. It is also the golden blossom within lead and mercury, hence called five.\n\nWhen three and five harmonize, the eight minerals establish the guiding principle. Three is mercury; five is the golden blossom. The above two explanations combine three and five—thus it is called eight. The eighth month is when metal is at its peak—hence the eight minerals. The world does not understand, claiming that the Great Returned Elixir uses eight minerals—this is a grave error. For when mercury obtains gold, they harmonize together, forming the guiding principle of the elixir.\n\nBreathing in desire for one another, they longingly become husband and wife. It speaks of mercury belonging to wood and lead belonging to metal. Metal is the husband of wood; wood is the wife of metal. The dragon exhales, the tiger inhales—they covet and restrain one another, thus longingly becoming husband and wife. The dragon is mercury; the tiger is the golden blossom. Thus it is known that the Great Return does not rely on yin and yang of the same kind subduing one another. Therefore, no other minerals may assist mercury—only gold and mercury will suffice.\n\nYellow earth is the father of gold. Yellow earth is metal, used to coat the interior of the crucible with *xuanbai* and golden blossom—called the *golden crucible*. It is not that gold or silver are used to make the crucible; rather, earth gives birth to all things, and metal is born of earth—thus it is the father of gold. Gold is mercury transformed into golden cinnabar.\n\nAnother interpretation: it is called the golden transformation of yellow sprouts, bearing the names *wu* and *ji*, which belong to earth. They are used to harmonize mercury and coat the interior of the crucible. Another *Jue* states: yellow earth refers to the flowing *xiongci* of the four yellows. The four yellows belong to earth; earth rules the four seasons, its original form established by fire. Each rules for eighteen days, entrusted to the four seasons, and is used as clay to coat the interior of the crucible. This *Treatise* treasures not the four yellows.\n\nFlowing pearls are the mother of water. Flowing pearls are the golden blossom; water is mercury. Mercury belongs to water—thus it is the mother of water. Another name for flowing pearls and golden blossom, when obtained by mercury, also becomes the mother of mercury.\n\nWater takes earth as its ghost; earth fills water so it does not rise. The *Caotang Annotation* states: use an abundance of yellow earth to press down. Otherwise, according to various *Jue*, one may also use the *Five Talismans of Metal* and the like to cover and support—thus it is known that earth refers to golden blossom, yellow sprouts, and the like, while water is mercury. When subdued by earth, it does not rise. It is not that sulphur, which belongs to earth, is used to transform mercury into cinnabar.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire. The Vermilion Bird is fire—the southern constellation, the essence of fire. It holds balance and regulates victory and defeat. Victory and defeat refer to ascent and descent. When ascending, add charcoal; when descending, remove charcoal. *Pingping* means observing the Dipper’s handle to determine the time by the clepsydra, thus knowing when to regulate the fire.\n\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished, and both die to return to the fertile earth. Water is lead; fire is mercury.",

      "translated_text": "Water, when met with fire, melts into liquid—thus it is said to prevail. When mercury enters within and meets fire, the mercury dies and becomes cinnabar. This cinnabar resembles earth or ash, hence it returns to the fertile earth.\n\nThe three natures unite in harmony, their original essence sharing a common ancestor. Earth is the ancestor, the golden blossom. One mercury, two gold, three vermilion—all belong to the same lineage. The three natures together honor earth as their ancestor, thus the ancestor and lineage reunite.\n\n*Jusheng* extends years; the returning elixir may be ingested. *Ju* means great. It surpasses all other elixirs, hence it is called *jusheng*. *Jusheng* is a solar name, also an alternate name for the returning elixir. It is also called the Tenfold Victorious Elixir, Purple Powder, or Golden Sand. When the elixir is completed and consumed, it extends life and grants longevity—ingestion leads to immortality. The nature of gold does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. Mercury is originally of gold’s nature; now transformed into golden sand, this sand is most revered and precious, the supreme treasure among all things. It transmutes the five metals, so when gold and mercury form the elixir and one consumes it, one’s lifespan matches heaven and earth. The elixir undergoes a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes; those who consume it transcend decay, achieving immortality without death.\n\nGuardians who consume it gain long life. Those who follow the Dao and ingest this great returning golden elixir attain extended longevity, transforming into feathered immortals who soar through the skies.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules. Earth refers to yellow earth as the crucible, or an iron crucible lined with yellow earth. It may also be lined with yellow sprouts or covered with yellow sprout padding, thus it guards boundaries and sets the rules, ruling as king through the four seasons. Moreover, earth refers to the dual yellows—male and female. The male acts as a general, guarding the four frontiers, hence it is said to guard boundaries. Boundaries refer to the color that envelops mercury. *Gui* refers to the roundness of mercury; *ju* refers to the squareness of gold. Earth governs them, hence the term *boundary*. Both interpretations are valid.\n\nWhen golden sand enters the five viscera—golden sand being the great returning elixir—it is said that mercury, originally of gold’s essence, after three years of fire, transforms into golden sand. The five viscera refer to the five organs. When one consumes golden sand, it enters the five organs and four limbs. It disperses like wind and rain, causing all impurities to perish. If the body harbors filth, grain qi remains unexpelled, and the seven illnesses, nine worms, and three corpses persist, these impurities will perish upon contact with the elixir. Additionally, if the elixir contains arsenolite, realgar, or malachite, or if fire toxins remain unremoved, they too will cause impurities to perish. Some may not die—perhaps due to a one-year elixir, or the absence of other toxins, or because the individual has long practiced virtue, purifying their intestines and organs, thus avoiding death. Therefore, when crafting the great elixir, do not mix it with mineral medicines.\n\nIf creating yellow and white alchemy or transmuting the five metals to solidify mercury, if the toxins are not removed, it will not solidify.\n\nBlack spreads to the four limbs, and the complexion becomes radiant and lustrous. After consuming the elixir, the old regain a youthful countenance; the four limbs become moist and supple, sinews firm, and marrow full. White hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow. The elderly revert to youth, robust and vigorous. At sixty, one becomes like a young man; at seventy, an old woman becomes a maiden. A maiden is a virgin—after consuming the elixir, her complexion resembles that of a virgin. An old woman is called *yu*; at seventy, *qi*; at ninety, *yi*. By transforming one’s form, one escapes worldly calamities and is called a *zhenren*.\n\nHumans are endowed with the essence of yin and yang. Now, refining the essence of yin and yang into an elixir, those who consume it transform in appearance, grow feathers, conceal themselves, and undergo metamorphosis. They command ghosts and spirits, attain longevity, and endure. Yin and yang cannot mold them; water and fire cannot harm them. They bid eternal farewell to death, their lifespan matching heaven and earth. With golden bones and jade marrow, they are called *zhenren*. This is the boundless merit of the great elixir—even the three disasters cannot harm them.\n\nWhen lead powder is cast into charcoal, its color spoils and reverts to lead. This illustrates that mercury is originally of gold’s nature. Now, when burned, it becomes gold; transformed into gold, it becomes sand; and from sand, it becomes golden sand. The returning elixir is like lead powder, originally made from roasted lead mixed with salt and vinegar, then heated over fire until it reverts to lead.\n\nIce and snow, when met with warm water, dissolve into the Great Mystery. The Great Mystery is water. Like ice and snow meeting yang, they transform back into water, self-regulating and undergoing change. It is also said that when the mysterious subdues gold and mercury to form the elixir, how can it not succeed?\n\nGold takes sand as its essence, harmonizing with mercury. Gold refers to lead blossoms refined over time. When lead blossoms are extracted, they are called golden sand. Mixing sand with mercury and burning it into yellow cinnabar yields yellow sprouts, also called golden sand. Alternatively, heating yellow cinnabar to extract lead, roasting lead into sand, or smelting lead into sand and combining it with mercury—all these methods are valid.\n\nThose who do not understand may say: grind gold and silver into powder to make sand and mix it with mercury. This is gravely mistaken. Such is the method for creating *goulou* yellow and white alchemy. For elixir-making, only golden blossoms and yellow sprouts will suffice.\n\nThe *Caotang* states: using cinnabar or mixing gold with mercury cannot achieve melting. Transformation arises from the genuine; beginning and end follow naturally. It is said that gold and mercury are genuine, inherently capable of transforming into the elixir. From start to finish, they follow one another—without this genuineness, they cannot enter the realm of precious wonders.\n\nTo create an elixir for immortality, one must use substances of the same kind. If compounding the great elixir with mercury, it is difficult to control its slipperiness. Moreover, as it belongs to the Greater Yang, without its lead-gold counterpart, it will never achieve the proper principle.",

      "translated_text": "The gold belongs to Greater Yin; only when yang obtains yin does it become of the same kind. The Great Returning Elixir mirrors the natural generation of heaven. The Returning Elixir arises naturally—cinnabar is born in lands where cinnabar exists, taking four thousand three hundred and twenty years to form. At its birth, its radiance illuminates mountains, shining through a thousand *li*. On the days of the Three Origins, the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Officials of the Upper Origin, the various heavenly immortals, and the Jade Clarity Immortal Officials descend to inspect it—something no mortal of a few lifetimes could obtain.\n\nAt its birth, above it lies malachite; to its left, realgar; to its right, orpiment; below, gold sand; to the south, cinnabar; to the north, mercury. These are the surging and intermingling *qi* of heaven and earth’s Greater Yin and Greater Yang. After one thousand eighty years, gold ore forms; the ore takes another one thousand eighty years to produce cinnabar; the cinnabar takes another one thousand eighty years to produce mercury; the mercury takes another one thousand eighty years to produce the Natural Returning Elixir—altogether four thousand three hundred and twenty years.\n\nCalculating that one year has twelve months and four thousand three hundred and twenty hours, with one hour corresponding to one year, then one year’s fire *qi* completes the Lesser Returning Elixir; two years’ fire *qi* completes the Middle Returning Elixir; three years’ fire *qi* completes the Great Returning Elixir. This employs the *qian* and *kun* hexagrams to circulate the fire. The two hexagrams have twelve lines, each line governing two and a half days; two lines govern five days, and five days make one *xun*. Together, they total sixty hours. One line is thirty hours; two lines are sixty hours. Calculating one month as three hundred sixty hours mirrors one year’s three hundred sixty days. Thus, one month’s fire *qi* is sufficient, and so the elixir opens once a month.\n\nBy this reckoning, one year equals four thousand three hundred and twenty years. When the fire *qi* is sufficient, the Great Returning Elixir is completed. Using three Greater Origins and a half, plus one Lesser Origin—ten years of fire *qi*—accounts for intercalary months and varying month lengths. One thousand three hundred and twenty years make one Greater Origin; sixty years make one Lesser Origin. Now, in crafting the Great Returning Elixir, this *qi* and fire calculation is employed.\n\nMoreover, cinnabar and mercury are especially born in the south, for the south faces Greater Yang, where the sun’s *qi* is abundant and generates them. *The Record of the Ten Continents* states: In Funan, Linyi, and the Five Indias, cinnabar appears like tiles and pebbles. Today, Chen and Jin prefectures, as well as the Five Han regions, have it in great abundance. In the foreign lands south of the mountains, one *dou* and one *sheng* of mercury yields a hundred *jin*. In Chen and Jin prefectures, one *dou* of mercury weighs a hundred *jin*. By this, the mercury of Chenzhou and Wuxi is the finest.\n\nThis mercury may be raw or cooked. If it flows out naturally, it is clear and white, sharp and suitable for elixirs. If it is steamed and distilled, it becomes white and turbid, dull and unfit for medicinal use—only good for powder-makers and goldsmiths. Thus, in refining the Great Elixir and great medicines, one must take luminous cinnabar and distill mercury from it to make the elixir.\n\nThe cinnabar should be large, three to four *cun* on each side, with veins resembling horse teeth—this is luminous cinnabar, transparent to sunlight. If it is the size of a child’s fist and resembles human teeth, it is called *zhu xiong*. If it is as small as millet grains, it is called cinnabar. If it is white outside and red inside, it is called White Horse-Teeth Cinnabar. Any cinnabar of purple hue is acceptable. The bright red and luminous kind is best; the next, resembling pomegranate seeds, is also usable. All other stones are likewise suitable.\n\n*The Five Metals Formula* states: Gold is hollowed by silver; silver is refined by copper; copper is distinguished by iron; iron is united by tin. Copper is subdued by mercury and free from worry; mercury is moistened by gold; gold is activated by realgar; silver is perfected by realgar. Copper, when matched with realgar, shares an uncommon nature; iron, when matched with realgar, averts danger. Gold, when controlled by orpiment, is momentarily restrained; silver, when matched with orpiment, transforms doubt. Copper, when matched with orpiment, corrects its errors; iron, when matched with orpiment, becomes firm; tin, when matched with orpiment, becomes fittingly lustrous. Thus, substances of the same kind are known to be compatible; those not of the same kind are difficult to subdue. Therefore, the Great Returning Elixir cannot be formed without the mutual restraint of yin and yang.\n\nHence, the scripture says: Subduing mercury into an elixir allows one to sit upon the Jade Altar. If mercury is refined alone into an elixir, it is the True Unity Method, also called the Wish-Fulfilling Method or the True Unity Independent Practice. Master Nine Origins says: Single refinement is not permitted. Thus, using lead for single refinement, mercury is called Solitary Yang and requires yin medicine.\n\nMoreover, *The Formula* states: Use silver as the same kind. Take eight *liang* of silver powder, seven *liang* of mercury, and one *liang* of realgar. Each month, remove the tiger and add the dragon. The dragon is raw mercury; the tiger is subdued mercury. Refining with *qian* silver is also a good method. Calculating the Great Elixir, there is no principle to it.\n\nAnother method: Use a silver vessel to support mercury until it becomes cinnabar, then use refined orpiment and realgar as mud to wrap the cinnabar-mercury and place it in a silver container. Seal it with halloysite and red halloysite, and cover it with red salt—this is called Independent Practice. This method is also of the same kind, though it is mostly a minor purple elixir. Whether it truly succeeds, whether it is toxic, and whether it is suitable for long-term consumption remain uncertain.\n\nAnother method: Mix gold with mercury and realgar. Another method: Mix cinnabar with mercury, adding cinnabar each month—this is called the Crimson Dragon’s Repeated Descent, the White Tiger’s Drinking. Another method: Mix equal parts cinnabar and mercury, adding raw sulfur every seven days. Once it becomes cinnabar, place it in a jar. There is also a method using silver, cinnabar, and mercury, adding refined realgar and red salt for twelve months—all of the same kind.\n\nIf following this *Contract*, it is not only gold and mercury that are truly of the same kind. Planting grain requires millet as seed. Just as sowing grain requires millet as seed, making medicine requires lead elixir as seed. Once the elixir is formed, use the elixir as seed; the rest are not of the same kind. To subdue a hen, use its egg. This means that to subdue a hen, one must obtain a hen’s egg. Thus, the Returning Elixir must use golden blossoms as its same kind to be completed.",

      "translated_text": "Transforming through kindred nature comes effortlessly; things take form as if shaped by cold forging. When of the same kind, work is easily applied; without the proper seed, no treasure can be made. Thus, the quail does not hatch the phoenix, nor does the fox or hare nurse the horse. Water does not flow upward in flame, nor does fire, though black, moisten downward. This speaks of lead and mercury in union—affairs must harmonize. Once the elixir is achieved, use the elixir as seed, so that things transform through nature, forming as if smelted. If the kind is the same, how could it not become treasure? Those of different kinds—can the quail hatch the phoenix? Can the fox or hare bear the horse? Water does not flow upward, and fire does not burn downward. Thus, we know that only the same kind succeeds; the unlike cannot.\n\nIn the world, many scholars possess lofty and wondrous talents. Yet by chance, they do not encounter the right opportunity, wasting fire and squandering wealth. This speaks of how many in the world desire to learn the divine elixir of longevity, admiring the arts of the furnace.

Some claim to use gold and silver, others male and female mercury, empty cinnabar, and the like. Some say it takes a year, others sixty days, while others speak of nine cycles without clarity in weight. Some, having merely subdued mercury, claim it is the great elixir; others achieve the elixir but fail to subdue the fire. Some, upon failure, grow disheartened and abandon the work; others feel shame and refuse to seek guidance. Through such negligence, the scriptures remain obscure, their progress mired in doubt, leading to failure and loss—discarding fire and wasting wealth. Such cases are many.

      "translated_text": "Wan is another name for mercury. The \"drumming of the five-stone bronze\" refers to its use as the *jin shu* (exhaust-pivot). The *jin shu* is a vessel. Those who, ignorant of its principles, recklessly employ the five metals as their crucible—how could they succeed? The Five Planets and the five metals all emerge from stone, hence the term \"five stones.\" It is not that drummed stone can produce gold or bronze. If refining mercury into silver, one must use a silver vessel; if making the elixir, a clay crucible is required. Using lead without refining the *xuanbai* (mysterious white), merely coating the interior with golden flowers, will achieve nothing. Different lineages do not share the same seed—how could they unite in one body? A thousand attempts will meet with ten thousand failures; what was meant to transmute will instead become delusion. Those who rely on arrogance and luck will never encounter the Way—only the sage truly knows. From youth to white-haired age, they grasp at straws in vain, mired in doubt. Things not of the same kind—how can they be mixed to succeed? A thousand attempts, ten thousand failures, until old age brings no satisfaction, the heart filled with longing and lingering uncertainty. Others, too proud to submit to a teacher, amass scriptures, formulas, and the *Cantong Qi*, exhaust their wealth, and haphazardly mix various stones—yet even in old age, they achieve nothing.\n\nTurning from the Dao to cling to delusion, treading crooked paths into perverse byways: this describes those who seek the *Cantong Qi* and esoteric formulas, only to claim, \"The method is not found here.\" Failing to recognize the true scripture, they bend and twist onto false roads, grasping the Dao while lost in confusion. Is this not the case? Peering through a tube yields no broad vision—how can one thus gauge what lies ahead? It means that those who cling to a single method, or obtain one scripture or one formula, immediately call it wondrous. Yet this is like gazing at the heavens through a tube—how can it compare to a sweeping view of distant horizons?\n\nAs for the supreme sages, none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the eight trigrams, modeling them on Heaven and Earth. Fuxi, the Great Hao of the Wood Virtue, looked up to emulate celestial patterns; the dragon-horse emerged from the River bearing the Diagram, and thus he established the eight trigrams. Later, Shennong doubled the trigrams, expanding them into sixty-four. The *Appended Judgments* states: \"Heaven engenders transformations, and the sage takes them as his model.\" King Wen, of the imperial lineage, elaborated the line statements. Later, King Wen of Zhou expanded the *Yi* and determined the line texts and silk words. Confucius, the foremost among sages, composed the *Ten Wings* to aid it. Confucius, the greatest of all sages, thus created the *Ten Wings*—the line texts, Images, Great Commentary, hexagram statements, and lesser Images—totaling ten scrolls, known as the *Ten Wings*. Later, Confucius praised the Dao of the *Yi*, lost in the Images and Symbols. The *Yi* is the subtle and wondrous essence, a book that illuminates the dark and commands destiny. Thus, in the Xia it was called the *Lianshan*, in the Yin the *Guicang*, in the Zhou the *Zhouyi*, in the Han the *Tai Xuan Shu*, and in the Jin the *Tong Lin*. Therefore, the supreme subtlety of the elixir path is entrusted to the imagery of the *Yi*.\n\nThe Three Lords were raised by Heaven, each rising in turn to govern their time. Yet even among them, there are gradations in their steps, and their merits and powers cannot be equaled. The world’s greatest sages—none surpass Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius—were Heaven’s chosen instruments, who drew trigrams, expanded the lines, and composed the *Ten Wings*.

      "translated_text": "The creation of works follows in the footsteps of predecessors, for without like substances, nothing can be accomplished. Weighing and measuring must be precise to the *zhu*. A *zhu* is one part of a medicinal pound, which contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—this corresponds to the celestial degrees, so the division of *zhu* must align with the cosmic measures.\n\nWhat has form is easy to estimate: when mercury obtains the golden flower, it takes shape as cinnabar or the elixir bell, as in the making of yellow and white where gold and silver are blended with mercury—such things are readily gauged. But what lacks signs is difficult to plan. *Mou* means strategy; *zhao*, the foundation. If mercury does not obtain gold, its foundation is hard to strategize. Even water and fire, though visible, cannot be easily regulated—how much more so mercury, which is so wondrously transformative and without trace, making it truly difficult to devise or contemplate.\n\nWhen the crafting of elixirs is made exemplary, it becomes the established canon for the world. *Fa* means standard. The perfected ones’ alchemical methods are recorded in scriptures, yet people in the world fail to comprehend them. The *Songs* are ancient verses, and the *Book* is the *Cantong Qi*; thus, the *Cantong Qi* elaborates on the ancient verses, and both have been transmitted within it. Though the elixir formulas are clear, people do not grasp their principles and instead devise their own misguided interpretations—just as Confucius edited the *Songs* and established the *Rites* to serve as enduring standards. If one does not understand the *Cantong Qi*, the Dao of the elixir will not succeed, or if it does, it will not endure, for the wondrous transformations of its principles will remain unattained.\n\nThe foundational materials—white mercury, gold, lead, and mercury—require prior knowledge, which comes only through a teacher’s instruction. The unrefined substances are not understood without a master; thus, Master Xu himself said he only grasped the Way after learning from his teacher. Now, the *Cantong Qi* and other esoteric scriptures often conceal their secrets, scattering them before or after, so their texts appear disordered. Without prior clarity, one can only awaken through the teachings of an experienced master.\n\nIt is like setting up tents in the wilderness without any shelter—what use is there in fabricating empty notions? Or like climbing a high tower with eyes closed—no insight is gained. Those who pursue this elixir path may ascend to great heights, yet if they spend without accomplishment and remain blind to understanding, all is in vain.\n\nThe *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, yet their aims do not differ in essence. Though the texts are earnestly expounded, the common people do not ponder them deeply. The *Fire Records* are alchemical scriptures: though the divine elixir and great medicines number over six hundred methods, their paths may vary, but they ultimately converge in a single principle. Fearing that people would not comprehend, the texts repeat their explanations. Why not speak plainly? Because the divine elixir is sacred and weighty, and its secrets were not revealed directly for fear of leaking celestial mysteries. Moreover, the Way of longevity might be severed, and people might cease cultivating the Dao, slandering the world by claiming no elixir of immortality exists. Yet the truth lies close at hand—ordinary people simply do not reflect deeply enough to seek the yin and yang of gold and mercury, which can be understood through a single metal or mineral.\n\nI humbly transmit the words of the worthy ones; how dare I fabricate false teachings? The *words* refer to the scriptures and the *Cantong Qi*. This book speaks truthfully, without deception, and passes it on to later generations.

      "translated_text": "If one were to seal their tongue and sever the Way, they would incur the sin of execution. Yet if I were to speak plainly from the outset, I fear people would not follow the Dao, and so I sealed my tongue and remained silent. I also feared that the Way would be severed and I would be punished. When I set my thoughts to bamboo and silk, I feared leaking the celestial tally. The tally is mercury—it is the heart of Heaven’s mercury, which also generates the five tally-signs.\n\nHesitating between two paths, I could only sigh in admiration and stitch my thoughts together in foolishness. I began to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk, circulating the text, but feared that revealing too much would sever the Way and bring punishment upon myself. Thus, I wavered between two courses. My thoughts were stitched together in writing, so I concealed my words and spoke in disarray.\n\nFrom the beginning, there was a method and procedure, yet I dared not lay it all bare. The method of refining the elixir has its own rules and steps. Unwilling to expose the full procedure, I only outlined its essentials, revealing the branches to hint at the root. The work has its method, but I could not explain it entirely—only the guiding principles, the branches that disclose the pattern. Thus, the way of restraint is expressed through the heart of Heaven; symbols are established to convey meaning. If no symbols were set forth, the heart of Heaven would remain unseen. Therefore, I reveal the branches to make its outward form known.\n\nFrom this point onward, I discuss directly the formation of the elixir from gold and mercury, hence the careful exposition of its steps. Gold serves as the embankment, and when water enters, it flows with ease. The gold here refers to the nine-times-refined essence of lead—golden flower buds. Using golden flowers as an embankment can restrain mercury; this embankment is the method of containment, able to hold the mercury in place, hence the term \"embankment.\" To refine mercury into the elixir, one does not use gold or silver to contain the mercury—that would be the method of yellow and white alchemy. It is also said that gold is used as the crucible, called the \"embankment,\" which is the silver kettle method. This is not what the elixir requires. Only when mercury is harmonized with golden flowers, entering and blending without loss, can it flow with ease.\n\nOriginally, it was said that \"water\" was a miswriting of \"wood,\" which is incorrect. It was also said that azurite was used as wood, but this remains unclear. There are fifteen measures of gold, using fifteen taels of golden flowers. Mercury is volatile and difficult to control, so golden flowers are used. Otherwise, yellow buds serve as the root for containment, using yin to restrain yang. The measure of water is the same: water here is mercury, also fifteen taels, symbolizing the number of a single month.\n\nThe *Caotang* states that \"water\" is a miswriting of \"wood,\" suggesting the use of fifteen taels of azurite, divided into five portions of three taels each. It says three portions of golden flowers (nine taels) and two portions of azurite (six taels) are used, with one catty of mercury. If we speak of the elixir’s method as true, only azurite remains in doubt. The oral instructions all say not to use mineral drugs, so one must carefully consider whether azurite is appropriate. Azurite brightens the eyes and summons spirits—it is the essence of gold, so its use would not be amiss. But if \"water\" is a miswriting for \"wood,\" calling it azurite may be incorrect. It is also said that gold is mercury, which makes sense, and that wood is azurite, using fifteen taels—this requires further verification.\n\nAs the *Caotang* Immortal was no ordinary man, his commentary should not be mistaken. If mercury were taken as wood and called the Azure Dragon, where would the measure of mercury be? If there are measures for both gold and mercury, the lines would naturally correspond, and the tally would not be azurite but true mercury. The ancients practiced using only azurite to refine mercury into the elixir, but this *Cantong Qi* discusses only the two substances, gold and mercury, with no mention of azurite.\n\nWhen setting up the crucible, determine the weights precisely: five portions of water with a surplus. \"Five portions\" means three taels per portion, totaling fifteen taels. The \"surplus\" adds one tael to make a catty. There are 384 grains, corresponding to the *Yi*, so a full catty is used. Earlier, it was said to use fifteen taels, symbolizing half a month, but this does not align with the Way of the *Yi*. When adding the surplus to make sixteen taels, it becomes a full catty, fixed in measure. Another explanation of the \"surplus\" is that a catty of mercury weighs the same as gold: two inches of gold can weigh one tael. Five portions are mercury, and the remaining five portions are gold, as in the previous eleven, four, six, and five taels, totaling fifteen taels as before.\n\nAfter the Qian trigram is established, fifteen taels of Kun complete the formation. Thirty days make a month, hence fifteen taels each for gold and mercury. These two are taken as true—only gold and mercury are genuine. Based on this, one might say that \"wood\" refers to azurite, but this does not align with the numerical system.\n\nThe weight of gold remains as it was initially. The bodies of gold and mercury should always retain their original weight, so they must be weighed frequently. Do not let the weight be lost—if it is, the fire must be hastened; if hastened, it must be slightly reduced. If the third does not enter, the two waters accompany it. The three substances contain and receive one another, transforming in a manner divine.\n\nOne is gold, two is mercury—water is the third, but it is not a third ingredient. It is said that the third does not enter, and the two are true. How could there be three substances? Only the two, gold and mercury, are refined by fire. After ten months of gestation and sixty days of transformation, they become the True Yang Divine Elixir.\n\nBeneath lies the qi of Great Yang—qi here means fire. The crucible’s base holds the fire. The success or failure of the refinement depends on the fire. If the fire is too hasty, there will be loss; if too restrained, it will not cease, like driving chickens or herding mercury—it is difficult to achieve the proper fire. As previously stated, the fire of the four seasons requires careful attention. Simply let the fire progress from civil to martial, and it will suffice.\n\nSteam it for a brief moment: first it liquefies, then it congeals, and it is called the Yellow Chariot. The unmelting flowers become liquid, and the warmed mercury is added. Another method says to remove the fire after adding azurite powder, let it cool, grind it finely, place it in the crucible, and gradually apply fire as if steaming. After the months are fulfilled, it becomes the elixir, golden and purple in color—hence the name Yellow Chariot.",

      "translated_text": "It is also said: the Yellow Chariot resembles a carriage, and when one ingests the medicine, it elevates the person—hence the name Yellow Chariot. Furthermore, when mercury is initially subdued, it briefly liquefies and then congeals, its color faintly tinged with greenish-yellow—this too is called the Yellow Chariot.\n\nThis annotation, along with the preceding discussion on using gold as a barrier, has fully addressed the weights of ingredients, their preparation, and their placement in the crucible. If one still fails to comprehend, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nAs the months and years draw to a close, one’s nature is destroyed and lifespan harmed. This means that when the time is fulfilled, the nature of mercury is broken and subdued by fire. Its form becomes like ash and dust, resembling the dust on a bright window.\n\nAfter ten months, it emerges from the womb, with mercury alone rising above the lead, crimson as the two primal forces. Beginning at the winter solstice, progressing through civil fire to the summer solstice, then through martial fire to the next winter solstice, the mercury is then opened and rises above the lead—this is called the True Yang Elixir. It appears like dust and ash; the medicine is collected and returned to the crucible.\n\nIf the mercury’s fire and qi are insufficient, it remains black as dead charcoal. At this stage, many lose heart, abandoning the process without realizing what follows. Simply continue firing the medicine, and its color will shift to purple.\n\nJust as in refining the Minor Return Elixir, where subduing the fire also turns it to black ash, from which it transforms to brown and later to a red-purple hue, later practitioners often stop upon seeing black. When mercury becomes powder, it is light as dust, losing its original form—do not doubt this. Simply allow it to be nurtured by fire over the course of years, months, and days, and its color will naturally transform into the elixir. When ground, it will be known by its weight.\n\nWith a year of firing, it becomes dust. Placed in the Red Gate for another year, it becomes the Great Elixir. Refine and combine them, then introduce them into the Red Gate. The Gate refers to the red earth crucible, coated with golden flowers to turn it red. Thus, the previous dust-like medicine and residue are cast and refined before being placed in the crucible.\n\nThe *Two Primordials* states: when refining the elixir, collect the residual lead sand. Alternatively, pound yellow earth into mud and coat the crucible. For the True Yang medicine, after sixty days of martial fire, the elixir turns purple; if not yet purple, continue firing until it becomes a deep purple-red, which is the highest grade, while green-black is the lowest.\n\nFor the Elixir of the Two Primordials, if it is to be covered, or for the Nine-Cycled Elixir, each cycle requires four taels of Mysterious White and golden flowers for covering. For the Purple Wandering Elixir, red salt is used as the covering—this is called the Red Gate. Seal its junctures firmly, ensuring it is secure and tight. This means the seals must be made sturdy and dense.\n\nThe blazing fire is kindled below, meaning the fire beneath should burn steadily, not too fiercely. As recorded elsewhere, begin with a minor martial fire for seventy days. Day and night, the sound remains keen. This means that when mercury receives fire, it emits a sound like an infant’s cry. If the crying ceases, the mercury has been subdued by fire, so the fire must not stop day or night.\n\nBegin with civil fire for cultivation—here, \"begin\" refers to the initial stage, which is civil fire. As recorded elsewhere, civil fire is used for 360 days. The middle stage is also civil fire, as previously mentioned with \"blazing\"—why then is civil fire needed? Because the mercury has been subdued by fire, a minor martial fire is now required. In the end, martial fire is employed.\n\nAt the close of the month and the end of the year, martial fire is necessary, followed by a greater martial fire. The crucible must match the color of the fire. For the Pure Yang Elixir, a great martial fire is required to subdue the fire, after which it must be transformed into an ingot, ground into powder, and fired for one cycle—this process ideally requires three years of firing. One year of firing also suffices for ingestion, but without transformation, three years of firing yield the superior elixir. As recorded elsewhere, thirty days of martial fire equate to one year of firing.\n\nObserve with utmost care, carefully regulating the heat. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node concludes, inspect closely. Open and examine it once each month, then wash and return it to the crucible. A node represents one month, hence the twelve nodes.\n\nWhen the qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po. Here, \"qi\" refers to fire, and \"exhausted\" means depleted. After twelve months of firing, the mercury dies and is subdued by fire. The hun is the mercury, and the po is the lead—thus, over a year, the hun and po disperse and transform into the Great Elixir.\n\nIts color shifts further to purple, resplendently forming the Return Elixir. The Return Elixir is purple and is also called Purple Gold Sand, Purple Powder, or the River Chariot.",

      "translated_text": "Four names it bears: Giant Victory. \"Giant Victory\" is a solar name, for mercury resembles the sun as Giant Victory. Five names it holds: Ten Victories Elixir. Six names it claims: Great Flowing Numinous Sand, so called because the Elder Lord, crossing the passes and fording the rivers to the Western Lands of Flowing Sands, bequeathed this method to Yin Xi, naming it Flowing Numinous Sand.\n\nIf its hue is not purple-red, it cannot be called the Great Medicine; if not yet crimson-purple, continue firing. Should its color resemble yellow cinnabar or red earth, it is not yet the Elixir—merely a minor subdued-fire mercury medicine.\n\nYin and yang consume one another. Yang mercury and yin metal: when metal meets mercury, they mutually consume and subdue each other, forming the Elixir. The Dao of intercourse is natural. When metal and mercury intermingle, the Elixir forms of itself—this too grants longevity and cures all ailments.\n\nIf mercury is merely subdued by fire and dried, it serves only as paste or powder, prolonging life but not constituting the Great Elixir. The Great Elixir is mercury, the grandson of metal and the son of cinnabar. Now restored to its original state, it resembles the body of metal, crimson-purple as cinnabar—hence the name Return Elixir. \"Elixir\" denotes the color red; \"Return\" signifies the meaning of returning. Thus it is called Return Elixir. Without this, how could it be the Return Elixir?\n\nRefine the powder into a single pellet, the *daogui* most divine. Once toxins are removed, form it with jujube pulp—or, if not, with Yellow Dragon Paste. Shape the pellet the size of a *wutong* seed. One pellet is one *daogui*. A *gui* is a small tael of gold; one *daogui* harmonizes the twenty-four qi. When the Elixir is complete, take one *daogui* and forge it into gold. If it fails to transmute the Five Metals, do not consume it rashly. The raw Elixir is toxic; without numinous transformation, continue firing until it becomes gold. Only when it achieves a deep purple hue is it called the Great Return Elixir. Ingesting one pellet grants communion with the divine.\n\nFurther, one *daogui* transmutes the Five Metals and one *jin* of raw mercury into yellow gold. At this stage, four *liang* make one dose. For those who wish to remain among mortals, take half a dose. For those who aspire to ascend to heaven, consume the full dose.\n\nExpounding the Five Phases, concise yet unburdensome. Pouring water to extinguish fire, suddenly the radiance is quenched. The Great Elixir’s expounding does not exceed the Five Phases. Mercury belongs to water, cinnabar to fire, lead and silver to metal, malachite to wood, realgar to earth—yet the Great Elixir employs only the two treasures: metal and mercury. These two inherently bear the names of the Five Phases: cinnabar belongs to fire, mercury to wood, black lead to water, white silver to metal, and the cyclical branches *wu* and *ji* correspond to earth—thus the Five Phases. \"Pouring\" means to irrigate. Water is yin, fire is yang; when water irrigates fire, yin enters and extinguishes yang—hence the radiance is quenched. Water is the flower of metal, fire is true mercury; when metal obtains mercury, water irrigates the midst of fire—thus it is unburdensome. This is not a case of water above and fire below.\n\nSun and moon mutually press and thin, ever abiding between darkness and dawn. The sun is mercury, the moon is metal; they abide within a month’s span, awaiting the fire’s waxing and waning. Dawn is the moon’s beginning, dusk its end. Between one yin and one yang, they naturally press and thin. When water waxes, *kan* encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, *li* plunges into twilight. *Kan* is water, the moon; *li* is fire, the sun. Yang is *qian*, the morning’s brightness; yin is *kun*, the evening’s obscurity. When yang prevails, water reigns; after six days, *kun* arrives—thus yang is encroached upon and fire wanes.\n\nNames define essence; words arise from nature. Mercury, born of the Great Yang, contains a vermilion hue—hence the name \"Elixir.\" Moist as water, white as silver—thus it is called \"quicksilver.\" Its white-red essence resembles silver’s nature—hence the name \"quicksilver.\" When metal returns to its original nature, it earns the title Return Elixir. Mercury, by nature, is metal. \"Elixir\" denotes the color red; \"Return\" signifies returning. Subdued mercury becomes vermilion, vermilion transforms into the Elixir—hence the name Return Elixir. This is the True Yang, called the Outer Return Elixir.\n\nHumans are endowed with primordial harmony, the original qi, emptiness and spontaneity—life arises from the void. After ingesting the Elixir, one returns to the primordial void, ascending to heaven—hence the name Return Elixir. Danqiu is the name of an immortal’s abode. Though one consumes the Outer Return Elixir, one must also take the Inner Return Elixir—restoring essence to replenish the brain. Only by consuming both can one attain longevity.\n\nI dare not fabricate falsely, but emulate the sages’ writings. Master Xu said: \"I record this *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Scripture* and the method of the Great Return. I dare not falsely attribute it, but emulate the sages’ writings—such as the *Book of Changes*.\" The ancient sages’ original text speaks of the \"Ancient Record.\" It speaks of Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger is the flower of metal, the Dragon is the mercury of metal—thus the ancients titled it the *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Scripture*. Another interpretation states: quicksilver and cinnabar bear the names Dragon and Tiger—cinnabar is the Red Dragon, mercury the White Tiger. Mercury also has two names: as the essence of wood, it is called the Azure Dragon; white as silver, it is called the White Tiger. Thus the flower of metal also bears the names Dragon and Tiger.\n\nIf lead does not meet mercury, the flower of metal remains colorless, and no flower emerges. Even if later it turns blue-black, it is still called Dragon and Tiger. Thus, in making the Elixir, the flower serves as the Tiger, mercury as the Dragon. Taking the Dragon to subdue the Dragon, the Tiger to subdue the Tiger—without these two treasures, nothing can be subdued. Even if one uses realgar or orpiment, it is of no avail; though they may turn to ash over time, they lack the principle of subjugation—serving only as auxiliary agents to imbue color and capture qi.",
      "overlap_context": "d and life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po. Here, \"qi\" refers to fire, and \"exhausted\" means depleted. After twelve months of firing, the mercury dies and is subdued by fire. The hun is the mercury, and the po is the lead—thus, over a year, the hun and po disperse and transform into the Great Elixir.\n\nIts color shifts further to purple, resplendently forming the Return Elixir. The Return Elixir is purple and is also called Purple Gold Sand, Purple Powder, or the River Chariot.",

      "translated_text": "The *Caotang Commentary* states: \"The Tiger refers to arsenolite, called the White Tiger, while azurite is termed the Azure Dragon.\" If azurite and arsenolite are said to be true agents, then what are gold and mercury called? This cannot be so. Speaking directly of Dragon and Tiger simply means that neither gold flower nor mercury requires gold, silver, or other minerals. The Yellow Emperor praised the gold flower. If the Tiger were not the gold flower, how could the Yellow Emperor have extolled mercury? Mercury is slippery, volatile, and difficult to subdue; as the gold flower, formed when lead enters mercury, it shares the same nature and possesses metallic properties. Thus, it can absorb mercury, restrain it, and together they transform into the Elixir.\n\nThere are several methods for producing the gold flower. If one obtains the fine, white, and unctuous lead from Raozhou, it may be used after three roastings over a fierce fire. Otherwise, refine the raw lead until it is half-cooked, then place it in an inverted crescent furnace. Apply intense heat below to slightly remove the excess skin, leaving some black residue before adding mercury. Once the fire is applied, within the time it takes to eat a meal, the gold flower will burst forth. If this flower is then melted into a liquid and mercury is added again, the flower will display five colors, known as the \"Tally of Heaven and Earth\" or \"Flowing Pearls\"—this is the transformation of mercury into the Elixir by the flower.\n\nIf the flower is used in a single cycle, it must be dense and rich, following the method of the \"Pure Yang Elixir.\" For every tael of flower, mix one tael of mercury, grind them into powder, and place them in the crucible. Inside the crucible, use yellow sprouts (lead oxide), leaving the unrefined flower as is; a single substance suffices to make a paste to coat the crucible’s interior. Add mercury and nurture it for a month. Then, add two taels of raw mercury for every two taels of flower, increasing the mercury by one part each month. When the mercury turns ashen and black, continue adding gold for a hundred days, then refine it with nine cycles of lead cinnabar to subdue the fire, turning it yellow with a slight red hue. Once a month, moisten it with water. If using an earthen crucible, no moistening is needed; if using wrought iron, it must be softened into malleable iron. Bury it head-deep in an earthen pit, and apply great fire until it glows red for a day and night to temper it. For an earthen crucible, use sweet clay, yellow earth slurry, and powdered Shouzhou porcelain in equal parts, adjusting the thickness according to size. After drying, coat it with a paste of ground lead cinnabar, then gradually heat it until it turns red and is fully tempered. Apply a lining of flower sprouts inside, then add the previously subdued medicine.\n\nNine months suffice, though even three to five months may yield results depending on quantity. Once subdued, return the medicine to the crucible for another hundred and fifty days, gradually increasing the fire from gentle to fierce, and finally applying the strongest fire for one or two days. Melt this medicine into a rod, crush it, and return it to the crucible for another month—even if not melted, it may still be ingested.\n\nWhen adding mercury, the fire must be nurturing, not fierce. For the method of \"Yin’s True Yang,\" use twice-refined flower. Otherwise, use single-refined flower or melt nine cycles of lead into a liquid, calculating one catty of lead to one catty of mercury. From this winter solstice to the next, when the process is complete, apply fierce fire for one full cycle. The mercury will rise to the surface of the lead; collect this medicine. Return it to the crucible and apply martial fire for sixty days to produce the \"True Yang Elixir.\"\n\nWhen the Elixir is complete, for the \"Yang’s True Yin\" method, use cinnabar covered with red lead; for the \"Yin’s True Yang\" method or the \"Nine Cycles of Flowing Pearls,\" simply refine the mercury until dry, grind it, and place it in the crucible, covering it with gold flower and dark white. Open it once a month, using four taels of charcoal daily. For the \"Divine Water of Good Snow\" method, fire is not recorded.\n\nIn this scripture, only the melted flower is added to mercury. In the \"Two Ultimates\" method, only cinnabar, arsenolite, and realgar are used, with slight variations—omission is also permissible. Thus, the Yellow Emperor valued only this gold flower.\n\nThe Huainan method refines \"autumn stone.\" Autumn stone is produced by adding the aforementioned gold flower to lead cinnabar for a hundred days. It is also called autumn stone because the gold flower belongs to the west, and the west corresponds to autumn. Liu Yan states: The *Caotang Commentary* says arsenolite, but this cannot be correct. Arsenolite is extremely toxic—how could it be used in medicine? Only in the \"Elixir of Four Spirits and Eight Stones\" and by mercury refiners is it employed; it should not be used here, so autumn stone is acceptable. How could the Prince of Huainan have used arsenolite? The Prince of Huainan prized it, just as dark white emerges from lead and is called chalcanthite. Some claim it comes from Pu Prefecture—is this not mistaken?\n\nThe Prince of Huainan was Liu An, the son of King Li of Han, enfeoffed in Huainan and thus known as the Prince of Huainan. Fond of the Dao, he was moved by the Eight Immortals to receive their teachings. He abandoned his throne to follow them to Shouzhou, where he successfully refined the Elixir and departed. The Eight Immortals Mountain remains there today. The Prince’s Yang Elixir used \"yellow sprouts.\" Yellow sprouts are refined lead and red lead, also called capital cinnabar: one catty of red lead to four taels of mercury, placed in a Shouzhou porcelain jar and fired fiercely. Within the time it takes to eat a meal, it becomes a mirror-like liquid. When cooled, it solidifies like yellow gold, and when broken, resembles horse teeth—hence the name \"yellow sprouts.\"\n\nThe Prince’s Yang Elixir used gold flower and autumn stone, though refining red lead was the primary method, equal in efficacy to the gold flower with only slight differences. Some say the gold flower is the yellow sprout—this is also acceptable, though with minor distinctions. Others remove sulfur, realgar, and orpiment—this is entirely mistaken. They merely use sulfur to restrain mercury into cinnabar, unaware of the origin of yellow sprouts. The *Records of the Ten Immortals* clearly states that lead, mercury, chalcanthite, and yellow alum are used in this scripture—they should not be employed. Only refined lead and red lead constitute the true Prince’s Yang.\n\nDuring the Han, the Governor of Yizhou, Chang, was fond of the Dao and used alchemy to save people, thus elevating the status of the Yang Elixir and naming it \"yellow sprouts.\" Therefore, those who properly regulate lead can achieve the Great Return Elixir. The wise act with singular purpose; the unworthy perish with their mothers.",

      "translated_text": "Those who practice the singular method refine mercury alone into the elixir, not employing the two blues or the four yellows. The \"mother\" refers to golden blossom. Thus, the true persons of highest antiquity spoke only of mercury, subjected to the fire of sun and moon over long duration, nurtured into the elixir, then combined with malachite for further refinement—such were the superior worthies of ancient times. Today’s unworthy later worthies claim that the power of golden blossom and yellow sprouts is identical, hence they are called unworthy, forbidden to perish with their mothers. The ancients did not complete the elixir in a year or two. According to the *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs*, golden blossom is also used to coat the crucible and nurture mercury—how could mercury alone, placed in an empty crucible, achieve completion? How then would it earn the names of Yin-Yang, Dragon-Tiger? This merely requires additional refinement.\n\nIf discussing the singular method, its wondrous name is \"Solitary Yang.\" The Nine Primordial Lords state: \"The elixir of Solitary Yang cannot be rashly ingested; it must borrow Yin to complete the elixir.\" If lead is exhausted, how can one cling to the singular method? The original Yin medicine, like the singular method, is exceedingly cold in nature. After the elixir forms, a hot toxic nature arises. Since lead belongs to Water and mercury to Fire, Water must extinguish Fire. Once the elixir is formed, its original toxicity is also subdued. When dry mercury takes on a color like red glass, it becomes a rarity of the world, ground into powder or made into paste. After ingesting five ounces, one’s bones become as cold as ice, resembling a chronically ill person. Dry mercury and silver may be treasures of the world, but how do they embody the principle of longevity? The scriptural formulas make this clear.\n\nOnly through the union of Yin-Yang, Dragon-Tiger can the elixir be achieved—how could mercury transform alone? Thus, mercury serves as the primary agent, golden blossom as the sovereign, malachite and the like as ministers, and realgar as the assistant. Sovereign and ministers work in concert, transforming impurities and subduing restraints to form the elixir. Entering the body, it disperses like wind and rain, instantly replenishing marrow and mending sinews—thus enabling immortality and deathlessness.\n\nMoreover, Heaven is Yang, Earth is Yin; the sun is Yang, the moon is Yin. The Way is called the interplay of one Yin and one Yang, and the mutual transformation of these two qi generates the myriad things—neither can be lacking. How could one discard Heaven to keep Earth, or abandon the sun to retain the moon? Therefore, the elixir formed from gold, mercury, realgar, and malachite is most wondrous. Without realgar and malachite, the elixir is most revered and weighty.\n\nThe Dao of ancient and modern times is one—this is but a casual remark in conversation. From antiquity to the present, only mercury alone is refined into the elixir, borrowing the phrase about lead blossom for subjugation. Upon closer examination, golden blossom is equal in measure to mercury—why then do they fail to comprehend in conversation? Scholars must redouble their efforts and reflect deeply. The essential teachings are laid bare, shining clearly without deceiving me.\n\n\"Shining\" means \"illuminating.\" I reveal this method and urge you to ponder this scripture deeply—I do not deceive you. Those who \"redouble their efforts\" refer to past practitioners of the singular method who nurtured it to the present, now applying the power of golden blossom and yellow sprouts to achieve the Great Return Elixir.\n\n*Commentary on the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Three, concludes.\n\nVariant readings:\n1. \"Advancing\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"advancing and retreating.\"\n2. \"Lead as\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"lead\" as \"refined.\"\n3. \"Wrapped in silk\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"wrapped in white.\"\n4. \"Beside\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"alongside.\"\n5. \"Face,\" originally \"and,\" emended according to context.\n6. \"Surrounding\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"surrounding\" as \"market.\"\n   (Subsequent identical variants are emended without annotation.)\n7. \"Securely sealed\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"sealed securely.\"\n8. \"Interconnected\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"interlinked.\"\n9. \"Filling the hall\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"filling the chamber.\"\n10. \"Treading the steps of the Dipper and lunar lodges\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"treading the Dipper and pacing the lunar lodges.\"\n11. \"External evil\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"external\" as \"outer.\"\n12. \"Yang Brightness\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"dark and new moon.\"\n13. \"With weariness\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"with\" as \"daily.\"\n14. \"Joyful in intent\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"and intent joyful.\"\n15. \"Self-declaring\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"declaring\" as \"calling.\"\n16. \"Actions and errors invariably occur\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"errors\" as \"measures\" and \"occur\" as \"violate.\"\n17. \"Over ten thousand words\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"over ten thousand clauses.\"\n18. \"Following it\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"following\" as \"practicing.\"\n19. \"Unceasing\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"unresting.\"\n20. \"Cultivation\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"ingestion.\"\n21. \"Merit completion\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"completion\" as \"fulfillment.\"\n22. \"Should receive the talismanic charts\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"should reap and receive the charts.\"\n23. \"Method\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"practice.\"\n24. \"Crucible furnace\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"furnace\" as \"stove.\"\n25. \"Receive\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"mercury.\"\n26. \"Seeking one another\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"restraining one another.\"\n27. \"Wood,\" supplied according to context below.\n28. \"Number\" in the *Fahui* edition reads \"Gen.\"\n29. \"Calculation\" in the *Fahui* edition has \"calculation\" as \"count.\"",
      "overlap_context": "ead, mercury, chalcanthite, and yellow alum are used in this scripture—they should not be employed. Only refined lead and red lead constitute the true Prince’s Yang.\n\nDuring the Han, the Governor of Yizhou, Chang, was fond of the Dao and used alchemy to save people, thus elevating the status of the Yang Elixir and naming it \"yellow sprouts.\" Therefore, those who properly regulate lead can achieve the Great Return Elixir.
