  "full_translation": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Section: Masters, Subsection 14 – Descriptive Catalog*\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi* (The *Wenzi* with Annotated Explications), Twelve Scrolls\n*Category: Daoist Works*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Wenzi Zuan Yi* was compiled by Du Daojian of the Song dynasty. Daojian, styled Nangu, was a native of Dangtu. He once served as a Daoist priest at Shengyuan Abbey on Jichou Mountain in Wukang. His biographical details are not recorded in local gazetteers, and this work is seldom mentioned in bibliographic catalogs. Only upon examining *Lingyang Ji* by Mou Yan do we find a preface written for Daojian. Additionally, the *Jichou Feng Zhen Shuai Lu* contains another preface, which states: \"Master Dongwei, Zu Chang, presided over Shengyuan Abbey and Deshou Palace, where he was honored with imperial calligraphy. In the year such-and-such, Daojian arrived, marking twelve generations since Master Zu’s time—barely a century later.\" Tracing from Emperor Gaozong’s abdication and retirement to Deshou Palace to the *renxu* year of Jingding (1262), precisely one hundred years had passed. Thus, Daojian must have been a contemporary of Emperor Lizong.\n\nThe *Wenzi* is a text of profound diction and recondite meaning, requiring explication to circulate. Since the Northern Wei, three scholars—Li Xian, Xu Lingfu, and Zhu Yuan—had composed commentaries. Those by Xian and Yuan are long lost, while Lingfu’s survives only in fragments, largely incomplete. Inspired by the traces of the *Wenzi* at Jichou Mountain, where he resided, and admiring its author, Daojian gathered existing interpretations, supplemented them with his own insights, and compiled the *Zuan Yi*. His grasp of Daoist subtleties is evident: though his language appears plain, he clarifies and extracts much of the *Wenzi*’s abstruse meaning, sparing readers the snares of textual thorns. While he does not attribute the old explanations he cites, his work preserves fragments of pre-Song commentaries that would otherwise be lost, offering no small benefit to the text itself.\n\nSince the Yuan dynasty, copies of this work have been exceedingly rare. Only the *Yongle Encyclopedia* preserves its contents under various rhyme categories, including the complete *Jingcheng*, *Fuyan*, *Shangde*, *Xiade*, *Weiming*, *Ziran*, and *Shangyi* chapters. The *Daoyuan*, *Jiushou*, *Daode Shangren*, and *Shangli* chapters, however, are missing from the *Zuan Yi*’s original edition—whether omitted during the *Yongle Encyclopedia*’s transcription or left unannotated by Daojian remains uncertain. For now, we retain the lacunae while preserving the original text, dividing it into twelve scrolls according to the chapters.\n\nThe text contains numerous discrepancies with the Ming dynasty edition printed by the Mingdao Studio. For instance, in the *Fuyan* chapter, the phrase \"seek governance through action, yet prefer tranquility\" (*qiu wei er ning*) appears in the Ming edition as \"seek governance through non-action\" (*wu wei*), directly contradicting the surrounding context. Elsewhere, the line \"the past cannot be retrieved, yet one may draw upon it\" (*shi zhi qu bu ke zhui er yuan ye*) is corrupted in the Ming edition to \"the past cannot be retrieved, yet one may tread upon it\" (*zhu* miswritten as *zu*). Another example: \"As for qi, it may be regulated through the Dao\" (*fu qi zhe keyi dao er zhi ye*) appears in the Ming edition as \"As for the two qi, they may be regulated through the Dao once it is attained\" (*er qi zhe ke dao yi er zhi ye*).\n\nAdditionally, in the *Weiming* chapter, the phrase \"the sage perceives fortune within the layered gates\" (*shengren jian fu yu zhong guan zhi nei*) appears in the Ming edition with *jian* (\"perceives\") miswritten as *xian* (\"precedes\"). In the *Xiade* chapter, the lines \"The emperor embodies yin and yang, yet encroaches; the king models the four seasons, yet diminishes\" (*di zhe ti yin yang ji qin, wang zhe fa si shi ji xue*) are corrupted in the Ming edition by the interpolation of *bu* (\"not\") beneath both \"emperor\" and \"king,\" rendering the passage incoherent and unintelligible—far less lucid than this edition. In the *Fuyan* chapter, the two lines \"Thus one who can achieve great victory with what the multitude cannot overcome—only the sage is capable of this\" (*gu neng yi zhong bu sheng cheng da sheng zhe, wei sheng zhe neng zhi*) are reduced in the Ming edition to a single line by the omission of the latter. The subsequent line, \"One who can become a true king must possess surpassing virtue\" (*neng cheng wang zhe bi de sheng zhe ye*), is further corrupted in the Ming edition by the omission of *de* (\"virtue\"). In the *Shangyi* chapter, the phrase \"Thus the world may be unified\" (*gu tianxia ke yi ye*) appears in the Ming edition with the interpolation of *ren* (\"person\") beneath *yi* (\"unified\"), among numerous other such errors—all of which serve to demonstrate the fallibility of the printed edition.\n\nOther instances where both versions convey plausible meanings are too numerous to count. As Daojian lived during the late Song dynasty, he was still able to consult various fine editions. Though the present text has long been corrupted by later hands, we are fortunate that this surviving compilation remains, allowing us to correct its errors and restore its integrity. This work is thus all the more precious.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the fifth month of the forty-second year of the Qianlong reign.\nCompiled by the Grand Academicians:\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\nGrand Collator: Minister Lu Feichi\n\n**Preface to *Zuan Yi* of the *Wenzi***\n\nWhen Yu received the reckoning at Kuaiji, \"Kuaiji\" meant \"accounting.\" Mount Jichou in Wukang derived its name from Jiran, who once surveyed the land here. Yet its meaning surely has an origin. Fan Li studied under Jiran, as recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*; Yan Shigu held that he was a contemporary of Confucius. The book titled *Wenzi* contains dialogues with King Ping, leading Xu Lingfu to mistakenly assume he lived during the reign of King Ping of Zhou. Liu Xiang’s catalog records only nine chapters of the *Wenzi*. Li Xian’s commentary, however, comprises twelve chapters, and one cannot help but suspect later interpolations. Some claim he was King Ping of Chu, for during that time, Chu and Yue contended in strength, and as Chu’s affairs daily worsened, Wu Zixu fled to Wu while Jiran left Chu—might he have taken a secret route to Yue? This cannot be verified.\n\nMaster Du of Nangu was discerning and erudite, sincere and steadfast, serene yet perceptive. Though capable of serving the world, his resolve lay in reclusion. Though he once oversaw the Xiantai and Zhen Pavilions, he soon relinquished them to build the Cloud-Dispelling Hermitage atop Mount Jichou. There, in leisure, he gathered the *Wenzi* and its scattered references from other texts, compiling and carving them into print. That a relic of antiquity from the Three Dynasties should suddenly emerge from obscurity is truly a marvel of the mountains and forests.\n\nI observe that since ancient times, ministers of finance have seldom preserved themselves. Jiran’s strategies were partially employed by Fan Li in Yue: after a decade of rebuilding, Yue avenged itself upon Wu, whereupon Fan Li vanished into distant seclusion, escaping the poisoned grasp of the black crow’s beak. Yet Jiran’s plans were so cunning they seemed those of an immortal who had attained the Dao—surely he had once studied under Laozi.\n\nOne who excels in reckoning requires no counting rods. How could this be the trivial work of buying low and selling high, toiling at the end of a whip and abacus? He does not prize rare goods, nor abandon frugality and thrift. He does not supply excess to those in want. He generates wealth yet does not possess it; he achieves success yet does not claim it. Such a one nearly embodies the Dao, transcending profit and harm, fortune and misfortune. Yet those in the world who hoard wealth and monopolize profit often defy the seasons, exhaust the earth’s bounty, and boast of their mental calculations, splitting hairs. They know not that they violate what Daoists most abhor, thereby inviting calamity. The cycle of ruin repeats, yet they remain oblivious—how lamentable!\n\nNangu once annotated the *Laozi*, grasping its essential teachings. Now he has compiled this book, allowing it to circulate alongside the master’s sayings. Its warnings to the world are urgent indeed. Scholars would do well to study them together.\n\nYet books are but dregs. To roam in vast contemplation, to wander in the boundless void, to sweep away the clouds of worldly entanglements from one’s breast—is this not a supreme joy? How might one ascend Mount Chou with Master Nangu, gaze upon the distant ruins, and seek the very shores where Chiyi Zi once set sail upon the lake?\n\nRespectfully composed by Mou Yan of Lingyang\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Volume One\nBy Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty\n*Dao Yuan* Chapter\n\nLaozi said: There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth. It has form yet no shape, profound and obscure, silent and desolate, faint and indistinct—its sound unheard. I force a name upon it and call it the Dao.\n\nThis Dao is lofty beyond all bounds, deep beyond all measure. It embraces heaven and earth, bestowing and receiving without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, surging yet never full. When turbid, it stills itself and gradually clears. It dispenses endlessly, without fixed time, manifesting without ever filling a single grasp. Contracted, it can expand; hidden, it can shine; soft, it can be firm. It contains yin and exhales yang, thereby revealing the three luminaries. Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it, birds fly by it. Unicorns roam by it, phoenixes soar by it. Stars and planets move by it. By non-being it takes being; by humility it takes honor; by retreat it takes precedence.\n\nOf old, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao and stood at the center. Spirit moved with transformation to soothe the four quarters. Thus they could turn the wheel of heaven and earth without cease, let waters flow without end, and accompany all things from beginning to end. Wind arose, clouds gathered, thunder sounded, rain fell—all responded without limit.\n\nCarved and polished, it returns to simplicity. Non-action acts, yet accords with life and death. Non-action speaks, yet communicates with virtue. Serene and joyful, without self-importance, it attains.\n\nHarmony encompasses ten thousand differences yet accords with life. Harmony regulates yin and yang, orders the four seasons, and harmonizes the five phases, moistening grasses and trees, seeping into metal and stone. Birds and beasts grow large, their fur and feathers lustrous; bird eggs do not spoil, beast embryos do not miscarry. Fathers know no grief for lost sons, elder brothers no lament for younger; children are not orphaned, women not widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not arise—all this arises from the attainment of virtue.\n\nThe eternal Dao of heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. All things rely on it to live, yet none know its power; rely on it to die, yet none can resent it. It gathers and stores, accumulates and amasses, yet does not grow richer; it bestows and endows, yet does not become poorer. Vague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form; indistinct and vague, its use is inexhaustible. Dark and obscure, it responds to transformations without shape; profound and penetrating, it moves without false action. Now yielding, now firm, it coils and unfurls with yin and yang; bowing and rising, it follows their rhythms.\n\nLaozi said: The great man is serene, without thought; tranquil, without care. He takes heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, yin and yang as his drivers. He travels where there are no roads, roams where there is no weariness, emerges where there is no exit.\n\nWith heaven as his canopy, there is nothing he does not cover; with earth as his chariot, there is nothing he does not bear. With the four seasons as his horses, there is nothing he cannot employ; with yin and yang as his drivers, there is nothing he does not prepare for. Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoving, his clarity undiminished, he illumines and perceives all under heaven—this is grasping the essence of the Dao and observing the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of all under heaven cannot be forced; follow their spontaneity and guide them. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be saved; hold fast to their essence and return to it. Thus, the sage inwardly cultivates the root and does not outwardly adorn the branches, honing his spirit and laying aside his knowledge and perceptions. Therefore, he is profoundly non-active, yet nothing is not done; he does not govern, yet nothing is not governed.\n\nWhat is called \"non-action\" is not acting before things do; \"non-governance\" is not altering their spontaneity; \"nothing is not governed\" is following the natural course of things.\n\nLaozi said: One who grasps the Dao to guide the people responds to matters as they arise and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their response; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their match.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and nonexistent, level and easy, clear and tranquil, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Emptiness and nonexistence are the abode of the Dao; levelness and ease are its plainness; clarity and tranquility are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function; simplicity is its constancy. Softness is the firmness of the Dao; weakness is its strength; purity, unadornment, and simplicity are its trunk.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. Having no desires or cravings is the perfection of emptiness; having no likes or dislikes is the perfection of levelness; unchanging unity is the perfection of tranquility; not mingling with things is the perfection of purity; neither sorrow nor joy is the perfection of virtue.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected person, he discards his cleverness, erases his embellishments, relies on the Dao, and abandons wisdom, emerging with the people in commonality. He simplifies what he upholds, reduces what he seeks, removes his temptations and longings, eliminates his noble desires, relinquishes his thoughts and concerns, and restricts what he guards. When he examines and reduces what he seeks, he attains it. Thus, by ordering the inner to control the outer, no affair is neglected. If the inner attains it, the outer can be shepherded. When the inner attains it, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts and concerns are balanced, sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes are keen.\n\nThe great Dao is smooth and easy; it does not depart from the self, yet those who seek it afar go forth only to return.\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets governance of others and resides in self-cultivation; he values forgetting.\n\nThe power of position lies within self-attainment; when one attains the self, the world attains me. Joy is forgotten, yet wealth and honor lie within. Harmonizing knowledge to enlarge the self and diminish the world—this nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: utmost emptiness, profound stillness. When the myriad things arise together, I observe their return. The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, silent and unmoving. Vastly penetrating, profoundly obscure, boundlessly expansive—it cannot be made external, nor can the finest hair or sharpest point be made internal. Though it has no walled dwelling, it gives birth to the general names of being and non-being.\n\nThe perfected person embodies it with emptiness and non-being, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity. Unmixed with things, this is the utmost virtue, the Dao of heaven and earth—thus they are called perfected persons. The perfected person knows how to enlarge the self and diminish the world, values governing the self and disdains governing others. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to confuse their essence. They conceal their name and surname: when the Dao prevails, they remain hidden; when the Dao is absent, they appear. They act without acting, engage without engaging, know without knowing.\n\nEmbracing the heavenly Dao, encompassing the heavenly mind, they inhale and exhale yin and yang, exhale the old and inhale the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they contract and expand. With yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with heaven, their body one with the Dao. They take no delight, feel no suffering, know no joy, harbor no anger. The myriad things are profoundly the same—nothing is not, nothing is.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the cruelty of cold, heat, dryness, or dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, or worry, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Thus, the perfected person employs the heart to restore nature, relies on the spirit for mutual support, and attains beginning and end. Therefore, in sleep they do not dream, and when awake they have no worries.\n\nConfucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and heavenly harmony will arrive. Gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come. Abandon virtue, and it will become your countenance; the Dao will become your dwelling. Your pupils will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the old. Your form will be like withered wood, your heart like dead ashes. Truly, their knowledge does not bend to circumstances, and they hold themselves with boundless ease. Clear and bright, extending in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who serve life respond to change and act, for change arises from the times. Those who know the times engage in no constant conduct. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words, yet words emerge from knowledge. The wise do not know the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the one concealed in books. Much learning leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center. Abandon learning, and there will be no worries; discard sagacity and wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nAt birth, humans are still—this is the nature of heaven. Moved by things, they stir—this is the nature’s desire. When things arrive and one responds, this is the movement of knowledge.\"\n\nWhen knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. As likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self—and heaven’s principle perishes. Thus, the sage does not exchange heaven for man: externally, they transform with things, yet internally, they do not lose their true nature. Those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who exhaust themselves in things end in non-action. Cultivating knowledge with tranquility, uniting the spirit with emptiness—thus, abiding by the gate of non-doing, they wander with the Dao. Those who follow men mingle with the vulgar.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not disturb heaven with affairs, nor disorder their nature with desires. Without scheming, they attain; without speaking, they are trusted; without deliberation, they obtain; without acting, they accomplish. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand ahead, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the wicked fear them, for they contend with nothing. Thus, none dare contend with them.\n\nLaozi said: \"People, following desires, lose their nature; their movements are never upright. Governing a state thus brings chaos; governing the self thus brings defilement. Those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not comprehend things cannot attain stillness. The original nature of humans is without depravity. Long immersed in things, it alters and forgets its root, merging with the false. The nature of water desires clarity, yet sand and stone muddy it; the nature of humans desires equilibrium, yet cravings harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge, nor disrupt harmony with desire. In joy, they are not exultant; in sorrow, they are not grieved. Therefore, though exalted, they are not imperiled; though secure, they are not overthrown.\n\nThus, though fools delight in good words and clever plans, and even the unworthy admire lofty virtue and noble conduct, those who praise are many, yet those who apply are few; those who admire are many, yet those who practice are few. Why? They are entangled in things and bound by custom.\"\n\nHe said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity. Stillness is the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is without mind, yet harmonizes with all under heaven.\n\nSpreading virtue without exhaustion, its use is inexhaustible. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is soundless. Formless, yet it gives birth to form; voiceless, yet the five notes resound; tasteless, yet the five flavors take shape; colorless, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, reality from emptiness. The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond viewing.\n\nIn sound, when the gong is established, the five notes take form; in flavor, when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; in color, when whiteness is established, the five hues are complete. In the Dao, when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. Thus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One pervades heaven and earth—its wholeness is perfect.\n\nHow solid!—it resembles uncarved wood. How vast!—it resembles turbid waters. Turbid, yet slowly clarifying; empty, yet slowly filling. Vast and deep like the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent, yet present; seemingly lost, yet enduring.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage establishes a single measure, follows the track, and does not alter its constancy. They take the plumb line as their standard, the marking cord as their guide, bending with what is straight, aligning with what is constant.\n\nJoy and anger are the depravities of the Dao; sorrow and grief are the depravities of virtue; likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart.\"\n\nDesires and cravings are the fetters of life. When a person rages greatly, they rupture their yin; when they rejoice excessively, they collapse their yang. Thin qi surges forth, and speech is lost; terror and dread induce madness. Sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness accumulates. If one can eliminate these five, they align with the numinous. The numinous resides within; attaining it within, the five viscera find peace, thoughts grow balanced, ears and eyes keen, sinews and bones robust. One becomes unobstructed yet not perverse, firm yet not exhausted—nothing too excessive, nothing beyond reach.\n\nNone in the world is more supple than water, for water embodies the Dao. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable; its length stretches without end, its far-reaching ripples without limit. Though it ebbs and flows, waxes and wanes, it surpasses all reckoning. Above, heaven makes it rain and dew; below, earth makes it moisten and nourish. The myriad things cannot but grow; the hundred affairs cannot but be accomplished. It embraces all life without partiality, bestowing moisture upon ants and worms without seeking repayment. It enriches the world without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not harmed; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not scorched. Supple and yielding, flowing and following, it cannot be scattered. Its sharpness pierces metal and stone; its strength pervades the world, ever sufficient, never lacking. It bears the world’s burdens, receives and imparts to the ten thousand things without precedence or delay, without partiality or impartiality. With heaven and earth, it shares a vast unity—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat water can perfect its utmost virtue is because of its suppleness and smoothness. Thus it is said: \"The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap.\" The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great origin of tones. The true person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with creation. They hold dark virtue in their heart, and their transformations dart like spirits. Therefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken is vast indeed! Without issuing commands, it shifts customs and alters mores—only the heart’s conduct can achieve this.\n\nThe ten thousand things have their origins, yet only the root is singular; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet only the gate is singular. Thus, one can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without weariness, respond without aging.\n\nLaozi said: \"In the Dao and virtue, the will is weak while affairs are strong; the heart is empty while responses are fitting. The weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, and still—concealed in non-acquisition, enacted in inability. Placid and inactive, moving without missing the moment, thus the noble must take the lowly as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Relying on the small, it encompasses the great; residing within, it governs without. Acting with softness yet firmness, its strength overcomes all; no enemy can resist, no force can overpower. It adapts to transformations, measures the times, and nothing can harm it. Those who desire firmness must guard with softness; those who desire strength must preserve with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or ruin.\n\nStrength overcomes what is weaker than itself; when matched against its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it tears. Teeth are harder than the tongue yet perish first. Therefore, softness and weakness are the stalks of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. Those who initiate first tread the path of exhaustion; those who act later follow the source of attainment.\n\nGrasping the Dao to adapt to change, the first also controls the last, and the last also controls the first. How so? By not losing what controls others, others cannot control them. The so-called 'later' adjusts its calculations to align with the time. When the time shifts, even a moment’s gap cannot be tolerated. Acting too soon is excessive; acting too late is insufficient. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not tarry with people. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the moment, establishes merit by relying on resources, upholds the pure Dao, restrains with feminine restraint, follows and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. Soft and weak, tranquil and composed, their achievements are vast—no firmness can contend with them.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors scheming, even pure whiteness is not unsullied, and the spirit’s virtue is not complete. How can one who does not know how distant they are from harm harbor harmful desires? When the heart forgets such intentions, even a starving tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculation labor yet achieve nothing. Those who enact laws, carve punishments, and execute penalties do not engage in the work of emperors and kings. Those who frequently employ whips and rods do not govern for distant ends. When likes and dislikes multiply, calamities follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. Therefore, following leads to greatness, while acting leads to pettiness; upholding leads to stability, while doing leads to failure.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to listen and see wearies the heart and obscures clarity; governing with cunning and planning exhausts the heart and yields no success. Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient for great governance; one person’s ability cannot manage even three acres of land. Following the principles of the Dao, relying on the naturalness of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not enough to equalize.\n\nHearing is lost to slander and praise; the eyes are seduced by colors. Ritual and sincerity are insufficient to dispel attachment; only a sincere heart can embrace the distant. Thus, nothing is more bitter than the will—swords and halberds are inferior weapons. No bandit is greater than yin and yang, yet drums and gongs are minor tools. The so-called great bandit leaves corpses uncounted; the middle bandit hides in the mountains; the petty bandit flees among the people. Thus it is said: When the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits increase. Abandon one and take the other—heavenly calamities do not arise.\n\nTherefore, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s thief; not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s virtue. The formless is vast, while the formed is small; the formless is many, while the formed is few; the formless is strong, while the formed is weak; the formless is solid, while the formed is hollow. The formed is the completion of affairs; the formless is the beginning of creation. The completion of affairs produces tools; the beginning of creation is without form.\"\n\nThe beginning is uncarved simplicity.\nThe formed has sound; the formless has no sound.\nThe formed arises from the formless—thus the formless is the beginning of the formed.\n\nVastness and thickness bear names; those with names are prized for wholeness.\nFrugality and thinness bear no names; those without names are despised and slighted.\nAbundance and wealth bear names; those with names are honored and favored.\nPoverty and scarcity bear no names; those without names are base and humiliated.\nThe male bears names; those with names are manifest and bright.\nThe female bears no names; those without names are veiled and subtle.\nSurplus bears names; those with names are exalted and wise.\nDeficiency bears no names; those without names are tasked with lowly work.\n\nAchievement brings names; lack of achievement brings no names.\nNames arise from the nameless—the nameless is the mother of names.\n\nThus the Dao gives rise to being and non-being,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other.\nTherefore the sage holds to the Dao, embracing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue.\nThus where there is the Dao, there is virtue;\nWhere there is virtue, there is achievement;\nWhere there is achievement, there is renown;\nWhere there is renown, there is a return to the Dao.\nAchievement and renown endure, and one remains free from fault throughout life.\n\nKings and lords possess achievement and renown;\nThe orphaned and widowed possess no achievement and no renown.\nThus the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root.\nAchievement is accomplished yet not possessed—\nThus they take achievement as benefit,\nAnd namelessness as function.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and artless, knowing neither east nor west.\nTheir appearance did not depart from truth; their words did not exceed their actions.\nTheir actions proceeded without pretense.\nTheir clothes were warm yet unadorned;\nTheir weapons were blunt and unsharpened.\nThey walked with unhurried steps, gazed with unfocused eyes.\nThey dug wells to drink, tilled fields to eat.\nThey neither bestowed charity nor sought virtue.\nHigh and low did not vie; long and short did not compare.\nWind and custom were as one—one could follow them.\nAffairs matched ability—easy to accomplish.\n\nPride and deceit confuse the world;\nEccentric conduct misleads the multitude.\nThe sage does not take them as worldly custom.\n\n**Wenzi’s Exposition of the Dao, Volume One**\n*Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*\n**Wenzi’s Exposition of the Dao, Volume Two**\n*By Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n**The Chapter on Sincerity**\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height; earth attains its depth. The sun and moon illuminate; the stars array themselves in order. Yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by aligning with the Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. Yet when spirit and clarity connect, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within and lodges spirit in the heart. Still and silent, serene and tranquil, the breast is vast and formless, silent and soundless. Offices seem empty of affairs; courts seem empty of men. There are no recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. The world looks up to the ruler’s virtue, emulates the sovereign’s intent. Distant lands and alien customs, though no envoy reaches their doors, all come through repeated translation—this is not because one visits each household, but because one extends sincerity to the world. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent are but government decrees; what enables their enforcement is sincerity. Now, though one may be enlightened, one cannot act alone—sincerity is required. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to govern the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\n**Exposition:** The sages of antiquity governed heaven and earth, administered the myriad things, concealed essence, and preserved sincerity—formless and soundless. They aligned with the Dao and entrusted things to their nature. In those times, courts had no favored ministers; the wilds had no neglected recluses; the state had no idle folk. Weapons were not raised; forced labor did not arise. The four classes delighted in their work. Thus, without visiting each household, they sat and achieved great peace.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven established the sun and moon, arrayed the stars, extended the four seasons, and regulated yin and yang. Day exposes; night rests. Wind dries; rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see how they are lost, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit and clarity. Therefore, the sage emulates this: in bestowing blessings, none see how they arise, yet blessings come; in removing misfortune, none see how it departs, yet misfortune vanishes. Investigating yields no trace; examining reveals no falsehood. Daily reckoning falls short; yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs the world—this is the transformation of the unintentional. Thus, when sincerity takes form within, qi moves heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge.\n\n**Exposition:** The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit. Heaven’s nurturing of things is unseen, yet daily they grow. The sage’s nurturing of the people, removing harm, and promoting benefit is the same—all arise from sincerity taking form within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, spirit and clarity aiding, and auspicious omens arriving.\n\nDefying heaven and harming things, the sun and moon are eclipsed, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons clash, day encroaches on night, mountains collapse, rivers dry, winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate. Thus, when a state declines, celestial signs change; when customs corrupt, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the workings of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved through cunning or forced by strength. Thus, the great person harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, aligns brightness with the sun and moon, unites numinosity with gods and spirits, and matches trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing heaven’s heart, holding earth’s qi, grasping the mean and containing harmony, one need not leave the hall to traverse the four seas, transform customs, and guide the people toward goodness as if it arose from oneself—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\n**Exposition:** Heaven and humanity share qi, the hidden and manifest communicate. Harmonious qi brings auspiciousness; pestilent qi brings calamity—none arise apart from the ruler. Thus, defying heaven, harming things, violating the Dao, and corrupting virtue provoke heaven’s wrath, and disaster follows. As when King Cheng repented, the grain stalks bent, and the wind reversed; or when the Lord of Song spoke, the fire star retreated—these are signs of sincerity moving heaven, turning misfortune into fortune.\n\nLaozi said: The human Dao is to preserve one’s nature, safeguard truth, and not harm the body. When pressed by urgency and difficulty, essence penetrates heaven. How can one who has never departed from the source fail to succeed? Life and death share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overpowered. How much less can one who governs heaven and earth, administers the myriad things, returns to creation, and contains ultimate harmony be subject to life and death? Sincerity takes form within and is understood by others—this is the unerring Dao.\n\n**Exposition:** All humans receive life from heaven, so their natures are without evil. Preserving one’s nature, safeguarding truth, and not harming the body, essence penetrates heaven—how can one fail to succeed? Returning to creation, attaining ultimate harmony, and transcending life and death—this is the true person.\n\nWhen the sage is above, embracing the Dao without speaking, grace extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words is vast indeed. When ruler and minister are at odds, deceit appears in heaven, and spirit and qi respond—signs manifest. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the Dao-less. To summon the distant, one acts without action; to draw near, one speaks without affairs. Only the night traveler can achieve this. Thus, turning back horses to fertilize fields, tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness, moving through the land.\" The heavenly Dao is impartial: it approaches without favor, departs without bias. The capable have surplus; the inept fall short. Following it brings benefit; opposing it brings misfortune. Thus, governing with cleverness makes holding the state difficult. Only those who align with great harmony and uphold natural response can possess it.\n\n**Exposition:** When the sage embraces the Dao, grace extends to the people—auspiciousness is visible. When ruler and minister are at odds, calamity appears in heaven—misfortune is visible. The distant act without action; the near speak without affairs. Spirit and qi respond—no summons is needed. Impartial approach, impartial departure, surplus and deficiency, alignment with great harmony—the teaching without words is simply natural.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide: distance makes them near; proximity makes them distant. Investigating yields no trace; examining reveals no falsehood. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing. The myriad things are unharmed. What one gains is what one loses; what one loses is what one gains. Therefore, one who penetrates great harmony is dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining, roaming within as if never having departed from the source—this is called great penetration. This is the use of the seemingly useless.\n\n**Exposition:** The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit. Heaven’s nurturing of things is unseen, yet daily they grow. The sage’s nurturing of the people, removing harm, and promoting benefit is the same—all arise from sincerity taking form within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, spirit and clarity aiding, and auspicious omens arriving.\n\nThe transmission of meaning holds the Dao as revered and virtue as noble—though their names differ, they emerge from the same source, residing within our hearts, not obtained from without. To give life and nurture is neither to possess nor to lack. The heart of the sage is like a bright mirror: when things come, it responds; when they depart, it remains still. It embraces pure sincerity, untainted by morality and virtue—what could corrupt it? What could it lose? As if never having departed from its source, even spirits cannot discern it.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the numbers of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying high and low, ensuring the strong did not overpower the weak, the many did not oppress the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were in harmony without grievance. Laws and decrees were clear and not obscure; assistants were just and not partial. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets had no false pricing. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished. Phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nThe transmission of meaning observes the Dao of heaven and grasps the movements of heaven. The Yellow Emperor attained this, and the world was well-governed. Later, he relinquished the world, pursued emptiness, and in humble reverence, sought the Master of Vast Accomplishment, asking how to govern the body so as to attain longevity. The Master of Vast Accomplishment said: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and subtle; its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing. Embrace spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure. Do not weary your form; do not agitate your essence. Only then can you attain long life.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on stone and slept on ropes, killed in autumn and stored in winter, embraced the square earth and the round heaven. Where yin and yang were obstructed and stagnant, he opened the pathways; where qi turned contrary and harmed the people, he severed and halted it. His people were simple and ignorant, unaware of east or west, their eyes dim, their steps unsteady, yet content and at ease, knowing not whence they came. They roamed freely, unaware of their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing where they were headed. At that time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes, all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and venom. His work matched heaven and earth, yet he grasped the subtleties beneath the Great Ancestor, not displaying his merit, not proclaiming his name. He concealed the Dao of the True Person, following the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because the Dao ascended above, and human cunning vanished.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: As the Six Records neared their end and the Two Emperors did not reappear, the Heavenly Sovereign emerged. At that time, great simplicity scattered, and human affairs began. The world first had action. Observing images, he crafted tools; tying knots into nets, he tamed birds and beasts—this was called Fuxi. Smelting metal into cauldrons, he transformed raw into cooked—hence the name Paoxi. Yet at that time, he did not regard it as merit. Birds and beasts, insects and snakes, though bearing claws and fangs, did not harm people. Later, when he created writing and rectified human relations, his work matched heaven and earth, yet he did not regard it as merit. Thus, he was honored as Taihao—was this not fitting?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear; if earth is unsettled, plants and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Therefore, only with the True Person does true knowledge arise. If what one holds is unclear, what can one know? What I call knowledge is not ignorance. Accumulating favors and amassing wealth to make the people joyful, delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Achieving great deeds and displaying illustrious names, ordering ruler and minister, clarifying high and low, distinguishing close and distant, preserving endangered states, continuing severed lineages, establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, discarding wisdom and returning to non-discernment, wandering blithely beyond the dust, carefree in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang, harmonizing with the myriad things—this is virtue. Thus, the Dao scatters and becomes virtue; virtue overflows and becomes benevolence and righteousness. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: The Dao and virtue in relation to the Five Constants, yin and yang in relation to the Five Phases—these are one. Knowing that the sun and moon alternate in brightness, the four seasons intermingle to complete the year, one understands that the human Dao, the Dao and virtue, and the Five Constants can coexist but cannot be without one another. Thus, when Laozi said, \"Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom; abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,\" what did he despise? The pretense of their names and their practice. If one truly had the heart to abandon them, the *Daodejing* would not speak of sages, nor of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, only with the True Person does true knowledge arise.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue dissipates, conduct becomes false. When essence is exhausted within, yet words and actions are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things. Essence may be exhausted, but conduct has no end. If what one holds is not firm and one indulges in the winds of the secular world, how can one avoid this?\n\nThe transmission of meaning: The Dao and virtue are the ancestors of the Five Constants. To have an ancestor without descendants is impossible; to have descendants without knowing their ancestor—how can this be? The Five Constants are the five spirits. When the Dao resides within, spirit does not scatter without. Once one loses what one holds, spirit scatters, words become flowery, virtue dissipates, and conduct becomes false—rarely does one not become enslaved by things. Only the sage knows the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, roaming in the harmony of spirit. If the ancestor is preserved, how can the descendants not be preserved?\n\nLaozi said: As for the wanderings of the sage, they move in utmost emptiness, roam the heart in great nothingness, gallop beyond boundaries, act through no gates, listen to no sound, see no form. Unconstrained by the world, unbound by custom, the sage’s way of moving the world is that the True Person does not exceed it; the way of correcting the world is that the sage does not observe it. If one is bound by custom, the body is fettered and spirit leaks—how can one avoid entanglement? If I can be fettered, it must be that my fate lies without.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: If the body is not bound by custom, people will not weary of me; if the heart is not constrained by the world, I will not weary of others. This is called roaming with the Creator. Thus, those who move the world are True Persons who do not exceed it; those who correct the world are sages who do not observe it. If will is enslaved by things, the body is fettered and spirit leaks—even the worthy are not exempt, let alone the common people.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts are such that spirit does not gallop within his breast, and wisdom does not extend beyond the four directions, when he cherishes a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. He monthly examines the seasons, annually assesses the end of the year, presents tribute, nurtures the people with impartiality, wields awe without admonition, reduces laws without complexity. His teachings are like spirits; his laws are lenient, punishments mild. Prisons are empty; the world is of one custom, none harboring treacherous hearts—this is the grace of the sage. If the ruler covets endlessly, the people below will vie for merit without yielding. The people grow poor and distressed, disputes arise, labor is toilsome yet fruitless. Cunning and deceit emerge; bandits and thieves multiply. Superiors and inferiors resent each other; orders are not carried out.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness unifies chariots and aligns their tracks, standardizes script and unifies writing—thus the world shares one custom. Rewards are not excessive, punishments not indiscriminate; the Four Seas beat as one heart. If this is so, then the ruler’s thoughts do not extend beyond the four domains, yet his transformative influence is like that of spirits. If the ruler covets without measure, those below will vie for merit without yielding. Cunning and deceit arise, the people’s strength is exhausted, superiors and inferiors resent each other, Heaven and Earth fail to commune, and the myriad things cease to flow.\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. If the ruler’s desires are many, deceit below multiplies; if the ruler is restless, those below grow unsettled. If the ruler’s demands are many, contention arises below. Addressing symptoms rather than the root is no different from digging channels to halt water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire. The sage governs with minimal affairs, seeks little yet suffices, enacts benevolence without action, establishes trust without speech, attains without seeking, and accomplishes without striving. Embracing naturalness and preserving utmost truth, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows him as echo answers sound, as shadow mirrors form—what he cultivates is the root.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: Heaven hangs forth its signs, revealing fortune and misfortune, which all see. The ruler issues decrees, clarifies rewards and punishments, and the people all trust him—is he not like Heaven? When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, if the ruler’s desires are many, deceit arises below; if the ruler values stillness, the people do not contend. The sage holds to the Dao and extends sincerity, and the world follows him—this may be called knowing the root.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters outward and wisdom strays within, one cannot govern the body. Where spirit is employed afar, what is left behind is near. Thus, without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one knows the Dao of Heaven. The farther one ventures, the less one knows—this speaks of sincerity issuing from within, where spirit and qi move Heaven.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: When Heaven and Earth commune, the myriad things flow; when the sage acts, the myriad things behold—this is the Dao of natural resonance and response. The human heart connects with Heaven, for the form one receives and the mandate one bears both originate from Heaven. Thus, when sincerity issues from within, spirit and qi move Heaven. When the human heart is empty and bright, Heaven’s light shines forth, as a mirror reveals beauty and ugliness—how can one not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things turn to them without being summoned, drawn by the utmost essence of natural resonance. Unbidden they come, unprompted they go, subtly and obscurely, their workings unknown, yet their achievements are self-fulfilled. If one must wait for eyes to see or words to command, governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as the great judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for speech? Shikuang was blind yet served as the great minister, and the state of Jin knew no disordered governance—what need was there for sight? The sage’s way of leading lies in this.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: The yang mirror summons fire only when the sun shines; the fangzhu vessel summons water only when the moon glows. Thus, with the Dao but no position, affairs cannot be established; with the position but no Dao, achievements cannot be completed. As with the rulers and ministers of Tang and Yu, when Dao aligned and transformative teachings spread, the hundred officials were upright and the myriad people submitted—this is why the sage serves as the teacher of a hundred generations.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but their conduct. Thus, if the ruler favors courage yet does not cause strife, the state will face many calamities, and gradually there will arise the chaos of robbery and murder. If the ruler favors beauty yet does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into disorder, and over time there will arise the disasters of debauchery. Therefore, the sage distinguishes sincerity within and clarifies likes and dislikes without, uttering words that match his feelings and issuing commands that clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to prohibit villainy—only spiritual transformation is prized. Where essence reaches is spirit; where spirit moves is like the spring’s life-giving force and the autumn’s killing force. Thus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: When the standard is upright, the shadow is straight; when the source is clear, the stream is long—this is the Dao of root and branch mutually sustaining each other. Knowing the heart as the root of the body, one knows the ruler as the root of the people. Thus, the ruler’s preferences must not be unprincipled: favoring courage gives rise to the chaos of robbery and murder; favoring beauty gives rise to the disasters of debauchery. Only by favoring virtue, distinguishing sincerity within, and clarifying likes and dislikes without can punishments go unused and villainy submit. When the root is firmly established, the state naturally finds peace.\n\nLaozi said: Laws are promulgated and rewards are set, yet customs are not transformed—this is because sincerity is not embraced. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their customs; observing their music reveals their manners; seeing their manners reveals their transformation. Those who hold to truth and manifest sincerity move Heaven and Earth, their spirit surpassing the four directions. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions observed; their Dao is unobstructed, and their intent is conveyed. Though they utter not a word, the world’s myriad people, birds, beasts, and spirits transform with them. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: Stone contains jade, and the mountain glows; water holds pearls, and the abyss shines—what is within manifests without. Water and stone are silent, yet people trust them. If a state embraces benevolence and sincerity, extends trust and truth, and punishes not out of resentment nor rewards out of favor, then without the need for promulgated laws or set rewards, the people will transform. Thus, hearing of Boyi’s integrity, the obstinate become upright and the timid find resolve—what words did Boyi speak? His person transformed them. If words are spoken yet not enacted, the people will not follow.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action is non-being. What is non-being does not abide; what does not abide resides in formlessness. What is formless does not move; what does not move is wordless. What is wordless is still and silent; what is formless and silent cannot be seen or heard—this is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit, continuous yet ever-present, the root of Heaven and Earth. The Dao is formless and soundless, so the sage forces a form upon it, naming it with a single phrase. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is great, taking the small as its root; abundant, taking the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven takes Heaven and Earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are utmost, his power and name most eminent—these two virtues match Heaven and Earth, so he must not deviate from the Great Dao, the mother of the world.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: The Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the king—these are the four great ones within the realm. The Dao is non-action, thus enduring; Heaven is wordless, thus lofty and bright; Earth is soundless, thus vast and deep. The king encompasses them all, for he is Heaven’s son, Earth’s master, and the people’s father and mother. Only by loving and nurturing the myriad things without considering it a favor do his merit and virtue become utmost, his power and name most eminent—none can surpass him.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent brings forth reputation; eliminating harm and establishing benefit achieves merit. When the world is free from disasters, even sages have no virtue to display; when superiors and inferiors are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, extends sincerity, and delights in giving—his wisdom is inexhaustible, yet he rests in silence without speech. The world does not know his worth, for it is his very silence that is prized. Thus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\" What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved on metal and stone, or transmitted to others—these are but its coarse manifestations.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different affairs with the same heart, followed different paths to the same end. Scholars of the degenerate age do not grasp the embodiment of the Dao or the summation of the One Virtue. They merely seize upon the traces of accomplished deeds, reciting them in kneeling posture. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid disorder.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, extending sincerity and delighting in giving—this is the Way of the superior. Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent, establishing benefit and eliminating harm—this is the Way of the middle. Being content with victory without seeking it, and yielding—this is the Way of the inferior. Adapting to the times and comprehending change, one is not bound by office or reclusion; different affairs yield the same merit. Without relying on bamboo, silk, metal, or stone, one may yet stand as a peer to the ancients.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can work spiritual transformations but cannot be spoken of as the Dao. The sage does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world—his influence surpasses the owl’s cry. Thus, shared words inspire trust, for trust precedes the words; shared commands are obeyed, for sincerity lies beyond the command. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit. His emotions precede them, yet when he acts above, there is no response below—this is because emotions and commands differ. A three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet the loving mother cherishes him all the more—this is the power of emotion. Thus, the use of words effects change, but the change is small; the use of silence effects change, and the change is great. When a noble person’s words are sincere and his intentions loyal, sincerity and loyalty take shape within and move others without—this is the transformation of the worthy and the sage.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The *Scripture of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism. The ruler is the heart of Heaven and Earth, the abode of spirit and intelligence. When emotions stir within, words issue forth. If good, a response arises a thousand *li* away; if not, opposition arises a thousand *li* away. Thus, when the sage is above, his transformation is like spirit—he does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: When a son dies for his father or a minister for his lord, it is not to seek fame by facing death. Rather, the heart of gratitude is concealed within, and they do not shirk difficulty. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned; it arises from within. One must examine his conduct. The sage is not ashamed before his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. Forsaking the near, one becomes distant and obstructed. Thus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, the people long for his will, never forgetting his desire to benefit others.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: When a scholar faces danger and offers his life, or stands firm in great integrity without wavering, it is loyalty and filial piety that compel him. Consider Chang Hong, who died for his lord, or Shen Sheng, who died for his father—the heart of gratitude was concealed within, and they did not shirk difficulty. How could they have sought fame by facing death? When the sage-king is above, the people delight in his governance—such were the Two Emperors and Three Kings. When the sage is below, the people long for his will—such were the Uncrowned Sages and Unadorned Kings.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior issues a single cry, the three armies retreat—this is the power of his sincerity. If one leads but none follow, or speaks but none bear the burden, there must be discord within. Thus, one who does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world seeks the source within himself. Where persuasion does not reach, demeanor does; where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does. When the heart’s sincerity is fully expressed, it takes form. The utmost essence can be met in form but cannot be awaited by expectation.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Words issue from the mouth, conduct emanates from the heart—this is the movement of sincerity. Words arise from the near, conduct extends to the far—this is the response of sincerity. When a brave warrior issues a cry, his sincerity moves the three armies to retreat. Consider Sunzi’s military teachings—bravery arises from sincerity. When he executed the king’s beloved concubine, it was because the king’s words lacked sincerity, and disaster befell his subordinates. For those who hold state and family, how can their words and deeds not be sincere?\n\nLaozi said: Words have a source; affairs have a root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, one is not as good as speaking little. To harm the multitude, even Yu the Craftsman would have his finger cut off to show that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise carpenter does not rely on skill but on timing. He does not know how to close, so he must bar the door before opening it.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Many words and many affairs are what the sage warns against. Only by taking the Dao as the source and virtue as the root, teaching without words, and acting without striving can one avoid failure and harm. The degenerate customs of later ages, though skilled in many techniques, are enslaved by cleverness and seldom avoid injury. The carpenter’s work does not rely on wisdom or skill, so there is no lock that cannot be opened. Yet if one must bar the door before opening it, where is the source and root? Laozi said: The sage’s undertakings follow different paths but reach the same end. Whether preserving or destroying, stabilizing or toppling, his will is unified and never forgets the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy; wailing, the expression of sorrow. What is felt within is expressed without, so the means of moving others lies in this. The sage’s heart day and night does not forget the desire to benefit others—how far-reaching is his influence!\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The sage is not without desire; he benefits others by what benefits them. The sage is not without affairs; he acts when it is fitting to act. Different paths lead to the same end; preservation and destruction share a single purpose. Sacrificing oneself to benefit others, never forgetting the world—though customs differ across lands and languages vary, human nature is one. What is felt within is expressed without: joy is sung, sorrow is wailed, and responses arise with feeling. All are our people—how can they be forgotten? Consider the Duke of Zhou, who toiled day and night, sitting to await dawn—this is one who never forgot, day or night. How far-reaching was his influence!\n\nLaozi said: When people govern through non-action, it is because action harms non-action. Those who act cannot achieve non-action; those who cannot achieve non-action cannot achieve action. When people are wordless, the spirit has words—this harms the wordless. Those who are wordless harm the spirit’s spirituality.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The body has form; the spirit is formless. The formed has words; the formless is wordless. Knowing the mutual generation of being and non-being, one suffers no harm. Being does not harm non-being. Thus, when the sage governs through non-action, his body is not harmed, nor is his spirit. Knowing that the spirit is not spiritual in itself, the two do not harm each other.\n\nWenzi said: A name may be forcibly established, and merit may be forcibly accomplished. In ancient times, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent within himself alone. Journeying south to see Laozi, he received instruction, and with a single word, his spirit became enlightened, his obstructions dissolved, and his hardships ceased. For ten days he ate nothing, yet it was as if he had feasted on the finest meats. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the realm, his name endured for posterity, his wisdom connected heaven and earth, his discernment distinguished the finest details, and his praises resounded in the most elegant speech—unceasing even to this day. This is what is meant by a name being forcibly established.\n\nTherefore, the farmer who does not exert himself will not fill his granary; the official who does not refine his conduct will not perfect his sincerity; the general and minister who do not strive will not achieve great deeds; the king and marquis who grow indolent will leave no name for posterity. The perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. Acting in accord with the times and establishing merit through available resources, he encounters no difficulty in advance or retreat, and nothing is beyond his reach.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: When one struggles in knowledge yet strives in action, success is as one—just as with Nanrong Chu. Was this not one who learned knowledge for its benefit and acted for its advantage? Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent within himself alone, so he entrusted his studies to Gengsang Chu’s gate. Later, journeying south to see Laozi, he heard the *Scripture on Nurturing Life*. His brilliance illuminated the realm, his name endured for posterity—thus proving that a name may be forcibly established and merit forcibly accomplished. The sage moves in concealment, acts in accord with the times, and establishes merit through available resources—what difficulty could there be in advance or retreat?\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, he is alarmed as if in mourning. He who worries with the people’s worries—his people worry with his worries; he who delights in the people’s delight—his people delight in his delight. Thus, he who worries with the world and delights with the world—yet does not become king—has never existed.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. It abides in an unshakable place, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and is carried in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices of no contention. He opens doors that are certain to be entered, does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain, and does not act where he cannot repeat.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings joy, and none fail to follow his commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, goodness becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The perfected person, the sage, and the great person—these should be distinguished. The perfected person regards the people as himself, sharing in their benefit and harm. When people rejoice, he rejoices; when people worry, he worries—there has never been one who did not become king. The sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. His decrees issue forth like flowing water. The great person enacts a governance that brings joy, issuing commands in accord with the times. When commands are followed, people comply; when commands are defied, the people are harmed.\n\nWhat is called the great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous. Inwardly strong like heaven and earth, outwardly luminous like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and support all without fail; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person displays goodness to others, never altering his fundamental principles or changing his constancy. The world follows his decrees like grass bending to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, the stars expand and contract, unsettled in their regularity. When governance falters in summer, Mars moves in retrograde. When governance falters in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, entering and exiting without constancy. When governance falters in winter, the Chen star does not appear in its proper region. When the four seasons lose their governance, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon display portents, the five planets move in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, the millet flourishes; when summer governance is not lost, timely rains descend; when autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; when winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: People receive the numinous essence of heaven and earth, and the heart is the abode of spirit and illumination. The great person, however, is even more numinous than others. The slightest movement of his mind—whether good or evil—heaven necessarily observes. Thus, the success or failure of governance manifests in omens and portents, responding to affairs without error.\n\nThe *Book* says: \"To slight the spirits and oppress the people—August Heaven will not protect them.\" Those who hold office—can they not be cautious?\n\n*Wenzi: Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness, Scroll 2*\n\n*The Imperial Four Treasuries: Wenzi: Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness, Scroll 3*\n*Composed by Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**Nine Principles**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was but a profound obscurity, an undifferentiated unity—still, clear, and serene. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. They separated into the four seasons, divided into yin and yang. The essence of qi became humans; the coarse qi became creatures. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born. Spirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit departs through its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and complies with earth, unbound by custom, undeluded by others. He takes heaven as his father, earth as his mother, yin and yang as his warp, and the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. Those who go against them perish; those who follow them live. Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are the dwelling of the Dao/Way.\n\nThat which is spirit originates from heaven; that which is bones and flesh is endowed by earth. The Dao/Way gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the blending of qi.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born. In the first month, the essence forms; in the second, the vessels develop; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus forms; in the fifth, the sinews develop; in the sixth, the bones form; in the seventh, the body is completed; in the eighth, it moves; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera divide: the liver governs the eyes, the kidneys govern the ears, the spleen governs the tongue, the lungs govern the nose, and the gallbladder governs the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has the four seasons, the five phases, the nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have the four limbs, the five viscera, the nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder becomes clouds; the lungs become qi; the spleen becomes wind; the kidneys become rain; the liver becomes thunder. Humans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs them. The ears and eyes are like the sun and moon; blood and qi are like wind and rain.\n\nWhen the sun and moon lose their proper course, eclipsing one another and dimming their light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, destroying and breaking to bring forth calamity; when the five stars stray from their paths, states and lands suffer their misfortune—such is the Dao of heaven and earth, vast and great, yet ever governed by measure, its brilliance cherishing its numinous clarity. How can human ears and eyes long endure fumigation without rest? How can the spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external.\n\nBlood and qi are the blossoming of humanity; the five viscera are the essence of humanity. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not scatter outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision sharp—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart, qi and intent prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not dissipate. Thus, in listening, nothing is unheard; in seeing, nothing is unseen; in acting, nothing is unaccomplished. Misfortune and disaster have no means of entry, and perverse qi cannot invade. Those who seek much gain little; those who perceive broadly know narrowly.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; blood and qi are the messengers of the five viscera. Thus, when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera tremble and cannot settle, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and the spirit gallops without restraint. Though calamity and fortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to recognize them.\n\nThus the sage cherishes without transgressing. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and penetrating, with nothing to lure or entice, and that intent and qi do not falter, remaining pure and with few desires, the five viscera are at peace, the spirit guards within, and the form does not transgress. Then, observing the external affairs of past ages and the internal misfortunes and fortunes between them, one may fully perceive. Thus, the farther one ventures outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds confuse the ears, rendering them unhearing; the five flavors confuse the mouth, causing it to suffer harm. Preferences and aversions unsettle the heart, causing conduct to fly astray. Thus, desires cause qi to overflow, and likes and dislikes cause the spirit to labor. If one does not swiftly depart from them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is due to their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who take no action for the sake of life thereby attain longevity.\n\nHeaven and earth move and mutually communicate; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to be unable to know the One is to be unable to know anything. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and things are also things. How can things be used to measure one another? The desire for life cannot be served; the hatred of death cannot be avoided. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling it, daring not to exhaust it—daring not to exhaust it is the utmost joy.\n\nLaozi said: The so-called sage follows the times and rests in his position, engaging with the world and delighting in his work. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the way of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. At rest, one harmonizes with yin; in motion, one moves with yang. Thus, the heart is the master of the form, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. When the form labors without rest, it stumbles; when essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage abides by this and dares not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its measures. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one completes one’s mandate, neither distant nor close, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony to follow heaven. With the Dao as one’s boundary and virtue as one’s neighbor, one neither initiates fortune nor precedes calamity. Life and death bring no change to oneself. Thus it is said: The utmost spirit seeks and obtains all; it acts and accomplishes all.\n\nLaozi said: To regard the world lightly is to keep the spirit unburdened; to treat the myriad things as trivial is to keep the heart unconfused. Equalizing life and death keeps intent unafraid; unifying transformations keeps clarity unimpaired. The perfected person leans on an unyielding pillar, walks an unbounded path, draws from an inexhaustible storehouse, and studies with an immortal teacher. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nowhere they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace fate without confusion, turning with misfortune and fortune, advantage and harm, which are insufficient to trouble the heart.\n\nThose who act for righteousness may be compelled by benevolence but cannot be coerced by arms; they may be rectified by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or nobility; they act for righteousness and cannot be terrified by death. How much more so for those who practice non-action? Those who practice non-action are without burdens. The burdenless person takes the world as a shadow, a reflection. Looking up, they observe the ranks of the perfected; deeply investigating the intent of the Dao and examining the conduct of the vulgar below, they find it sufficient to feel shame.\n\nThose who take the world as nothing are like a drum beaten in vain. To guard equilibrium:\n\nLaozi said: Esteeming power and abundant profit are what people covet, yet compared to the body, they are base. Thus, the sage eats enough to fill the void and connect qi, wears enough to cover the form and ward off cold, and satisfies desires without excess. Not coveting gain, not hoarding much, they keep the eyes clear and unseeing, the ears still and unhearing, the mouth closed and silent, the heart relinquished and unthinking. Abandoning cleverness, returning to simplicity, resting the spirit, and discarding knowledge—thus, without likes or dislikes, this is called great penetration. To eliminate filth and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What cannot be accomplished? To know the harmony of nurturing life is not to be lured by profit; to understand the correspondence of internal and external is not to be enticed by power. The external of the external is the greatest; the internal of the internal is the noblest. To know great nobility, where does one not succeed?\n\nTo guard simplicity:\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who practiced the Dao ordered emotions and nature, governed the heart’s arts, nurtured with harmony, and held with appropriateness. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot baseness; content with virtue, they forgot poverty. What nature did not desire, they did not desire and did not obtain; what the heart did not enjoy, they did not enjoy and did not do. What harmed nature, they did not burden virtue with; what inconvenienced life, they did not disturb harmony with. Not indulging the body or following whims, their system could serve as a model for the world. Measuring food by the belly, clothing by the form, dwelling in contentment, and acting in accord with emotion, they had surplus in the world yet did not possess it, entrusted the myriad things yet did not profit from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness, cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who can do this may be said to embody the Dao.\n\nTo guard clarity:\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes relate to sounds and sights; the nose and mouth relate to fragrances and odors; the skin and flesh relate to cold and warmth—their essence is one. Some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty. What governs them differs. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level. No one mirrors in flowing water but mirrors in still water because it is clear and still. Thus, when the spirit is clear and intent is level, one can perceive the essence of things. Those who employ it must borrow from those who do not. A bright mirror is not sullied by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. Thus, when the heart reaches a point, the spirit is present in it; returning to emptiness, agitation vanishes, and the storehouse of the spirit rests. This is the wandering of the sage. Therefore, to govern the world, one must first understand the essence of nature and life.\n\nThus, the heart is the master of the form, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. When the form labors without rest, it stumbles; when essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage abides by this and dares not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its measures. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one completes one’s mandate, neither distant nor close, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony to follow heaven. With the Dao as one’s boundary and virtue as one’s neighbor, one neither initiates fortune nor precedes calamity. Life and death bring no change to oneself. Thus it is said: The utmost spirit seeks and obtains all; it acts and accomplishes all. To guard the insubstantial.\n\nTo Guard the Real\n\nLaozi said: What is called the sage merely accords with human nature, eating according to the measure of the belly and clothing according to the measure of the form, restraining the self so that the heart of greed and corruption has no means to arise. Thus, one who can possess the world must not take the world as one’s own; one who can possess fame and reputation must not seek them through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness follow as natural attachments.\n\nAs for the spirit, nothing obscures it; the heart bears no burden. Penetrating and unimpeded, all things flow through; tranquil and unoccupied, one is free from affairs. Power and profit cannot entice, sounds and sights cannot seduce, sophistry cannot persuade, cunning cannot move, and bravery cannot terrify—this is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThat which gives life does not itself live; that which transforms does not itself transform. One who does not grasp this Dao, though one may govern heaven and earth, illuminate like the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make words flow like metal and stone, is still of no benefit in governing the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what one guards.\n\nTo Guard Stillness\n\nLaozi said: Stillness and tranquility, serenity and simplicity—these nurture life. Harmony and joy, emptiness and nothingness—these uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one attains one’s nature and finds its proper place. Stillness does not move; harmony rests in virtue and finds its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to complete one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nIn such a state, the blood and vessels flow without stagnation, the five viscera hold no accumulated qi. Fortune and misfortune cannot deceive, praise and blame cannot defile. Without possessing the world, who could bring it to order? Possessing talent but not meeting the right time, the body cannot even free itself—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nThe eye that discerns the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; the ear that harmonizes the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus, if one sets the mind on small things, one forgets great things. Now, the myriad things assail and seize one’s life, snatching at one’s essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf the water in a basin is clear, after a day one can see the brows and lashes; if it is muddied, even a single stir prevents one from seeing its shape, whether square or round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like the water in a basin. Guard the law.\n\nLaozi said: The highest sage models himself on Heaven; the next reveres the worthy; the lowest relies on ministers. To rely on ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to revere the worthy is the source of delusion and confusion. To model oneself on Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness are its foundation: emptiness admits all, stillness sustains all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus the sage takes stillness as order and movement as chaos. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb, do not agitate—then the myriad things will clear themselves. Do not startle, do not alarm—then the myriad things will order themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\n**Embrace Weakness**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world and a single state as their household, and the myriad things as their storehouse. When the world is vast and the myriad things are many, qi becomes replete and the will grows arrogant. The great use force to invade the small; the small grow insolent and domineer over the lowly. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long. Therefore the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and acting without contrivance, never diminishing. The qi of the Unwrought appears small, embraces weakness, retreats, and claims nothing. He models himself on the rivers and seas: the rivers and seas do not act, yet their merit and fame transform of themselves. Not forcing, they thus complete their kingship. As the female of the world, they can spiritually endure without perishing. Loving themselves, they thus achieve their nobility. The power of ten thousand chariots and the authority over the myriad things are of the utmost weight—one cannot treat them lightly. To treat them lightly is to fail in merit and fame.\n\nThe Dao is great, yet it is completed through the small; it is rich, yet it takes the few as its master. Thus the sage, governing the world with the Dao, sees the subtle in the supple and wondrous, sees the few in frugality and restraint. Seeing the small, he thus completes the great; seeing the few, he thus completes the beautiful. The Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to them and offers them tribute. The sage is humble, tranquil, and yielding—he appears lowly. Emptying his mind, he appears insufficient. Appearing lowly, he thus attains the high; appearing insufficient, he thus completes his worth. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure. The violent die; the self-satisfied perish. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot remain full for even a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains move with the qi of violence, thus they cannot last and are destroyed. Small valleys occupy the place of violence, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, discards extravagance and arrogance, and dares not move with the qi of violence. Holding to the female and the yielding, he thus establishes his maleness; not daring extravagance and arrogance, he thus endures long.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—sun and moon are thus. Therefore the sage daily diminishes and the qi of the Unwrought does not dare become full. Daily advancing with the female, his merit and power do not decline. The Dao of Heaven is thus. The nature of man is to love the high and hate the low, to love gain and hate loss, to love profit and hate harm, to love honor and hate disgrace, to love nobility and hate baseness. The multitude act accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; grasping, they thus cannot obtain. Therefore the sage models himself on Heaven, achieves without acting, and obtains without grasping. His nature is the same as others, yet his Dao differs—thus he endures long.\n\nTherefore the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called \"Admonishing Goblets.\" When empty, they stood upright; when full, they overturned. Things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its full wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Thus, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom guard themselves with foolishness; those with much learning and wide eloquence guard themselves with restraint; those with martial strength and courage guard themselves with fear; those with wealth and nobility guard themselves with humility; those who bestow virtue upon the world guard themselves with yielding. These five were how the former kings preserved the world. Those who serve this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one remain whole without renewal.\n\nLaozi said: The sage moves with the yin, closing when it closes; moves with the yang, opening when it opens. He can reach the state of no joy, and thus there is nothing that does not bring joy. With nothing that does not bring joy, he reaches the ultimate joy. This is inner joy, not delighting the inner with outer joys. Thus he has joy of himself, and his will is honored throughout the world. The reason for this is that he acts for the world through the world’s essentials. It does not lie in others but in oneself; it does not lie in people but in the body. When the body attains it, the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, those who penetrate the discourse on the arts of the mind have desires and aversions beyond them. Therefore, they have nothing to delight in, nothing to anger them, nothing to bring them joy, nothing to cause them suffering. The myriad things are profoundly the same—nothing is not so, nothing is right. Thus the scholar has a constant discourse, the woman has unchanging conduct. They do not wait for power to be honored, do not require wealth to be rich, do not need strength to be mighty. They do not profit from goods and wealth, do not covet worldly fame. They do not find security in nobility, nor danger in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nForm is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life.\n\nWhen any one of these loses its proper place, all three are harmed. Thus, those who take spirit as their master find form following to their benefit; those who take form as their master find spirit following to their harm. The greedy and gluttonous, driven by excessive desires, stumble blindly after power and profit, lured by the allure of fame and rank. As they surpass others in cunning and rise above the world, their spirit daily depletes, drifting ever farther in dissipation without return. When form seals itself in resistance, there is no way for it to admit anything. Hence arise the afflictions of blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, will, and qi—when at rest, they daily grow full and vigorous; when agitated, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage preserves and nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, floating and sinking with the Dao. Thus, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart, and the changes of the hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nTo guard simplicity—Laozi said: \"The so-called True Person’s nature accords with the Dao.\" Thus, they have yet seem as though they have not; they are full yet seem as though empty. They cultivate their inner without managing their outer, understanding the Great Simplicity, acting without contrivance, and returning to uncarved simplicity. They embrace their spirit and wander to the root of Heaven and Earth, drifting faintly beyond the dust and grime, at ease in the work of no-affair. Schemes, wit, and cleverness are not carried in their heart; they discern the flawless and do not shift with things. They perceive the transformations of affairs yet hold fast to their origin. Their mind and intent are concentrated within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding, they know not what they do; moving, they know not where they go. Without learning, they know; without looking, they see; without acting, they accomplish; without governing, they order. They respond to stimuli, move under pressure, proceed only when unavoidable—like light shining, like a shadow following. They take the Dao as their guide, acting when conditions allow. Vast and empty, clear and still, they hold nothing, regarding a thousand lives as one, taking the myriad differences as a single origin.\n\nThey possess essence yet do not employ it; they possess spirit yet do not use it. They guard the great undifferentiated simplicity, standing at the center of utmost refinement. They do not dream in slumber, their wisdom does not sprout; their movement leaves no form, their stillness no substance. They exist yet seem to vanish; they live yet seem to die. They enter and exit without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits—such are the powers of those who ascend to the Dao through spirit.\n\nWhen spirit flows freely and does not lose its origin, day and night without interruption, it becomes springtime to all things—this is harmony arising in the heart. Thus, though form may decay, spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation without transforming, through a thousand changes and ten thousand shifts, it never reaches an end. That which transforms returns to formlessness; that which does not transform is born together with Heaven and Earth.\n\nTherefore, that which gives life has never truly given life—what it gives life to is but life’s transformation. That which transforms has never truly transformed—what it transforms is but transformation itself. Such is the wandering of the True Person, the pure and unalloyed Dao.\n\n*Wenzi, in \"Weaving the Meaning,\" follows this.*\n\nThe *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Volume Four\nBy Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty\n\"Fu Yan\" (Words as Tokens) Chapter\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It enfolds Heaven and Earth yet has no exterior or interior; it pervades and covers all yet encounters no obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao neither rages nor rejoices. Seated, they harbor no anxieties; awake, they dream no dreams. They perceive things and name them; affairs arise, and they respond.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: \"Fu\" (tokens) demonstrate trust; \"yan\" (words) convey sincerity. The world speaks of \"mandates as tokens,\" \"seals as tokens,\" \"golden tokens,\" \"jade tokens\"—all capable of demonstrating trust and conveying sincerity, where this evokes and that responds. Hence, \"fu yan\" (words as tokens). The Dao is without limit in height or depth, near or far, yet it penetrates all. Without form or name, it possesses sentiment and nature. The sage embodies the Dao, neither privately rejoicing nor raging. They perceive things and name them; affairs arise, and they respond. Their wordless words can serve as tokens of trust.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame as their corpse must generate affairs. Generating affairs means abandoning the public to pursue the private, forsaking the Dao to rely on one’s own views. Seeking praise by doing good, establishing a name by being worthy—such governance does not accord with principle, and such affairs do not align with the times. Governance that does not accord with principle leads to excessive blame; affairs that do not align with the times yield no merit. Rash actions aimed at achieving success cannot absolve one of responsibility; failed affairs are sufficient to destroy the self.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Fame is the instrument of self-destruction, which the sage guards against. Those who covet fame as their corpse must defy Heaven and contravene the Dao, abandoning the public to pursue the private, seeking praise and establishing a name by generating affairs that harm the multitude. Thus, governance does not accord with principle, and merit cannot absolve one of responsibility; failed affairs destroy the self. This is no falsehood.\n\nLaozi said: Do not act as the corpse of fame, do not act as the storehouse of schemes, do not act as the burden of affairs, do not act as the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not seek to be first in fortune, do not initiate calamity. Begin with formlessness, move only when unavoidable. To seek fortune, first avoid calamity; to seek benefit, first distance harm. Thus, those who seek tranquility lose their tranquility and invite peril; those who seek order lose their order and invite chaos.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Thus, those who act without action to seek tranquility lose their tranquility and invite peril; those who act without action to seek order lose their order and invite chaos. Upon examining this passage, the *Zuan Yi* states: 'Those who seek tranquility, when tranquility is lost, invite peril; those who seek order, when order is lost, invite chaos.' It appears the main text should not read 'act without action.' This can be compared with the Ming printed edition for textual variants.*]\n\nTherefore, do not desire to be as dazzling as jade or as unyielding as stone. That which has fine patterns will surely be flayed; that which has beautiful horns will surely be slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words will later incur transgressions; mountains bearing jade will be harmed. The suffering of the black-headed people is already present before the words are spoken.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow. Doing good brings blessings; doing evil brings calamity. Evil must not be committed; fame must not be coveted as one’s corpse. Those who seek tranquility, when tranquility is lost, invite peril; those who seek order, when order is lost, invite chaos. Fine patterns lead to flaying; beautiful horns lead to death. No destruction comes that is not self-invited.\n\nLaozi said: Those who move with the times yet do not know the Dao turn fortune into misfortune, Heaven into a canopy, Earth into a crossbar. Those who skillfully employ the Dao ultimately suffer no exhaustion. Earth as a crossbar, Heaven as a canopy—those who skillfully employ the Dao ultimately suffer no harm. When the five phases are arrayed, there must be conquest. What Heaven covers is without exception fitting. Thus, to know yet not claim to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Thus, to know yet not claim to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\"]\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Heaven as a canopy covers all without exception; Earth as a crossbar bears all without exception. Heaven and Earth’s benevolence toward humanity is boundlessly great. The sage models this, acting in accordance with the times. Where there is movement, there must be following. Like the five phases, which mutually generate and mutually conquer, those who skillfully employ the Dao know without speaking—this is the supreme. Not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal, stones give birth to jade; they mutually erode. Trees give birth to insects, which turn and consume them. People generate affairs, which turn and harm them. Those who delight in affairs are never without misfortune; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Good swimmers drown; good riders fall. Each is harmed by what they delight in.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Each turns and harms themselves.\"]\n\nTo gain lies in timing, not in contention; to govern lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth abides below, contending not for height, thus it is secure and not imperiled. Water flows downward, contending not for speed, thus it departs yet does not lag. Therefore, the sage holds to nothing and thus suffers no loss; acts without action and thus suffers no defeat.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things mutually steal to nourish one another. When theft is appropriate, there is security; when theft is inappropriate, there is harm. Thus, food can nourish people yet also harm them; people can support their lord yet also rebel against him. When those above enact laws and initiate affairs to plunder the people’s strength, it may initially seem beneficial, but in the end, none do not harm themselves. Knowing that to gain lies in timing, not in contention, and that to govern lies in the Dao, not in sagacity, one avoids the loss of mutual theft.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the ancestral teaching of the world. Three words are the heroes of the feudal lords; four words are the pairs of the world. Integrity and trust cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the ancestral teaching of the world. Elevating worthies and virtue makes the feudal lords heroes; hating the few and loving the many makes the world a pair.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Few words invite few faults; few actions invite few regrets. It lies in conduct, not in words. Grasping the great image, the world comes to you—it lies in virtue, not in peril. Only when the mouth utters good can it avoid stirring conflict. Can words not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: People have three deaths that are not fated. Immoderate eating and drinking, belittling the body—disease kills them. Unrestrained joy and insatiable seeking—punishment kills them. Attacking the many with the few, overpowering the strong with the weak—weapons kill them.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Life must end in death; who among people can avoid it? Yet to die not by fate is truly lamentable. Gluttony and desire die by disease; greed and desire die by punishment; aggression and strength die by weapons. Though the causes of these three deaths differ, their lack of fate is the same.\n\nLaozi said: Those who bestow generously receive beautiful recompense; those who harbor great resentment suffer deep calamity. To bestow little yet expect much, to harbor resentment yet hope for no misfortune—such has never existed. Examine what has gone forth, and you will know what will return.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: The principle of bestowal and recompense is like planting melons to harvest melons, planting fruit to harvest fruit. The retribution of kindness and resentment follows the same principle.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the mandate of Heaven, order the arts of the heart, regulate likes and dislikes, and adapt to the nature of the emotions—thus the governance of the Dao is unimpeded. Tracing the mandate of Heaven prevents confusion about fortune and misfortune; ordering the arts of the heart prevents reckless joy and anger; regulating likes and dislikes prevents greed for the useless; adapting to the nature of the emotions prevents excessive desire. Not being confused about fortune and misfortune ensures that movement and stillness accord with principle; not being reckless in joy and anger ensures that rewards and punishments are not biased; not being greedy for the useless ensures that desire does not harm one’s nature; not exceeding the bounds of desire ensures nurturing life and knowing contentment. These four do not seek from without or borrow from others; they return to the self and are obtained.\n\nThe four—tracing the mandate of Heaven, ordering the arts of the heart, regulating likes and dislikes, and adapting to the nature of the emotions—are interconnected, like the moon in water: its waxing and waning, its fullness and crescence, appear as reflections following its form. The rectitude or perversity of the heart’s arts brings fortune or misfortune in its wake.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue conduct that invites reproach; do not resent others’ reproaches of oneself. Cultivate virtue sufficient for praise, yet do not seek others’ praise. One cannot ensure misfortune does not arrive by trusting in one’s refusal to welcome it; one cannot ensure fortune must come by trusting in one’s refusal to yield it. Misfortune’s arrival is not of one’s own making, thus one may be impoverished yet not anxious. Fortune’s coming is not of one’s own achievement, thus one may be prosperous yet not proud. Therefore, dwelling in leisure brings joy; acting without contrivance brings governance.\n\nTracing the mandate: Trusting oneself, what is there to seek? Resenting others, what is there to hate? Virtue and conduct arise from oneself; praise or blame arise from others. Thus, praise does not spur one on, nor does slander discourage. Dwelling in leisure, one finds joy; governing without ceasing, one finds order.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao consists in preserving what one already possesses, not seeking what one has not yet obtained. Seeking what one has not yet obtained causes what one already has to be lost; following what one already possesses causes what one desires to arrive. Governance that is not firmly rooted in non-chaos yet strives for order is surely perilous. Conduct not yet free from wrongdoing yet hastily seeking fame is surely thwarted. Thus, no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune; no benefit is greater than the absence of defense. Some things, when augmented, are diminished; when diminished, are augmented. The Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue advantage, yet it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Thus, one may constantly be without misfortune, yet not constantly possess fortune; one may constantly be without guilt, yet not constantly achieve merit.\n\nThe Dao is vast and obscure, following Heaven’s majesty, sharing Heaven’s qi. It is without thought or planning, without preparation or hoarding. What comes is not welcomed; what goes is not pursued. Though people move east, west, south, or north, one stands alone at the center. Thus, amidst the crooked multitude, one does not lose one’s straightness; flowing with the world, one does not depart from one’s domain. One does not act for goodness nor avoid ugliness, following Heaven’s Dao. One does not initiate nor act alone, following Heaven’s principle. One does not premeditate nor abandon the times, taking Heaven as one’s measure. One does not seek gain nor refuse fortune, following Heaven’s norm. Within, there is no extraordinary fortune; without, there is no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise.\n\nIf others act as thieves, the utmost virtue speaks the same words, shares the same path, and enjoys the same fortune. Above and below are of one heart, without divergence. Those who stand by the roadside are sent away; the path is opened to goodness, and the people turn toward the proper direction.\n\nTracing the mandate: Coveting gain and forgetting loss is a malady common to all. Without desire, one is thus tranquil—this is called the perfected person. The principles in the world cannot be certain. Preserving what one already has may bring what is not yet obtained; seeking what is not yet obtained may cause what one already has to be lost. Therefore, one of the Dao within has no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. One joins Heaven as a companion—how could others act as thieves against one?\n\nLaozi said: Acting with goodness spurs one on; acting without goodness invites observation. Spurring gives rise to esteem; observation gives rise to trouble. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame; it can only be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor seek praise through knowledge. Governance follows nature; one who does nothing has nothing unaccomplished; one who seeks nothing has nothing unattained. People may be limited, yet the Dao is unimpeded. One may possess knowledge, yet acting without contrivance achieves the same merit as the unknowing. One may possess ability, yet acting without busyness achieves the same virtue as the incapable. Possessing knowledge yet appearing unknowing, possessing ability yet appearing incapable—when the principle of the Dao is thoroughly understood, human talent vanishes.\n\nPeople and the Dao cannot both be illustrious. If people love fame, they do not employ the Dao. When the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao recedes and fame flourishes, peril and ruin follow.\n\nTracing the mandate: Acting with goodness yet not seeking fortune, fortune arrives; acting with evil yet not seeking misfortune, misfortune arises. Leaving behind a fragrant reputation for ten thousand generations, through the ages, one should indeed be at ease. Thus, loving fame and valuing it causes the heart not to employ the Dao; delving deeply into the Dao causes the self not to seek fame. Herein lies the division between Heaven and humanity.\n\nLaozi said: If trustworthy men were to divide wealth, it would be better to determine shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intention cannot achieve fairness as well as those without. If vigilant men were to guard wealth, it would be better to close the doors and seal it completely. For those with desire cannot be as secure in defense as those without. If people point out one’s flaws, one resents them; if a mirror reveals one’s ugliness, one improves oneself. One who can engage with things without involving the self is free from entanglement.\n\nTracing the mandate: Dividing wealth by drawing lots—having intention is not as fair as being without intention. Guarding wealth by closing doors—having desire is not as incorruptible as being without desire. Pointing out flaws causes resentment in others, thus one does not love them; reflecting on ugliness to improve oneself is within oneself, thus one loves it. Only when engaging with things yet having no involvement with the self does one have no such intention, and others have no flaws in one.\n\nLaozi said: In all matters of serving others, if not with treasures or gifts, one must use humble words. Gifts are exhausted, yet desires remain unfulfilled; the body is humbled, words are exhausted, yet alliances are not formed. Oaths and covenants are sworn, agreements are made, yet one betrays them first. Therefore, the noble person does not outwardly adorn benevolence and righteousness but inwardly cultivates virtue and the Dao. One attends to the affairs within one’s borders, exhausts the expanse of one’s land, encourages the people to hold fast to death, and strengthens the city walls. Above and below are of one heart, defending the altars of the state together. Thus, one who acts for fame does not attack; one who acts for profit without guilt does not invade. This is the certain way to preserve wholeness and the certain principle of securing benefit.\n\nTracing the mandate: Serving others with treasures and gifts—gifts are exhausted, yet desires remain unfulfilled. Forming alliances with humble words—words are exhausted, yet agreements are betrayed first. Only by inwardly cultivating virtue and the Dao, with above and below of one heart, can one defend the altars of the state and protect the people. This is the complete Dao.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome the heart; the multitude does not overcome desire. The noble person acts with upright qi; the petty person acts with perverse qi. Internally, one accords with one’s nature; externally, one harmonizes with righteousness. Moving in accordance with principle, not bound by things—this is upright qi. Indulging in flavors, addicted to sounds and colors, giving rein to joy and anger without regard for later consequences—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright harm each other; desire and nature harm each other. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Therefore, the sage reduces desire to follow nature.\n\nThe eyes love beauty, the ears love sounds, the nose loves fragrance, the mouth loves flavor—gathering and indulging in these, one does not depart from considerations of benefit and harm, from cravings and desires. The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; it is the heart that controls them, each obtaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desire cannot prevail.\n\nTracing the mandate: This is the division between the heart of the Dao and the human heart, between Heavenly principle and human desire. When principle prevails, all actions are Heavenly; when desire prevails, all actions are human. Herein lies the division between the noble person and the petty person. Principle and desire contend; the perverse and the upright harm each other. If even the noble person does not act thus, how much less the sage?\n\nLaozi said: Those who govern the body and nurture their nature regulate their rest and dwelling, moderate their diet, harmonize their joy and anger, and adjust their movement and stillness—thus what lies within the self is attained, and pernicious qi has no means of entry. Those who indulge what is external injure what is internal; those who gratify their emotions harm their spirit. Those who are dazzled by appearances are obscured in their truth.\n\nThus, one who must pause without forgetting their worthiness will surely exhaust their nature; one who walks a hundred paces without forgetting their appearance will surely burden their form. Therefore, those with beautiful plumage injure their bones and frame; those with lush branches and leaves harm their roots. One who can perfect both is nowhere to be found under Heaven.\n\nTracing the mandate: The true Dao nurtures the spirit; the human Dao nurtures the form. What lies within is attained; what lies without is made light. Distancing oneself from sounds and sights, moderating rich flavors—this is the Way of nurturing the form. Cutting off thought and guarding the essence-qi—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. To govern the body and nurture one’s nature, attaining both inner and outer, how could this be achieved through mere sounds and smiles?\n\nLaozi said: Heaven possesses brightness and does not worry over the people’s darkness; Earth possesses wealth and does not worry over the people’s poverty.\n\nThe perfected Daoist, like a mountain’s peak, stands immovable—unyielding, self-sufficient. Travelers take it as their landmark, yet it remains straight and complete unto itself. Things do not bestow upon it, nor does it accept their virtue. Thus, abiding in stillness, it endures; Heaven and Earth have no part in it. Hence, nothing is taken from it, no virtue is owed, and so no resentment arises.\n\nThose who excel in anger invite much resentment; those who excel in giving invite much taking. Only by following the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth can one master principle. Thus, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil attends. Profit becomes harm’s beginning, blessing becomes misfortune’s precursor. Seek no profit, and harm does not arise; seek no blessing, and misfortune does not come. The body takes wholeness as its constant; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nTracing the mandate: The sage illuminates all within the seas, yet the people are not benighted; treasures all beneath Heaven, yet the people are not impoverished. Accord with the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth, let the myriad things grow of themselves. Give nothing in private, and nothing is taken in public; bestow no light rewards, and no heavy punishments arise. Regard wealth and honor as floating clouds—only then can one preserve one’s true nature.\n\nLaozi said: The sage wears no eccentric garments, performs no strange deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious—unobstructed yet not florid, impoverished yet not cowed, honored yet not conspicuous, humbled yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In common use, he cannot be named—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nTracing the mandate: Plain and unadorned, strange conduct—how could these be the sage’s affairs? Shining yet not dazzling, sharp yet not cutting, he shares common use with the people—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is straight unto itself, awaiting the arrival of its time. One cannot hasten its return; when its time departs, one cannot pull it back. Thus, the sage does not advance to seek, does not retreat to yield, but follows the time. When the three seasons pass, the time leaves me behind; when the three seasons come, the time follows behind me. Neither departing nor approaching, I stand at the center of my place. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—only virtue is its companion. Blessings arrive not from one’s seeking, so one does not boast of merit; misfortunes come not from one’s doing, so one does not regret one’s conduct. The heart abides in tranquility, unburdened by virtue. Dogs bark, yet one is not startled—trusting in one’s nature, sincere and without transgression, thus the one who embodies the Dao is not deluded. Knowing fate, one is not anxious. When emperors and kings perish, their bones are buried in the wild, yet their sacrifices are offered in the Bright Hall—spirit is prized above form. Thus, when spirit governs form, form obeys; when form overcomes spirit, spirit is exhausted. Though wisdom and insight are employed, they must return to spirit—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nTracing the mandate: The Dao is the shared path of all under Heaven. The sage is straight unto himself, awaiting the time’s coming and going, neither leading nor welcoming, standing at the center to govern the four directions. He does not boast of merit, does not regret his conduct. His heart is tranquil, embodying the Dao and knowing fate. Though wisdom and insight are employed, they must return to spirit.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness—thus their names did not move. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty—thus their hearts did not move. Therefore, humility brought joy, stillness brought contentment. Counting their years, they grieved over the world’s chaos as one grieves over a river’s drying, weeping to replenish it. Thus, those who do not grieve over the world’s chaos but delight in their own governance can be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nTracing the mandate: The Dao is honored, virtue is prized—delighting the heart and preserving the self. Thus, poverty and lowliness do not move one’s heart and will. If the self is governed, what need is there to worry over the world? How could one, with a lifespan of less than a hundred years, take on the world’s burdens?\n\nLaozi said: People have three resentments: those with high rank are envied; those with great office are despised by their lord; those with generous emoluments are resented. Thus, the higher the rank, the more one’s intent should humble; the greater the office, the smaller one’s heart should be; the thicker the emoluments, the more one’s giving should spread. Cultivate these three, and resentment will not arise. Therefore, lowliness is the root of nobility, and humility is the foundation of height.\n\nTracing the mandate: High rank breeds arrogance, and people will envy; great office breeds haughtiness, and the lord will despise; thick emoluments breed stinginess, and people will resent. This is the way of high and low overturning each other. Only through humility and generosity, never forgetting lowliness or humility, can one avoid resentment and blame.\n\nLaozi said: Speech is the means by which one communicates oneself to others; hearing is the means by which others communicate to oneself. Being both deaf and blind, the human way is obstructed. Those with deafness and blindness do not know how to manage affairs—how could only the body suffer from deafness and blindness? The heart, too, has them. Blockage—no one knows what it obstructs. This is the blindness and deafness of the heart. The Dao is the ancestor of all things—all that has form is born from it, and its kinship is deep. Those who consume grain and breathe qi all live long—its lordship is generous. All the wise study it—its teaching is bright. Yet people harm what is useful with what is useless. Thus, knowledge is not broad, and days are insufficient. With the days spent on chess and gambling, one asks about the Dao. Yet not hearing, not asking—this is like the deaf and blind among people.\n\nTracing the mandate: Receiving form and being born, one owes the debt of kinship; consuming grain and living long, one owes the debt of the lord’s generosity; through study and enlightenment, one owes the debt of the teacher’s virtue. Growing to adulthood, the body is also noble. Speech is the voice of the heart, communicating oneself to others—without speech, it is not conveyed. Communicating others to oneself—without speech, it is not heard. Speech is the spirit’s manifestation. If one does not let private speech obstruct public speech, does not harm what is useful with what is useless, then one’s hearing of the Dao is deep and not isolated—one becomes a person of the highest order.\n\nLaozi said: Human nature is such that the heart submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue is present or absent—this is what one seeks. Thus, the sage who desires to be valued by others first values others; who desires to be honored by others first honors others; who desires to overcome others first overcomes himself; who desires to humble others first humbles himself. Thus, nobility and lowliness, honor and humility are governed by the Dao. The ancient sage-kings spoke to humble themselves before others, placed themselves behind others—thus the world delighted in pushing them forward and did not tire, in bearing them and did not find it heavy. This is because their virtue was abundant and their qi harmonious. Thus, knowing that giving is taking, that putting oneself last is putting oneself first—this is guarding the Dao.\n\nTracing the mandate: Ritual values putting oneself first; speech values putting oneself last—this is human nature. Thus, one can be made to submit through virtue, not through force. Therefore, the sage advances and retreats with measure, puts himself first and last with propriety—thus the world delights in pushing him forward and bearing him.\n\nLaozi said: Little virtue with much favor invites ridicule; low talent with high position invites danger; no great merit with thick emoluments invites calamity. Thus, some things are increased yet diminished, discarded yet increased. The multitude knows the benefit of benefit but not the harm of harm. Only the sage knows that harm is benefit and benefit is harm. Thus, a tree twice laden with fruit will have its roots injured; a family with much stored wealth will have its posterity imperiled. Great profit reverses into harm—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Virtue is not weary of breadth, and one’s share must not be overstepped. When water is shallow and the boat large, it runs aground; when a tree is great but its roots shallow, it is uprooted. A man’s virtue thin and talent meager, harboring no benevolence yet occupying high position—rarely does he not meet uprooting. Only one who knows the reversal of benefit and harm, who cherishes no excessive hoarding, and attains harmony of righteousness and profit—what harm can befall him?\n\nLaozi said: The petty man engages in affairs saying, “Let me but gain”; the noble man says, “Let me but act with righteousness.” The doer of good does not seek fame, yet fame follows him. Fame does not arrange to meet profit, yet profit accrues to him. Their pursuit is the same, but their ends differ. Thus, where action brings benefit, harm follows; where words lack constancy and conduct lacks propriety—this is the petty man. One discerning in one matter and proficient in one skill is a middling man. One who encompasses all and possesses manifold abilities, whose talents are employed with skill—this is the sage.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Round skulls and square feet, bearing teeth and wearing hair—all are equally human. Yet the endowment of qi differs, and wisdom and folly are thereby distinguished. The petty man, in his pursuit of gain, has talent that outstrips virtue; the noble man, in his pursuit of righteousness, has virtue that outstrips talent. One who can rise or descend is a middling man; one whom Heaven endows with manifold abilities—is he not the sage?\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, when the world is ordered, one defends the self with righteousness; when the world is chaotic, one defends righteousness with the self. The day of death is the culmination of one’s conduct. Therefore, the noble man is cautious in his every application. Life is what we receive from Heaven; fate is what we encounter in time. To possess talent but not meet one’s era—this is Heaven’s doing. The noble man can do good but cannot ensure he will obtain fortune; he refrains from doing wrong yet may not escape calamity. Thus, when the noble man meets his time, he advances—if he obtains it through righteousness, what good fortune is there? When his time does not come, he retreats—if he yields with propriety, what misfortune is there? Thus, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he does not regret, for he has attained what he values.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: We receive our mandate from Heaven and are endowed with form as humans. Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. What we encounter in time—whether straitened or flourishing—is none other than fate. To possess talent yet not meet one’s era—this is Heaven’s doing. Therefore, the noble man does good, yet fortune does not necessarily follow; he does not do wrong, yet calamity does not necessarily depart. Thus, when he meets his time, he rides forth; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. What is noble lies within me.\n\nLaozi said: People have qi of compliance and opposition, born of the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi complies; when the heart is disordered, qi opposes. The order or disorder of the heart lies in the Dao. Attaining the Dao, the heart is ordered; losing the Dao, the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, there is deference; when the heart is disordered, there is contention. Deference engenders virtue; contention breeds harm. With virtue, qi complies; with harm, qi opposes. When qi complies, one diminishes oneself to serve others; when qi opposes, one diminishes others to serve oneself. Qi can be governed by the Dao. The Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to sound: virtue accumulates and fortune arrives; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises. Officialdom corrupts learning; filial piety wanes amid wife and children. Worry breeds disaster; illness worsens when near recovery. Thus, if one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning, no affairs will fail.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The *Yin Fu Jing* says: The five thieves reside in the heart and act upon Heaven’s qi. When qi complies, there is order; when qi opposes, there is chaos. Order brings deference; chaos brings contention. When qi opposes the heart, it harms the self; when qi opposes the times, it harms the state. Only by governing qi with the Dao can one diminish oneself to serve others. Though one’s office flourishes, it cannot corrupt one’s learning; though one has wife and children, they cannot weaken one’s filial piety. How can there be the disaster of worry or the illness of near recovery? If one is cautious to the end, nothing will be lost.\n\nLaozi said: To lift the crooked and place them with the straight—how can this not succeed? To lift the straight and place them with the crooked—do not do so, and they will not go. This is what is meant by “sharing the same filth yet dwelling in different mud.”\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: It does not say “discard the crooked and correct the straight” but rather “lift the crooked and place them with the straight.” Why? To lift the crooked and place them with the straight is to elevate petty men and return them to the noble man—how can this not succeed? To lift the straight and place them with the crooked is to push noble men into the realm of petty men—noble men will not go. To share the same filth yet dwell in different mud is to abide by the petty man’s way, harmonizing without flowing away.\n\nLaozi said: The sage treats life and death as one; the fool also treats life and death as one. The sage’s unity of life and death is clarity regarding the division of principle; the fool’s unity of life and death is ignorance of where benefit and harm lie. The Dao hangs in the heavens and spreads upon the earth; harmony resides in man. If the ruler’s heart is not harmonious, Heaven’s qi will not descend, earth’s qi will not rise, yin and yang will not align, wind and rain will not come in season, and the people will suffer illness and hunger.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The use of harmony is supreme. Heaven attains it, and the ten thousand images are bright; earth attains it, and the ten thousand things are born; man attains it, and the ten thousand affairs are accomplished. Can the ruler’s heart afford to lose harmony? If lost, Heaven and earth will not interact, and the people will suffer illness and hunger. Though sage and fool share the same life and death, what differs lies between righteousness and profit. Profit is the harmony of righteousness. The sage is clear about the division of principle—profit is also righteousness. The fool does not know where benefit and harm lie—righteousness is also profit.\n\nLaozi said: To obtain the troops of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing one apt word. To obtain the Marquis of Sui’s pearl is not as good as obtaining the origin of affairs. To obtain the He Shi jade is not as good as obtaining the proper application of affairs. Though the world is vast, those who delight in using troops will perish; though the state is secure, those who delight in war will be imperiled. Thus, a small state with few people, though possessing weapons of ten or a hundredfold, does not use them.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Yu bowed to wise counsel, dismissed the army, and set the troops in order—thus the Miao people submitted. Hearing one apt word surpasses ten thousand troops. Obtaining the Marquis of Sui’s pearl or the He Shi jade is not as good as obtaining the origin and proper application of affairs. Thus, the sage values the Dao, not treasures; esteems virtue, not merit. How could he willingly endanger himself with troops?\n\nLaozi said: One who can become a hegemon or king must be one whose virtue prevails. One who can prevail over enemies must be strong. One who can be strong must employ the strength of others. One who can employ the strength of others must win their hearts. One who can win their hearts must first win himself. One who wins himself must be yielding and weak. To prevail over those not equal to oneself—when it comes to those equal to oneself, one must be measured. To prevail through yielding surpasses those equal to oneself—its outcome cannot be fathomed. Thus, to achieve great victory with those who cannot prevail—only the sage can do this.\n\nHe who inherits the meaning of virtue prevails as a hegemon by winning the hearts of others; he who prevails over enemies is strong by employing the strength of others. Yet without winning the hearts of others, none can employ their strength. How then can enemies be overcome? How can strength lead to hegemony? Virtue arises from self-attainment. Self-attainment yields yielding and weakness, which prevail over rigidity and strength. Thus, one can prevail over those not equal to oneself. When it comes to those equal to oneself, this is a case of equal virtue. Yet yielding surpasses those equal to oneself—its outcome cannot be fathomed. Here, virtue again prevails over oneself. Therefore, to achieve great victory with those who cannot prevail—only the sage can do this.\n\n*Wenzi, Inheriting the Meaning, Scroll 4*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, Wenzi, Inheriting the Meaning, Scroll 5*\n*By Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**The Dao and Virtue**\n\nWenzi asked Dao of Laozi, saying: \"When learning is not refined and listening to the Dao is not profound, how can one who listens hope to attain wisdom, perfect conduct, or achieve merit and fame? Without refinement, there is no clarity; without depth, there is no attainment. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with spirit; in middling learning, one listens with the heart; in inferior learning, one listens with the ears. To listen with the ears is to have learning in the skin; to listen with the heart is to have learning in the flesh; to listen with spirit is to have learning in the bone marrow. If listening is not profound, knowledge is not clear; if knowledge is not clear, one cannot exhaust its essence; if one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct cannot be perfected.\n\nIn general, the principle of listening requires an empty mind, tranquility, and the reduction of qi—without excess, without thought, without worry. The eyes must not gaze recklessly, nor the ears listen carelessly. One must concentrate, accumulate, and store within, filling the intent and merging it. Once attained, one must firmly guard it and preserve it for long.\n\nThe Dao is the origin and source of all things, the beginning of all beginnings. It begins in softness and weakness, and is completed in hardness and strength. It begins in brevity and scarcity, and is completed in abundance and length. A tree ten spans in girth begins as a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below. This is the Way of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below; withdrawal is how one places oneself behind; frugality is how one makes oneself small; reduction is how one makes oneself few. Thus, humility leads to honor, withdrawal to precedence, frugality to expansiveness, and reduction to greatness—this is what the Way of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of virtue, the root of Heaven, the gate of fortune. All things depend on it to live, to be completed, and to find peace. The Dao is non-action and formless. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and affairs are established, it neighbors Heaven. It is non-action, yet nothing is left undone. None know its true nature, none know its reality, yet within it there is sincerity.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, all under Heaven submit, and the altars of soil and grain endure. When the feudal lords possess the Dao, the people are harmonious and do not lose their states. When the scholar-commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their persons and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without battle. When the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contention. When affairs are undertaken with the Dao, success is achieved and fortune is gained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness. When father and son possess the Dao, there is affection and filial piety. When scholar-commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao there is harmony; without it, there is harshness. From this, it is evident that the Dao is fitting for all people in all circumstances.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune. When practiced to its fullest, all under Heaven submit. Submission leads to cherishing. Thus, the emperor is the one to whom all under Heaven turn; the king is the one to whom all under Heaven go. If all under Heaven do not turn or go, one cannot be called emperor or king. Therefore, even if an emperor or king gains the people, without the Dao he cannot succeed; even if he gains the people but loses the Dao, he cannot preserve his position.\n\nThose who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and lazy. They are haughty, self-important, and self-aggrandizing. They hold to dominance and rigidity, create difficulties, sow enmity, provoke warfare, and become the instigators of chaos. When petty men practice this, they bring great calamity upon themselves; when great men practice it, their states perish. The calamity may be shallow, affecting only themselves, or deep, extending to their descendants. No crime is greater than lacking the Dao; no resentment is deeper than lacking virtue. This is the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"One who practices the Dao causes others, though brave, to be unable to pierce him, and though skillful, to be unable to strike him. Though they cannot pierce or strike him, he is still humiliated—this is not as good as causing others, though brave, to dare not pierce him, and though skillful, to dare not strike him. Yet even this 'daring not' is not the absence of intent—it is not as good as causing others to have no such intent. When there is no such intent, there is no mind of love or benefit—it is not as good as causing all men and women under Heaven to rejoice and desire to love and benefit him. When this is so, there is no land where one is not a ruler, no office where one is not a leader. All under Heaven wish for his peace and benefit. Thus, courage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life.\"\n\nWenzi asked about virtue. Laozi said: \"To nurture, nourish, foster, and grow; to benefit all without partiality; to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue. What is benevolence? To be above without boasting of merit, to be below without shame of faults; in great matters not to be arrogant, in small matters not to be negligent; to love universally without selfishness, and to endure without decline—this is called benevolence. What is righteousness? To be above and assist the weak, to be below and uphold integrity; when prosperous, not to indulge one’s desires; when impoverished, not to change one’s principles; to measure by the standard, follow principle, and not act selfishly or perversely—this is called righteousness. What is propriety? To be above and be reverent and solemn, to be below and be humble and respectful; to yield and be the female of all under Heaven; to stand in not daring, to establish in inability—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue causes those below to follow commands; cultivating benevolence causes those below not to contend; cultivating righteousness causes those below to be upright; cultivating propriety causes those below to be respectful. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure. Therefore, the Dao gives birth to things; virtue nurtures them; benevolence loves them; righteousness rectifies them; propriety respects them. Without nurturing and nourishing, one cannot foster growth; without kindness and love, one cannot bring to completion; without rectitude and correction, one cannot endure; without respect and honor, one cannot esteem and value. Thus, virtue is what the people cherish; benevolence is what the people embrace; righteousness is what the people fear; propriety is what the people respect. These four are the proper sequence of culture and the means by which the sage governs the myriad things.\n\nWhen the noble man lacks virtue, those below resent him; without benevolence, those below contend; without righteousness, those below are violent; without propriety, those below are chaotic. When these four classics are not established, it is called lacking the Dao. There has never been one who lacked the Dao and did not perish.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"In the age of utmost virtue, merchants find convenience in the marketplace, farmers delight in the fields, great officers are secure in their posts, recluses cultivate their ways, and the people enjoy their occupations. Thus, wind and rain do not destroy, plants and trees do not die prematurely, the Yellow River yields its diagrams, and the Luo River yields its writings. When the age declines, taxes and levies are without measure, killing and execution are unceasing, those who remonstrate with punishments are killed, and worthy scholars are suppressed. Thus, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, creeping things do not rest, and the wilds lack all vegetation.\n\nTherefore, when the world is well-governed, even fools cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil in life. When the utmost virtue and the Dao prevail, it is fate. Thus, life encounters fate and then can act; fate meets the times and then can be understood. There must be the right age before there can be the right person.\"\n\nWenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom. Laozi said: \"To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. Thus, the sage constantly perceives where fortune and misfortune arise and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise constantly see fortune and misfortune take shape and choose their conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious of Heaven’s Dao, thus knowing where fortune and misfortune arise. The wise foresee their formation, thus knowing the gateway of fortune and misfortune. To hear before they arise is sagacity; to see before they form is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"If a ruler favors righteousness, he will trust the times and rely on himself, abandoning calculation to employ kindness. Broad knowledge with shallow means cannot deeply provide; broadness without depth has never existed. Relying solely on one’s wisdom, failures will be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhausted strategies; favoring courage is the path to peril and ruin. Favoring bestowal leads to no fixed share—if the ruler’s portion is not fixed, the people’s expectations will be endless. If heavy exactions are made, it turns the people into enemies. Taking little but giving much, such calculations will cease. Thus, favoring bestowal is the path that invites resentment. From this, it is clear: wealth is insufficient to employ the Dao and its arts; one must rely on clarity.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How did the kings of antiquity govern the world with the Dao?\" Laozi said: \"They held to the One and practiced non-action, following Heaven and Earth and adapting to their transformations. The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped or acted upon. To act is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it. Those who grasp see only the small; seeing the small, they cannot accomplish the great. Non-action means maintaining stillness. By maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in great fullness without overflowing, dwelling in high nobility without arrogance—abiding in greatness without overflowing, full yet not deficient; dwelling above without arrogance, exalted yet not imperiled; full yet not deficient, thus long preserving wealth; exalted yet not imperiled, thus long preserving nobility. Wealth and nobility do not depart from one’s person, and blessings extend to descendants. The kingly Dao of antiquity was complete in this.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The people have a Dao they all follow, laws they all uphold. Righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler holds to the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Dao is not for action but for non-action. The wise do not make virtue their task; the brave do not employ force for violence; the benevolent do not use position for favor—this is called unity. Unity is the Dao without preference, the root of the myriad things. If a ruler frequently changes the state’s laws, and the state frequently changes its ruler, people use their positions to pursue their likes and dislikes, and the tasks of subordinates become unmanageable. Thus, if a ruler loses the One, the chaos is worse than having no ruler. The ruler must hold to the One before he can unite the many.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How many are the kingly ways?\" Laozi said: \"Only one.\" Wenzi said: \"In antiquity, some ruled with the Dao, others with military force—how are they one?\" Laozi said: \"Those who rule with the Dao do so through virtue; those who rule with military force also do so through virtue. In the use of arms, there are five types: righteous armies, responsive armies, resentful armies, greedy armies, and arrogant armies. Punishing the violent and aiding the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use force, it is called responsive; contending over small matters without restraining one’s heart is called resentful; desiring others’ lands and coveting their wealth is called greedy; relying on one’s state’s greatness, boasting of its people’s multitude, and seeking superiority over enemy states is called arrogant. Righteous armies triumph; responsive armies prevail; resentful armies are defeated; greedy armies perish; arrogant armies are destroyed—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Abandoning the Dao to rely on wisdom leads to peril; discarding calculation to employ talent leads to distress. Thus, maintaining one’s role and following principle, one does not grieve over losses nor rejoice over gains. Success is not sought; what is obtained is not pursued. Incoming, there is reception without taking; outgoing, there is bestowal without giving. Following spring to give life, following autumn to bring death—those who live owe no gratitude; those who die bear no resentment. This is near to the Dao.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How does a ruler gain the people’s joyful hearts?\" Laozi said: \"Be like the rivers and seas—bland and without flavor, inexhaustible in use. Putting the small before the great, if one wishes to lead others, one must humble one’s words before them; if one wishes to precede others, one must place oneself behind them. The world must emulate one’s joy and love, advancing one’s benevolence and righteousness without harshness. Dwelling above, the people do not find one burdensome; standing before them, the multitude is not harmed. The world delights in advancing one without weariness. Though distant lands and foreign customs, even the flying insects and creeping things, none are not cherished and loved. There is nowhere one does not reach, no place one does not succeed. Thus, one is honored by the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Holding to the world’s laws and records to oppose the customs of succeeding generations is like gluing the pegs of a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexible adaptation, applying measures suited to circumstances. As eras differ, affairs change; as times shift, customs transform. Thus, one does not model after already established laws but models after the principles that create laws, moving with transformation. The sage’s laws can be observed, but the reasons for their creation cannot be traced; his words can be heard, but the sources of his speech cannot be discerned. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, considered the myriad things insignificant, equated life and death, and harmonized with change. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the feelings of the myriad things. Above, they befriended the Dao; below, they accompanied transformation. Now, if one wishes to learn their Dao but does not attain their clarity and mysterious sagacity, merely adhering to their laws and records and enforcing their statutes and decrees, one certainly cannot govern effectively.\"\n\nWenzi asked about governance. Laozi said: \"Guide them with the Dao, nourish them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not impose force. Diminish and hold to the One. Have no place for profit, no display of desire. Be square without cutting, be sharp without wounding. Be without pride, without boasting. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will attach themselves; nourish them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not impose force, and the people will be simple. Not displaying worthiness is frugality; not imposing force is humility. Descend to gather them, bestow to obtain them, be frugal to preserve oneself, be humble to secure oneself. Without descending, they scatter; without nourishing, they rebel. Displaying worthiness causes the people to contend; imposing force causes them to resent. Scattering weakens the state’s power; rebellion strips the ruler of authority. Contention leads to disregard for wrongdoing; resentment of superiors endangers one’s position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Dao is near.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The superior’s words are employed by the inferior; the inferior’s words are employed by the superior. The superior’s words are constantly used; the inferior’s words are used flexibly. Only the sage can know the flexible words and yet be certain, fulfill expectations and yet be appropriate. The highest conduct in the world is to testify for one’s father with integrity, for one’s daughter to die for trust—who can esteem such? Thus, the sage discusses the right and wrong of affairs, bending and extending with them without fixed standards. When blessed, he is a named lord; when drowned, he is seized by his father—circumstances compel this. Flexibility is how the sage uniquely foresees. To first oppose and then conform is called flexibility; to first conform and then oppose is to not know flexibility. Those who do not know flexibility turn good into ugliness.\"\n\nWenzi asked, \"Master, in your teaching, none but the Dao and virtue can govern the world. Yet among the kings of antiquity who inherited their thrones and continued their legacies, some were without the Dao—how did they pass their eras without calamity or ruin?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own life, yet the sustenance varies in abundance. The world often sees states perish and families break apart, not for lack of the Dao and virtue. With the Dao and virtue, one rises early and retires late, ever vigilant, trembling with fear of peril. Without the Dao and virtue, one indulges desires and grows indolent—ruin comes without warning. Had Jie and Zhou followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even the worthy Tang and Wu could have achieved no merit.\n\nThe Dao and virtue are what nurture life, what rear and sustain, what foster love and affection, what command respect and esteem. Even the deaf and mute, though foolish, do not harm what they love. If all under heaven held a heart of benevolence and love, how could disaster or misfortune arise?\n\nThose without the Dao yet free from harm still retain some thread of benevolence, some remnant of righteousness. But when benevolence is not wholly severed and righteousness not entirely lost, the feudal lords grow contemptuous of their superiors. When lords scorn their superiors, the court becomes irreverent. Should they then defy orders and disobey, when benevolence is severed and righteousness lost, lords rebel, the strong oppress the weak, the great encroach upon the small, and the people take assault as their trade. Disasters arise, chaos erupts—ruin comes swiftly. How could one expect to escape harm?\n\nLaozi said, \"When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people grow deceitful. When the ruler is meddlesome, the subjects adopt many guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To create trouble to resolve trouble is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate peril through cunning and then rely on cunning to guard against it is like stirring water and hoping for clarity.\n\nLaozi said, \"If a ruler favors benevolence, he rewards those without merit and pardons the guilty. If he favors punishment, he dismisses the meritorious and condemns the innocent. Without preferences or aversions, he metes out punishment without resentment and bestows favors without expectation. He follows the plumb line and levels himself by the standard, remaining uninvolved like heaven and earth. How could he not cover and sustain, harmonizing all? To unite and reconcile is the role of the ruler; to distinguish and punish is the function of the law. When the people accept punishment without resentment, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said, \"Under heaven, right and wrong are never fixed. Each age approves what it deems good and condemns what it loathes. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but what aligns with themselves. They do not reject wickedness but what contradicts their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and abide by it, to select what is wrong and discard it, I would not know what the world calls right or wrong. Thus, governing a great state is like frying a small fish—do not stir it.\n\nThose who rush to conform speak to flatter and grow closer, yet when their counsel is sound, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await the world’s response, how would I know what the age expects of me? If I raced with the crowd, it would be like fleeing the rain—nowhere to go without getting drenched. To desire emptiness yet be unable to attain it—only one who does not strive for emptiness yet naturally embodies it achieves what they seek without fail.\n\nThus, one who penetrates the Dao is like a chariot’s axle: it does not move itself yet, with the wheel, travels a thousand miles, turning endlessly on the infinite plain. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao, returning to the ultimate and unchanging, awaiting transformation. Moving yet without action.\n\nLaozi said, \"A state that wages frequent wars and achieves repeated victories will surely perish. Frequent wars exhaust the people; repeated victories make the ruler arrogant. An arrogant ruler indulges without restraint, pushing things to extremes; an exhausted people grow resentful, their grievances reaching their limit. When both ruler and people are at their extremes, ruin is inevitable. Thus, to withdraw when one’s work is done is the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi, \"I have heard that you attained the Dao from Lao Dan. Yet even worthy men, though possessed of the Dao, encounter eras of chaos. With the authority of one man, how can they transform a long-corrupted people?\"\n\nWenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue correct the crooked to make it straight, quell disorder to restore order, and refine excess to return to simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world finds peace—all hinges on the one man. The ruler is the people’s teacher; the superior is the inferior’s model. If the superior embodies beauty, the inferior emulates it. If the superior possesses the Dao and virtue, the inferior cultivates benevolence and righteousness. With benevolence and righteousness below, there can be no age of chaos.\n\nAccumulated virtue makes a king; accumulated resentment makes ruin. Piled stones form a mountain; gathered waters form a sea. Nothing is accomplished without accumulation. One who accumulates the Dao and virtue gains the favor of heaven, the aid of earth, the assistance of spirits. Phoenixes soar in his courtyard; qilin roam his outskirts; dragons dwell in his ponds. Thus, to govern the world with the Dao is to be the world’s virtue; to govern without the Dao is to be the world’s scourge. To set oneself against the world as an enemy is to court destruction—longevity is unattainable.\"\n\nYao and Shun flourished by this; Jie and Zhou perished by this. King Ping said, \"I reverently heed your command.\"\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Five\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Six\nBy Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty\n\"On Supreme Virtue\"\n\nThe old commentary states: \"Supreme virtue\" refers to the virtuous rulers of their time. The Dao of the Three Dynasties has declined, and the virtue of the Five Hegemons has waned. Thus, it is fitting to cultivate virtue to bring the world into submission. Merit can be seen, and virtue can be revered—hence it is called \"supreme virtue.\"\n\nLaozi said: The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is ordered, the hundred limbs are at peace; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred limbs are in chaos.\n\nThe old commentary states: Governing the state lies in the ruler’s clarity; when clear, the myriad people delight in their work. Cultivating the self lies in rectifying the heart; when rectified, the hundred limbs rest in their proper place.\n\nThus, when the self is ordered, the limbs are free from affliction.\nThe old commentary states: Without illness or suffering.\n\nWhen the state is ordered, ruler and minister forget one another.\nThe old commentary states: Without anxiety or care.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Virtue is one, yet it has two aspects. Nurturing the myriad things is the virtue of heaven; cherishing and nourishing the hundred clans is the virtue of the ruler. The ruler is the heart of the state. When the ruler possesses virtue, the heart is expansive, the body at ease, the qi unconfused, and the self is naturally ordered. Governing the state is like cultivating the self. When ruler and minister are at peace, can the state fail to be ordered? Thus it is said: \"Supreme virtue does not act as virtue\"—this means possessing virtue without relying on it as virtue, and so virtue is truly present.\n\nLord Lao studied under Chang Cong.\nThe old commentary states: The teacher of Lord Lao, surnamed Chang, named Cong. Lord Lao himself said he received instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: \"See the ancient and embrace softness.\"\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"ancient\" as \"tongue.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Seeing the ancient Dao, one embraces the feminine and yielding. The character for \"ancient\" was originally written as \"tongue,\" which also signifies softness.\n\nGaze up at the eaves and trees.\nThe old commentary states: Cherishing the fleeting light of time.\n\nRetiring, one gazes upon the river.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"目\" as \"因,\" an error for \"目.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Lamenting that all things in passage never cease.\n\nObserving one’s shadow, one knows to hold to what comes after.\nThe old commentary states: Not preceding things.\nThus the sage is empty and non-contending, following the constant and remaining behind rather than ahead—like stacked firewood, where what is kindled later lies above.\nThe old commentary states: What comes after is first; what is below is above. This is the constant principle of things. He who seeks to be first among others cannot be first.\n\nZuan Yi: Chang Cong was a sage of antiquity. Laozi studied under Chang Cong as Confucius studied under Laozi. Laozi perceived the Dao with his eyes and spirit, thus able to \"see the ancient and embrace softness\" and \"observe his shadow and know to hold to what comes after.\" Therefore, the sage follows the empty and non-contending, neither striving nor daring to be first. This is called \"supreme virtue.\"\n\nLaozi said: The clapper sounds and destroys itself; the candle burns and consumes itself. The patterns of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the agility of gibbons and monkeys brings capture. Thus the valiant perish through strength, the eloquent are ensnared by their wit, and those who rely on knowledge know only what can be known, not what cannot.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition omits the character \"而\" in the phrase \"而未能以智不知.\"*\nThe old commentary states: This is to say that ability harms oneself, while inability preserves oneself; knowledge destroys oneself, while ignorance sustains oneself.\n\nThus, courage in a single ability or discernment in a single argument may suffice for narrow persuasion but not for broad response.\nThe old commentary states: Holding to the courage of a common man cannot govern the multitude; clinging to a corner’s argument is not the way of thoroughfare.\n\nZuan Yi: People value virtue, not excessive knowledge. With too much knowledge, one strays from oneself and returns to oneself—rarely does this not bring harm. The patterns of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the agility of gibbons and monkeys brings capture. The valiant die by their strength, the wise are ensnared by their eloquence—this is fitting. Only he who does not rely on knowledge to know but on knowledge to *not* know is not confined to one corner but responds broadly.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao takes non-being as its essence.\nThe old commentary states: The essence of the Dao is emptiness and non-being—what is called subtle and wondrous.\n\nWhat is seen but has no form, heard but makes no sound, is called \"dark and obscure.\" Yet \"dark and obscure\" is how the Dao is discussed, not the Dao itself.\nThe old commentary states: Like the fish-trap is for catching fish but is not the fish, words discuss the Dao but are not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is perceived by inward reflection.\nThe old commentary states: Turning the ear inward and gazing within, one finds it within oneself.\n\nThus, one who does not indulge in petty learning does not fall into great delusion; one who does not indulge in petty cleverness does not fall into great folly.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"不小学\" as \"不小觉.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Clutching a firefly’s glow to compare with the sun—what delusion could be greater? Holding a pebble to match a piece of jade—what folly could be greater?\n\nDo not mirror yourself in flowing waters but in still waters, for their inner stillness keeps them from outward disturbance.\nThe old commentary states: When the mind’s dust scatters outward, it flows turbid and remains dim; when water’s nature is inwardly empty, it is deep and clear, mirroring itself.\n\nWhen the moon is full, the sun’s light is diminished. Time cannot be entrusted to the yang; when the sun rises, the stars fade and cannot compete with its brilliance. The branch cannot be stronger than the trunk; the top cannot outweigh the bottom without risking collapse.\nThe old commentary states: This means that the great ruler issues commands, and petty men should not be employed. If they are, it is like yin usurping the sun’s light. The root and branch should be proportionate, the noble and base in their proper places—then there will be no danger of toppling or ruin.\n\nA single abyss does not harbor two dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. Where there is oneness, there is stability; where there are two, there is strife.\nThe old commentary states: When the ruler is one, the state is at peace; when the lord is one, the heart is at ease.\n\nJade lies in the mountain, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the banks do not wither.\nThe old commentary states: Mountains and rivers conceal jade and become lush; the noble accumulates virtue and radiates brilliance.\n\nThe earthworm has no strong sinews or sharp claws and teeth, yet above it eats the dry clods, below it drinks the yellow springs—all through the unity of its mind.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"上食晞块\" as \"上食晞堁.\"*\nThe old commentary states: When the earthworm is hungry, it eats soil; when thirsty, it drinks water—it has no other concerns, so it needs no sinews or claws. When a person unifies the mind and guards the Dao, what need is there for fame or profit to feel content?\n\nZuan Yi: The Dao takes non-being as its essence, so it can coexist with all things. Things take form as their function, so they cannot stand together. Non-being as essence brings unity and stability; form as function brings duality and strife. Yet there are distinctions between great and small, divisions between ruler and minister. If the ruler embraces the Dao and holds to virtue, never claiming them as his own—this is why the Dao is great and virtue enduring. Who in the world would dare to contend with such strength?\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water can reveal the pupil of the eye. Turbidity brings harm: a river’s waters cannot reveal Mount Tai.\nThe old commentary states: Though small, clarity can reflect the finest details; though vast, turbidity cannot reveal even mountains and peaks.\n\nOrchids and iris do not cease to be fragrant because no one wears them; a boat does not sink in rivers and seas because no one rides it. The noble person practices the Dao not because no one knows him but because it is his nature to do so.\nThe old commentary states: The fragrance of orchids and iris is their nature—they cannot but be fragrant. The noble person’s practice of goodness is the Dao—he cannot but act.\n\nEntering the turbid with clarity brings distress and disgrace; entering the clear with turbidity brings ruin and collapse.\nThe old commentary states: The worthy and the foolish do not stand together; the clear and the turbid are not the same vessel.\n\nThe two qi of heaven form the rainbow; the two qi of earth leak and store; the two qi of man generate illness. The old commentary states: The Dao of the Three Powers values unity above all. Yin and yang cannot be both winter and summer at once; the moon cannot know day, nor the sun know night. The old commentary states: Winter and summer cannot be confused; day and night do not encroach upon one another.\n\nWhere rivers are broad, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall; where the land is vast, virtue is profound. The old commentary states: If rivers are not broad, they cannot nurture giant scales; if wisdom is not comprehensive, it cannot reach the ultimate principle. Thus, one knows that without profound virtue, one cannot deeply understand or see far.\n\nTherefore, fish cannot be caught without bait; beasts cannot be summoned with empty vessels. The old commentary states: Things cannot be obtained by sitting idly; the Dao cannot be attained without the proper means.\n\nWhere mountains have fierce beasts, their forests remain uncut; where gardens have stinging insects, their mallows and beans remain unpicked; where a state has worthy ministers, it repels enemies a thousand *li* away. The old commentary states: Fierce beasts and stinging insects still shelter grass and trees; worthy and noble persons naturally aid their lord and people.\n\nOne who is attuned to the Dao is like a wheel’s axle turning within the hub: it does not move itself, yet with it, one travels a thousand *li*, ever returning to the beginning, revolving in an inexhaustible source. The old commentary states: This has been explained previously.\n\nThus, to lift the crooked while ignoring the straight—how can this suffice? Do not lift the straight while abandoning the crooked; do not proceed once the goal is achieved. The old commentary states: This explains the \"Tallying Words\" chapter.\n\nWater’s clarity mirrors reflections; the heart’s clarity mirrors things with clarity. When turbid, all is obscured. The noble and the petty cannot stand together; winter’s cold and summer’s heat cannot coexist. If they do, disasters and plagues arise; if both hold power, calamities ensue. Yet how can the noble, seeing the petty in office and the Dao obstructed, forever remain withdrawn?\n\nA bird is about to arrive, and one sets a net to await it. The bird is caught by a single mesh of the net—yet if one sets a net of but one mesh, the bird will never be caught. The old commentary states: Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient to govern the many; a net of one mesh cannot catch birds.\n\nThus, some matters cannot be planned in advance; some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment. The old commentary states: The sage’s conduct follows heaven; his actions follow the times. When the time has not come, he guards the Dao; when it arrives, he acts. This is how King Wen rose to establish the Zhou and how Emperor Gaozu flourished to build the Han.\n\nTo attract fish, first clear the valley streams; to seek birds, first plant trees. Water gathers, and fish assemble; trees flourish, and birds gather. To obtain fish, one does not carry them into the depths; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees. One simply follows what benefits them. The old commentary states: The mutual reliance of lord and minister is like fish returning to water and birds nesting in trees. Following what benefits them, they come unbidden. Thus, a wise ruler in the world naturally draws loyal worthies.\n\nWhat the feet tread is shallow, yet one must await what they do not tread to walk; what the heart knows is limited, yet one must await what it does not know to attain clarity. The old commentary states: What the feet tread is little; what they do not tread is much. What the heart knows is few; what it does not know is many. By not using what is unused, its use is perfected; by not knowing what is unknown, its knowledge is preserved.\n\nWhen rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, deep pools fill; when lips are gone, teeth grow cold; when river waters run deep, fertile soil remains in the mountains. The old commentary states: This well illustrates how lord and people depend on one another, just as mountains and rivers connect. When river waters run deep, rich soil remains in the mountains; when the lord levies heavily, the people’s wealth is exhausted. When those above demand, those below are depleted. When the people’s strength is spent, the lord’s position is imperiled—this is the meaning of \"when lips are gone, teeth grow cold.\"\n\nWhen water is still, it is clear; when clear, it is level; when level, it is easy to see the forms of things. Yet forms cannot be taken as the standard. The old commentary states: When the ruler is enlightened, it is like still water’s clarity, deeply reflecting the true nature of things—good and evil cannot escape its scrutiny. When governance is even and harmonious, its policies spread.\n\nTo summarize: Those who know the essentials of governance understand that ruling a state depends on one person, not the many. Without first cultivating scholars, can one obtain worthies? Thus, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment. When the right person is found, the state flourishes—none will fail to serve him.\n\nLeaves fall because the wind shakes them; water grows turbid because things disturb it. The old commentary states: Without wind, trees shed leaves on their own; without disturbance, water remains clear—this has never been otherwise.\n\nThe beauty of jade and fine rings comes from the polishing of *jian* stone; the sharpness of *Moye* and *Yanyue* swords comes from the grinding of whetstones. The old commentary states: Even fine jade and precious swords, though naturally excellent, ultimately rely on the work of whetstones to become extraordinary implements. Likewise, though the noble and worthy possess talent and quality, they ultimately rely on teachers and masters to perfect their work.\n\nFang Yu and Ji could travel a thousand *li* without flying; without provisions, they did not hunger. The old commentary states: When a state relies on worthies, its achievements are great, and it rests without worry. When things attach to the good, their reach is far, and they move swiftly without labor.\n\nWhen the cunning hare is caught, the hunting dog is cooked. The old commentary states: This is the inevitable outcome.\n\nWhen the high-flying birds are gone, the fine bow is put away. The old commentary states: It is no longer used.\n\nWhen fame is achieved and success attained, one retreats—this is the Way of Heaven. The old commentary states: One who understands the proper times for advance and retreat, who exhausts the principles of rise and fall, who embraces the Dao and guards virtue, preserving his person and protecting his name—such a one may be called worthy.\n\nAnger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. Seeing in the absence of forms, one obtains true vision; hearing in the absence of sound, one obtains true hearing. The old commentary states: Human nature is originally without anger—anger arises from circumstances. Human nature is originally without action—action arises from desires. To know that anger is excessive and action is improper, one must inwardly see what has no form and reverse-hear what has no sound. This means returning to one’s original nature, where there is no sound, no form, no anger, no action. What is valued is seeing what is not there—seeing what is.\n\nFlying birds return to their homeland; hares run back to their burrows; foxes die with their heads toward the hills; cold cicadas cling to trees—each depends on its origin. The old commentary states: Creatures do not forget their roots; people, however, may stray from the Dao.\n\nTo summarize: The Dao can be practiced alone, but it cannot be monopolized alone. A man may walk vigorously, yet after a hundred *li*, he tires. With a fine horse, a thousand *li* can be reached. Anger arises from non-anger—this is how Kings Wen and Wu pacified the world’s people. Action arises from non-action—this is how Yao and Shun achieved governance without effort. For the state, those who skillfully employ others—how could the people not know where to return?\n\nTo obtain fish, one does not carry them into the depths; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees. One simply follows what benefits them. The old commentary states: The mutual reliance of lord and minister is like fish returning to water and birds nesting in trees. Following what benefits them, they come unbidden. Thus, a wise ruler in the world naturally draws loyal worthies.\n\nWhat the feet tread is shallow, yet one must await what they do not tread to walk; what the heart knows is limited, yet one must await what it does not know to attain clarity. The old commentary states: What the feet tread is little; what they do not tread is much. What the heart knows is few; what it does not know is many. By not using what is unused, its use is perfected; by not knowing what is unknown, its knowledge is preserved.\n\nWater and fire despise each other, yet the tripod stands between them, harmonizing the five flavors; bones and flesh love one another, yet slanderers sow discord between them, endangering father and son. The old commentary states: The natures of things may be opposed—though water and fire attack each other, when used with proper method, they achieve harmony. Father and son love one another, yet slander and malice sow suspicion between them. The worthy cannot but be discerning.\n\nDogs and swine eat from any vessel and grow fat, hastening their death. The old commentary states: This illustrates how petty men, in their eagerness for fame and profit, may rise for a time but ultimately fall, while the worthy cultivate the Way and await their moment, enduring temporary setbacks to achieve lasting success.\n\nThe phoenix soars a thousand fathoms high, yet none can bring it down; the hammer strikes a hundred times within, yet cannot straighten itself. The old commentary notes: *[Zhì huài, meaning unclear.]*\nThe eye sees a hundred paces away yet cannot see its own lashes. The old commentary states: Those who seek greatness neglect the small; those who see far overlook what is near.\n\nBuild upon height to make a mountain, and it stands firm without peril; delve into depth to make a deep pool, and fish and turtles gather there. *[According to the Ming printed edition: \"it deepens, and fish and turtles gather there.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: By following what comes easily, one labors not, yet success is achieved; by relying on what is familiar, things come unbidden.\n\nDitches and ponds overflow when full and dry up in drought, but the source of rivers and seas is deep and inexhaustible. *[According to the Ming printed edition: \"deep and inexhaustible.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: Small vessels fill quickly when filled and empty quickly when drawn from, but a great measure may be added to without overflowing and drawn from without depletion.\n\nThe soft-shelled turtle has no ears, yet its eyes cannot be obscured, for it is keen in clarity; the blind have no eyes, yet their ears cannot be deceived, for they are sharp in hearing. *[According to the Ming printed edition: \"sharp in hearing.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: Each excels in its own faculty; none can borrow from the other.\n\nCan turbid, swirling waters be used to wash my feet? Can clear, cool waters be used to rinse my cap strings?\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of neither rejecting the muddy nor favoring the clear—both worthy and unworthy are employed, but each is given tasks according to ability and matched to their nature.\n\nSilk floss may become either a cap or a sock. *[Pronounced \"wà.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: Its use is not fixed.\nA cap is worn on the head, while socks are trampled underfoot.\nThe old commentary states: There is no conflict in their roles; each fulfills its proper function.\n\nTo continue the meaning: People have no constant right, things have no constant wrong. When qi flows in accord, they unite; when qi flows in opposition, they part. Fire flames upward, water moistens downward—when the tripod harmonizes them, the work of \"Completion\" is achieved. When a father is kind and a son filial, slanderers sow discord, and the enmity of Shen and Shang arises. Dogs and swine grow fat and near death; the phoenix soars high, beyond reach. Clear waters rinse cap strings, turbid waters wash feet—yet those who cannot purify themselves and instead soil others should take heed.\n\nThe power of metal overcomes wood, yet a single blade cannot fell a forest; the power of earth overcomes water, yet a handful cannot dam rivers and streams; the power of water overcomes fire, yet a ladle cannot extinguish a cartload of kindling.\nThe old commentary states: This illustrates how one man’s uprightness cannot correct many crooked ways, nor can one man’s wisdom enlighten a multitude of delusions.\n\nIn winter, there is thunder; in summer, there is hail. Cold and heat do not alter their seasons, and frost and snow fall thickly. *[Pronounced \"biāo,\" meaning \"abundant.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: *[Biāo, from *bēi xiū*, meaning \"dense.\"]*\nThe sun rises and flows onward.\nThe old commentary states: Winter thunder and summer hail cannot fully disrupt the seasons; the sun’s turning light cannot be fixed by frost and snow.\n\nCollapse is easy to overturn; leaning is easy to topple. *[Pronounced \"fǔ.\"]*\nNearness is easy to assist; dampness is easy to rain upon.\nThe old commentary states: The worthy draw near to the good, while the foolish draw near to the wicked—their influence is easily followed, their affairs easily tainted.\n\nOrchids and angelica are fragrant, yet when touched by frost, toads and toads alone repel weapons and live long—on the full moon of the fifth month. *[According to the *Wanbi Shu*: \"On the fifth month’s full moon, kill a toad and apply its blood to weapons; entering battle, one will not be harmed.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: These all have their uses yet suffer harm—how much better to remain nameless and preserve oneself.\n\nThose who dissipate their essence are easily broken within.\nThe old commentary states: When inner essence is expended, outer branches and trunk wither.\n\nFruit that blooms out of season should not be eaten.\nThe old commentary states: To eat what is not in season brings illness; to take what is not in accord with right brings harm.\n\nTo continue the meaning: The mutual overcoming of the Five Phases has its fixed order. When the weak take on what is too great, none do not in the end suffer its control. Wood overcomes metal, water overcomes earth, fire overcomes water—yet these are not their true natures. Winter thunder and summer hail are not their proper seasons, and their duration is not even a morning or evening. How can one fail to measure oneself?\n\nWhich fails first, the tongue or the teeth? Which remains straight longer, the rope or the arrow?\nThe old commentary states: The hard, though firm, comes to ruin; the soft, though yielding, sets things right.\n\nIt is form that makes the shadow crooked; it is sound that makes the echo muddy.\nThe old commentary states: When form is upright, the shadow cannot be crooked; when words are good, the echo cannot be bad.\n\nThose who share the same illness as the dead are difficult to cure; those who follow the same path as a ruined state cannot offer loyal counsel.\nThe old commentary states: A fatal illness cannot be saved, even by a skilled physician; a doomed state cannot be preserved, even by a loyal minister.\n\nHave musicians play the *yu*; have craftsmen shape the holes—though they may hit the notes, they cannot be made to judge the ruler’s form, for it is lost.\nThe old commentary states: The musician is the performer; the craftsman shapes instruments. This speaks of musicians playing the *yu* and craftsmen shaping the holes—though the rhythm may be correct, their functions differ. Heart and hand do not respond; how can they judge? This means the ruler’s form is lost.\n\nThe deaf do not sing, for they have no way to delight themselves; the blind do not gaze, for they have no way to engage with things.\nThe old commentary states: Sound does not reach the ears, so they cut off thoughts of joy; color does not meet the eyes, so they cease observation in the heart.\n\nOne who walks through the forest cannot take the straight path; one who travels through peril cannot tread the plumb line.\nThe old commentary states: Walking through the forest, one does not seek the crisscrossing paths but focuses on moving forward; treading through peril, one does not follow the carpenter’s square and compass but acts to overcome danger.\n\nWhat the seas and lands produce endures, and thus can be great.\nThe old commentary states: Born without ceasing, used without exhaustion—thus it is called great.\n\nTo carry on virtue in a place not one’s own, to rely on those not one’s kin—how difficult this is! Teeth, though hard, break first; arrows, though strong, snap first. This is like a fatal illness where even a skilled physician cannot save, or a doomed state where even a loyal minister cannot preserve.\nWhen a ruler abandons the Dao and a minister forces his counsel, their minds diverge—can success be achieved?\n\nThe sun does not rise twice; the fox does not have two alphas. The spirit-dragon does not pair; fierce beasts do not flock. Birds of prey do not fly in pairs.\nThe old commentary states: These all stand alone and do not flock, thus they become leaders of the hundred beasts and flocks of birds.\n\nWithout the canopy’s ribs, the sun’s wheel cannot be shaded; without the spokes, swiftness cannot be pursued. Yet the wheel alone is not sufficient to rely upon.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of how things mutually depend on one another and cannot be entrusted to one side alone.\n\nTo draw a bow and shoot, without the bowstring the arrow cannot be loosed—such is but one-tenth of archery.\nThe old commentary states: Though the bow may be strong, without the bowstring it cannot hit the mark. Though the ruler may be sagely, without loyalty, nothing can be accomplished in governance. Among all who draw the bow, many seek to shoot, but those who truly aim to hit the mark are but one in ten. So too are those who seek office plentiful, but those who seek worthiness are as rare as one in ten thousand.\n\nA starving horse in the stable makes no sound; cast fodder beside it, and its competitive heart arises.\nThe old commentary states: When one lacking fodder is given it, they will contend. Those thirsting for fame and position, once given it, will surely compete. Thus the noble person yields their emolument, while the petty person vies for rank.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot hold even ten *shi* of the world’s grain, yet with a stopper, it can hold a hundred *dou*.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of the insatiable greed of the avaricious, which has no limit, just as a vessel without a bottom is difficult to fill.\n\nCutting along the plumb line will not err; measuring with the suspended balance will not miscalculate. Suspending the ancient methods of the *jun* and *zhuo* may at times succeed, while implements like the staff and cangue may at times be applied. To act in accord with this is called judgment; to act contrary to it is called chaos.\nThe old commentary states: Moving in accord with the plumb line, nothing can transgress it; establishing measures with the suspended balance, nothing will be amiss. As ancient and modern times differ, so too do laws and standards. Adapting to the times brings order; clinging to obsolete methods brings chaos.\n\nTo carry on virtue, the sun does not rise twice, the spirit-dragon does not pair, fierce beasts do not flock—how much more so for humans! The ribs support the canopy; the axle turns the wheel—this is the Dao of mutual reliance between ruler and minister. A starving horse contends for fodder; rewards must not be recklessly bestowed. Cutting along the plumb line, the law does not err; ancient methods and implements are applied in their proper time—it lies in the hands of those who enact them.\n\nThe farmer toils while the noble person is nourished; the foolish speak while the wise select.\nThe old commentary states: In plowing, toil lies within; in learning, emolument lies within.\n\nTo see clearly is to handle things as jade and stone; to see dimly and obscurely is to surely retain one’s schemes.\nThe old commentary states: When the principles of affairs are clear, they can be distinctly divided without doubt. But when perception is crude and hasty, understanding becomes difficult, and thus one’s schemes are preserved.\n\nThe brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows fully opened do not equal the brightness of one door.\nThe old commentary states: Though petty persons may be many, they are not sufficient to be entrusted; though a worthy person may be few, one is more than enough. King Wen obtained Lü Wang; Gaozu obtained Zhang Liang—does it lie in numbers?\n\nThe venomous snake cannot be given feet; the tiger cannot be given wings.\nThe old commentary states: No person is perfectly capable; no thing is doubly excellent.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nA six-foot mat—lying down, even an inferior talent can cross beneath it; standing, even a superior talent cannot step over it. The difference lies in the circumstances.\nThe old commentary states: Clearly, people’s talents are unequal. In one situation, they may excel; in another, they may falter. Their abilities differ, and so do their outcomes.\n\nThose who assist in sacrifices may taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights may be wounded.\nThe old commentary states: When one encounters goodness, one receives its blessings; when one meets evil, one suffers harm.\n\nSheltering beneath an ill-omened tree, one may be struck by thunder.\nThe old commentary states: Taking refuge under an ill-omened tree, one cannot escape Heaven’s wrath; harboring an evil person, one will surely face the nation’s law.\n\nThe sun and moon wish to shine, but floating clouds obscure them; the river wishes to run clear, but sand and soil pollute it. The orchid wishes to flourish, but autumn winds wither it; human nature wishes to be balanced, but desires harm it. Covered in dust, how can one avoid being blinded? Purity is unattainable.\nThe old commentary states: Dwelling in darkness, how can one perceive brightness? Living amid desires, what one is tainted by becomes like frost and sleet falling together—how can orchids and irises preserve their fragrance? Sand and mud pollute the flow, so how can the river’s source remain pure?\n\nGold and jade with tortoise-shell knobs may be worn by the worthy as ornaments; earth and soil may be spread upon the ground, yet the capable consider them wealth.\nThe old commentary states: Those who do not recognize their use may treat gold and jade as dung; those who know their application may regard earth and soil as jewels.\n\nThus, giving gold and jade to the weak is not as good as giving them plain silk.\nThe old commentary states: The weak here refers to the foolish. Giving them plain silk may preserve them, but giving them gold and jade will harm them—just as petty men should not occupy high positions, for it will surely lead to danger and ruin.\n\nIf the plowman does not toil, the gentleman has nothing to eat; if the gentleman does not govern, how can the plowman be at peace? A snake cannot have feet, nor a tiger wings—one cannot have both. Floating clouds cover the sun, but the fault does not lie with the sun; desires harm one’s nature, but the illness does not come from others.\n\nA wheel’s hub is hollow at its center, and the thirty spokes each exert their strength. If one spoke were to protrude alone, all the others would be abandoned—how then could it travel near or far?\nThe old commentary states: A cart must rely on many spokes to achieve its purpose of long travel; governing a state must also depend on many talents to secure lasting peace.\n\nOranges and pomelos have their native soil; reeds and rushes grow in clusters. Beasts with the same feet travel together; birds with the same wings soar together.\nThe old commentary states: Those of the same qi summon one another; those of the same kind seek one another.\n\nTo observe the land of the Nine Provinces, one cannot do so without traveling a thousand *li*; without the source of governance and teaching, one cannot stand above the myriad people.\nThe old commentary states: To survey the Nine Domains, how can one arrive without traveling? To govern the myriad affairs, how can one do so without the Dao?\n\nThe fierce are hunted; the clustered are shot.\nThe old commentary states: The fierce are the wicked; the clustered are the many. When the wicked gather, they will surely be struck down and punished. *Ti* (提) is pronounced *shi*.\n\nThus, the purest white appears tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\nThe old commentary states: Only brightness appears white, so it seems to bear humiliation; virtue does not display itself outwardly, so it appears lacking.\n\nThe gentleman has wine—\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of excess.\n\nThe petty man beats the clay pot. Though it cannot be considered good, it can at least serve as a warning.\nThe old commentary states: The gentleman’s overindulgence in wine is excessive; the petty man’s beating of the clay pot serves as a caution. Even for the petty man, this is not good—how much more shameful is it for the gentleman?\n\nIf the August Ultimate resides at the center, it relies on the Eight Assistants to establish itself; if the wheel’s hub is hollow at its center, it depends on the many spokes to move. The Son of Heaven stands at the center of the world, above the myriad people, yet without the source of governance and teaching, it is like having no feet to travel a thousand *li* and observe the land of the Nine Provinces—how can one proceed? Only by rectifying one’s position, sitting upright, and assigning duties to the hundred officials can the world be governed without leaving the hall.\n\nHuman nature is suited to wearing silk, yet one may be shot and don armor—what is inconvenient becomes convenient when it serves its purpose.\nThe old commentary states: To ward off cold, one relies on silk and floss; in battle, one wears armor. One acts according to the time to achieve convenience—this is human nature.\n\nThe thirty spokes share one hub, each aligned with its own mortise and unable to encroach upon one another—just as ministers each guard their own duties.\nThe old commentary states: This meaning is no different from the previous explanation.\n\nOne who is skilled in employing others is like the centipede’s many feet, numerous yet not harming one another; like the tongue and teeth, hard and soft rubbing together yet not defeating one another.\nThe old commentary states: The centipede is a many-footed creature. This speaks of one who is skilled in employing the many—is it not like the centipede? The tongue and teeth work together, hardness and softness both serving, the foolish and the wise all gathered, each following their proper place without losing their abilities.\n\nStone is born hard; the angelica is born fragrant. To possess these qualities in youth is to become even more radiant with age.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of their original nature. Stone is hard, angelica is fragrant—just as the worthy are bright and the foolish are dim. Thus, hardness and fragrance cannot be taken away, nor can foolishness and dimness be altered. To possess these in youth is to become even more steadfast with age.\n\nSupporting and lifting, declining and yielding, gaining and losing, promising and reneging—these differ by a thousand *li*.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of their vast and distant disparity—who would say they are the same?\n\nIf governance has its methods, no affair will fail; if employing people has its principles, no one will be unhelpful. The wheel’s spokes each align with their own mortise—this clarifies that officials each have their own duties. The centipede’s many feet do not harm one another because their use is appropriate. Stone is hard, angelica is fragrant—employing each according to their abilities, the worthy become bright and the foolish exert their strength, yet success is one and the same.\n\nThose that bloom again do not bear fruit; those that blossom too early do not need frost to fall.\nThe old commentary states: Those that bloom again do not bear fruit; when yang reaches its extreme, it naturally withers.\n\n---\n\nIf one soils the nose and powders the forehead—this is like treating the foot when the hand is afflicted, a most irregular affair. A rotten rat lies in the hall, yet one burns incense within—entering water yet hating to be wet, holding stench yet seeking fragrance: even the most skilled cannot craft success from this.\n\nWinter ice may be broken, summer trees may be bound; opportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose. The old commentary states: Time is precious, fate is rare—this illustrates how the noble person awaits the moment to act, for it must not be lost.\n\nA tree in full vigor, though felled all day, will regrow; yet when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night. This speaks of building merit and accomplishing deeds—one cannot delay the hour.\n\nThe target is set and arrows strike; the forest is lush and axes enter—not by any summons, but by the force of circumstance. The old commentary states: Without seeking its use, the felling comes—this is the natural course.\n\nA nursing dog will bite a tiger; a brooding hen will strike a fox—where favor is bestowed, strength is not measured. The old commentary states: It is the care of nurture that makes them forget their lives.\n\nThose who climb for profit and drown will surely drown others for profit. A boat can float, can sink—the fool does not know moderation. The old commentary states: A boat floats by water yet can also drown; a person thrives by profit yet can also drown. Only by discerning the measure of sufficiency can one avoid the calamity of sinking.\n\nA steed, though driven, does not advance; though pulled, does not stop—the ruler does not seek the Dao in this. The old commentary states: When the people are utterly exhausted and the ruler’s exactions know no limit, driving a weary steed further makes distant roads impossible to govern. Opportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose; the people are easily wearied yet hard to revive. Thus, what blooms again bears no fruit; what blossoms too early falls without waiting for frost—this is when the time is not favorable. The target is set and arrows strike; the forest is lush and axes enter—this is the force of circumstance. A nursing dog bites a tiger; a brooding hen strikes a fox—this is the impulse of affection. A rotten boat, if loaded, will sink; a weary steed, if driven, will perish—how can the people bear further hardship?\n\nThough water is level, it must have waves; though a balance is true, it must have discrepancy; though a measure is even, it must have danger. Without compass and square, one cannot determine circle and square; without level and plumb, one cannot correct crooked and straight. Those who use compass and square must also have the mind of compass and square. The old commentary states: When the ruler establishes impartial laws yet the people generate discord, this is like waves arising from level water, discrepancy from a true balance—traces of favor and resentment give rise to calamity and chaos. This is not because the ruler lacks laws, but because ministers lose their compass and square.\n\nMount Tai’s height, though doubled, cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair, though small, can be discerned when viewed directly. The old commentary states: When one’s aim is true, even the tip of an autumn hair, though small, can be discerned; when one’s conduct is contrary, even Mount Tai, though vast, cannot be seen.\n\nBamboo and wood contain fire, yet without drilling, no smoke arises; earth contains water, yet without digging, none emerges. The old commentary states: Fire is hidden in wood, water in earth—without drilling or digging, they cannot emerge. The Dao resides in people, yet without study, it is not known.\n\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two li; yet with half-steps unceasing, a lame turtle travels a thousand li. Piling clods without rest, mountains and hills form. The old commentary states: In all learning, one must not prize swiftness at the outset; what matters is long devotion to the Way—then a thousand li may be reached, mountains and hills surely formed.\n\nTo stand by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning to weave a net. The old commentary states: Fish in the river are caught by nets; the Dao in people is grasped by the mind.\n\nFirst tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek excellence; first establish trust, then seek ability. The old commentary states: From these three examples, one may discern the essentials of all affairs.\n\nA skilled smith cannot melt wood; a master craftsman cannot carve ice—there are things that cannot be forced. The noble person does not dwell on them. The old commentary states: Things that cannot be worked cannot become vessels; though a master craftsman exists, his skill has no application. People who cannot be guided cannot be turned from their ways; though a sage exists, there is no way to convey his intent.\n\nOne may command a person not to cross the river, but one cannot command the river to have no waves. The old commentary states: A river must have waves; the world must have misfortune. To prevent people from encountering misfortune is easy; to make a river have no waves is difficult.\n\nIf guiltless, the pot will not fall into the well. The old commentary states: *Gu* means fault. What misfortune one incurs is not without cause—if the pot did not fall into the well, how could there be no reason?\n\nThe old commentary states: Level water cannot be without waves; a true balance cannot be without discrepancy—how can the mind not be cautious? The rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame of the noble person are like the compass, square, level, and plumb of the craftsman. First tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek excellence. Without first establishing trust, can ability be attained? Thus, the noble person does what can be done and does not do what is beyond remedy.\n\nThose who criticize my conduct wish for my friendship; those who covet my goods wish to trade with me. The old commentary states: They seek to move the inner, and it appears in the outer.\n\nA single move in chess is insufficient to reveal one’s understanding; a single pluck of the zither is insufficient to express sorrow. The old commentary states: Mastery of one matter does not yet encompass the full principle; the first strum of a zither cannot yet be called exquisite.\n\nNow, if a single burning coal is picked up, it scorches the fingers—yet if a myriad tons of coal are ignited, the smoke pervades all, and even at ten paces away, one does not die. Those of the same qi may differ in accumulation. Where there is flourishing splendor, there must also be sorrow and withering. The old commentary states: Prosperity and decay alternate; joy and grief oppose each other.\n\nAbove, there are silken gauze and fine fabrics; below, there must be coarse hemp and rags. The old commentary states: ** (pronounced *fúfèi*): When the ruler above is extravagant and frivolous, indulging in fine silks, the people below suffer from cold and hunger, lacking adequate clothing and food. How can a ruler fail to examine this?\n\nThe greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base. The old commentary states: The ruler takes the people as the root, the lowly as the foundation.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Bitter words benefit conduct; bitter medicine benefits illness. Those who criticize my conduct wish for my friendship—this is the noble person following righteousness. Those who covet my goods wish to trade with me—this is the petty person pursuing profit. A person’s good fortune cannot be overindulged; excess is unnecessary. The greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base. When the people are prosperous, the state flourishes.\n\nLaozi said: The drum does not conceal sound, thus it can produce sound; the mirror does not obscure form, thus it can reflect form. The old commentary states: The drum does not conceal sound, the mirror does not conceal form—thus they can produce sound and reflect form.\n\nMetal and stone have voices, yet if not struck, they do not ring; pipes and flutes have tones, yet if not blown, they make no sound. The old commentary states: Metal, stone, flutes, and pipes cannot sound on their own; only when struck or blown do they produce sound. This is like people: all receive the Dao and virtue, yet without learning, they never attain completion.\n\nThus, the sage conceals within and does not initiate; when affairs come, he governs them; when things arrive, he responds. The old commentary states: The sage does not speak recklessly; his actions are never empty responses.\n\nThe Way of Heaven moves without cease, ending and then beginning again—thus it endures long. The wheel returns to its turning—thus it travels far. The old commentary states: The movement of Heaven is divine and unfathomable, operating without end.\n\nThe movement of Heaven does not err, thus it is without fault. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends; yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are harmonized as one. The old commentary states: Heaven’s movement is singular and without error; the ruler governs with flawless governance—thus Heaven and Earth interact smoothly, all things flourish, ruler and minister are joyful, above and below are at peace.\n\nWhen the noble person is employed, the petty person vanishes—this is the Way of Heaven and Earth. The old commentary states: Removing the wicked and appointing the worthy accords with the Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang do not interact, and the myriad things do not prosper. When the petty person gains power and the noble person vanishes, the five grains do not grow, and the Dao and virtue are concealed within. The old commentary states: When the qi of Heaven and Earth do not interact and the qi of yin and yang do not communicate, it is because the ruler does not employ the Dao and virtue, allowing treacherous and flattering petty persons to hold office while the noble person remains in obscurity—causing the myriad things to fail and the five grains not to grow.\n\nThe Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to benefit the deficient; the Way of Earth diminishes the high to supplement the low. The old commentary states: The Way of Heaven and Earth... *[Note: The text here appears to have a lacuna; no alternate version is available for collation.]*\n\nThe Way of spirits restrains arrogance and aligns with the humble. The old commentary states: It curbs the nature of arrogance and associates with those who are modest.\n\nThe Way of humans does not give to those who already have much. The old commentary states: It does not increase those who are already abundant.\n\nThe Way of the sage is lowly, yet none can surpass it. The old commentary states: It never seeks to be above, thus people honor it.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The mind does not conceal things, thus it can respond to them; the drum does not conceal sound, thus it can respond to being struck. If it rings without being struck, it is monstrous. Thus, the sage conceals within and does not initiate—he merely responds. When Heaven and Earth interact, the myriad things are harmonized as one. This illustrates the time when worthy encounters and the noble person is employed. If this is reversed, it is the day when the petty person gains power.\n\nOnly the sage, though in high position, listens to the lowly and does not become complacent, never placing himself above. When the sun is bright, it can illuminate the four directions; when the ruler is enlightened, the minister is enlightened, and the realm is at peace. When the realm has these four enlightened ones, it can endure long. To be enlightened in governance is to be enlightened in transformation. The old commentary states: When the four enlightened ones are complete, all the people are transformed.\n\nThe Way of Heaven creates patterns. The old commentary states: The sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\n\nThe Way of Earth establishes order. The old commentary states: The mountains, marshes, rivers, and seas.\n\nOne harmonizes them. The old commentary states: Fusing with the harmonious qi.\n\nTiming commands them. The old commentary states: Responding without error.\n\nThe Dao gives life to the myriad things and is thus named. The old commentary states: It nurtures and sustains the myriad things without acting as their master, hence it is called the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is level and broad, never far from the self. Cultivate it within the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in things, and its virtue never ceases. The old commentary states: Cultivating it within is called truth; nurturing it externally is called virtue.\n\nHeaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nourish them, giving without taking—this is the highest virtue. Thus, in virtue, none is higher than Heaven, none lower than the marsh. Heaven is high, the marsh low; the sage emulates this, establishing hierarchy and order, and the world is settled. The old commentary states: High and low are arrayed, noble and base find their places.\n\nEarth bears the myriad things and makes them grow, giving and taking—thus bones and skeletons return to it. Giving and taking is the lesser virtue; the lesser virtue does not lose virtue, yet it is called \"without virtue.\" The old commentary states: Not taking means Heaven gives life to the myriad things, merely nurturing them without claiming their substance, so the spirit returns above. Taking means Earth, though it matures the myriad things, reclaims their essence, so bones and skeletons return below—this is called \"without virtue.\"\n\nEarth follows Heaven, thus it is settled and at peace. When Earth is settled and at peace, the forms of the myriad things take shape. Earth is vast and thick, and the myriad things are numerous. Settled and at peace, there is nothing it does not bear; vast and thick, there is nothing it does not contain. Earth’s depth and thickness gather water and springs; its breadth and expanse endure long. The sage emulates this, and his virtue admits all. The old commentary states: Heaven and Earth follow one another to achieve vastness and thickness; ruler and minister trust one another to achieve governance and harmony. The ruler embodies the Way of Heaven, the minister the Way of Earth. Heaven is noble, Earth base—the distinction between ruler and minister is fixed. When the ruler is enlightened and the minister enlightened, they illuminate the four directions—is this not like Yao’s radiance filling the world, where the hundred clans are bright? Thus, to emulate Heaven and Earth in completing the myriad things is the Dao. Nurturing them, giving without taking, is the highest virtue; giving and taking, virtue becomes lesser.\n\nYin submits to yang, and the myriad things flourish; yang submits to yin, and the myriad things perish. When things flourish, none lacks abundance; when they perish, none lacks joy. When things are joyful, none is ungoverned. [Note in the Ming printed edition: After \"things are joyful,\" there is an additional \"then.\"]\n\nYin harms things, yang yields of itself; yin advances, yang retreats. When petty men gain power, the noble withdraw to avoid harm—this is the Way of Heaven. The old commentary states: When yang is constrained by yin, the world is harmonious and well-governed; when ministers overpower the ruler, petty men hold office.\n\nYang qi moves, and the myriad things are at ease, each in its place. Thus, the sage follows the yang Way. Those who follow things, things follow them; those who oppose things, things oppose them. Thus, one does not lose the nature and feelings of things. When marshes are full, the myriad things mature; when marshes dry, the myriad things wither. Thus, when rain and moisture do not flow, the world perishes. Yang rises and then returns below—thus it is the master of the myriad things, not long abiding, yet able to end and begin anew, thus enduring long. Enduring long, it becomes the mother of the world. The old commentary states: The sage follows Heaven’s Way, acting without striving, thus enduring long; opposing the feelings of things, even with position, none can preserve it.\n\nYang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who, without accumulation, could transform. Thus, the sage is cautious in what he accumulates. The old commentary states: Accumulating virtue brings blessings; accumulating evil leads to ruin.\n\nWhen yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow fat; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Thus, kings and lords esteem the yang Way, and the myriad things flourish; they esteem the yin Way, and the world perishes. The old commentary states: Yang is uprightness and life, thus things grow fat—fat means flourishing. Yin is depravity and death, thus things decline—decline means perishing.\n\nIf yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not mature; if the ruler does not descend to the minister, virtuous transformation does not spread. Thus, when the ruler descends to the minister, wisdom and clarity prevail; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue. The old commentary states: Unless the ruler is supremely sagely, he cannot descend to the minister; unless the minister is supremely worthy, he cannot assist the ruler. Yu Shun humbled himself before Bo Cheng; King Wen treated Jiang Shang as his teacher—these may be called wise and clear.\n\nContinuing the thread: yang gives life, yin kills. Thus, the noble man cherishes life, the petty man delights in killing. Kings and lords esteem the yang Way, and the myriad things flourish; they esteem the yin Way, and the world perishes. Yang values descending, yin does not. Thus, when the ruler descends to the minister, wisdom and clarity prevail, and the state is well-governed; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue, and virtuous transformation does not spread.\n\nThe sun rises from the earth, and the myriad things thrive; kings and lords stand above the people, illuminating the Dao and its virtue. The sun sets into the earth, and the myriad things rest; petty men stand above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. The old commentary states: This means when yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not flourish; when the ruler does not descend to the minister, the myriad things conceal themselves.\n\nWhen thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The conduct of great men resembles this. The movement of yin and yang has constant measure; the actions of great men do not exceed things. The old commentary states: The majesty of great men is like spring thunder; their commands are like the warm wind—all is harmonious in sound and qi, thus they do not exceed things.\n\nThunder moves upon the earth, and the myriad things are at ease; wind sways the trees, and grasses and trees scatter. Great men remove evil and pursue goodness, and the people do not wander far. The people have departures and arrivals—departing from the extreme, arriving at the lesser. [Note in the Ming printed edition: Before \"the people have departures and arrivals,\" there is an additional \"thus.\"] The old commentary states: Moreover, when great men have goodness, the hundred clans gather to them. Like King Tai leaving Bin—how far did the people go?\n\nWhen wind does not move, fire does not emerge; when great men do not emerge, petty men have nothing to transmit. Fire emerges only when there is fuel; the words of great men must be trustworthy. With trust and truth, what cannot be accomplished? The old commentary states: Fire emerges and spreads through fuel; words are issued and trust is established. Thus, the words of great men proceed without retreating, their trust like the four seasons.\n\nThe Yellow River’s waters are deep, its banks lie in the mountains; hills and mounds rise and fall into the abyss. Yang qi flourishes and transforms into yin; yin qi flourishes and transforms into yang. Thus, desire must not be filled, joy must not be extreme. The old commentary states: The Way of Heaven humbles the high and raises the low. Only by moderating desires and preserving harmony can one follow Heaven’s principle, not allowing things to reach extremity.\n\nAnger without harsh words, wrath without fierce expression—this is called calculated gain. The old commentary states: Though angry, one does not forget; though enraged, harsh words and fierce expressions do not appear externally—this is calculated gain within, governed by the Dao.\n\nFire flames upward, water flows downward; the sage’s Way seeks harmony through yielding. When yang prevails, the world is harmonious and united; when yin prevails, the world is submerged and sunk. [Note in the Ming printed edition: After \"seeks harmony,\" there are two characters, \"圣入,\" likely superfluous.]\n\nThe old commentary states: When yang prevails, it draws near to the loyal and worthy, thus the world is harmonious and united; when yin prevails, it draws near to the treacherous and sycophantic, thus the world is submerged and sunk. To continue the analogy: Heaven’s sun—is it not the ruler of men? When the sun rises from the earth, dukes and lords govern above the people, and the myriad things flourish; when the sun sets into the earth, petty men govern above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. The movement of yin and yang has its constant measure, thus the year does not disorder the seasons; the movement of the great person does not reach extremity in things, thus the people do not wander far. When things reach extremity, they transform. Desires must not be filled to the brim—yin and yang are of Heaven, but order and chaos depend on man.\n\nLaozi said: \"Accumulating thinness makes thickness; accumulating lowness makes height.\" The noble person daily strives to achieve radiance; the petty person daily indulges to reach disgrace. The old commentary states: The noble person diligently cultivates the Dao, daily increasing in brilliance; the petty person seizes leisure to gratify desires, ultimately reaching distress and disgrace. Though its waxing and waning may not yet be visible, one sees goodness as if never sufficient, and lodges evil as if it were an ill omen. If one inclines toward goodness, though there be faults, there is no resentment; if one does not incline toward goodness, though there be loyalty, evil comes. Thus, resenting others is not as good as resenting oneself; exhorting others is not as good as seeking within. Sound summons itself; harmony seeks itself; reputation commands itself; office is self-assumed. There is nothing that is not oneself. Wielding a sharp point to stab, grasping a blade to strike—why resent others? Therefore, the noble person is cautious in the subtle.\n\nThe old commentary states: To be cautious in the subtle is not a matter of greatness. If one inclines toward goodness, then blessing does not depend on others; if one exhorts oneself, then if one does not incline toward goodness, calamity returns to oneself—why resent others? Evil is like grasping a blade to cut oneself; accumulating fire to burn oneself—who else can one blame? The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, using qi to achieve harmony. Harmony resides in the center, thus the fruit of trees grows from the heart, the seed of grasses grows from the pod, and eggs and wombs generate from the center. Those that are neither egg nor womb but require time to be born—\n\nThe old commentary states: Things differ in kind, but all speak of what is generated as arising from central harmony and forming substance. Those that are neither womb nor egg but depend on transformation must await their time to come into being.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow; when light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt. The old commentary states: When the earth is level, water has no rushing force; when the scale is balanced, things have no bias of light or heavy.\n\nThe generation and transformation of things have their causes. The old commentary states: The birth of the myriad things each has its stimulus, not arising without reason. To continue the analogy: Yin and yang stimulate each other to form central harmony, thus the myriad things are born; ruler and minister unite to attain the central Dao, thus the myriad people are at peace. Therefore, the noble person harmonizes his heart and will, daily striving to achieve radiance; the petty person disrupts his natural harmony, daily indulging to reach disgrace. Thus, the noble person is cautious in the subtle, rectifies his heart, and seeks within himself. I do not resent others, and others harbor no resentment.\n\nLaozi said: \"When mountains reach their height, clouds and rain arise; when waters reach their depth, dragons are born; when the noble person attains the Dao, virtue and grace flow forth. Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown.\" The old commentary states: The numinous mountains must send down clouds and rain; the lofty Dao must bestow virtue and grace. There has never been one who did not first perform the deed and later receive the reward.\n\nThose who plant millet do not reap millet; those who plant resentment receive no return of virtue. The old commentary states: To plant millet and reap millet, or to repay virtue with resentment—such has never been.\n\nTo continue the analogy: Doing good without others knowing is called utmost goodness; doing evil without others knowing is called utmost evil. Mountains conceal clouds and form rain and dew; abysses conceal water and generate dragons; the noble person cherishes the Dao, and grace flows to the world. Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward—Heaven aids them; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown—people esteem them. Only those who possess Heavenly virtue know this.\n\n**The Subtle Illumination**\n\nThe old commentary states: To perceive the formless form, to hear the soundless sound—hence it is called \"subtle illumination.\" Laozi said: The Dao may be weak, may be strong; may be yielding, may be firm; may be yin, may be yang; may be obscure, may be luminous. It can envelop Heaven and Earth, respond to all directions without limit. What is known of it is shallow; what is unknown, deep. What is perceived of it lies without; what is unperceived, within. What is grasped of it is coarse; what is ungrasped, refined. To know it is not to know; not to know is to know. Who understands that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Who comprehends the formless form?\n\nThus, when all under Heaven know goodness as goodness, this is already not goodness. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: \"Subtle illumination\" is the Dao. To see without the eyes, to hear without the ears—it is attained in Heaven and inscribed in the heart. Thus it can envelop Heaven and Earth, respond to all directions without limit. It cannot be sought through cunning or force; only by knowing not-knowing, acting not-acting, speaking not-speaking can it be grasped.\n\nWenzi asked: Can one speak subtly?\nLaozi replied: Why not? Only those who know speech do not speak. Those who contend for fish become drenched; those who chase beasts hasten—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the utmost word abandons words; the utmost act abandons acts. What the shallow-minded contend over is but the trivial.\n\nSpeech has its origin; affairs have their ruler. Only the ignorant do not understand me.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao cannot be spoken; if it could, it would be spoken of as a thing—yet this is not the Dao. If not spoken, it would remain obscure. When Wenzi asked whether one could speak subtly, Laozi replied that only those who know speech can do so—this is to speak without speaking, to not speak while speaking. Those who contend for fish or chase beasts do not understand speech. Clinging to words and attaching to things, what they contend over is but the trivial. How can one abandon words and acts to speak with such a person?\n\nWenzi asked: Is there a method for governing a state?\nLaozi replied: Consider those who pull a cart: the front calls out *xiehu*, and the rear responds. This is the song that encourages their strength. Though the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu may be fine, it does not match the meaning of this. In governing a state, propriety exists, but not in ornate debate. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Those who govern a state are like Heaven and Earth. Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not utter, yet the myriad things grow. When Wenzi asked about the method of governing a state, Laozi replied with the song of the cart-pullers—front calling, rear responding—just as the sage precedes Heaven without opposing it, follows Heaven in its seasons. Governing a state begins with propriety, not with florid debate. Those who do not understand the essence of governance and instead multiply laws and decrees merely provide thieves with tools to plunder the people.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao has no fixed norm, yet it can serve as the norm. It is like forests and mountains, which can provide timber. Yet timber does not surpass forests and mountains; forests and mountains do not surpass clouds and rain; clouds and rain do not surpass yin and yang; yin and yang do not surpass harmony; harmony does not surpass the Dao. The Dao is what is called the formless form, the imageless image. Its meaning cannot be fully conveyed. Between Heaven and Earth, all can be molded and transformed.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao has no fixed form; things take shape in accordance with it. Observing forests and mountains transforming into clouds and rain, yin and yang harmonizing—one knows that all formless and imageless things between Heaven and Earth can be molded and transformed. How wondrous is the Dao!\n\nLaozi said: The sage establishes teachings and implements governance only after examining their beginning and end, perceiving their origin and outcome. Thus, when the people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know machinery, sincerity declines. The zither does not sound of itself, yet its twenty-five strings each respond with their own tone. The axle does not turn of itself, yet its thirty spokes each rotate with their own force. Only when there is tension and release can music be completed; only when there is labor and rest can distant journeys be achieved. If what has sound were made soundless, if what turns were made motionless—then the high and low would follow different paths. When governance is easy, disorder arises. Those in high positions with great Dao engage in great affairs; those with small Dao meet with misfortune. Minor virtue harms righteousness; minor goodness harms the Dao; minor debate harms governance; harshness injures virtue. Great uprightness is not perilous, so the people are easily guided. Excessive defenses lead to betrayal below. Utmost loyalty returns to simplicity, so the people do not conceal or deceive.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The sage establishes teachings and implements governance out of necessity, examining their beginning and end, acting without contrivance. Knowing writing, calculation, contracts, and machinery is to act with intention—thus virtue, benevolence, trust, and sincerity decline. The ruler relies on ministers for governance, just as the zither has sound and the spokes achieve distance. Grasping the essential and employing the great—then no age will be ungoverned.\n\nLaozi said: When laws of mutual implication are established, the people resent them. When decrees reducing ranks are issued, meritorious officials rebel. Thus, those who scrutinize the traces of brush and ink do not understand the root of order and chaos. Those practiced in military formations do not grasp the authority of temple strategy. The sage perceives fortune within the innermost gates, considers calamity beyond the outermost defenses. The foolish are deluded by small gains and forget great harm. Thus, affairs may benefit the small but harm the great; gain may be had here while loss occurs there. There is no greater benevolence than loving people; no greater wisdom than knowing people. Loving people leaves no resentment; knowing people leaves no disordered governance.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Governance cannot be overburdened with affairs; laws cannot be frequently altered. When affairs multiply and changes are frequent, the people resent them, and meritorious officials rebel—this is the ruler’s doing. The root of order and chaos, the authority of temple strategy—the sage discerns the unseen, possessing foresight.\n\nLaozi said: The great floods of rivers and streams do not last beyond three days. Fierce winds and torrential rains do not persist past noon. Where virtue is not accumulated, there is no cause for worry—yet ruin comes swiftly. Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, transform misfortune into fortune. The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: A state’s harsh policies erupt like the great floods of rivers, like the sudden storms of wind and rain—yet they do not last long. Ruin comes swiftly. Only those who worry over lacking virtue and know how to change can turn misfortune into fortune, weakness into strength. That one must not be self-satisfied is clear.\n\nLaozi said: Serenity and harmony are the nature of man; propriety and rules are the systems of affairs. Knowing man’s nature, one nurtures the self without transgression; knowing the systems of affairs, one’s actions are never disordered. Issuing a single command, scattering without contention—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"without end\" for \"without contention\"]—unifying all under one guiding principle is called the heart. Seeing the root and knowing the branch, holding to the One and responding to the myriad is called technique. Abiding in knowledge to act, knowing where one goes, knowing what one relies upon in movement, knowing where one stops—this is called the Dao. Causing others to praise and esteem oneself is the power of the heart; causing others to belittle and slander oneself is the fault of the heart. Words spoken from the mouth cannot be forbidden by others; actions begun nearby cannot be forbidden from afar. Affairs are difficult to accomplish yet easy to ruin; reputation is difficult to establish yet easy to destroy. All people take lightly small harms and trivial matters, yet these lead to great calamity. When misfortune arrives, man himself gives birth to it; when fortune comes, man himself brings it to completion. Misfortune and fortune share the same gate; profit and harm dwell in the same neighborhood. Without utmost clarity, none can distinguish them. Thus, wisdom and foresight are the gate and door of misfortune and fortune; movement and stillness are the pivot and trigger of profit and harm. One cannot but examine them carefully.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Heavenly principle and human desire arise from the same heart; the noble man and the petty man emerge from the same self—yet they share a single origin but bear different names. Holding to the One and responding to the myriad is called technique; seeing movement and knowing where to stop is called the Dao. Words issue from the mouth; actions arise from the heart. Misfortune and fortune, profit and harm follow like shadows and echoes. Without utmost clarity, who can distinguish them? Can one not examine them within oneself and be cautious in the heart?\n\nLaozi said: All know the mechanism of order and chaos yet none know the tools for preserving life. Thus, the sage assesses the world and acts accordingly, weighing affairs to devise plans—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"weighing affairs\" as \"weighing matters\"]. The sage can be yin or yang, soft or hard, weak or strong, moving or still with the times, establishing merit by relying on resources. Observing things’ tendencies, one knows their return; attending to one affair, one examines its transformations, then models and responds accordingly. Thus, one may practice this all one’s life without encountering困. Some matters can be spoken of but not practiced; some can be practiced but not spoken of; some are easy to do yet difficult to complete; some are difficult to complete yet easy to ruin. What can be practiced but not spoken of is taking and abandoning; what can be spoken of but not practiced is deceit and falsehood. What is easy to do yet difficult to complete is affairs; what is difficult to complete yet easy to ruin is reputation. These four are what the sage attends to, what the wise alone perceive.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Times may be ordered or chaotic, but governance lies with man. Knowing the mechanism of order and chaos yet not knowing the tools for preserving life—this failure lies in man, not in the times. The sage moves or is still with the times, examining their changes, practicing this all one’s life without encountering困. How can those who hold power in their time be indolent and not know the tools for preserving life?\n\nLaozi said: The Dao reveres the minute and subtle, never missing the moment. In archery, one is cautious of misfortune, lest it grow. Calculating fortune does not compare to considering misfortune; on the same day, those covered by frost are not harmed. The foolish, when prepared, share the same merit as the wise. Accumulating love brings fortune; accumulating hatred brings misfortune. All know how to rescue from calamity, yet none know how to prevent calamity from arising. Preventing calamity from arising is easier than rescuing from calamity. Now, people do not strive to prevent calamity from arising but strive to rescue from calamity—even a divine being could not devise a plan for this. The sources of misfortune and calamity are boundless. The sage dwells in seclusion to avoid calamity, remains silent to await the moment. The petty man, unaware of the gate of misfortune and fortune, moves and falls into punishment. Though he bends every effort to prepare, it is not enough to preserve his life. Thus, the superior man first avoids calamity, then pursues profit; first distances himself from disgrace, then seeks reputation. Therefore, the sage always attends to what lies beyond the formless and does not dwell on what is already accomplished within. Thus, misfortune has no way to arrive, and neither praise nor blame can tarnish him.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao reveres the minute and subtle, never missing the moment—this is caution at the outset. The foolish, when prepared, share the same merit as the wise. Man’s misfortunes cannot be averted beforehand but are sought to be rescued afterward—even a divine being could not devise a plan for this. Thus, the superior man takes avoiding calamity and distancing disgrace as primary, placing reputation and profit afterward without insistence. How then could misfortune arrive? How could praise or blame tarnish him?\n\nLaozi said: In the Dao of man, the heart desires smallness, the will desires greatness, wisdom desires roundness, conduct desires squareness, abilities desire multiplicity, affairs desire fewness. What is called a small heart is to consider misfortune before it arises, to be cautious of calamity and vigilant in subtleties, never indulging one’s desires. A great will—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"a great will desires\" with \"desires\" likely an interpolation]—encompasses the myriad states, unifying disparate customs, with right and wrong converging like spokes at the hub. Round wisdom has no beginning or end, flowing to the four directions like a deep spring that never runs dry. Square conduct stands upright without bending, pure and unstained, unwavering in poverty, unrestrained in success. Multifaceted ability encompasses civil and martial, moving and still in accord with propriety, with actions and placements perfectly fitting. Few affairs mean grasping the essential to pair with the many, holding the simple to govern the broad, abiding in stillness to restrain restlessness.\n\nThus, a small heart forbids the minute; a great will embraces all; round wisdom knows all; square conduct refrains from all; multifaceted ability governs all; few affairs mean simplicity in what one holds. Therefore, the sage, in regard to goodness, leaves nothing small undone; in regard to faults, leaves nothing subtle uncorrected. He does not employ shamans or mediums, yet spirits dare not precede him—this may be called utmost nobility. Yet he trembles and quakes, cautious day by day, thus achieving effortless unity through sincerity—[note: the Ming printed edition mistakenly reads \"sincerity\" as \"completion\"]. The foolish man’s wisdom is already meager, yet the affairs he undertakes are many, so he inevitably falls into困. Thus, using uprightness to transform—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"governance\" for \"uprightness,\" but since it opposes \"deviance\" below, \"uprightness\" seems correct]—is easy and will surely succeed; using deviance to transform is difficult and will surely fail. Abandoning what is easy and sure to succeed to engage in what is difficult and sure to fail—this is the result of foolish delusion.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The will desires greatness, yet the heart desires smallness; wisdom desires roundness, yet conduct desires squareness; abilities desire multiplicity, yet affairs desire fewness—these six are what all people cannot but strive for. A great will embraces all things; a small heart is cautious of the slightest detail. Round wisdom is unobstructed in all matters; square conduct is upright and unbending. Multifaceted ability accomplishes all; few affairs mean simplicity in what one holds. The sage’s conduct does not employ shamans or mediums, yet spirits dare not precede him—unified through sincerity alone.\n\nLaozi said: Fortune arises softly, softly; misfortune arises in tangled profusion. The workings of fortune and misfortune are subtle and invisible, yet the sage perceives their beginning and end—therefore, one cannot but examine them closely. The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for his own sake but for the sake of the state. If something pleases him yet brings no benefit to the state, he does not bestow reward; if something offends him yet benefits the state, he does not impose punishment. Thus, one whose actions are borne by what is fitting is called a noble person; one who abandons what is fitting is called a petty person. Those who attain understanding without toil rank highest; those who toil without suffering harm rank next; those who suffer harm yet toil all the more rank lowest. The ancients savored without ceasing; the people of today cease without savoring. When Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi wept; when Lu buried with wooden figurines, Confucius sighed. Seeing the beginning, one knows the end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The mechanism of fortune and misfortune has an opening—must one not examine it? Reward and punishment are the ruler’s great handles, not for his own sake but for the sake of the state. Between the noble person and the petty person lies the distinction of righteousness and profit. Governing without toil is the highest form of governance; toiling without suffering harm is the next; suffering harm yet toiling all the more is the lowest. When Jizi wept over ivory chopsticks and Confucius sighed over wooden figurines, the fate of the state could be known without awaiting its end.\n\nLaozi said: Benevolence is what people admire; righteousness is what people esteem. To be admired and esteemed by others, yet to perish oneself or lose one’s state—this is due to being out of step with the times. Thus, one who knows benevolence and righteousness but does not know the balance of the world does not attain the Dao. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is not the Dao. Therefore, good and bad coincide; praise and blame lie in custom; conduct is equal; compliance and opposition lie in the times. Knowing Heaven’s actions and understanding human conduct—only then can one manage the world. Knowing Heaven but not people, one has no means to engage with custom; knowing people but not Heaven, one has no means to guard the Dao. A steadfast will and compliant nature—these are firm and strong, yet they are harmed by the self and enslaved by things, consumed by yin and yang.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao does not prevail—I know why: the times have changed. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is to be ignorant of the times. Ignorant of the times, one is ignorant of Heaven and people—how can one manage the world? The person who attains the Dao adapts outwardly yet remains unchanged inwardly. Outward adaptation is how one knows others; inner constancy is how one preserves the self. Thus, inwardly possessing a steadfast principle while outwardly bending and stretching, moving with things—no action leads to entrapment. What is prized in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation. Clinging to a single node, advancing a single conduct, though one may achieve fulfillment, is still not as good as being unbound by petty preferences and unobstructed by the great Dao. The Dao is quiescent and empty, not acting upon things, nor acting upon itself. Therefore, in acting in accord with the Dao, it is not the Dao that acts—it is the Dao’s application.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The dragon and tiger transform—this is the Dao of the great person. The person who attains the Dao moves with things yet does not fall into entrapment. Thus, Laozi was called \"like a dragon.\" Embracing the Dao, empty and formless, outwardly not possessing things, inwardly not possessing the self—the Dao is applied without exception, and the world is transformed.\n\nWhat Heaven covers and Earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate, what yin and yang warm, what rain and dew moisten, what the Dao and virtue support—all share a single harmony. Thus, one who can bear the great circle walks the great square; one who mirrors the great clarity sees the great brightness; one who establishes great peace dwells in the great hall. One who guards what is to be guarded shines like the sun and moon. Without form, it is born from form. Thus, the true person entrusts their destiny to the numinous terrace and returns to dwell in the origin of things. Seeing what is to be guarded, hearing the soundless—within what is to be guarded, there is unique understanding; within quiescence, there is unique illumination. Its use is non-use; only through non-use can it be used. Its knowledge is non-knowledge; only through non-knowledge can it be known.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Harmony is the universal Dao of the world. Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing share a single harmony—how can the ruler who wears the circle, walks the square, dwells in the great hall, and establishes great peace lose it? The true person returns to dwell in the origin of things and must have unique insight within what is to be guarded. Thus, use arises from non-use, and only then can it be used; knowledge arises from non-knowledge, and only then can it be known. This is called the great harmony.\n\nThe Dao is what things follow; virtue is what life relies upon; benevolence is the proof of accumulated kindness; righteousness is what aligns with the heart and accords with the multitude. When the Dao declines, virtue arises; when virtue wanes, benevolence and righteousness emerge. Thus, the highest age followed the Dao without virtue; the middle age upheld virtue without cherishing it; the later age clung tightly, fearing the loss of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, the noble person cannot live without righteousness; losing righteousness, one loses what sustains life. The petty person cannot survive without profit; losing profit, one loses what sustains existence. Thus, the noble person fears losing righteousness; the petty person fears losing profit. Observing what they fear, fortune and misfortune diverge.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness split, and the Yellow Emperor, emperors, kings, and hegemons divided the ages—changes in the world made it so. The Dao guides; virtue gives life; benevolence bestows kindness; righteousness makes fitting. The governance of the four ages may differ, yet the distinction between ruler and minister remains the same. Those who follow the Dao without virtue are sovereigns; those who possess virtue without cherishing it are emperors; those who fear losing benevolence and righteousness are kings; when righteousness loses its fittingness, cunning and deceit arise.\n\nLaozi said: Some matters, when one desires to benefit them, only end in harm; others, when one desires to harm them, end in benefit. Those with dampness ailments who force themselves to eat, those with heat ailments who force themselves to drink cold—these are what the multitude nurtures, yet what the good physician treats as illness. Pleasing to the eye, delightful to the heart—these are what the foolish consider beneficial, yet what the person of the Dao avoids. The sage first opposes and later aligns; the multitude first aligns and later opposes. Thus, the gate of fortune and misfortune, the reversal of benefit and harm—these cannot but be examined.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Some matters, when one desires to benefit them, end in harm; others, when one desires to harm them, end in benefit—not by human effort can this be determined, for things may cause it. Thus, first opposing and later aligning is the Dao of the sage; first aligning and later opposing is the way of the multitude. Fortune and misfortune intertwine; benefit and harm reverse—how can one not examine them?\n\nLaozi said: Those who achieve merit yet depart from benevolence and righteousness will be met with suspicion; those who commit faults yet possess benevolence and righteousness will surely be trusted. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the constant compliance of affairs, the exalted rank of the world. Even if plans are obtained and calculations prove fitting, one must still consider calamities and resolve schemes; for the state to endure, its affairs must be preserved. Those who depart from benevolence and righteousness—though their merit may seem complete—will not ultimately succeed. Though their words may not breach defenses and their plans bring no benefit to the state, if their hearts are devoted to the ruler and align with benevolence and righteousness, their persons will surely be preserved. Thus it is said: A hundred words, a hundred plans—if none ever prove fitting, it is better to abandon haste and carefully examine benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Benevolence and righteousness—are they not the grandchildren of the Dao and the children of virtue? Though these four may seem unrelated, they have never been separate. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the exalted rank of the world. For one who values governing the world with their person, how can they not abandon haste and carefully examine these—benevolence and righteousness?\n\nLaozi said: Teaching originates with the noble person, yet the petty person receives its benefit; profit originates with the petty person, yet the noble person enjoys its fruits. When noble and petty persons each attain their proper place, their functions interchange and affairs proceed smoothly. When desires multiply, righteousness is harmed; when anxieties multiply, wisdom is impaired. Thus, in governing a state, joy preserves it; in a tyrannical state, joy destroys it. Water flows downward and becomes vast; the ruler lowers himself before his ministers and gains clarity. When the ruler does not contend with his ministers, the Dao of governance flows freely. Thus, the ruler is the root, the ministers the branches. Never has there been a case where the root is unsound yet the branches flourish.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Noble and petty persons are equally human. If one is noble yet their teaching does not extend to the petty, what virtue can provide for the petty’s sustenance? When a state is well-governed, joy preserves it; when a state is tyrannical, joy destroys it. When the ruler excels in humility and does not contend, ministers offer their loyalty. When the root is firm and deep, the state is secure.\n\nLaozi said: The compassionate father’s love for his child does not seek repayment; it cannot be dissolved within the heart. The sagely ruler’s nurturing of the people is not for personal use—it is a nature that cannot be restrained. Yet if one relies on their strength, depends on their merit, and inevitably exhausts it, once there is something to be gained, kindness no longer reaches them. Thus, employing what the multitude loves, one gains the multitude’s strength; raising what the multitude delights in, one gains the multitude’s hearts. Therefore, seeing their beginning, one knows their end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The bond between father and child is a heavenly nature. The father’s love for his child and the ruler’s nurturing of the people—if either harbors an expectation of repayment, kindness is lost. Thus, benefiting others through what benefits them, one gains the multitude’s strength; promoting goodness through what is good, one gains the multitude’s hearts. How could children then be disobedient, or ministers disloyal?\n\nLaozi said: People unite through righteousness and grow strong through fellowship. Thus, where virtue is bestowed widely, its authority extends far; where righteousness is applied thinly, military control is limited.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: When the ruler takes the world as his heart and people unite through righteousness, loyalty and filial piety flourish; when factions grow strong through fellowship, treacherous heroes arise. The balance of safety and danger cannot but be examined and discerned.\n\nLaozi said: One who obtains through unrighteousness and does not distribute, bringing calamity upon themselves—unable to serve others, yet having nothing for themselves—can only be called a fool, no different from the owl that loves its young. Thus, holding and filling it is not as good as stopping; sharpening and honing it cannot be long preserved. In the center of virtue lies the Dao; in the center of the Dao lies virtue. Its transformations cannot be exhausted. Within yang lies yin; within yin lies yang. All things are thus—beyond enumeration. When fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear; when calamity approaches, auspicious signs precede it. Seeing the auspicious yet not doing good, fortune does not come; seeing the inauspicious yet practicing goodness, calamity does not arrive. Profit and harm share the same gate; misfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors. None but the divine and sagely can distinguish them. Thus it is said: Calamity—fortune leans upon it; fortune—calamity lies concealed within. Who knows their limit?\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Misfortune and fortune lean upon each other like a shadow following form. Wealth doubled in entry will be doubled in exit. Accumulating goodness yet not employing it is like raising an owl as one’s child—few do not harm themselves. The mechanism of profit and harm turns back and forth—none but the divine and sagely can know it.\n\nWhen a person is about to fall ill, they first crave the rich flavors of fish and meat; when a state is about to perish, it first detests the words of loyal ministers. Thus, one on the verge of death cannot be saved by a good physician; a state on the verge of collapse cannot be aided by loyal counsel. Cultivate the self, then one can govern the people; order the household, then one can advance to office. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes genuine; cultivate the household, and one’s virtue overflows; cultivate the state, and one’s virtue abounds. The people’s means of living are clothing and food. When affairs are sufficient in clothing and food, merit is achieved; when insufficient, merit is absent. Without merit, virtue does not grow. Thus, following the times without success—do not alter the punishments; adapting to the times without success—do not change the principles. When the time is about to turn, this is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: A state does not stand without its people; the people do not live without food—this is an unchanging principle. Thus, when the people have enough clothing and food, they can live; when they lack clothing and food, merit is obstructed. Without merit, virtue does not grow.\n\nThe true king enriches the people; the hegemonic king enriches the land; the endangered state enriches its officials; the well-governed state appears insufficient; the doomed state’s granaries are empty. Thus it is said: When the ruler does nothing, the people enrich themselves; when the ruler does not act, the people transform themselves. Mobilizing an army of a hundred thousand costs a thousand gold per day. After military campaigns, there are inevitably years of famine. Thus, arms are inauspicious instruments, not the treasure of the noble person. Reconciling great resentment must leave lingering resentment—how can it be used for what is not good? In ancient times, those nearby were not summoned with words, and those afar were not dispatched with words. When those nearby are pleased, those afar come. When desires are shared with the people, harmony is achieved; when defenses are shared with the people, stability is secured; when thoughts are shared with the people, wisdom is gained; when the people’s strength is obtained, wealth is secured; when the people’s praise is won, renown is achieved. Actions invite bandits; words bring calamity. There is no misfortune greater than speaking before others—merely following them. Whispered words travel a thousand miles. The speaker invites calamity; the tongue is the trigger. Once words are spoken amiss, even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: From ancient times to the present, what has not changed is the land; what has varied between order and chaos is the relationship between ruler and people. The true king enriches the people; the hegemonic king enriches the land; the endangered state enriches its officials; the well-governed state appears insufficient; the doomed state’s granaries are empty. Thus, in the eras of Yao and Shun, the world was prosperous; in the Warring States period, there were no wealthy people.\n\nFormerly, Zhonghuangzi said: Heaven has five directions, earth has five phases, sound has five notes, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and people have five positions. Thus, between heaven and earth, there are twenty-five types of people.\n\nThe highest five ranks include the divine person, the perfected person, the Dao person, the utmost person, and the sage. The next five ranks include the virtuous person, the worthy person, the wise person, the good person, and the eloquent person. The middle five ranks include the public-spirited person, the loyal person, the trustworthy person, the righteous person, and the ritual-observant person. The following five ranks include the scholar, the artisan, the forester, the farmer, and the merchant. The lowest five ranks include the common person, the servant, the foolish person, the base person, and the petty person. The difference between the highest five and the lowest five is like that between humans and oxen or horses.\n\nThe sage sees with the eyes, hears with the ears, speaks with the mouth, and walks with the feet. The perfected person, however, sees without looking, hears without listening, follows without walking, and is impartial without speaking. Thus, what the sage employs to move the world is something the perfected person has never transgressed. What the worthy person uses to correct世俗 is something the sage has never observed.\n\nThe so-called Dao has no front or back, no left or right; the myriad things are profoundly united, without \"is\" or \"is not.\" The *Zuan Yi* records that Zhonghuangzi was an ancient perfected person. His words state: \"Humans have five positions, each with five gradations, totaling twenty-five in all. The highest is the divine person; the lowest is the petty person. The difference between the highest five and the lowest five is like that between humans and oxen or horses—petty persons violate the Dao and defy virtue, no different from oxen or horses in robes. The sage does not match the perfected person; the worthy person does not match the sage. Only because their attainment of the Dao differs in depth do their ranks likewise follow.\"\n\n**Wenzi Zuan Yi, Scroll Eight**\n*Compiled by Du Daojian of the Song*\n**The Spontaneous**\n\nThe ancient commentaries state: The supreme Dao is vast and boundless, the mother of the myriad things, the bellows and key that open and close without limit or boundary—this is called the Spontaneous. For the Dao’s transmission is utterly cut off: things are so without knowing why, yet it is not that they are not so. All things are thus, cannot but be thus. Yet the Spontaneous is not something that can make them so; it has no cause or dependence. Hence it is called the Spontaneous.\n\nLaozi said: “Purity and emptiness are Heaven’s clarity; non-action is governance’s constancy.”\nThe old commentary: Within emptiness there is spirit; within darkness there is light. Who can perceive it? It is one with the Dao. Through non-action, one governs the self, and the myriad things all attain completion.\n\nAbandon kindness and favor, set aside sageliness and wisdom, cast out worthiness and ability, discard benevolence and righteousness, extinguish affairs and events, reject flattery and sophistry, forbid deceit and falsehood—then the worthy and the unworthy are equalized in the Dao.\nThe old commentary: Remove these seven, and the worthy have nothing to esteem, the foolish nothing to shame themselves over. The vast Dao returns to the Spontaneous.\n\nStillness is identical to emptiness; in emptiness, there is penetration. Supreme virtue is non-action, and the myriad things all find accommodation. The Dao of emptiness and stillness is as enduring as Heaven and Earth. Its spirit is subtle, pervading all things without dominion.\nThe old commentary: When the mind is empty, nothing is impenetrable; when virtue is full, nothing is excluded. Thus it functions spiritually without a master, circulating without end.\n\nThe twelve months revolve in cycles, returning to their beginning.\nThe old commentary: The twelve months turn without cease, ending and beginning anew—such is Heaven’s Dao.\n\nMetal, wood, water, fire, and earth: their forces harm one another, yet their Dao depends on one another.\nThe old commentary: The five phases advance in succession, one flourishing while another declines. Cold and heat alternate in due measure; advance and retreat occur in season. Generation and destruction follow the Dao, never losing their proper order.\n\nThus extreme cold harms things, yet without cold it cannot be; extreme heat harms things, yet without heat it cannot be. Therefore, what can be and what cannot be are both acceptable. The great Dao has nothing it cannot accept; its acceptance lies in principle. When what is acceptable is seen, do not hasten; when what is unacceptable is seen, do not withdraw. The acceptable and the unacceptable serve as each other’s left and right, as each other’s inner and outer.\nThe old commentary: Cold and heat succeed one another—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Ritual and punishment are the laws of the sage. Though cold and heat may be harsh, they cannot be absent; when the time is right, what harm is there? Though punishments may be severe, they cannot be abolished; when principle demands it, they are not harmful. When what is acceptable is seen, act; when what is unacceptable is seen, desist.\n\nThe essentials of all affairs must begin with unity; when the time is taken as their standard, from antiquity to the present they have never changed. This is called Heavenly principle.\nThe old commentary: Unity is the child of the Dao, the handle of the ruler. Though antiquity and the present differ, their functioning remains unchanged—like an axle turning a hub, controlling what is within while the wheel revolves endlessly, beginning and ending with Heaven.\n\nAbove, it grasps the great brightness; below, it employs its light. The Dao generates the myriad things, ordering them through yin and yang, transforming them into the four seasons, dividing them into the five phases. Each attains its place, coming and going with the seasons, following constant standards. Extending even to the incapable, the Dao above does not falter. All ministers are of one mind; the Dao of Heaven and Earth is non-action yet complete, without seeking yet attaining. Thus we know that non-action is beneficial.\nThe old commentary: Heaven hangs its images to illuminate the four directions; the ruler establishes laws to govern all under Heaven. Hibernating creatures awaken; the common people are protected. Yin and yang do not err; the myriad things have constancy. Without non-action, one cannot benefit the state. In ancient times, Yao governed all under Heaven by cultivating himself.\n\nLaozi said: “The greatest simplicity has no form; the greatest Dao has no measure.” Thus Heaven is round yet does not conform to the compass; Earth is square yet does not conform to the carpenter’s square. From past to present is called *zhou*; the four directions and above and below are called *yu*. The Dao is within them, yet none know its place. Therefore, those whose vision is not far-reaching cannot be spoken to of greatness; those whose knowledge is not broad cannot be discoursed with on the supreme. Those who receive the Dao and communicate with things have nothing by which to oppose one another.\nThe old commentary: The Dao is utterly great, without form; Heaven and Earth are utterly vast, without measure. It is near, in the space between a hair’s breadth, yet unseen; it is far, within the cosmos, yet unfathomable. Without broad understanding and communication with things, none can comprehend the source of the supreme Dao or the realm of right and wrong.\n\nThus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had different laws and methods, yet their attainment of the people’s hearts was one.\nThe old commentary: Though their systems of law differed, their reverence for the people was the same.\n\nIf compass and square, carpenter’s curves and marking lines are the tools of craft, they are not craft itself. Thus, without the qin, even if one studies under Master Wen, one cannot produce its melodies; with the qin alone, one cannot evoke sorrow on one’s own. Therefore, the qin is the instrument of sorrow, not sorrow itself.\n\nThe old commentary: Though all things are said to be natural, they all rely on mutual support and cannot move alone. It is like carpenter’s curves and marking lines, which are the means of craft yet not craft itself. The marvel lies in the person. Without restraint, even the qin cannot be played well; the instrument is the means of sorrow, yet not sorrow itself. Without the qin, there is no sorrow.\n\nAs for divine harmony flowing between heart and hand, freely expressing spirit and discussing transformation while shaping it through the qin—even a father cannot teach this to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the untransmittable Dao.\n\nThe old commentary: Master Wen plays the qin, directing his fingers to pluck the strings, expressing spirit and freely roaming between heart and hand, harmonizing the signs of yin and yang. Thus, the transformations of the four seasons’ qi move all things. Even between father and son, though closely bound, this cannot be transmitted. Such marvel reaches its utmost—this, too, is the subtle Dao that cannot be passed down.\n\nThus, solemnity is the ruler of form, and stillness is the master of sound.\n\nThe old commentary: Solemnity is stillness; thus, stillness gives birth to form, and stillness is its ruler. Within stillness lies sound, and silence is its master.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of Heaven and Earth takes virtue as its master and the Dao as its mandate, allowing things to correct themselves. The utmost restraint lies within, not prizing affairs. Thus, it does not wait for achievement to stand, does not rely on position for honor, does not depend on fame to be manifest, does not require ritual for dignity, nor weapons for strength.\n\nThe old commentary: The Dao gives life as its mandate; virtue nurtures as its master. One who can harmonize spirit and qi, rectify nature and life, inwardly preserve essence and qi, and outwardly discard troubles—why would they need fame or position to be honored? Without relying on weapons, none would oppose them.\n\nThus, the Dao is established yet does not teach; it illuminates yet does not scrutinize. The Dao is established yet does not teach—it does not deprive people of their abilities. It illuminates yet does not scrutinize—it does not harm their affairs.\n\nThe old commentary: When the Dao exists, teaching is abandoned; when illumination is complete, there is no scrutiny. Only then can one entrust all matters without harm.\n\nThose who teach the Dao act contrary to virtue and harm things. Thus, yin and yang, the four seasons, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth share the same Dao yet differ in principle; all things share the same nature yet differ in form. The wise do not instruct one another; the capable do not receive from one another. Therefore, the sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts, allowing each to follow their nature. Thus, the living bear no gratitude, and the dead hold no resentment.\n\nThe old commentary: Acting contrary to virtue means that when virtue declines, teaching arises. Harming things means first diminishing and then benefiting. Moreover, the five phases have different natures, and the myriad things have distinct forms. Teaching has its roots and branches; people have the wise and the foolish. The sage enacts laws and teachings to guide the ignorant, enabling the wise to instruct one another and the capable not to conceal their skills. Each fulfills their role, returning to the natural. The living do not boast of their virtue; the dead do not resent Heaven.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—they regard the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nThe old commentary: Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things; the sage nurtures the hundred clans. How could they have a mind for things or partiality for people? Observed as one, they are like straw dogs.\n\nCompassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness are the narrow paths of the Dao. The narrow leads to confusion when entering the great; the near leads to bewilderment when traveling far. The sage’s Dao enters the great without confusion, travels far without bewilderment, constantly empty and self-guarding—this can be called the ultimate. This is called Heavenly virtue.\n\nThe old commentary: The Dao and virtue are profound and subtle; benevolence and righteousness are narrow and shallow. Following the middle way and treading small paths leads to confusion. Only the most sagely, ascending the great thoroughfare without obstruction—unless one’s inner palace is eternally bright, how can they reach the ultimate with Heaven?\n\nLaozi said: The sage covers like Heaven, bears like Earth, shines like the sun and moon, transforms like the four seasons, nurtures the myriad things without sameness—without old or new, without distance or closeness, without partiality.\n\nThe old commentary: This is the virtue of the sage. Covering and bearing like Heaven and Earth, shining and illuminating like the sun and moon, turning like the four seasons—though customs differ and forms vary, grasses, trees, and insects all dwell in peace and fulfill their natures. How could there be old or new, closeness or distance among them?\n\nThus, one who models Heaven does not rely on a single season; one who models Earth does not rely on a single resource; one who models people does not rely on a single affair. Affairs are manifold, pursuits are diverse.\n\nThe old commentary: If Heaven relied on one season, it could not complete the year; if Earth relied on one resource, its uses would be exhausted; if people relied on one ability, it would not be prized.\n\nThus, in warfare, some are light, some heavy, some greedy, some incorruptible—these four are opposed and cannot be uniform.\n\nThe old commentary: Each pursues their own advantage, so they are not uniform.\n\nThe light wish to advance; the heavy wish to halt; the greedy wish to seize; the incorruptible do not covet what is not theirs.\n\nThe old commentary: When troops are numerous, their hearts desire unity. Yet the heavy wish to halt while the light wish to advance—each pursues their own convenience, so they are not uniform. If they are not uniform, they will be defeated when encountering the enemy. Only by measuring their talents and balancing their strengths can they achieve victory without fail.\n\nThus, the brave may be ordered to advance and fight but not to hold firm; the heavy may be ordered to defend but not to assault the enemy; the greedy may be ordered to attack and seize but not to distribute spoils; the incorruptible may be ordered to guard their portion but not to advance; the trustworthy may be ordered to uphold agreements but not to respond to change. The sage employs all five, utilizing their talents.\n\nThe old commentary: Only the sage excels at employing abilities without losing their proper use—thus, none under Heaven can oppose them.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not cherish a single thing; yin and yang do not produce a single species. Thus, the sea does not refuse water from streams to become vast; mountain forests do not refuse crooked branches to become lofty. The sage does not reject the words of firewood carriers to broaden their fame. Those who guard a single corner and neglect all directions, or take one thing and discard the rest, gain little and govern shallowly.\n\nThe old commentary: Without breadth, the Dao cannot embrace the myriad things. Without depth, the sage’s virtue cannot accept all words. Thus, one ability must not be prized; one corner must not be guarded. Those who guard it are narrow; those who prize it are shallow.\n\nLaozi said: What Heaven covers, Earth bears, and the sun and moon illuminate—though forms differ and natures vary, each has its peace and joy. Yet joy in what one does is the very cause of sorrow; peace in what one does is the very cause of danger.\n\nThe old commentary: If one delights in their own joy, it becomes sorrow; if one delights in another’s joy, it remains joy. If one finds peace in their own peace, it becomes danger; if one finds peace in another’s life, it remains peace.\n\nThus, the sage governs the people by allowing each to suit their nature, dwell in their proper place, do what they can, fulfill their needs, and apply what is fitting. In this way, the myriad things are as one, with none surpassing another.\n\nThe old commentary: The sage governs the people, allowing different natures and forms to each find their proper place. Though the myriad things exist, they are as one body, unable to surpass one another—thus, they are called \"as one.\"\n\nThe things of the world are neither inherently noble nor base; if one deems something noble, then all things become noble by that standard, and if one deems something base, then all things become base by that standard.\n\nOld commentary: Nobility and baseness have no fixed division; prosperity and adversity have no constant measure. It depends on whether one encounters opportunity or not, whether one is employed or not.\n\nThus, those who do not exalt the worthy say: Do not cast fish into the trees, nor drown birds in the depths. Old commentary: If you release flying creatures into the forest and place swimming creatures into the water, then both flight and submersion find their proper place—thus, the worthy and the unworthy are employed together.\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao governed the world, Shun served as Minister of Education, Xie as Minister of War, and Yu as Minister of Works. Old commentary: These were the Three Dukes, who deliberated on the Dao, managed governance, harmonized yin and yang, and served as the limbs, throat, and tongue of the Son of Heaven. Hou Ji oversaw agriculture. Old commentary: He taught the people to sow and cultivate. Xi Zhong served as Master of Crafts. Old commentary: He created tools to provide for the people’s needs. The sage employed the worthy in this manner; his achievements reached the cosmos, and his virtue flowed to the four seas. Only Heaven is great, and only Yao emulated it.\n\nIn guiding the people, he allowed those who dwelled by water to fish, those in forests to gather, those in valleys to herd, and those on land to farm. Each place suited its tasks, each task suited its tools, and each tool suited its material. Marsh-dwellers wove nets, hill-dwellers tilled fields. In this way, the people exchanged what they had for what they lacked, traded their skills for their ineptitudes, and bartered their strengths for their weaknesses. Thus, those who rebelled were few, and those who obeyed were many. Like the wind passing through panpipes, they responded instantly, each according to its pitch. All things pursued their advantage and avoided harm. Therefore, neighboring states could see one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard across borders, yet no one trod within the lords’ territories, and no chariot tracks extended beyond a thousand li—all dwelled content in their places.\n\nOld commentary: The sage guided the people by following their circumstances and settling them where fitting. Thus, the haves and have-nots exchanged goods, the skilled and unskilled aided one another—like the wind passing through panpipes or rain nourishing all things, sounds followed what moved them, and beings pursued their advantage. Thus, neighboring states could see one another, weapons were unused, and the people lived to old age, all content in their dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a disordered state appears prosperous, a well-governed state appears empty, a ruined state appears lacking, and a preserved state appears abundant. The empty is not without people—each guards its duties. The prosperous is not overpopulated—all vie for trivialities. The abundant is not wealthy—desires are restrained and affairs are few. The lacking is not without goods—people are scarce and expenses are many.\n\nOld commentary: Understanding these four reveals the root of order and disorder, the conditions of survival and ruin.\n\nThus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but followed what already existed. Their prohibitions and punishments were not of their own doing but upheld what was already established. This is the Way of supreme virtue.\n\nOld commentary: Prohibitions and punishments are the laws the former kings established, not for the sake of killing but as dikes and barriers. Yet foolish people do not observe their commands, so many fall into them and perish—this is unavoidable.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world by the Dao is not to alter human nature but to order and smooth what already exists. Thus, to follow is to make the great, and to act is to make the small. The ancients who dredged waterways followed the flow of water; those who grew crops followed the suitability of the land; those who waged war followed the people’s desires. If one can follow, one will be invincible under Heaven. Things must have their natural state before human affairs can be ordered.\n\nOld commentary: Observe that things have their natural natures, then follow what is fitting for them. If you act according to the people’s desires, nothing will fail, and no action will be unprofitable.\n\nThus, the former kings’ systems of law followed human nature and established its patterns. Without that nature, one cannot be guided; with that nature but without its resources, one cannot follow the Way.\n\nOld commentary: Like wood that cannot be made to produce water or metal that cannot be made to generate fire.\n\nHuman nature possesses the resources of benevolence and righteousness, but without the sage’s laws and institutions, one cannot be directed toward the proper path. Following what people detest to prohibit wrongdoing, punishments are unused, and authority works like a spirit. Following their nature, the world obeys; opposing their nature, laws are enacted but unused.\n\nOld commentary: Though morality, benevolence, and righteousness are rooted in human nature, without the sage-king’s laws and the exercise of his power—rewarding with virtue, ordering with ritual, and restraining with punishment—there would be no way to return to the natural state and direct people toward the proper path. Following their nature, their response is divine; opposing their nature, even commands are disobeyed.\n\nVirtue and the Dao are the foundation of merit and fame, what the people cherish. When the people cherish them, merit and fame are established.\n\nOld commentary: Without virtue and the Dao, how could merit and fame be established?\n\nThe ancients who were good at being rulers modeled themselves on rivers and seas. Rivers and seas achieve their greatness through non-action, their vastness through humility. Thus, they endure long as the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they gather the hundred streams; through not seeking, they obtain; through not acting, they reach. Therefore, they take the world without effort, do not value themselves and so are rich, do not display themselves and so are illustrious, do not boast and so endure, do not possess and so become kings of the world. Not contending, none can contend with them. Never striving to be great, they achieve greatness. Rivers and seas are close to the Dao, thus they endure long, preserving themselves like Heaven and Earth. Kings and lords cultivate the Dao, achieve success without possession, and without possession, they become strong and firm. Strong and firm without oppressing others, the Dao deepens; the Dao deepens, and virtue deepens; virtue deepens, and merit and fame are accomplished. This is called profound virtue—vast and far-reaching, the opposite of all things.\n\nOld commentary: The world exalts the lofty, but I humble myself; the world values boasting, but I do not contend. Dwelling in non-possession, I am thus the opposite of all things.\n\nThe world has a beginning, but none know its principle. Only the sage knows its cause. It is neither male nor female, neither yin nor yang. Born yet undying, it completes Heaven and Earth, forms yin and yang, shapes the myriad things, and gives them life. Thus, yin and yang have round and square, short and long, existence and extinction. The Dao commands them, hidden and inactive in the mind, deeply guarded by the Dao, profoundly rich. Life and death share the same principle; the myriad things transform and unite in the One Dao. Simplify life, forget death—what path does not lead to longevity? Abandon affairs and words, follow non-action. Guard the Dao, be thorough with things, do not control. To the utmost, be cautious, formless. The beginning of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things are one in the Dao yet differ in form. To the utmost, there are no things—thus one can care for all. To the utmost, vast and without bounds—thus one is the shelter of the myriad things. To the utmost, fine and without interior—thus one is the treasure of the myriad things. Value the Dao to preserve life, virtue to secure form. The measure of the supreme Dao: abandon likes and dislikes, be without knowledge, and intentions will be at ease; harmonize the mind, do not oppose the Dao.\n\nThe old commentary states: \"That Heaven and Earth have a beginning refers to the Dao.\" Yet none in the world can recognize it—this is to say, it cannot be distinguished as male or female, nor inferred from form or color. Though one may seek it, there is nothing to speak of; though one may discuss it, nothing can be grasped. Yet it endures eternally.\n\nHeaven and Earth have their positions of high and low; the sun and moon have their proper times of day and night; yin and yang have their principles of hardness and softness; the myriad things have their endowments of long and short. As for the Dao, it is neither hidden nor manifest, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither vast nor fine, neither round nor square. It revolves without limit, transforms without direction. Yet those who embody it can preserve life and secure form, abandon affairs and words, be vast in non-action, and yield in compliance—thus they return to great simplicity and enter the realm of benevolence and longevity.\n\nHeaven and Earth are whole as one, divided into two, yet when reversed and united, above and below do not lose their wholeness. Whole as one, divided into five, yet when reversed and united, they must align with the compass and square. The old commentary states: \"One is the distribution of qi; two is the flow of form; five are the Five Phases. Above and below refer to Heaven, Earth, and humanity, who dwell between them. Those who harmonize their virtue with Heaven and Earth, concentrate their essence into one, must align with the standards and return to the origin.\"\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be guarded against; it is most near yet cannot be sought afar. Those who seek it far away go and return in vain. The old commentary states: \"To seek it in external things is to know nothing; to seek it within oneself is to find it.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The emperor has a name, yet none know his true nature. The emperor values virtue; the king esteems righteousness; the hegemon is adept in principle.\" The old commentary states: \"Virtue nurtures and fosters the myriad things; righteousness rescues the drowning and upholds the imperiled; principle responds to the mechanisms of fate.\"\n\nThe Way of the sage in relation to things: when the Dao is narrow, one relies on wisdom; when virtue is thin, one relies on punishment; when clarity is shallow, one relies on scrutiny. Those who rely on wisdom have hearts in turmoil; those who rely on punishment incur resentment above and below; those who rely on scrutiny do not seek goodness in serving their superiors—this is corruption. The old commentary states: \"Wisdom gives rise to falsehood and obscures truth; punishment breeds legalistic deception; scrutiny arises from pretense. Once these three change, even the sage cannot overcome them—here lies the corruption of losing the Dao.\"\n\nThus, the sage follows Heaven and Earth to transform their virtue. Heaven covers and Earth bears; the Dao nourishes in accordance with the seasons. When nourishment is abundant, governance is achieved. Even if there are divine sages, what can replace this? Abandoning the mind’s knowledge, reducing punishments, returning to tranquility—things will right themselves. The Dao as ruler is like a corpse: solemn, profound, and silent, yet all under Heaven receive its blessings. One person is covered without excess; ten thousand are covered without insufficiency. Therefore, to heavily bestow favors or heavily impose violence is to oppose the Dao. Bestowing favors is to distribute alms. The old commentary states: \"The sage observes the corruption of the times and the reliance on cunning deception, thus governs with the Dao and responds by returning to tranquility, allowing things to right themselves. By guarding profound silence, they restore simplicity. Thus, rewards are not recklessly given, and punishments are not recklessly applied—violence and chaos do not arise, and the Dao is followed.\"\n\nWithout merit, to grant generous rewards; without labor, to confer high ranks—those who hold office will grow lax in their duties, and the idle will hasten to advance. Those who are violent recklessly execute the innocent, and those who walk the Way are subjected to punishment. Thus, those who cultivate themselves are not encouraged toward goodness, and those who act wickedly lightly offend their superiors. Therefore, bestowing favors gives rise to treachery; imposing violence gives rise to chaos. A society of treachery and chaos is the wind that topples states. The old commentary states: \"Punishment cannot be applied to those with the Dao; rank cannot be attained without merit. Otherwise, those who hold office will show signs of laxity, and those who walk the Way will have hearts of decline—this is a society of treachery and chaos, the wind that topples states.\"\n\nThus, when the state executes, the ruler does not grow angry; when the court bestows rewards, the lord does not intervene. Those executed do not resent the ruler, for their crimes are fitting; those rewarded do not feel indebted to the lord, for their achievements are deserved. The people know that rewards and punishments arise from their own conduct, thus they devote themselves to merit and cultivation, not seeking gifts from others. Therefore, the court is uncluttered and without traces; the fields are opened and without weeds. The old commentary states: \"Rewards suffice to encourage goodness; punishments suffice to deter treachery. Those who reward show no arrogance; those who punish show no sorrow. Thus, those near receive its blessings; those far submit to its virtue. All cultivate their work and exhaust their strength—thus the court is without disputes, and the fields flourish with crops.\"\n\nThus, the highest ruler is unaware yet possesses it. The old commentary states: \"This speaks of later ages knowing that the highest ruler has the Dao, and later kings emulate it.\"\n\nThe kingly Way: abides in the affairs of non-action, practices the teaching of no words, is tranquil and unmoving, consistent and unshaken. It follows and entrusts to subordinates, holds them accountable without labor, devises without miscalculation, acts without error. Speech and writing, conduct and demeanor, advance and retreat, movement and stillness—all accord with the seasons, follow principle. Beauty and ugliness are not loved or hated; rewards and punishments do not bring joy or anger. Each is named according to its nature; each follows its affairs naturally, without anything issuing from the self. If one seeks to grasp it, this is to depart from it; if one seeks to adorn it, this is to harm it. The old commentary states: \"The king must be great to contain the myriad things, tranquil to harmonize the hundred clans. Free from love and hate, earnest in simplicity, narrow yet not intimate, refined yet not harmful—thus all things return to the natural.\"\n\nHeaven’s qi forms the spirit; Earth’s qi forms the corporeal soul. When reversed, the profound and wondrous each dwell in their abode—guard them and do not lose them. Above, they connect with the Great One. The essence of the Great One communicates and unites with Heaven. The Way of Heaven is silent, without form, without rules—vast beyond measure, deep beyond fathoming. It constantly transforms with humanity, yet wisdom cannot grasp it. It revolves without end, transforms like a spirit, empty and compliant, always following and never leading. The old commentary states: \"The spirit in humanity is yang, life—received from Heaven. The corporeal soul is yin, death—received from Earth. Each guards its principle. The spirit is the yang’s numen; the corporeal soul is the yin’s essence. Spirit and corporeal soul are the utmost essences of Heaven and Earth—thus they are called profound and wondrous. Heaven attains them and is eternally bright; humanity attains them and is eternally alive—thus it is said, 'guard them and do not lose them.' Above, they connect with the Great One—the Great One is the Supreme Dao Lord, what humanity is endowed with. This means that if one can guard their essence and spirit, keeping them from leaving the body, they will unite above with Heaven and the Great One. Concentrating essence and accumulating thought, they can communicate. The method of guarding is only through essence and silence, without form, without rules—boundless and immeasurable, its subtlety unfathomable. Thus it is said, 'it constantly transforms with humanity, yet wisdom cannot grasp it; it revolves like a wheel, transforms like a spirit.' In the space of emptiness and compliance, it always follows and never leads—profound and unknowable, thus it is called the utmost subtlety.\"\n\nIn governing, listen with an empty mind and a yielding will, clear and bright without obscurity. Thus, all ministers gather like spokes converging on a hub, advancing together—whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, none fail to exhaust their abilities. The ruler attains what controls the ministers; the ministers attain what serves the ruler—thus the governance of the state is enlightened.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: One who possesses a mirror of clarity and brightness will surely perceive the essence of purity. In governing the state, all ministers will vie to support him without contempt; in cultivating the self, the myriad things will encircle and guard him without departure.\n\nLaozi said: \"He who knows and delights in inquiry is wise; he who is brave and delights in inquiry prevails. He who rides upon the wisdom of the multitude can accomplish all tasks; he who employs the strength of the multitude can overcome all obstacles. Relying on the strength of the multitude, even Wu Huo is not sufficient to depend upon; riding the momentum of the multitude, all under heaven is not enough to employ.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: One who skillfully employs the multitude finds no strength under heaven too great to overcome. Using the strength of the multitude, even mountains and hills, though heavy, can be moved by their force; employing the wisdom of the multitude, even ghosts and spirits, though obscure, can be illuminated in their principles. Without strategic advantage, one cannot create a position of power; without following the patterns of principle, even the sagely cannot succeed.\n\nThe old commentary states: Once the mechanism of strategic advantage is set, even an ordinary man can release the tension of a ten-thousand-jun crossbow; once the principles of affairs are violated, even a sage cannot bend the words of a child.\n\nThus, the sage in undertaking affairs never fails to rely upon and employ available resources. One with a single merit is placed in a single position; one with a single ability is assigned a single task. When strength surpasses the task, the undertaking is not burdensome; when ability matches the affair, the accomplishment is not difficult. The sage employs all without exception, thus no person is discarded, and no material is wasted.\n\nThe old commentary states: Employing each according to their capacity, none fail to exhaust their talents; utilizing each according to their ability, none fail to devote their utmost effort.\n\nLaozi said: \"The so-called non-action does not mean drawing them will not bring them near or pushing them will not send them away—petty and unresponsive, unmoved by stimuli; rigid and stagnant, unflowing; coiled and grasped, undispersed.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: Only by adapting to circumstances, following the times, and responding to things without obstruction is it called non-action. It means private will does not enter public Dao, desires do not cling to correct methods; following principle in action, establishing merit by relying on resources, and leveraging natural tendencies—thus affairs cannot but be accomplished. Success is achieved, yet the self does not boast; merit is established, yet the name is not claimed.\n\nAs for water employing boats, sand employing embankments, mud employing sledges, mountains employing baskets, summer canals, and winter reservoirs—forming mountains from heights and ponds from lowlands—these are not what I have made.\n\nThe old commentary states: Each employs what is beneficial and attains its convenience, thus it is said, \"not what I have made.\"\n\nThe sage does not feel shame for the lowliness of his person or the failure of his Dao to prevail; he does not grieve over the brevity of his fate but worries for the suffering of the people. Thus, he remains constantly empty and non-active, embracing simplicity and revealing the uncarved block, not mingling with things.\n\nThe old commentary states: Constantly in harmony with the Dao, not mingled with things.\n\nLaozi said: \"The ancient establishment of emperors and kings was not to indulge their desires. The sage who ascends the throne does not seek ease and pleasure for himself. For the people of the world, the strong oppress the weak, the many bully the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, the brave invade the timid. Moreover, those who harbor cunning and deceit do not teach one another; those who accumulate wealth do not share with others. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established to unify their conduct; the brilliance of one man cannot illuminate all within the four seas, so the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers are established to assist him; distant lands and foreign customs cannot receive his beneficence, so feudal lords are established to instruct them. Thus, heaven and earth, the four seasons—none fail to respond. Offices have no neglected affairs; the state has no wasted benefits. Clothing the cold, feeding the hungry, nurturing the elderly and weak, giving rest to the weary—none are left unattended.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: The sage in the superior position does not desire to honor his position or delight in his person but seeks to relieve the people and remedy their ills. Thus, the Son of Heaven holds to the One to unify them; the Three Dukes discuss the Dao to correct them; the Nine Ministers uphold the law to assist them; the feudal lords proclaim teachings to guide them. Therefore, distant and near share the same customs, ruler and ministers are of one mind, officials have no deceit, salaries and markets have no corrupt thoughts. Thus, the *Book of Songs* says: \"With towering virtue, the four states submit.\"\n\nShennong appeared emaciated, Yao grew thin, Shun was swarthy, Yu developed calluses, Yi Yin carried the cauldron to serve Tang, Lü Wang drummed the knife to enter Zhou, Baili Xi was sold in servitude, Guan Zhong was bound in fetters, Confucius had no soot on his chimney, Mozi had no warmth on his mat—none sought position or coveted salary. They desired to initiate the world’s benefits and eliminate the harms to all things.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the common people, if the four limbs are not labored and thoughts are not troubled by affairs, those who seek sustenance have never been heard of.\n\nThe old commentary states: From Shennong onward, those whose bodies were emaciated and hands and feet calloused did not seek to stand above the people or pursue honor but aimed to save the world. There has never been one who, sitting idly, expected salary or reaped without sowing.\n\nLaozi said: \"The so-called Son of Heaven possesses the heavenly Dao to establish the world. The Dao for establishing the world is to hold to the One as its safeguard, returning to the root, practicing non-action, emptiness, and tranquility—without distraction, without boundaries, without limit, without end. Gazing upon it, no form is seen; listening to it, no sound is heard. This is called the warp of the great Dao.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: As in the previous explanation.\n\nLaozi said: \"The Dao embodies the round and models the square; it turns its back on yin and embraces yang; left is yielding, right is firm; it treads the dark and bears the bright. Its transformations are endless; attaining the source of the One, it responds to all directions—this is called spirit and illumination.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: The human head is round like heaven; the feet are square like earth. The back faces yin, the front faces yang; the left hand holds the yielding, the right hand holds the firm. The feet tread the nine depths, the head bears the three luminaries. Circling without end, its essence shines in all directions, one and unchanging, wheeling without constancy—this is called spirit. Those who see it prosper.\n\nHeaven is round without end, thus its form cannot be observed; earth is square without boundary, thus none can peer into its gate. Heaven’s transformations proceed without form; earth’s growth is without measure.\n\nThe old commentary states: Transforming without limit, even the keenest cannot perceive its form; generating without end, even the wisest cannot know its number.\n\nAmong things, there are those that prevail, but the Dao has no rival. The reason it has no rival is that it has no constant form or position. Wheeling without end, it resembles the movement of the sun and moon, the alternation of spring and autumn, the succession of day and night—ending and beginning again, brightening and darkening again. It shapes forms yet has no form, thus its achievements can be accomplished; it creates things yet is not a thing, thus it prevails without exhaustion.\n\nThe old commentary states: Forms emerge from the formless, thus forms are endless; things emerge from the non-thing, thus things are inexhaustible.\n\nHe who excels in temple warfare becomes an emperor; he who excels in spiritual transformation becomes a king. He who excels in temple warfare models the heavenly Dao; he who excels in spiritual transformation illuminates the four seasons. Cultivating governance within his borders, distant lands cherish his virtue; achieving victory before battle, the feudal lords submit as guests.\n\nThe old commentary states: He who excels in temple warfare governs by the Dao to become emperor; he who excels in spiritual transformation prevails by arms to become king. These are employed only when unavoidable.\n\nThose of old who attained the Dao were quiescent and modeled heaven and earth; in motion, they accorded with the sun and moon. Joy and anger followed the four seasons; commands resounded like thunder, their qi never clashing with the eight winds. Flexion and extension never transgressed the five measures.\n\nThe old commentary states: Those who attain the Dao do not rashly give vent to joy or anger, nor rashly issue commands. They model heaven and earth, accord with the sun and moon—thus the eight winds never clash, and the five planets never deviate.\n\nThey followed the people’s desires and harnessed their strength, removing cruelty and eliminating harm. Those who share benefits die for one another; those who share sentiments complete one another; those who share conduct assist one another. Moving in accord with the Dao, the world becomes a crucible. Thus, he who excels in employing troops employs their self-interest; he who cannot employ troops employs them for his own ends. Employing their self-interest, none in the world cannot be employed; employing them for his own ends, not a single person can be employed.\n\nThe old commentary states: Remove what harms them, and though the world be vast, all will serve of their own accord. Oppose their desires, and though one be few, none will belong to oneself.\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Eight\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Library Collection*\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Nine\nBy Du Daojian of the Song\n*Lower Virtue* Chapter\n\nThe old commentary states: The supreme Dao is empty and merged, formless—thus it acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone. As for those who dedicate themselves to nurturing and encounter things with governance, holding to the Dao without loss and guarding virtue without deviation—these belong to the lower virtue. Yet this chapter specifically sets forth the essence of the *Upper Virtue* to clarify the meaning of the *Lower Virtue*.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the self, the highest is to nurture the spirit.\nThe old commentary states: When the spirit is serene and joyful, the self attains great governance.\n\nNext is to nurture the form.\nThe old commentary states: When the form is free from toil, the flesh is full; the spirit is clear, the mind is at peace, and all joints are at rest—this is the root of nurturing life.\n\nThe old commentary states: When the spirit is unagitated and the form is unlabored, this is the foundation of governance and nurturance.\n\nTo fatten the flesh, fill the belly, and supply desires—this is the end of nurturing life.\nThe old commentary states: When nurturing the form reaches this point, the spirit and mind no longer remain clear and at peace—thus it is called the end.\n\nIn governing the state,\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of the Dao of governing the state.\n\nThe highest is to nurture transformation.\nThe old commentary states: To nurture the transformation of virtue and power.\n\nNext is to rectify the law.\nThe old commentary states: To rectify the laws of punishment and reward.\n\nPeople yield to one another, contend to occupy the lowly, vie for few gains, and strive for labor—daily transforming upward toward goodness, unaware of why they do so. This is the root of governance.\nThe old commentary states: The sage rectifies himself and awaits them—none fail to daily employ and transform toward goodness, unaware of why they do so.\n\nUsing profit to encourage goodness and fear of punishment to deter wrongdoing, with laws rectified above and the people compliant below—this is the end of governance.\nThe old commentary states: Relying on this for governance, ruler and minister mutually sustain and compete in vigilance to preserve it—thus it is called the end.\n\nThe ancients nurtured the root; later ages attended to the end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: *Lower Virtue* means holding to virtue. The highest is nurturing the spirit—the root of governing the self. Next is nurturing the form—the end of governing the self. The highest is nurturing transformation—the root of governing the state. Next is rectifying the law—the end of governing the state. Descending further, there is yet a lower than the *Lower Virtue*.\n\nLaozi said: Rulers capable of governance do not appear in every generation; ministers capable of assisting governance do not number one in ten thousand. Seeking one in ten thousand among those who do not appear in every generation—this is why supreme governance occurs but once in a thousand years.\n\nThe old commentary states: A sage descends once in a thousand years; a worthy is born once in five hundred—when virtue converges and timing aligns, it is rare to encounter. Some say: When the ruler is sagely, the minister is worthy, and the minister can guide the ruler to become like Yao and Shun. Yet when heavenly qi descends and earthly qi does not respond, when the earth has fertile soil but heaven sends drought or flood—even between heaven and earth, harmony is not always achieved. How much less can ruler and minister constantly share virtue? Thus, one knows that eras of supreme governance are rare indeed.\n\nFor the achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every generation.\nThe old commentary states: The Dao of hegemons and kings cannot be passed down through successive generations.\n\nFollow their good intentions, guard against their perverse thoughts, and share with the people a single Dao—then the people can be made good, and customs can be made beautiful.\nThe old commentary states: Nurture goodness, restrain perversity, do not rely on hanging laws, and move together along the Dao—daily transformation occurs unawares. This is called attaining the root of governance and achieving perfect goodness.\n\nWhat is prized in the sage is not that he follows crimes to enact punishments, but that he knows where disorder arises.\nThe old commentary states: What is valued is governing before things take shape.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edge and indulges them, letting them become dissolute and licentious, then abandons them to the law and follows with punishments—though one may slaughter the world, one cannot suppress their villainy.\nThe old commentary states: Preventing disorder does not lie in addressing the root but in controlling what is inevitably violated—like holding firewood to put out a fire, only feeding its intensity.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The convergence of a wise ruler and a worthy minister occurs but once in a thousand years. Wise rulers do not appear in every generation; worthy ministers do not number one in ten thousand. When a ruler who does not appear in every generation obtains a minister who is one in ten thousand—from Tang and Yu onward, examples like Tang with Yi Yin or King Wen with Lü Wang are rarely seen. Even cases like Duke Huan of Qi with Guan Zhong do not appear in every generation. Thus, eras of governance grow fewer while eras of disorder grow more numerous—perhaps because the noble are few and the petty are many?\n\nLaozi said: One who dwells by rivers and seas yet keeps his heart in the palace—this is valuing life. Valuing life means轻轻利.\nThe old commentary states: Though one has not forgotten worldly glory, one can place oneself in tranquility and vastness—this may be called one who values life and轻轻利.\n\nIf one cannot overcome oneself but follows it, the spirit suffers no harm.\nThe old commentary states: When the inner struggle is not overcome, one should follow the heart and fulfill the will—this still avoids harm to life.\n\nIf one cannot overcome oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called重伤. One who is重伤 will not live long.\nThe old commentary states: If one cannot forget attachments yet suppresses them to return to stillness, this重伤s life. One who重伤s life will no longer be among the long-lived.\n\nThus it is said: Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Increasing life is called auspiciousness; the mind employing qi is called strength.\nThe old commentary states: One who can release emotions and fulfill the will still approaches knowing harmony. One who guards constancy is clear about his lot. Increasing life and employing qi are also fitting for this—how much more so when one attains the supreme harmony of heaven and earth, draws upon the enduring virtue, understands the unity of life and death, and lives without perishing? This is the luminous penetration of heavenly nature.\n\nThis is called \"using its light and returning to its clarity.\"\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: In the Dao of serving or reclusion, there is no bending or extending. Though the self dwells in rivers and lakes, the heart remains in the palace—this is not forgetting the furrowed fields. Thus, the man of Dao recludes by this Dao: when the time is to stop, he stops; when the time is to act, he acts. This is called \"using its light and returning to its clarity.\"\n\nLaozi said: Nothing in the world is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. What is called doing good? Being quiescent and without action, suiting one’s emotions, rejecting excess, free from enticement, following one’s nature, preserving authenticity, and never changing within oneself—thus it is said that doing good is easy.\n\nThe old commentary states that this does not exceed the bounds of one’s inherent nature—how could it not be easy? What is called \"doing evil is difficult\" refers to murder, usurpation, deceit, restlessness, and excessive desires—these are not of human nature. Thus, it is said that doing evil is difficult. The old commentary states that this exceeds the bounds of ordinary nature—how could it not be hard? That which accords with the Dao brings good fortune and is easy; that which opposes the Dao brings misfortune and is difficult.\n\nWhat is now considered the greatest affliction arises from lacking constancy and measure. The old commentary states: If one acts recklessly, affliction follows; if one acts without restraint, affliction grows. Thus, in matters of profit and harm, fortune and misfortune, one must be discerning. The sage has no desires and no aversions. The old commentary states: Having no desires, what would one avoid? In some matters, pursuing desire only leads to loss; in others, avoiding harm only brings it closer. The old commentary states: Seeking to nourish life yet losing it, striving to avoid misfortune yet encountering it. When the will is set on desire, one forgets one’s purpose. The old commentary states: Like grasping for gold, one becomes blind to others and forgets all caution.\n\nThus, the sage examines the changes between movement and stillness, adapts to the measure of giving and receiving, harmonizes the emotions of love and aversion, and moderates joy and anger. When movement and stillness are balanced, affliction cannot intrude. The old commentary states: The common affliction of people is their inability to avoid calamity. When giving and receiving are appropriate, guilt does not burden one. The old commentary states: When one acts according to one’s capacity, one is no longer bound by guilt. When love and aversion are principled, sorrow does not approach. The old commentary states: If one’s choices are upright, one avoids proximate sorrow. When joy and anger are moderated, resentment does not arise. The old commentary states: With consistent rewards and punishments, resentment does not take root.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Though good and evil take different forms, both arise from the heart. Nothing in the world is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. The steps to fortune and misfortune are unpredictable—one may seek gain yet lose, strive to avoid harm yet encounter it. Thus, the sage examines the changes between movement and stillness, harmonizes joy and anger, and acts without error. What sorrow or resentment could there be?\n\nThe person who embodies the Dao does not grasp at what is not theirs nor refuse misfortune. They do not discard what is not theirs nor control what is beyond them. The old commentary states: They are unified in their circumstances—what comes is not refused, what has not yet arrived is not sought. They remain full yet do not overflow, ever empty yet easily sustained. The old commentary states: This is the result of self-sufficiency. Thus, when one measures oneself by the Dao and its arts, food fills the void, clothing wards off the cold—enough to warm and nourish this seven-foot frame. Without the measure of the Dao and its arts, even the power of ten thousand chariots cannot bring joy, nor can the wealth of the world bring delight. The old commentary states: Abiding in the Dao, all desires may be followed without limit.\n\nThus, the sage’s heart is at peace, their will is yielding, their spirit is inwardly guarded, and external things cannot delude them. The old commentary states: Without desire, one is naturally at peace; without greed, one is naturally yielding.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Cultivating the self has its Dao; engaging with the world has its art. The person who embodies the Dao upholds their natural constancy, accepts their fate, eats to fill the void, clothes themselves to ward off the cold, does not grasp at what is not theirs, does not discard what they possess, avoids misfortune without seeking it, and does not recklessly pursue fortune. They are not arrogant in success nor change their conduct in adversity. They delight in their natural truth and remain with the Dao for long.\n\nLaozi said: One who overcomes others is strong; one who overcomes themselves is mighty. Those who are mighty must employ the strength of others. The old commentary states: This refers to the power of virtue that subjugates others. Those who can employ the strength of others must win their hearts. Those who win the hearts of others must first master themselves. There has never been one who mastered themselves yet lost others, nor one who lost themselves yet won others. The old commentary states: This was already explained in the *Fuyan* chapter.\n\nThus, the foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people. The foundation of pacifying the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency. The foundation of ensuring sufficiency lies in not seizing the seasons. The old commentary states: The seasons refer to the three periods of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest. The foundation of not seizing the seasons lies in reducing affairs. The foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderating use. The foundation of moderating use lies in eliminating arrogance. The old commentary states: This means attaining the proper mean. The foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in emptiness and non-action. The old commentary states: The root lies in emptying oneself and governing without action—how could this not embody the principle of moderation and the virtue of cherishing the people?\n\nThus, one who understands the nature of life does not pursue what life cannot provide; one who understands the nature of fate does not worry over what fate cannot bestow. Why is this? The old commentary states: The body’s own limits—thus, the wise do not worry, and only then can they fully realize the way of preserving life and entrusting themselves to fate. The eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves rich flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds—the seven apertures contend with one another, harming the singular nature. Day by day, deviant desires drain one’s celestial harmony. If one cannot even govern oneself, how can one govern the world? The old commentary states: There has never been one who harmed themselves yet could also govern others—how much less the world?\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: To overcome others, one must first overcome oneself. There has never been one who failed to overcome themselves yet could overcome others. Overcoming others requires strength—this is about using force to prevail. Overcoming oneself requires might—this is about principle prevailing over desire. When principle prevails, one wins the hearts of others, and they willingly offer their strength. When desire prevails, one employs the strength of others, yet they first withdraw their hearts. The difference between heavenly principle and human desire is thus clear.\n\nWhat is called \"gaining the world\" does not refer to treading upon power and bearing a noble title. It means moving the hearts of the world and winning the strength of the world. The old commentary states: Thus, one’s radiance extends to the four directions, reaching above and below—people cannot bear to oppose them. To have the name of facing south yet lack the praise of even one person is to lose the world. Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings. The old commentary states: This means they lost the hearts and strength of the world. Tang and Wu were not exiles. The old commentary states: It was not that Tang and Wu could exile Jie and Zhou—rather, they followed the hearts of the world and employed the strength of the world.\n\nThe Son of Heaven who attains the Dao is guarded by the four barbarians; the Son of Heaven who loses the Dao is guarded by the feudal lords. The old commentary states: *Guarded* means protected—when the Dao is attained, protection lies with foreign customs; when the Dao is lost, protection lies with ministers. The feudal lord who attains the Dao is guarded by the four borders; the feudal lord who loses the Dao is guarded by his attendants. The old commentary states: If one does not righteously support the royal house and benevolently care for the people, even those as close as liver and gallbladder become as distant as Chu and Yue.\n\nThus, it is said: Do not rely on others not seizing from you; rely on what cannot be seized from you. The old commentary states: Do not defend against the difficulty of virtue; rely on the Dao, which cannot be seized. To practice a Dao that can be seized, even if one avoids murder and usurpation, it is of no benefit in preserving the world. The old commentary states: Dwelling in a position that can be seized, even if one avoids usurpation for a lifetime, it is still insufficient to uphold and protect the divine vessel.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: If one cherishes me, they follow; if one oppresses me, they become enemies. The sage moves the hearts of the world and wins the strength of the world—thus, the world is governed. As for Jie and Zhou as rulers, they had the name of facing south yet lacked the praise of even one person—this is why Tang and Wu could not serve them as ministers. When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao and the feudal lords become his guardians, whose fault is this?\n\nLaozi said: Those who govern a state well do not alter its ancient ways nor change its constant norms. The old commentary states: They govern by following these.\n\nAnger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is what throws people into chaos. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue; delighting in the use of instruments of misfortune to govern what throws people into chaos is the height of perversity. The old commentary states: This is not the way to govern people.\n\nOne cannot bring misfortune upon others without bringing it upon oneself. The old commentary states: Simply following what one does. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their brilliance, and merge with their dust. The old commentary states: Crush their instruments of ferocity, release their entangled hearts, and harmonize with the myriad things, blending with their dust and transforming them.\n\nHuman nature invariably desires to surpass others and resents falling short. The old commentary states: This is the common nature of people. The desire to surpass others gives rise to contention; resentment at falling short breeds grievance and strife. The old commentary states: Because they harbor resentment, there is much grievance and strife. When grievance and strife arise, the heart is thrown into chaos and qi becomes contrary. The old commentary states: Qi is harmonious and smooth when it follows its proper course.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old withdrew from contention, and grievance did not arise. The old commentary states: This means they did not exalt worthiness. When the heart is at peace and qi follows its course, it is said: \"Do not exalt worthiness, and the people will not contend.\" The *Zuan Yi* states: Contention leaves one lacking; yielding leaves one with a surplus—a way for both self and others to be preserved.\n\nAnger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is what throws people into chaos. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue; delighting in the use of instruments of misfortune to govern what throws people into chaos is the height of perversity. Wenzi transmitted these words to Fan Li, who admonished Goujian when Yue sought to attack Wu. Goujian did not listen and was defeated at Fujiao. Thus, it is known that those who seek to bring misfortune upon others only bring it upon themselves. Would the worthy act in such a way?\n\nLaozi said: Those who govern things do not do so through things but through harmony. The old commentary states: Using harmony to engage with things, they can be governed. Those who govern harmony do not do so through harmony but through people. The old commentary states: When people attain what is fitting, they naturally harmonize. Those who govern people do not do so through people but through the ruler. The old commentary states: When the head is upright, the limbs stand on their own. Those who govern the ruler do not do so through the ruler but through desire. The old commentary states: Without desire, the self is upright; when the self is upright, all under heaven is upright. Those who govern desire do not do so through desire but through nature. The old commentary states: When one attains the principle of nature, all things are untied. If one uses desire to eliminate desire, it is like using affairs to stop affairs. Those who govern nature do not do so through nature but through virtue. The old commentary states: When nothing is lacking, nature is complete. Those who govern virtue do not do so through virtue but through the Dao. The old commentary states: If one does not lose virtue, this is what virtue is. Abiding in the ultimate Dao, virtue arises of itself.\n\nWhen the root of the Dao is taken as nature, there is no deviation. Dwelling long among things, one forgets their root; forgetting their root, one merges with the so-called nature. The old commentary states: Departing from the pure and simple root, one takes the desires of acquired habits as nature. Clothing, food, ritual, and custom are not human nature; they are received from without. The old commentary states: They are outside the bounds of one’s nature.\n\nThus, human nature desires equilibrium; desires harm it. Only those with the Dao can relinquish things and return to themselves. The old commentary states: They can recover the root of nature. When one has something with which to reflect upon oneself, one does not lose the true nature of things; when one has nothing with which to reflect upon oneself, one moves and is deluded by confusion. The old commentary states: Reflecting upon oneself with the Dao, the original nature of the myriad things remains unstained. If one cannot do so, when things come, they delude and confuse, and one loses the proper course in all movements.\n\nThose who indulge their desires lose their nature; their movements are never proper. In managing life, they lose themselves; in governing the state, they throw people into chaos. Those who have not heard the Dao have no means to return to their nature. The old commentary states: Thus, it is said: \"Returning is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Nature and desire are fundamentally distinct. All people are like this, but rulers are especially so. Those who govern things do not do so through things but through harmony—first clarifying their own nature, then clarifying the nature of things. When the nature of things is clarified, one can assist in transformation and nurturing, participating in the work of heaven and earth.\n\nThe sages of old were able to attain this within themselves, thus their commands were carried out and prohibitions were effective. The old commentary states: When one’s self is upright, commands are followed without being issued. In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit. When the spirit is clear and the mind is calm, things can be set right. The old commentary states: Clarity allows one to discern the true nature of things; calmness allows one to set things right. Then, nothing is neglected, and good is accomplished.\n\nIf one’s hearing is misled by false praise and one’s eyes are seduced by dazzling colors, it will be difficult to set affairs right. The old commentary states: Listening to words amid right and wrong, gazing upon fine silks—when the self is not settled, how can one set things right? Therefore, emptiness is valued. The old commentary states: Because it is unburdened, its responses are inexhaustible.\n\nThus, when water is agitated, waves arise; when qi is disordered, wisdom is clouded. Clouded wisdom cannot be used to set things right; turbulent water cannot be used to level things. The old commentary states: When clouded, it does not reflect; when turbulent, it does not settle. When settled, it is level and still; when reflecting, it is right and fitting.\n\nThus, the sage-kings held to the One to govern the nature and feelings of things. The old commentary states: The clear and calm One can penetrate the principles of the myriad things. The One is most noble, having no preferences under heaven. The sage-kings entrusted themselves to having no preferences, thus they issued commands for all under heaven. The old commentary states: If they were partial to something, it would not be noble under heaven. The sage-kings, being without desire, had no preferences. With no preferences, all preferences were met, thus they could transform and command all under heaven.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The scholars of old studied for themselves. Once the way of cultivating the self was established, the way of benefiting others could be practiced. The sages attained this within themselves, thus clarity and brightness resided in their persons, illuminating all without exception. They grasped the true nature of the myriad things, and their commands were carried out under heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Yin and yang shape and smelt the myriad things, all riding upon a single qi to come into being. The old commentary states: The three powers share a single harmonious qi to mold the myriad things. When superiors and inferiors are at odds, qi rises and steams upward; when ruler and ministers are not in harmony, the five grains do not ripen. The old commentary states: This is what is meant by storing and communicating harmonious qi.\n\nSpring frost and autumn blossoms, winter thunder and summer frost—all arise from pernicious qi. The old commentary states: That which harms the constant norms is called pernicious qi. Between heaven and earth, it is like the body of one person. The old commentary states: It depends solely on the ruler’s transformation. Within the six directions, it is like the form of one person. The old commentary states: The patterns of movement and function all correspond.\n\nThus, those who are enlightened about nature cannot be coerced by heaven and earth; those who are discerning about signs cannot be deluded by strange phenomena. The old commentary states: Knowing the mutual resonance of spirit and nature, trusting the correspondence of signs between heaven and humanity, one does not fall into fear or confusion. The sages knew the distant through the near. The old commentary states: Comparing to what is within the self.\n\nAccumulating the harmonious qi of mutual resonance thus arises.\n\nThat which treats the myriad differences as one unity—the old commentary states: This follows from the principle of inference. Qi steams throughout heaven and earth—the old commentary states: The qi of central harmony pervades above and below. When ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are not established, the myriad people will inevitably invade and oppress one another, remaining in a state of chaotic obscurity—the old commentary states: The governance of the utmost Dao transforms through resonance, not through the allure of ritual and righteousness to external things. Thus, in pure simplicity and constancy, one does not know how this state is achieved, yet it is attained.\n\nWhen integrity and shame decline, and the age falls into decay—using much yet possessing little, laboring strenuously yet lacking sustenance—the people grow impoverished and bitter, giving rise to resentment and strife. Hence, benevolence is esteemed—the old commentary states: Temporarily borrowing universal love to govern the people. Yet when people are base and unequal, forming cliques and factions, each promoting their own allies while harboring hearts of scheming, craftiness, and deceit, righteousness is esteemed—the old commentary states: Righteousness is the regulation that accords with what is fitting, after which things are rectified in their reality.\n\nWhen men and women dwell in mixed groups without distinction, ritual is esteemed—the old commentary states: Ritual is the restraint of the self to conform to measure, after which people are ordered in their proper relations. When the passions of life and destiny become excessive and press upon one another in unavoidable ways, leading to disharmony, music is esteemed—the old commentary states: Music harmonizes the heart and calms the mind, after which it transforms customs through resonance.\n\nThus, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are means to remedy decay, not the Dao of universal governance—the old commentary states: They remedy the decay of dissipation and excess, not the universal Dao of governance. To inherit this principle: Heaven and earth are as one body; the world is as one qi. The transformations of yang and the changes of yin shape and refine the myriad things, all riding upon this single qi. The sage cherishes and nurtures the myriad people, regarding them as one family; thus, the world attains peace.\n\nYet when use is excessive and resources are few, when labor is strenuous and sustenance is insufficient, the people grow impoverished and bitter, giving rise to resentment and strife—this is not the Dao of universal governance. If one can truly settle the numinous clarity throughout the world and return the heart to its origin—the old commentary states: Through resonance and transformation, causing it to revert to the original nature—then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang, follow and encompass it—the old commentary states: Through great compliance, great penetration is achieved. Thus, resources are sufficient and people are provided for; the hearts of greed, baseness, resentment, and strife cannot arise—the old commentary states: Through attaining their nature and being fulfilled, they do not know of other things.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet virtue and the Dao are settled throughout the world, and the people do not indulge in sensual pleasures—the old commentary states: If they have not been subjected to benevolence and righteousness, then the Dao between above and below flows freely without dissipation, and the virtue of ruler and minister remains plain and undecorated. Thus, when virtue declines, then benevolence and righteousness are adorned—the old commentary states: Losing virtue, then benevolence is lost; losing benevolence, then righteousness is lost. When harmony is lost, then sounds are tuned—the old commentary states: Tuning sounds to seek harmony clearly shows that harmony has already been lost. When ritual becomes excessive, then deportment is adorned—the old commentary states: Excess here means surpassing the mean, thus leading to the adornment of conduct.\n\nThus, only by knowing virtue and the Dao can one recognize the insufficiency of benevolence and righteousness; only by knowing benevolence and righteousness can one recognize the insufficiency of ritual and music. To inherit this principle: When the sage is sincere and enlightened, returning to the original nature, the people revert to goodness. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang, follow and encompass it; resources are sufficient and people are provided for; greed and baseness do not arise, and resentment and strife cease. Benevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet virtue and the Dao are settled throughout the world.\n\nLaozi said: The governance of clarity and stillness is harmonious and compliant, tranquil and serene, plain and unadorned, leisurely and unhurried—the old commentary states: The desireless abide constantly in the wondrous, thus all virtues are naturally preserved. Within, it accords with the Dao; without, it aligns with righteousness—the old commentary states: Internally, it harmonizes with the Dao; externally, it rectifies affairs. His words are concise yet follow principle; his conduct is joyful yet accords with the passions—the old commentary states: Words that accord with principle are naturally simple; conduct that follows things is thus compliant. His heart is harmonious yet without falsity; his affairs are plain yet without adornment—the old commentary states: Internally harmonious and externally plain, a heart with falsity leads to adorned affairs.\n\nHe does not scheme about beginnings nor discuss endings; at ease, he remains, and when stirred, he acts—the old commentary states: Dismissing cleverness and abandoning knowledge, he abides in action and responds to stimuli. His entire being accords with heaven and earth; his essence unites with yin and yang; he harmonizes with the four seasons; his clarity illuminates like the sun and moon. Those who transform with the Dao become human—the old commentary states: The self does not possess itself; it becomes human with the Dao, thus heaven and earth, sun and moon, unite in their luminous virtue.\n\nScheming, craftiness, and deceit do not lodge in his heart. Thus, heaven covers with virtue; earth bears with music; the four seasons do not lose their order; wind and rain do not act with cruelty; the sun and moon are clear and still, their radiance unimpeded; the five stars do not deviate from their courses—this is what clarity and stillness reveal—the old commentary states: Through clarity and stillness, non-action, heaven and earth do not fail in their constant virtue.\n\nTo inherit this principle: Heaven is clear and earth is still, thus they endure long. The sage governs with clarity and stillness, modeling himself on heaven and earth. When the heart is clear, it internally accords with the Dao; when the body is still, it externally aligns with others. Thus, without leaving his door, his transformation spreads.\n\nLaozi said: The duties of governing the age are easy to maintain—the old commentary states: Without affairs, they are easy to maintain. Its affairs are easy to perform—the old commentary states: Without disturbance, they are easy to perform. Its rituals are easy to practice—the old commentary states: Without adornment, they are easy to practice. Its obligations are easy to fulfill—the old commentary states: With lenient laws, they are easy to fulfill.\n\nThus, people do not hold multiple offices; offices do not manage multiple affairs. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are distinguished by village and separated by state—the old commentary states: They do not encroach upon one another’s proper relations. Thus, farmers speak with farmers about storing, scholars speak with scholars about conduct, artisans speak with artisans about skill, and merchants speak with merchants about profit—the old commentary states: Profit refers to the calculations of what is advantageous. Thus, scholars do not neglect their conduct, artisans do not suffer in their work, farmers do not abandon their labor, and merchants do not lose their goods; each abides in their nature—the old commentary states: Each abides in what is convenient for their nature and practices according to their time.\n\nThough their forms and appearances differ, they exchange tasks without confusion—the old commentary states: Though the four classes differ in appearance and their paths of entry and exit vary, they exchange their tasks without mutual disorder. Those who lose their occupation are base; those who attain their aspirations are noble—the old commentary states: Those who attain do so naturally; those who lose do so naturally.\n\nTo inherit this principle: The ancients guarded one office for life; each office guarded one affair. Thus, in a well-governed age, officials’ duties were easy to maintain, and affairs were easy to perform. Later ages implemented the system of holding multiple offices and sharing affairs, leading to increasingly redundant officials and increasingly complex affairs. With governance issuing from many sources, it instead harms order.\n\nThose with foresight and far-reaching vision possess abundant talent, yet a well-governed age does not demand this of the people. Those with extensive knowledge, strong memory, eloquent speech, and quick wit possess overflowing knowledge, yet a enlightened ruler does not seek this from his subordinates. Those who scorn the world and despise things do not sully themselves with vulgar customs, yet a well-governed age does not use them to transform the people. Thus, those who are too lofty to be emulated are not taken as a measure for the people; conduct that cannot be matched is not taken as the custom of the state—the old commentary states: The Dao of utmost principle unifies customs; esteeming worthies and valuing goods gives rise to contention and theft.\n\nThus, exceptional talent cannot be exclusively employed, nor can standards be rigidly imposed—old commentary: because their capacities differ. The Dao and its arts can be transmitted through generations—old commentary: the Dao adapts to each according to their share, while arts grasp the one to respond to the myriad, hence their transmission through the ages remains viable. Therefore, state laws may be upheld by the simple-minded, and military discipline may be maintained in unison—old commentary: when the state unifies customs, even the simple-minded can uphold its laws; when the army unifies its methods, even discipline can be uniformly observed. One need not rely on the heroic talents of antiquity, for people are self-sufficient when their existing capacities are employed in parallel—old commentary: in an age without turmoil, the talents of the worthy and the unworthy alike find their proper place and are used together. In the degenerate laws of later ages, standards are set too high, yet punishments fail to reach them; burdens are made too heavy, yet penalties cannot bear them; tasks are made too difficult, yet those who dare not attempt them are condemned—old commentary: demanding beyond their proper share. When tasks are light, all can bear them; when duties are easy, all dare to fulfill them. When the people are oppressed by these three demands, they adorn their intelligence to deceive their superiors, violate norms to pursue perilous paths—old commentary: seeking only to escape blame. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, their deceit cannot be suppressed—old commentary: for their deceit evades the very punishments meant to restrain it. When beasts are cornered, they gore; when birds are cornered, they peck; when people are cornered, they deceive—this is what it means.\n\nThose of abundant talent with foresight and vision are not held to account by a well-governed age; those of extensive knowledge with eloquent and persuasive speech are not sought after by an enlightened ruler. Scorning the world and holding oneself aloof while demanding much of others and imposing the impossible only invites the deceit of those driven to desperation. Laozi said: The sound of thunder and thunderclaps can be likened to bells and drums; the changes of wind and rain can be known through musical tones—old commentary: when confined to sound and appearance, none can escape detection. What is vast enough to be seen can be measured; what is clearly visible can be obscured; what can be heard can be tuned; what can be observed can be distinguished—old commentary: within the bounds of perception. Yet the vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot be contained, nor can the subtlety of spirits and numina be grasped—old commentary: referring to the primordial era when the Dao’s essence was undifferentiated and its virtue’s workings were imperceptibly refined. Once calendars were established, the five colors distinguished, and the pure and turbid, sweet and bitter flavors separated, simplicity scattered and gave way to artifacts—old commentary: with the differentiation of the five colors and the six pitch-standards, the undifferentiated whole dispersed, each finding its place within the realm of instruments. When benevolence and righteousness were instituted and rites and music refined, virtue shifted and became artificial—old commentary: what was once inherent virtue now depends on external cultivation—how could it not be false? The people adorn their intelligence to astonish the foolish and devise deceit to assail their superiors. Though some may hold power over the world, none can bring it to order—old commentary: though they may hold it, they cannot govern it. The more intelligence and ability proliferate, the more virtue declines into depravity. Thus, the perfected person preserves simplicity and does not scatter it.\n\nIn this vein, the sage splits the great unhewn wood, models Heaven and Earth, and observes their images to craft instruments. Just as thunder and thunderclaps relate to bells and drums, and wind and rain to musical tones, all are shaped by their likenesses. Yet the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the subtlety of spirits and numina cannot be fully fathomed. Only the perfected person, preserving simplicity and not scattering it, can serve as the teacher of all ages. In the governance of the perfected person, emptiness and stillness prevail, no desires are visible, the mind abides with the spirit—old commentary: acting without domination—and form harmonizes with nature.\n\nThe old commentary states: inner and outer flow in harmony, stillness embodies virtue, and movement aligns with principle—following the Dao of nature only when necessity arises. Old commentary: responding only when moved. Acting with serene non-action, the world attains harmony; free from desires, the people naturally return to simplicity. Without contention, wealth suffices; the giver claims no virtue, the receiver offers no deference, yet virtue returns of itself, and none perceive it as a favor. Old commentary: when the world knows not whence its blessings come, nor declines what arrives, then the highest virtue returns, and none regard it as a gift.\n\nEloquence without words, the Dao unspoken—if one attains this, it is called the Celestial Treasury. Old commentary: abiding in this Dao to transform the people and share in their virtue. Drawing from it does not diminish it; partaking of it does not deplete it. None know its source—this is called the Radiant Light. Old commentary: that which has abundance and bestows its surplus upon things is called *light*; that which moves in accordance with the needs of things is called *radiance*. The Radiant Light is the sustenance of the myriad things. Old commentary: the Dao is capable of bestowing and completing, hence it is called *sustenance*.\n\nIn this vein, the Northern Asterism is the honored sovereign of Heaven, dwelling at the center of the celestial pole while the host of stars encircle it. The perfected person models this in governance: the mind abides with the spirit, serene and non-active, and the world attains harmony. The Radiant Light resides at the handle of the Northern Dipper, sustaining the myriad things as it revolves with the leftward turning of Heaven, completing a daily cycle. The Dipper does not descend, yet blessings arise, and the people are fed without want. Shun observed the turning of the jade armillary to align the Seven Governors—was he not one who understood Heaven?\n\nLaozi said: Heaven cherishes its essence, Earth cherishes its balance, and humans cherish their nature. Old commentary: *cherishes* here means *values*. Heaven’s essence consists of the sun, moon, stars, thunder, wind, and rain; Earth’s balance consists of water, fire, metal, wood, and soil. Old commentary: Heaven distributes the essence of the Six Qi, Earth divides the balance of the Five Phases. Human nature encompasses thought, discernment, joy, and anger. Thus, closing the Four Gates and halting the Five Escapes, one merges with the Dao, spirit and numina concealed in formlessness, essence and qi returning to the true. Old commentary: the Four Gates are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth; the Five Escapes are the five emotions straying from their root. By closing and halting them, one merges with the Dao, preserving spirit and qi. The eyes see clearly yet do not fixate on sights; the ears hear keenly yet do not cling to sounds; the mouth speaks rightly yet does not indulge in words; the mind flows unimpeded yet does not engage in thought. Old commentary: acting thus, one avoids external toil and internal harm. Essence stored in the eyes sharpens vision; stored in the ears, it refines hearing; retained in the mouth, it ensures right speech; gathered in the heart, it clarifies thought. Old commentary: if even the mind’s exertions may approach this, how much more so when essence is preserved? Thus, closing the Four Gates ensures lifelong freedom from harm; the four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live—this is the True Person. Old commentary: *neither die nor live* means they are neither abandoned nor employed. The True Person is simply unified: the limbs and orifices are pervaded by pure qi.\n\nEarth’s generation of wealth stems fundamentally from the Five Phases; the sage regulates the Five Phases to govern without disorder. Old commentary: the qi of life and sustenance lies in the Five Phases; governing by modeling them prevents mutual harm. In this vein, humans possess Five Natures corresponding to the Five Stars of Heaven and the Five Phases of Earth. When the Five Natures stir, the Seven Emotions arise—can one remain unaware of their value? The spirit is stored in the heart, essence in the kidneys, the hun-soul in the liver, the po-soul in the lungs, and intention in the spleen. Spirit and numina are concealed in formlessness, neither living nor dying—this is the True Person.\n\nLaozi said: the balance is impartial between left and right, thus it can serve as a level; the plumb line is impartial between inner and outer, thus it can serve as a standard. The ruler is impartial in law, free from personal likes and dislikes, thus he can issue commands. Old commentary: *commands* here means *decrees*. Without partiality, one can rectify the world. Virtue is not established, resentment is not harbored—this is following the Dao and harmonizing with the people’s hearts. Old commentary: yielding to the Dao, one goes where all is the same; sameness without intention precludes both virtue and resentment. Thus, in governance, knowledge is not employed. Old commentary: employing knowledge is inappropriate. Water’s turbulence capsizes boats; wood’s impact snaps axles—one does not resent the wood or stone but blames the clumsiness of the craftsman. Knowledge is not to be relied upon. Old commentary: the unburdened heart incurs no resentment; relying on knowledge never ensures lasting fortune.\n\nThus, when the Dao employs knowledge, disorder arises; when virtue harbors intention, peril ensues; when the heart has eyes, obscurity follows. Old commentary: knowledge disrupts the Dao of non-action; intention endangers the virtue of self-so; eyes obscure the clarity of the heart. Yet the balance, the compass, the square, and the marking-line remain constant and unchanging, ever uniform and unerring, ever square and unobstructed. Their form endures for a day, their transmission for ten thousand generations—this is the non-action that acts. Old commentary: *uniform* means non-action; the Hundred Kings employed it, and it was transmitted through the ages without alteration. All things devoid of partiality or selfishness, when met with this unity, though responding all day, never act—this is the ultimate governance, upright and constant. Otherwise, how could balances and measures, created in a single day, remain unchanged for ten thousand generations? In this vein, when humans harbor selfishness, none fail to harm the Dao; when the ruler is impartial, the law is unified and decrees are implemented. Thus, when virtue harbors intention, peril ensues; when the heart has eyes, obscurity follows. Knowing that the balance, the compass, the square, and the marking-line remain constant and unchanging, one understands that unity is the non-action employed by the Hundred Kings, transmitted through the ages.\n\nThe saying goes: a state may have a ruler who perishes, but the world never lacks the Dao. Old commentary: the Dao does not change with the ages; only humans cultivate it. Humans may reach an impasse, but principle knows no obstruction. Old commentary: one who thoroughly investigates a matter encounters no impassable principle. Thus, non-action is the root of the Dao; attaining the root of the Dao, one responds without limit. Old commentary: without intention in the midst of things, one moves in harmony with the myriad beings without exhaustion. Therefore, not relying on the patterns of principle but instead depending on one’s own abilities will lead to an impasse not far off. Old commentary: only by not relying on oneself but following Heaven’s principle can one remain at ease, unaware of where limitations lie.\n\nThe ruler who does not leave his chamber yet knows the world does so by relying on things to understand things and on people to understand people. Old commentary: taking non-action as one’s heart is the means of reliance. Simply following principle to deduce it, the world can be known. Thus, the strength of accumulated effort achieves all it undertakes; the plans of collective wisdom accomplish all they intend. A thousand-strong host never runs out of provisions; a ten-thousand-strong assembly never fails in its work. Old commentary: when the ruler does not monopolize affairs, he can rely on the people’s strength to bear the world’s burdens. Losing the Dao of reliance, knowledge is exhausted, and affairs are abandoned.\n\nThe craftsman possesses no exceptional skills, the officer holds no concurrent posts—each guards his own duty without encroaching upon another. People find their proper place, and things attain their rightful peace. Thus, tools and implements are never faulty, and official duties are never neglected.\n\nOld commentary: When each is fully devoted to a single use, none loses its proper place.\n\nDebts are few and easily repaid.\nOld commentary: Action can remedy error.\n\nDuties are few and easily upheld.\nOld commentary: Affairs are simple and easily accomplished.\n\nResponsibilities are light and easily encouraged.\nOld commentary: Strength remains, and thus all flows smoothly.\n\nThe ruler holds to few and simple divisions; below, the people readily achieve success. Thus, ruler and minister endure long without wearying of one another.\nOld commentary: The Way of simplicity and ease can be great and enduring.\n\nTo inherit the right principle: Heaven does not act as Heaven—who then acts for Heaven? Earth does not act as Earth—who then acts for Earth? A state may have a ruler who perishes, yet the age does not perish with the Way. Yi Yin five times approached Jie yet was not employed—this was relying on one’s own ability while ignorant of the Dao of relying on others. Thus, Yi Yin did not serve Xia but served Tang. Could Xia have avoided ruin? Could Tang have failed to rise?\n\nLaozi said:\nThe emperor embodies the Great Unity.\nOld commentary: Embodies the Dao of the Great Unity and the True One.\n\nThe king models himself on yin and yang.\nOld commentary: Models himself on the potter’s work of shaping the myriad things.\n\nThe hegemon follows the four seasons.\nOld commentary: Follows the commands of warmth in spring and severity in autumn.\n\nThe lord employs the six pitch-pipes.\nOld commentary: Employs the qi of the five notes and seasonal indicators.\n\nOne who embodies the Great Unity is enlightened to the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the principles of the Dao and virtue.\nOld commentary: Emerges from Heaven and Earth, unites the Dao and virtue.\n\nHis intelligence shines like the sun and moon, his spirit communes with the myriad things.\nOld commentary: No darkness remains unillumined, thus he shines like the sun and moon; no mechanism escapes his grasp, thus he communes with the myriad things.\n\nIn movement and stillness, he harmonizes with yin and yang; in joy and anger, he accords with the four seasons.\nOld commentary: In movement, he is never excessive; in stillness, he is never stagnant—thus he harmonizes with yin and yang. In spring, he is not overly warm; in autumn, he is not overly severe—thus he accords with the four seasons.\n\nHis sheltering and nurturing are all through the Dao, vast and all-embracing yet without partiality.\nOld commentary: Sheltering and nurturing alternate, all through the Dao.\n\nFrom the flying midge to the wriggling worm, none fails to look up to his virtue and live.\nOld commentary: The Three Powers harmonize and fully realize their life.\n\nHis virtue flows beyond the four directions, his fame and reputation resound through later ages.\nOld commentary: One who dwells in reality naturally becomes the master of guests and beauties.\n\nOne who models himself on yin and yang inherits the harmony of Heaven and Earth, his virtue matching Heaven and Earth, his brilliance equaling the sun and moon, his essence equaling the numinous spirits.\nOld commentary: This is what is meant by uniting one’s numinous virtue with Heaven, Earth, and the spirits.\n\nHe wears the round and treads the square, embraces the plumb line and rests on the marking cord.\nOld commentary: The Way of advancing correctness lies entirely in following the patterns.\n\nWithin, he can govern his person; without, he wins the hearts of the people. When he issues commands, the world follows like the wind.\n\nThe old commentary states: When commands issue like the wind scattering, then the four seasons—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—take and give in measure, go out and come in with proportion. Joy and anger, firmness and softness do not depart from principle. Soft yet not brittle, firm yet not harsh, broad yet not wanton, solemn yet not perverse, gentle and yielding to nurture the multitude—such virtue embraces the foolish and accommodates the unworthy, without partial love.\n\nOld commentary: Only when all these excellences are gathered does the way of hegemony take shape. Thus, who but the sage can attain the realm between emperor and king?\n\nOne who employs the six pitch-pipes governs life and death, reward and punishment, giving and taking—without these, there is no Dao.\n\nOld commentary: The Dao lies in following the six seasonal indicators to administer all affairs; in the application of rewards and punishments, nothing contravenes what is fitting.\n\nTo strike down disorder and restrain violence, to elevate the worthy and depose the unfit, to correct the crooked and make it straight, to transform peril into peace—this is to be clear about the Dao of bestowing and withholding, opening and closing, riding the moment and leveraging circumstances to subdue and employ the hearts of the people.\n\nOld commentary: Without impartiality, one cannot govern the myriad things; without timing and circumstance, one cannot employ the people.\n\nThe emperor embodies yin and yang, yet encroaches.\n\nOld commentary: This is the virtue of the Great One, the Dao of non-action.\n\nThe king models himself on the four seasons, yet pares away.\n\nOld commentary: This is the governance that equalizes punishments and rewards among the people.\n\nThe hegemon employs the six pitch-pipes, yet brings humiliation.\n\nWhen the ruler loses the plumb line, he is deposed.\n\nThus, to act greatly in small matters is to become isolated and estranged from one’s kin.\n\nOld commentary: This is the insufficiency of relying on wisdom and position.\n\nTo act small in great matters is to become narrow and unable to accommodate.\n\nOld commentary: This is the inability to apply virtue and power.\n\nWhy does the *Zuan Yi* speak not of the \"august\" but of the \"emperor,\" the \"king,\" the \"hegemon,\" and the \"lord\"? It is to honor the august. The emperor loses the Dao and then relies on virtue; the king loses virtue and then relies on benevolence; the hegemon loses benevolence and then relies on righteousness; the lord loses righteousness and then relies on ritual. When the great is established, the small is contained within; when the small is established, the great is lost.\n\nLaozi says: Vast lands and numerous people are not enough to make one strong.\n\nOld commentary: Losing the Dao, all become enemies.\n\nStrong armor and sharp weapons are not enough to ensure victory.\n\nOld commentary: Relying on victory leads to arrogance; arrogance leads to defeat.\n\nHigh walls and deep moats are not enough to make one secure.\n\nOld commentary: Security lies in virtue, not in peril.\n\nHarsh punishments and cruel killings are not enough to inspire awe.\n\nOld commentary: When kindness spreads, awe is established; when laws are severe, people rebel.\n\nIn governance that preserves, even the small must be preserved; in governance that destroys, even the great must perish. Thus, the skilled defender has none to resist him.\n\nOld commentary: He abides in governance that cannot be seized.\n\nThe skilled warrior has none to contend with.\n\nOld commentary: He exploits their anger to employ them.\n\nRiding the moment, leveraging circumstances, and following the people’s desires, the world submits.\n\nOld commentary: This is the way of Tang and Wu.\n\nThus, the skilled governor accumulates virtue; the skilled commander stores up anger. Accumulating virtue makes the people usable; storing up anger establishes awe. Where culture extends deeply, the sway of authority is great; where virtue is bestowed widely, the reach of power is broad.\n\nOld commentary: Cultivating civil virtue draws them in—then shields and spears become discarded objects.\n\nBroad reach makes me strong and the enemy weak. The skilled commander first weakens the enemy, then engages in battle.\n\nOld commentary: He rides the heart of all under Heaven.\n\nThus, the cost is halved, yet the achievement is tenfold. A state of a thousand chariots that practices civil virtue will become a king; a state of ten thousand chariots that delights in war will perish. The king’s army first secures victory, then battles.\n\nOld commentary: It always holds the calculation of certain victory—thus, it conducts campaigns without fighting.\n\nThe defeated army first battles, then seeks victory.\n\nOld commentary: Not knowing constancy, it abides in a position of certain defeat.\n\nThis is to be unclear about the Dao.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: One who practices civil virtue, though small, will surely be preserved; one who delights in war, though great, will surely perish. The skilled governor accumulates virtue; the skilled commander stores up anger. Only by knowing the root of warfare—to stop disorder and not cause it—will the people remain unharmed and the state endure long.\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Nine\n*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Wenzi Zuan Yi*\n\n**Imperial Annotated Four Books Repository**\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Ten\n*Chapter on Supreme Humaneness*\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of the noble person is tranquility for self-cultivation and frugality for nurturing life. Tranquility means not disturbing those below; not disturbing those below means the people do not resent. Disturbing those below means governance falls into chaos; the people’s resentment means virtue is thin. When governance is chaotic, the worthy do not offer counsel; when virtue is thin, the brave do not fight. A disordered ruler acts otherwise: possessing the wealth of the world and the power of a state, he exhausts the people’s strength to serve his sensory desires. His will is fixed on palaces, terraces, moats, ponds, parks, and menageries of fierce beasts and rare curiosities. The poor starve while tigers and wolves feast on fodder; the people freeze while the palace is clad in brocade. Thus, the ruler accumulates these useless things, and the world cannot preserve its nature.\n\nLaozi said: Without indifference, virtue cannot be clarified; without serenity, the distant cannot be attained; without magnanimity, all cannot be embraced; without impartiality, judgments cannot be made. Use the eyes of the world to see, the ears of the world to hear, the mind of the world to deliberate, and the strength of the world to contend. Thus, decrees penetrate below, and the sentiments of ministers rise above. The hundred officials are well-ordered, and the assembled ministers converge like spokes. Joy is not expressed through rewards, nor anger through punishments. Laws are clear yet not harsh; ears and eyes are keen yet not dim. The sentiments of good and ill are daily presented without obstruction. Thus, the worthy exhaust their wisdom, the unworthy exert their strength, those near are at ease in their nature, and those far cherish their virtue. This is the Dao of employing people.\n\nOne who rides a carriage and horse does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*; one who boards a boat and oar does not swim yet crosses rivers and seas. If words are correct, though spoken by a woodcutter or grass-gatherer, they cannot be discarded. If words are incorrect, though spoken by a ruler, minister, or high official, they cannot be used. Right and wrong cannot be judged by nobility or baseness, honor or humility. If a plan is usable, one need not be ashamed of one’s position; if words are practicable, one need not value their eloquence.\n\nA benighted ruler acts otherwise: among his assembled ministers, those who offer sincere loyalty are rarely employed, while those who curry favor with the crooked are drawn near. The worthy cannot be seen; the distant and lowly, though they exhaust their strength in loyalty, cannot be heard. Those who speak are silenced with sophistry; those who remonstrate are punished with crimes. Wishing thus to pacify the realm and preserve the myriad regions, he distances himself ever further from clarity and wisdom.\n\nLaozi said: One who values life, though rich and noble, does not harm the body with indulgence; though poor and lowly, does not burden the form with profit. Now, inheriting the hereditary rank of one’s ancestors, one must esteem the loss of it—life’s origin is long-established, yet one lightly discards it. Is this not delusion? He who governs the world by honoring the self entrusts the world; he who governs the world by cherishing the self commits the world.\n\nWenzi asked about the root of governing the state. Laozi said: The root lies in governing the self. Never has one whose self is well-governed ruled a disordered state; never has one whose self is disordered ruled a well-governed state. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. The subtlety of the Dao is such that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nWenzi asked: What conduct makes the people cherish their superiors? Laozi said: Employ them in due season and treat them with reverence and caution, as if standing at the edge of a deep abyss or treading on thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good are my charges; the not-good are my enemies. In ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang turned against their foes Jie and Zhou to serve Tang and Wu; the people of Susha attacked their own lord and submitted to Shennong. Thus, what people fear cannot but be feared.\n\nLaozi said: He who governs the great cannot act small; he who rules vast lands cannot impose narrow constraints; he whose position is lofty cannot be troubled by trifles; he who governs the multitude cannot be harsh in teaching. Affairs are cumbersome and difficult to govern; laws are strict and difficult to enforce. Seeking much is difficult to sustain. Measuring by inches to reach a *zhang* will surely err; weighing by *zhu* to reach a *dan* will surely exceed. The *dan*-scale and *zhang*-measure are straightforward and seldom err; the general outline is easy to grasp. Clever sophistry is difficult to fathom, yet it brings no benefit to governance but only to disorder. The sage does not act thus; what brings no benefit to use but only to waste, the wise do not pursue. Thus, achievements do not disdain simplicity; affairs do not disdain frugality; seeking does not disdain scarcity. Simple achievements are easy to accomplish; frugal affairs are easy to govern; scarce seeking is easy to sustain. Entrusting tasks to the multitude is easy. Thus, petty disputation harms righteousness; petty righteousness breaks the Dao. A narrow Dao cannot be unimpeded; unimpededness must be simple. The Yellow River winds yet reaches far; mountains rise gradually yet attain height; the Dao wanders yet transforms. One who is skilled in a single craft, precise in a single matter, or discerning in a single ability may excel in a narrow scope but cannot respond broadly.\n\nOne who tunes strings makes the small tight and the large loose; one who establishes affairs makes the lowly labor and the noble rest. The words of the Dao say: Vast and obscure, it follows heaven’s majesty, shares its *qi* with heaven. Those who share *qi* with heaven become emperors; those who share righteousness become kings; those who share achievements become hegemons. Those who share none perish. Thus, without speaking, there is trust; without acting, there is benevolence; without anger, there is awe—this is the movement of heaven’s heart. Acting with benevolence, speaking with trust, and displaying anger with awe—this is the work of utmost sincerity. Acting without benevolence, speaking without trust, and displaying anger without awe—this is the work of outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the Dao to govern, few laws suffice for order; without the Dao to govern, many laws suffice for chaos.\n\nLaozi said: When the whale loses water, it is controlled by ants; when the ruler abandons his proper role and contends with ministers over affairs, he is controlled by his officials. One who holds position and duty through non-action listens and follows, taking compliance from his subordinates. If ministers conceal their wisdom and do not use it, instead monopolizing affairs, the ruler who does not employ ability but delights in acting himself will find his wisdom daily obstructed and bear responsibility alone. When his plans are exhausted below, he cannot extend governance; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control. If wisdom is insufficient for governance and awe insufficient for punishment, he cannot engage with the world.\n\nWhen joy and anger appear in the heart and desires manifest outwardly, those who hold office depart from rectitude to flatter their superiors; officials bend the law to follow the wind. Rewards do not match merit; punishments do not fit crimes. Thus, superiors and subordinates grow estranged, ruler and ministers resent each other, the hundred officials are troubled and confused, and wisdom cannot resolve it. Praise and blame arise, yet clarity cannot illuminate. If one does not reflect on one’s own faults but instead blames others, the ruler labors ever more while ministers grow ever more idle. This is like replacing the master carpenter’s adze—few who do so avoid injuring their hands.\n\nWhen racing a horse, even if one’s sinews snap, one cannot catch up. Mounting a chariot, grasping the reins, the horse submits to the crossbar—Bo Le appraises it, Wang Liang drives it, and a enlightened ruler rides it, achieving a thousand *li* without the toil of driving or guiding. This is the excellence of relying on others’ abilities.\n\nThe Dao of the ruler is to achieve without acting, to accomplish without preferences. Where there is action, there is debate; where there is preference, there is flattery. Debate can be seized; flattery can be seduced. Those who establish yet are controlled by others cannot hold the state. Thus, the wise establish without guarding against words, for what is established has no form.\n\nOnly in spiritual transformation can nothing overcome things. When inner desires do not leak out, it is called \"bolting the inner\"; when external perversities do not enter, it is called \"closing the outer.\" With inner bolted and outer closed, what affair is not moderated? With outer closed and inner bolted, what affair is not accomplished? Thus, without employing, there is employment; without acting, there is action. Without boasting of words, without seizing affairs, one follows names to demand realities, allowing ministers to act on their own. Taking ignorance as the Dao and forbidding harshness as the principle, all officials’ duties are thus examined.\n\nLaozi said: \"Food is the people’s root; the people are the state’s foundation.\" Thus, the ruler follows the heavens above, exhausts the earth below, and employs human effort in between. Thereby, all living things grow, and the myriad beings flourish. In spring, withered branches are pruned; in summer, fruits are gathered; in autumn, vegetables are stored; in winter, firewood is collected—these sustain the people’s livelihood. Without them, the living have no use, and the dead leave no corpse.\n\nThe laws of the former kings did not cover flocks to take the young, did not drain marshes to fish, did not burn forests to hunt. Before the jackals’ sacrifice, nets were not set in the wild; before the otters’ sacrifice, fishing nets did not enter the waters; before hawks struck, snares were not spread on the marshes. Before plants withered, axes did not enter the mountains and forests; before insects hibernated, fire was not used in the fields. Pregnant creatures were not killed; fledglings were not taken; fish under a foot long were not caught; pigs and dogs under a year old were not eaten. Thus, the sprouting of the myriad things was like steam rising from *qi*.\n\nThis was how the former kings responded to the seasons, cultivated preparations, enriched the state, and benefited the people—yet not by seeing with their eyes and acting with their feet. In seeking to benefit the people, they did not forget...\n\nThe heart thus readied, the people naturally prepared themselves. Laozi said: In ancient times, enlightened rulers took from the people with restraint and maintained their own sustenance with moderation. They necessarily calculated the year’s harvest and measured the people’s stores, knowing the surplus and deficiency. Only then did they take their due. Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed and avoided the calamity of hunger and cold. Their compassion for the people was such that if the state suffered famine, they did not indulge in rich flavors; if the people endured cold, they did not wear furs in winter. Sharing in the people’s joys and sorrows, the realm knew no grieving subjects nor benighted rulers.\n\nOtherwise, they took from the people without sparing their strength, demanded without measuring their stores. Men and women could not attend to plowing and weaving, yet still had to meet the ruler’s demands. Their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted, they lived from dawn to dusk in want. Now, a single man plowing with his foot could till no more than ten *mu*. The yield of middling fields did not exceed four *shi*. His wife and children, the old and weak, depended on this for food. Should disaster strike, there would be nothing to meet the ruler’s demands—then the lord would pity them.\n\nGreedy rulers and violent lords drained their people to satisfy boundless desires, so the common folk could not receive Heaven’s harmony or tread Earth’s virtue. Laozi said: Of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, none is greater than harmony. Harmony is the balance of yin and yang, the division of day and night. Thus, all things are born at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Birth and maturation must attain the essence of harmony. Excess yin does not generate; excess yang does not transform. Only when yin and yang unite can harmony be achieved. Therefore, the sage’s Way is lenient yet firm, stern yet warm, yielding yet upright, fierce yet benevolent. Too rigid, it snaps; too pliant, it coils. The Way lies precisely between rigidity and pliability.\n\nThe carpenter’s line can be coiled and stored, drawn out and stretched straight, laid out long without warping, kept short without constraint, straight yet not rigid—thus the sage embodies it. If kindness is overindulged, weakness follows; weakness lacks awe. If severity is overindulged, cruelty follows; cruelty lacks harmony. If love is overindulged, license follows; license lacks command. If punishment is overindulged, calamity follows; calamity severs ties. Thus, harmony is prized.\n\nLaozi said: A state endures because it attains the Way; it perishes because its principles are obstructed. Therefore, the sage observes transformations to discern their signs. Virtue waxes and wanes, and the winds of change appear first as sprouts. Those who attain the Way of life, though small, must grow great. Those who bear the signs of ruin, though established, must fail. A state’s demise lies not in its size but in the loss of the Way; its survival lies not in its smallness but in attaining the Way. Thus, the rulers of disordered states pursue territorial expansion but not benevolence and righteousness, seek high rank but not the Way and virtue. They abandon what ensures survival and create what ensures ruin.\n\nIf above, they disrupt the radiance of the Three Luminaries, and below, they lose the hearts of the myriad people, who could not bear it? Thus, he who examines himself need not prepare against others. The ancients who ruled deeply called it the Way and virtue; those who ruled shallowly called it benevolence and righteousness; those who ruled superficially called it ritual and wisdom. These six are the guiding principles of the state. Deep practice brings profound blessings; shallow practice brings meager blessings. Those who practice them fully win the submission of all under Heaven.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating the Way and virtue rectified all under Heaven; cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a single state; cultivating ritual and wisdom rectified a single village. Profound virtue is great; shallow virtue is small. Thus, rank is not established by might, victory is not won by hardness, and attainment is not gained by greed and contention. To stand in the world, extend the self; to prevail in the world, humble the self; to gain the world, yield to it—it does not lie in seizing for oneself. Thus, the female and the yielding stand firm; the soft and weak prevail. With benevolence and righteousness, one attains; without contention, none can contend. Thus, the Way in the world is like the rivers and seas.\n\nHeaven’s Way: to act is to fail; to grasp is to lose. Those who seek great fame and contend for it, I see them not attaining it. Even if they grasp and obtain it, it does not endure. Fame cannot be sought and gained; it is bestowed by the world. What the world bestows is virtue. Thus, the highest virtue wins the world’s submission; the highest benevolence wins the submission of all within the seas; the highest righteousness wins the submission of a state; the highest ritual wins the submission of a village. Without these four, the people do not submit. Without submission, to resort to arms is perilous.\n\nThus, arms are inauspicious instruments, used only when unavoidable. To kill and wound, though victorious, is not to be glorified. Thus, it is said: Where death reigns, thorns grow. Mourn with sorrow, dwell in mourning rites. Therefore, the noble man devotes himself to the Way and virtue, not prizing the use of arms.\n\nWenzi asked: Why are benevolence, righteousness, and ritual considered inferior to the Way and virtue? Laozi said: Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy; those who practice righteousness must clarify taking and giving. Within the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal; the wealth of the treasury cannot suffice to provide for the myriad people. Thus, it is known that cultivating the Way and practicing virtue, following the nature of Heaven and Earth, all things rectify themselves and the world is provided for. Benevolence and righteousness are but adjuncts.\n\nTherefore, the great man dwells in profundity, not in shallowness. Ritual is the ornament of reality; benevolence is the effect of kindness. Thus, ritual is established according to human feelings, not exceeding reality. Benevolence does not exceed kindness. Sorrow embraces emotion; sending off the dead accords with benevolence. Nurturing life does not compel what people cannot reach; it does not sever what people cannot cease. Measures and standards do not lose their appropriateness. Without praise or blame, no cause arises.\n\nThus, music is made sufficient to unite joy, not exceeding harmony. It clarifies the distinction between life and death, accommodates the appropriateness of extravagance and frugality. In later ages, it was otherwise: words contradicted deeds; emotions opposed appearances. Ritual became ornate with excess; music disturbed with licentiousness. Customs drowned in worldliness; praise and blame converged in the court. Thus, the perfected man was abandoned and unused.\n\nTo race a thoroughbred on foot, man cannot outrun it; to place it in a chariot, the thoroughbred cannot outrun man. Thus, those who skillfully employ the Way ride the people’s resources to establish merit, entrusting what they can do to what they cannot. The lord bestows in due season, and the people repay with wealth. The lord treats them with ritual, and the people repay with their lives. Thus, there are endangered states but no secure rulers; anxious lords but no joyful ministers.\n\nVirtue exceeding rank brings honor; emoluments exceeding virtue bring misfortune. Esteeming virtue without exalting it, valuing righteousness without excess—those who exalt without virtue usurp rank; those who take without righteousness steal wealth. The sage is content in poverty, delights in the Way, does not harm life with desires, nor burden the self with profit. Thus, he does not violate righteousness to take wantonly.\n\nIn ancient times, none without virtue were honored; none without ability were appointed; none without merit were rewarded; none without guilt were punished. In advancing people...\n\nIn dismissing people, employ ritual; in the age of petty men, in advancing people, employ righteousness. When the superior dismisses people, it is like casting them into an abyss; when speaking of the ancients, it is with urgency for the present. In selecting horses, one errs by favoring the lean; in choosing officers, one errs by favoring the poor. A plump pig fills the kitchen, but its bones, though fine, are not appointed to office. The gentleman examines reality and does not trust slander. When the lord errs and is not admonished, it is not the loyal minister; when admonished and not heeded, the lord is not enlightened. When the people are drowning in distress and not grieved, it is not the worthy lord. Thus, to uphold integrity and die for difficulty is the duty of a minister; to clothe the cold and feed the hungry is the kindness of a compassionate father.\n\nTo serve the great with the small is called adapting to others; to offend the great with the small is called defying Heaven. Though one may ascend to Heaven before, one must inevitably plunge into the abyss. Thus, in villages and hamlets, the elderly are honored by age; in the court, the noble are distinguished by rank. Those who exalt the honored do so because they draw near to the lord; those who respect the elderly do so because they draw near to kin; those who revere their elders do so because they draw near to their elder brothers. Those born to nobility grow arrogant; those born to wealth grow extravagant. Thus, few among the rich and noble, who do not illuminate the Way and examine themselves, can avoid wrongdoing.\n\nTo learn without weariness is how one cultivates the self; to teach without fatigue is how one governs the people. Few who abandon worthy teachers and good friends commit wrongdoing. To recognize worthiness is called wisdom; to love worthiness is called benevolence; to honor benevolence is called righteousness; to respect worthiness is called ritual; to delight in worthiness is called music. Those who were good at governing the world in ancient times practiced non-action yet nothing was left undone.\n\nThus, in governing the world, one who is tolerant can gain tolerance; one who practices non-action can achieve merit. Without tolerance, all actions lead to misfortune. One who is tolerant in governing the world is cautious, as if crossing a great river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing the four neighbors; solemn, as if a guest; melting, as if ice dissolving; simple, as if uncarved wood; turbid, as if muddy water; vast, as if a valley.\n\nTo be cautious as if crossing a great river in winter is to dare not act rashly. To be hesitant as if fearing the four neighbors is to fear self-injury. To be solemn as if a guest is to be modest and reverent. To be melting as if ice dissolving is to dare not hoard. To be simple as if uncarved wood is to dare not claim refinement. To be turbid as if muddy water is to dare not seek clarity. To be vast as if a valley is to dare not be full and overflowing.\n\nOne who dares not act rashly in advancing will not dare to take the lead in retreating. One who fears self-injury guards softness and weakness and does not dare to be proud. One who is modest and reverent humbles the self and respects others. One who dares not hoard diminishes the self and does not dare to be steadfast. One who dares not claim refinement diminishes the self and does not dare to be complete. One who dares not seek clarity dwells in turbidity and disgrace and does not dare to be fresh and pure. One who dares not be full and overflowing sees insufficiency and does not dare to consider the self worthy.\n\nThus, the Dao retreats and so can advance; it guards softness and weakness and so can be proud; it humbles the self and so can be exalted; it diminishes the self and so is truly steadfast; it diminishes and is incomplete and so can be complete; it dwells in turbidity and disgrace and so can be fresh and pure; it sees insufficiency and so can be worthy. The Dao practices non-action yet nothing is left undone.\n\n*Wenzi, \"Weaving the Meanings,\" Scroll Ten*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n**Wenzi, \"Weaving the Meanings,\" Scroll Eleven**\n*On the Supreme Principle*\n*Composed by Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\nLaozi said: In all learning, one who can clarify the distinction between Heaven and man, comprehend the root of order and chaos, purify the mind and settle the intent to preserve it, perceive its beginning and end, and return to emptiness and nothingness—this may be called attainment.\n\nThe root of governance is benevolence and righteousness; its branches are laws and institutions. What gives rise to man is the root; what does not give rise to him is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet their nature is to love both. He who puts the root first is a noble person; he who puts the branch first is a petty person. Laws arise to assist righteousness. To value laws while abandoning righteousness is like prizing one’s cap and shoes while forgetting one’s head and feet.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness are vast and lofty. To diminish their depth while expanding their breadth is to invite ruin. To not broaden the foundation while increasing the height is to court collapse. Thus, without a great ridgepole, one cannot bear heavy burdens. Nothing bears weight like the ridgepole; nothing sustains the state like virtue. The ruler’s possession of the people is like a city’s possession of its foundation or a tree’s possession of its roots: when the roots run deep, the base is firm; when the foundation is thick, the heights are secure. Therefore, affairs not rooted in the Dao and virtue cannot serve as enduring principles. Words not aligned with the former kings cannot serve as the Way. To seize upon a single practice and claim it as a universal method is not the universal Dao of the world.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: \"On the Supreme Principle\" clarifies the distinction between Heaven and man and comprehends the root of order and chaos. Governance has root and branch; knowing what to prioritize brings one close to the Dao and virtue. How can such methods govern the world?\n\nLaozi said: The way of governing people is like Zaofu driving a team of four horses. He harmonizes them with the reins and bit, aligns them with the chest and breast, inwardly attains the center of the mind, and outwardly accords with the horses’ intent. Thus, he can traverse the Way and reach distant places, with strength to spare. Advancing and retreating, turning and curving—nothing fails to conform to his will. Truly, he has mastered the method.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the ruler’s team of four horses. The body cannot depart from the comfort of the chariot; the hand cannot lose the horses’ hearts. If the team of four is not harmonized, even Zaofu cannot traverse the Way. If ruler and ministers are not in accord, even a sage cannot bring about order. Holding to the Dao to govern them, even those of middling talent can fully understand. Making divisions clear to them, treachery and deceit can be halted. When things arrive, observe their changes; when affairs come, respond to their transformations. If those near are not disordered, those far will be governed. Without relying on arbitrary teachings, one attains the natural Dao. In ten thousand actions, nothing is lost.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: Heaven and earth are one horse; the myriad things are one finger. The sage’s utmost understanding of things compares the chariot to power and authority and the team of four to great ministers. The ruler thereby rides them without exhausting wisdom or strength, and no distance remains unsubdued. This is the method of governance. How can one speak of governing with those who merely grasp the reins?\n\nLaozi said: In all who practice the Dao, block the paths of depravity and guard against what has not yet arisen. Do not value self-righteousness; value the inability to do wrong. Thus it is said: Do not allow what can be desired, lest there be daily seeking; do not allow what can be seized, lest there be daily contention. In this way, human desires dissolve and the public Dao prevails. Those with surplus stop at the measure; those with insufficiency reach the use. Thus, the world can be unified.\n\nTo abandon duties and heed slander and praise, to discard merit and employ cliques—then extraordinary skills flee, and those who guard their posts do not advance. Customs are disordered within the state; meritorious ministers contend within the court. Therefore, with the Dao, one governs others; without the Dao, one is controlled by others.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: A good physician does not treat an illness after it has arisen but treats what has not yet fallen ill. One who practices the Dao blocks the paths of depravity and governs what has not yet arisen—is this not what the good physician means? Thus, do not value self-righteousness; value not doing wrong. Then there will be no seeking of what can be desired, no contention over what can be seized. Therefore, with the Dao, one can govern others; without the Dao, one is controlled by others.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the state, there is a constant: benefiting the people is the root. In government and teaching, there is a Dao: commands must be carried out. If it benefits the people, one need not follow antiquity; if it suits the matter, one need not adhere to custom. Thus, the sage’s laws change with the times; rites transform with customs. Clothing, utensils, and tools each suit their use; laws, institutions, and commands each fit their circumstances. Therefore, changing antiquity cannot be condemned, nor can following custom be overpraised.\n\nReciting the former kings’ books is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping what gave rise to their words. What gave rise to their words is that which words cannot express. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Therefore, what the sage follows is called the Dao—like metal and stone, once tuned, it cannot be altered. Affairs are like the zither and lute: when a melody ends, the tuning changes. Laws, institutions, rites, and music are the tools of governance, not governance itself. Thus, one of limited understanding cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao, for he is awakened by custom and bound by teaching.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: The Dao is the substance of laws; laws are the function of the Dao. That governance has a constant and benefits the people as its root is the Dao. Government and teaching are the Dao, and commands must be carried out—this is the law. The sage’s laws change with the times; rites transform with customs. Laws, institutions, and commands each fit their circumstances. Thus, one of limited understanding cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao, for he is bound by teaching.\n\nLaozi said: Does the world possess constant laws? One must be appropriate to the affairs of the age, accord with human principles, follow the Heavenly Dao, and be detailed in spirit and gods—then one can rightly govern.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns had no decrees, yet the people followed; the Five Emperors had decrees but no punishments. The Xia dynasty did not break its word; the Yin people swore oaths; the Zhou people made covenants. In the decline of later ages, people endured disgrace and slighted shame, coveted gain and lacked modesty. Therefore, laws, institutions, and commands assess customs and moderate urgency and ease. Tools and implements adapt to changes in the times and suit what is appropriate.\n\nThose constrained by laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those bound by rites cannot respond to change. One must possess unique insight and singular hearing, then one can act with the Dao. He who knows the origin of laws responds to the times and changes; he who does not know the source of governance, though he follows, will ultimately cause disorder.\n\nNow, scholars follow the past, inherit practices, grasp texts, and uphold written laws, wishing to govern—this is like forcing a square peg into a round hole. To seek what is fitting is also difficult.\n\nIn preserving danger and governing chaos, even the wise cannot foresee; in praising antiquity, even the foolish have more than enough. Therefore, the sage does not employ unused laws.\n\nUnverified words the enlightened ruler does not heed. The sages established laws to prohibit evil, redress grievances, and protect the people. The Three Sovereigns had no decrees, but from the Five Emperors onward, the laws and ordinances, rewards and punishments they instituted differed with each era—such were the changes of the times. How could the enlightened ruler fail to investigate this?\n\nWenzi asked: \"From whence do laws arise?\"\nLaozi said: \"Laws arise from *yi* (rightness); *yi* arises from what suits the multitude, conforming to the human heart. This is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from heaven, nor do they emerge from the earth. They arise among men, returning to self-correction and sincerity to reach their root, not disordering their branches. Knowing the essential, one is not confused by doubts. What one possesses oneself, one does not condemn in others; what one lacks oneself, one does not demand of them. What is established below is not abolished above; what is forbidden to the people is not violated by oneself. Thus, when the ruler enacts laws, he first uses himself as the model. If prohibitions prevail over his own person, then his commands will be obeyed by the people.\"\n\nTo continue: *Yi* means \"fitting.\" The former kings established laws to suit the conditions of the multitude, thus first using themselves as the model. What they forbade the people, they dared not violate themselves. Therefore, their commands were carried out, and all under heaven followed.\n\nNow, the law is the plumb line of all under heaven, the measure of the ruler. To suspend the law is to make the law lawless. Once the law is fixed, those who meet the line are rewarded; those who fall short are punished. Though noble and exalted, one does not lightly bestow rewards; though lowly and base, one does not heavily impose punishments. Those who violate the law, though worthy, are surely punished; those who meet the measure, though unworthy, incur no guilt. Thus, the public Way prevails, and private desires are blocked.\n\nThe ancients appointed officials to restrain the people from wantonness; they established rulers to control the officials from acting arbitrarily. Laws, standards, the Way, and techniques exist to restrain the ruler from overreaching. When none can act wantonly, the Dao prevails, and principle is attained. Thus, one returns to non-action. Non-action does not mean inactivity; it means that all proceeds from oneself.\n\nTo continue: The law is the ruler’s measure, the plumb line for all under heaven. Once the law is fixed, there is no duality in its application. Those who violate the law, though noble, are surely punished; those who meet the measure, though base, incur no guilt. Thus, private desires are blocked, and the public Way prevails. In ancient times, the appointment of officials, the establishment of rulers, and the institution of rites and laws—if these three were not abolished, the world had no resentful people, and the age could return to simplicity. What need was there for laws and commands?\n\nLaozi said: \"The skilled rewarder spends little yet encourages much; the skilled punisher uses few penalties yet prohibits evil. The skilled giver employs restraint yet bestows virtue; the skilled taker receives much yet incurs no resentment. Thus, the sage follows what the people favor to encourage goodness and follows what they detest to prohibit evil. Rewarding one, all under heaven rushes to follow; punishing one, all under heaven stands in awe. Therefore, the utmost reward costs nothing, and the utmost punishment is not excessive. The sage governs broadly through restraint—this is what is meant.\"\n\nTo continue: Growth and killing, storing and concealing—these are the ways of heaven. Reward and punishment, giving and taking—these are the ways of man. The sage models himself on the Way of heaven and follows the hearts of the people to establish the foundation of good governance. He who possesses all under heaven, mastering these four handles in every matter to the utmost, rewards one, and all under heaven turns to him; punishes one, and all under heaven stands in awe.\n\nLaozi said: \"The way of the minister is to discuss matters and act appropriately, taking the lead in affairs, upholding his duties, and clarifying his responsibilities to achieve success. If ruler and minister follow different ways, there is order; if they follow the same way, there is chaos. Each attains what is fitting and occupies his proper place, so that above and below have means to employ one another.\n\nThus, the branch cannot exceed the trunk, nor the tip surpass the root. There must be a means to regulate light and heavy, great and small. He who attains power and influence holds little yet entrusts much, guards sparingly yet controls broadly. A tree ten spans around supports a house of a thousand *jun*—this is attaining the proper leverage. A bolt five inches long can control opening and closing—this is occupying the crucial point. Commands that must be obeyed bring benefit to those who comply and harm to those who resist. All under heaven heeds them because they are in accord. Issuing orders and enforcing prohibitions relies on the power of the multitude.\n\nRightness does not mean benefiting all the people under heaven; it benefits one, and all under heaven follows. Tyranny does not mean harming all within the seas; it harms one, and all under heaven rebels. Thus, the raising and abolishing, the establishment and removal of measures must be carefully considered.\"\n\nTo continue: The ruler stands by relying on his ministers; the ministers act by relying on the ruler. The ruler practices non-action above; the ministers act below. Discussing matters and acting appropriately, upholding duties and clarifying responsibilities—these are the affairs of ministers. When ruler and minister each attain what is fitting, above and below have means to employ one another, great and small have means to regulate one another. If they follow different ways, there is order; if they follow the same way, there is chaos. The raising and abolishing, the establishment and removal of measures bear on order and disorder. The ruler cannot but be careful.\n\nLaozi said: \"Yield an inch to extend a foot; bend slightly to straighten greatly. The sage acts thus. Now, when the ruler evaluates his ministers, if he does not consider their great achievements but tallies their minor conduct and seeks petty virtues, he loses the way of valuing the worthy. Thus, one with profound virtue should not be questioned about minor faults; one with great renown should not be criticized for small flaws. For human nature is such that none is without shortcomings; what matters is achieving the great outline. Even if there are minor faults, they are not enough to be a burden. If one fails to achieve the great outline, even village conduct is not enough to praise. Thus, the overly cautious achieve no great success, and those with flawed conduct are not tolerated by the multitude. The great in stature have relaxed standards; the vast in measure have far-reaching reputations. This is the way to evaluate ministers.\"\n\nTo continue: Complete talent is rarely found, and this has been so since ancient times. The master builder seeking ridgepoles and beams does not cling to minor flaws, so great timber can be obtained. If the ruler evaluating his ministers and aides knows to yield an inch to extend a foot, then great worthies can be obtained. For no person is perfect, and no affair is flawless. Taking the great and discarding the small, what achievement cannot be accomplished? Following the long and setting aside the short, what matter cannot be resolved?\n\nLaozi said: From ancient times to the present, there has never been one whose conduct was entirely flawless. Thus, the noble person does not demand perfection from any single individual. Square yet not cutting, sharp yet not wounding, upright yet not unrestrained, broadly learned yet not disparaging—this is the Way of moral and martial virtue, not demanding perfection from others. Cultivating oneself through the Dao and not imposing demands on others is easily repaid. Cultivating oneself through the Dao leaves no fault.\n\nThe jade tablet of the Xia dynasty could not be without flaw, nor could the luminous moon-pearl be without blemish, yet the world treasures them, not allowing minor defects to mar great beauty. Now, those who fixate on others’ shortcomings and forget their strengths will find it difficult to seek worthies throughout the world. The common view—judging by lowly position, humble status, or base and shameful deeds—fails to grasp the greater pattern. Thus, the way to evaluate others is this: when prosperous, observe what they promote; when wealthy, observe what they bestow; when impoverished, observe what they refuse; when lowly, observe what they decline to do. Observe how they conduct themselves in difficulty to know their courage, how they act in joy to gauge their steadfastness, how they respond when entrusted with wealth to discern their benevolence, and how they react when shaken by fear to measure their integrity. In this way, the true nature of a person may be known.\n\nTo continue: Those who excuse themselves do not correct their faults; those who blame others do not preserve their relationships. The noble person does not demand perfection from others, knowing that not even Yao or Shun could make every matter entirely good. If a person possesses great talent, how can one discard them for minor flaws?\n\nLaozi said: To bend is to seek extension; to yield is to seek uprightness. To yield an inch is to extend a foot; a small yielding brings great uprightness. The noble person acts thus. All rivers flow to the sea—those that do not are not valleys. Those who take divergent paths do not return to goodness—they are not noble persons. Good words are valued for their practicability; good deeds are valued for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble person’s faults are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not diminish their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act recklessly, and the brave do not kill without cause. Choosing what is right and acting with deliberation, proceeding with due measure—this is how affairs are accomplished and merits are made reliable, how one’s name endures even after death. Though one may possess wisdom and ability, these must be rooted in benevolence and righteousness to stand firm. The sage takes benevolence and righteousness as the standard: those who meet it are called noble persons; those who do not are called petty persons. Even if a noble person dies, their name does not perish; even if a petty person gains power, their guilt is not erased.\n\nOne who grasps the map of the world in the left hand and cuts their own throat with the right—even a fool would not do this, for the body is more precious than the world. One who faces death for their lord or parents regards it as a homecoming, for righteousness is weightier than life. Thus, the greatest good in the world is compared to the body, and the body is deemed small; the body is compared to benevolence and righteousness, and it is deemed light. This is the standard of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTo continue: The principle of yielding and extending is this: the noble person endures a small yielding to achieve great uprightness, like the hibernation and resurgence of dragons and serpents. Good words and good deeds nourish all living things, all arising from humbling oneself and cultivating virtue. The sage takes benevolence and righteousness as the standard, knowing that the body is weightier than the world and righteousness weightier than the body. Thus, they can face death for their lord or parents. This is why the noble person’s name does not fade even after death.\n\nLaozi said: The completeness of the Dao and virtue is like the sun and moon. Even among the Yi, Di, Man, and Mo peoples, none can alter its essence. Whether praised or blamed in custom, whether one’s conduct is uniform or not, whether one is in poverty or success depends on the times. When one’s affairs align with the world, merit is accomplished; when one’s tasks accord with the times, one’s name is established. Thus, those who establish merit and fame are discerning about the world and cautious about the times. When the moment arrives, not even a breath can be spared.\n\nThe ancients who waged war did not covet land or treasure but sought to preserve life, pacify disorder, and eliminate harm for the people. Those who are greedy, rapacious, and full of desire bring calamity to the world, stirring the myriad people into turmoil, leaving none at peace. The sage rises resolutely to punish the strong and violent, pacify a disordered age, and eliminate harm for the world—turning turbidity into clarity, peril into peace. Thus, they cannot but act decisively.\n\nTo continue: Human morality is like the sun and moon of Heaven; the five human natures are like the five stars of Heaven. Even among the Yi, Di, Man, and Mo, none can alter them. Whether one advances or retreats lies with oneself; whether one is praised or blamed lies with others. Whether one is employed or not depends on the times; whether one’s conduct succeeds or fails rests with fate. Thus, the noble person, when the time comes to practice the Dao, does not spare even a breath.\n\nThe Red Emperor brought fire disaster, so the Yellow Emperor captured him. Gonggong brought water harm, so Zhuanxu executed him. They instructed through the Dao and guided through virtue, but if they did not listen, they confronted them with martial might. If they still did not submit, they subdued them with arms. To kill innocent people and sustain an unrighteous lord—what harm could be greater? To exhaust the world’s wealth to satisfy one person’s desires—what calamity could be deeper? To indulge one person’s desires and prolong suffering throughout the world—this is something Heaven’s principles do not permit.\n\nThe purpose of establishing a ruler is to suppress violence and disorder.\n\nNow, riding upon the strength of the myriad people, they instead become cruel oppressors—this is like giving wings to a tiger; why should they not be removed? Those who keep fish must remove otters and eels; those who raise birds and beasts must eliminate jackals and wolves. How much more so for those who shepherd the people? Thus, the rise of arms and armor has its reasons.\n\nThe succession of virtue and the cycles of the Five Phases in the state have endured since antiquity. In the Fire Phase of the Red Emperor, when the ruler lost his virtue, fire became a disaster. In the Water Phase of Gonggong, when the ruler lost his virtue, water became a disaster. From this, we know that when a ruler loses virtue, disasters arise in accordance with the phase. How can any lord of the land lose virtue, invite calamity, and remain unaware or unrepentant?\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of governing a state is this—above, there are no harsh decrees; officials are not overburdened with governance; scholars do not act with deceit; artisans do not craft excessive finery. Affairs are managed without disturbance, tools are kept whole without ornamentation. In a disordered age, it is otherwise: those who act vie to outdo one another in loftiness; those who observe ritual compete in ostentation. Chariots and carriages are carved to excess; vessels and utensils are engraved beyond measure. Those who seek wealth contend over what is rare, prizing it as treasure; those who indulge in rhetoric chase after complexity, deeming it urgency. Scholars engage in deceptive argument, prolonging disputes without resolution, bringing no benefit to order but only to chaos. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete them, yet they serve no practical use.\n\nThus, the laws of Shennong state: If able-bodied men do not farm, the world will suffer hunger; if women in their prime do not weave, the world will suffer cold. Therefore, he himself tilled the fields, and his wife herself wove, setting the example for all under heaven. They did not value rare goods or esteem useless objects. Thus, if farmers did not exert themselves, they could not sustain life; if weavers did not labor, they could not clothe the body. Surplus and deficiency each returned to the self. With clothing and food abundant, deceit and wickedness did not arise; with peace and ease prevailing, the world was harmonious. The wise had no need to deploy their defenses; the brave had no occasion to display their might.\n\nThe succession of virtue shows that the Dao of governance differs between ancient and modern times because customs have changed. The ancients were simple and honest: above, there were no harsh decrees; officials were not overburdened; scholars did not act with deceit; artisans did not craft excessive finery. Thus, the people’s hearts were easily satisfied, and governance was not difficult. In later ages, customs shifted, winds changed, and the example set above was followed below. Extravagance was esteemed, and greed knew no bounds. Thus, the people’s hearts were hard to satisfy, and governance became arduous.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of hegemons and kings relies on planning and foresight, acting with righteousness—not to secure survival, but to preserve or end it. Thus, when they heard that the ruler of an enemy state was cruel and oppressive to his people, they would raise an army and advance to its borders, reproaching him for his unrighteousness and rebuking him for his misdeeds. When the army reached the outskirts, the commanders would issue orders: \"Do not fell trees, do not dig up graves, do not ruin the five grains, do not burn stored grain, do not seize the people, do not gather livestock.\" Then they would proclaim: \"The ruler of this state defies Heaven and Earth, insults the spirits, metes out unjust judgments, and slaughters the innocent. He is one whom Heaven condemns and the people revile. Our army has come to depose the unrighteous and enthrone the virtuous. Whoever dares defy the Dao of Heaven and disturb the people’s peace shall be put to death, and their clan exterminated. Those who yield by household shall be rewarded by household; those who yield by village shall be rewarded by village; those who yield by township shall be enfeoffed by township; those who yield by county shall be enfeoffed by county. If we conquer the state, we shall not harm its people. We shall depose its ruler, reform its governance, honor its outstanding scholars, exalt its worthy and good, relieve its orphans and widows, succor its poor, release its prisoners, and reward its meritorious. We shall open our granaries to feed them and store grain to sustain them. Our only fear is that they will not come to us.\"\n\nWhen a righteous army reaches the border, the enemy does not fight but surrenders. When an unrighteous army arrives, corpses lie strewn, blood flows, and battle is joined. Thus, those who fight for land cannot establish kingship; those who seek personal gain cannot achieve great deeds. Those who act for the sake of others receive widespread support; those who act for themselves are widely abandoned. What is supported by the many, though weak, must become strong; what is abandoned by the many, though great, must perish.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* comprises twelve chapters, arranged in three sections of four, wherein the rise and fall of former emperors, kings, and hegemons are recorded. In the age of hegemons, when one observes their words—not for securing survival but for restoring what is lost—the spirit of reviving what has declined and continuing what has been severed is vividly apparent. Compared to the unrighteous deeds of later ages, they are far removed.\n\nLaozi said: The highest righteousness is this—governing the state, ordering the realm within, practicing benevolence and righteousness, spreading virtue and bestowing kindness, establishing just laws, and blocking the path of evil. Ministers draw near, the people are harmonious, above and below are of one heart, and all officials unite in strength. The feudal lords submit to his might, and the four directions cherish his virtue. In the ancestral temple, he deliberates policies that repel enemies a thousand *li* away. When he issues commands, the world responds—this is the highest.\n\nWhen the land is vast, the people numerous, the ruler worthy, and the generals capable; when the state is rich and the army strong; when discipline is firm and orders clear—even if two evenly matched enemies face each other, before blades clash or arrows fly, the enemy flees. This is the next best.\n\nWhen one knows the suitability of the land, is familiar with the advantages of strategic passes, understands the shifts in harsh governance, and discerns the dynamics of battle formations; when blades cross and arrows rain down, the wounded are carried and the dead lie strewn for a thousand *li*, corpses littering the fields—this is the lowest form of righteousness.\n\nThe victory or defeat of an army lies in governance. When governance prevails and the people submit to their superiors, the army is strong and the people victorious. When governance fails and the people rebel against their superiors, the army is weak. Benevolence and righteousness suffice to win the hearts of the world’s people; deeds suffice to meet the world’s crises; selection and appointment suffice to win the hearts of worthy scholars; planning and foresight suffice to decide matters of weight and urgency—this is the Dao of the highest righteousness.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* on military strategy states: The first to act is the host; the one who responds is the guest. There is a saying in warfare: \"I dare not act as host but only as guest,\" meaning that armies should not be lightly raised. When there is no choice but to use them, acting with righteousness is best; pursuing a fleeing enemy is next; fighting is the lowest.\n\nLaozi said: A state becomes strong through the willingness of its people to die; the willingness to die arises from righteousness; righteousness is carried out through might. Thus, one commands with civility and unifies with martiality—this is called certain victory. Might and righteousness advance together—this is called certain strength. When blades clash and arrows fall like rain, yet the soldiers vie to be first, it is because rewards are certain and punishments clear. If the ruler regards his people as children, the people will serve him as a father, and he will rule the Four Seas. If the people regard their ruler as a father, they will rectify the world. If the ruler regards his people as younger brothers, they will be willing to die for him. If the people serve their ruler as an elder brother, they will be willing to perish for him. Thus, one cannot fight against enemies bound as father and son or brothers. Therefore, a righteous ruler internally cultivates governance to accumulate virtue, externally blocks evil to make his power clear, and examines the toil and ease of his people to know their hunger and satiety. When the day of battle arrives, they view death as a return home, for the ruler’s benevolence has reached them.\n\nTo govern the world through accumulated virtue follows the Dao—why resort to arms? Only when unavoidable. The armies of a strong state fight to the death because righteousness compels them. Yet how can a ruler who embodies the Dao bear to drive his people to death by relying on a strong state? When the ruler regards his people as children and the people serve him as a father, the virtuous ruler cultivates governance to amass virtue, and the state will naturally grow strong—a principle inherent in the world since antiquity.\n\n*Wenzi: Accumulated Virtue*, Scroll Eleven\n*Wenzi: Accumulated Virtue*, Scroll Twelve\nImperially Commissioned *Siku Quanshu*\n*On Ritual*, compiled by Du Daojian of the Song\n\nLaozi said: In high antiquity, the True Person breathed in harmony with yin and yang, and all living beings looked up to their virtue, aligning themselves with its harmony. In that era, governance operated in hidden subtlety, naturally forming a state of pure simplicity. Before this purity dispersed, the myriad things flourished in abundance. As the age declined, by the time of Fuxi, people dimly stirred, each seeking to abandon their childlike hearts and awaken to the realm between Heaven and Earth. Their virtue grew disordered and inconsistent. By the eras of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, they began to systematically order the world, establishing the norms of the four seasons and harmonizing yin and yang. Thus, the people stood in reverence, eager to support and obey, seeing and listening with devotion. Though governance was achieved, harmony was lost.\n\nBy the Xia and Yin dynasties, desires extended to external things, and intelligence was lured outward, causing the loss of the true nature of life. This spread to the Zhou dynasty, where simplicity dissolved, and purity scattered. The Dao was abandoned in favor of artifice; perilous virtue became conduct. Cunning and craft emerged, and those who mimicked the sages with clever learning sought to deceive the masses. They carved and adorned the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* to trade for fame and reputation, each desiring to enact their schemes, feigning compliance with the world while losing the fundamental root of the great origin. Thus, the world erected barriers against nature, and the decline of life’s essence has long been its gradual course.\n\nTherefore, the learning of the Perfect Person seeks to return the nature to nothingness and roam the mind in emptiness. The learning of the vulgar world plucks at virtue and seizes at nature, inwardly distressing the five viscera, recklessly acting, and exceeding wisdom to clamor for fame in the world—this is what the Perfect Person does not do. Plucking at virtue is self-display; seizing at nature is severing life. As for the Perfect Person, they settle the meaning of life and death and penetrate its continuity.\n\nThe principle of honor and disgrace is such that even if the whole world praises it, it does not increase encouragement; even if the whole world condemns it, it does not add to discouragement—this is grasping the essence of the supreme Dao.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, rulers wore their hair loose and without collars to govern the world. Their virtue gave life without killing, bestowed without seizing. The world did not conform in attire yet shared in their virtue. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious, the myriad things flourished, and the nests of flying birds could be reached and explored by bending down. Wild beasts could be leashed and followed. But as virtue declined, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all became harms to the people. Thus, iron was cast into blades to defend against these calamities. When people were pressed by hardship, they sought convenience; when afflicted by disaster, they prepared defenses. Each used their wisdom to avoid harm and pursue benefit, yet constant customs could not be followed, and implements could not be relied upon. Thus, the laws and institutions of former kings underwent changes.\n\nTherefore, it is said: \"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\" The Five Emperors followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; the Three Kings pursued distinct affairs yet their names endured for later generations—this is adapting to the times and changing accordingly. It is like the tuning of the five notes by the master musician Shi Kuang: though the shifts move up and down without constancy, with the measure of a ruler, none fail to strike true. Thus, one who understands the essence of music can create sound; one who has a fundamental principle within and knows the use of squares, curves, and plumb lines can govern people. Therefore, the institutions of former kings should not be immediately abolished, nor should the affairs of the latter age be blindly adopted. Thus, the sage who establishes rites and music does not let rites and music constrain them; the one who regulates things is not bound by things; the one who establishes laws is not confined by laws. Therefore, it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage kings of old took symbols from heaven above, measures from the earth below, and models from humanity between. They harmonized the qi of yin and yang, attuned the seasons of the four times, and examined the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—high and low—to establish affairs, generate wealth, eliminate the suffering of hunger and cold, and ward off the disasters of illness and plague. They received human affairs at their center to establish rites and music, practiced the Dao of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relations, and arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish the intimacy of father and son and form the family. They listened to the clear and turbid of the five notes and the mutual generation of the six pitch-standards to establish the righteousness of ruler and minister and form the state. They observed the sequence of the four seasons—first, middle, and last—to establish the hierarchy of elders and juniors and form offices. They divided the land into provinces and governed states, establishing universities to teach. These are the guiding principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Dao is attained, all things flourish; when the Dao is lost, all things decline. No thing has ever expanded without relaxing, flourished without decaying. Only the sage can flourish without decay. When the sage first created music, it was to return the spirit, restrain excess, and revert to the heavenly heart. But as it declined, it flowed without return, indulged in lust and favored beauty, disregarding proper laws, flowing into later generations until the ruin of states. When they first created writing, it was to order and manage the hundred affairs. The foolish used it to avoid forgetting; the wise used it to record events. But as it declined, it became a tool for deceit and fraud, exonerating the guilty and killing the innocent. When they first created parks, it was to prepare offerings for ancestral temples, train soldiers, and guard against the unforeseen. But as it declined, they galloped and hunted, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength. When they first honored worthies, it was to level education, rectify lawsuits, place the worthy in office, and employ the capable. Grace flowed downward, and the myriad people cherished virtue. But as it declined, cliques formed, each promoting their own, abandoning the public for private gain, recommending one another inside and out. The wicked held office while the worthy withdrew. The Dao of heaven and earth reaches its extreme and then returns; it gains and then loses. Thus, the sage governs decay by reforming institutions, ends affairs and begins anew.\n\nThe excellence of the sage’s Dao lies in harmony; its flaw lies in power. The sage’s Dao says: Without cultivating rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame, the people cannot be established. Without integrity and shame, they cannot be governed. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot rectify. Without exalting the good and abolishing the ugly, there is no turning toward rites and righteousness. Without laws, there can be no governance. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented. Laws can kill the unfilial but cannot make people filial; they can punish thieves but cannot make people honest. When the sage king is above, he clarifies likes and dislikes to show the people, uses praise and blame to guide them, draws near the worthy and advances them, despises the unworthy and retires them. Punishments are set aside and unused; rites and righteousness are cultivated, and the virtuous are employed. Thus, the highest in the world become the Three Dukes; the highest in a province become the Nine Ministers; the highest in a state become the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters; the highest in a village become the Eighty-One Elders. Those whose wisdom surpasses ten thousand are called heroes; a thousand, called talents; a hundred, called杰; ten, called豪. Those who understand the Dao of heaven and earth, comprehend the principles of human affairs, are vast enough to embrace the multitude, benevolent enough to cherish the distant, wise enough to know power—these are heroes. Those whose virtue suffices to transform, whose conduct suffices to set the standard, whose trust suffices to gain the people, whose clarity suffices to illuminate below—these are talents. Those whose conduct can serve as a model, whose wisdom suffices to resolve doubts, whose trust can keep promises, whose integrity can distribute wealth, whose actions can be emulated, whose words can be followed—these are杰. Those who hold office without neglect, abide in righteousness without cliques, face danger without fleeing, see profit without seizing—these are豪. Heroes, talents,杰, and豪 each occupy their positions according to the magnitude of their abilities, flowing from root to branch, using the heavy to control the light. Above they initiate, below they harmonize; within the four seas, all share one heart, turning from greed and baseness toward benevolence and righteousness. In transforming the people, it is like the wind bending grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy oversee the worthy, even with severe punishments, they cannot suppress their treachery. The small cannot control the great; the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of heaven and earth. Thus, the sage promotes the worthy to establish merit. The unworthy ruler promotes those he favors. Observe whom they promote, and the distinction between order and chaos is clear. Examine their cliques, and the worthy and unworthy can be assessed.\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice rites carve and polish human nature, distorting its true feelings. Though the eyes desire, they are restrained by measures; though the heart delights, they are moderated by rites. They strut and circle, bow and bend, their flesh congealing without eating, their wine settling without drinking. Outwardly, they bind their forms; inwardly, they distress their virtue, restraining the harmony of yin and yang and constraining the true feelings of life. Thus, they spend their lives in sorrow. Why? They do not address the root of desire yet prohibit what is desired; they do not trace the origin of joy yet block what brings joy. This is like penning beasts without sealing their enclosures, forbidding their wild hearts, or damming the flow of rivers with one’s hands. Therefore, it is said: \"Open its aperture, assist its affairs, and it will never be saved in a lifetime.\"\n\nRites suppress emotions and close desires, using righteousness to guard the self. Though the heart is choked and the form starved, they force themselves with what cannot be helped. Thus, none can complete their natural years. Rites cannot make people cease desiring.\n\nYet those who would halt joy cannot make people cease rejoicing, only restrain it. To make the world fear punishment and refrain from theft—how is this better than eradicating the very thought of theft? Thus, when one knows a thing has no use, even the greedy will abandon it; when one does not know its use, even the incorruptible cannot relinquish it. The downfall of states, the death of rulers at the hands of others, the scorn of the world—were these not all born of desire? Like winter fans and summer furs, useless to oneself, all things crumble to dust when their time has passed. Thus, to scoop boiling water to stop its bubbling only makes it boil more fiercely. Those who know the root remove the fire and nothing more.\n\nLaozi said: To follow one’s nature and act is called the Dao; to attain one’s natural disposition is called virtue. When nature is lost, then benevolence and righteousness are prized. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. Unadorned simplicity scatters, and rites and music become embellishments. Right and wrong take shape, the people vie for pearls and jade, and the world falls into strife.\n\nRites serve to distinguish high and low, noble and base; righteousness serves to harmonize the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—the boundaries of human conduct. In later ages, rites become mere formal respect, and righteousness is reduced to calculated exchange. Gifts are given to win favor, and ministers become estranged from rulers; bonds of kinship breed resentment.\n\nThus, when water stagnates, it breeds creatures that devour one another; when earth piles up, it spawns beasts that consume themselves. When rites and music become mere adornments, deceit and falsehood arise. The governance of later ages does not accumulate the means of nurturing life. It thins the world’s purity, scatters its simplicity, and confounds the people, turning clarity into turbidity. Nature and destiny take flight in chaos, all striving for integrity and trust, yet these dissolve in decay. People lose their true nature, laws and righteousness oppose each other, actions and profit stand in contradiction. The rich and poor vie with one another, and the distinction between ruler and slave becomes negligible. When there is surplus, people yield; when there is scarcity, they contend. Yielding gives rise to rites and righteousness; contention breeds violence and disorder. Thus, excessive desire leads to unmanageable affairs; insatiable seeking ensures endless strife.\n\nTherefore, in times of order, petty men uphold integrity, and profit cannot seduce them. In times of chaos, even gentlemen turn to treachery, and laws cannot restrain them.\n\nLaozi said: The rulers of declining ages bore into mountains and stones to extract gold and jade, smelt mother-of-pearl and bronze, yet the myriad things do not flourish. They rip open wombs, burn the suburbs, overturn nests, and shatter eggs. The phoenix does not soar, the qilin does not roam. They build towers of timber, burn forests for hunting, drain marshes for fishing, pile earth into mounds, dig wells to drink, dredge rivers to make pools, and fortify walls for defense. They pen beasts as livestock, and thus yin and yang fall into discord, the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter, hail and frost wreak havoc, and half the myriad things wither and perish. Grass and trees wither in summer, the Three Rivers run dry. They divide mountains, rivers, and valleys into boundaries, count the multitudes to assign ranks, set up traps and barriers for defense, and establish distinctions in clothing and colors to mark noble and base, worthy and unworthy. They mete out rewards and punishments, and thus arms rise and strife is born. The innocent are slaughtered, the guiltless are punished—such calamities arise.\n\nLaozi said: When the world is about to suppress nature and destiny, it is like the rising of dark qi. The ruler is benighted and unclear, the Dao is abandoned and unenacted, virtue is extinguished and unmanifest. Affairs run counter to heaven, proclamations defy the four seasons. Spring and autumn contract their harmony, heaven and earth strip away their virtue. The ruler sits uneasily upon his throne, ministers retreat and fall silent, officials anticipate their lord’s will and disrupt constancy. Kin grow distant, and the self-serving find refuge. Flatterers scheme in secret, swiftly carrying the arrogant ruler toward chaos, shaping events to their advantage. Thus, ruler and minister grow estranged, kin drift apart, fields lie barren, roads are empty of travelers. Gold piles up but loses its edge, jade is hoarded until it cracks. Tortoise shells are hollow, yarrow stalks wither. The world fails to unite as one; feudal lords enact their own laws, customs clash, and defenses are built. They neglect the root and discard the foundation, carve punishments into harshness, and vie over the smallest gains. They slaughter the people, consuming more than half. They raise armies to wage war, besiege cities, and slaughter wantonly. They scale high walls, secure strongholds, and deploy troops to die on the roads, charging into fierce battles. For every hundred who march out, one returns. Reputations are falsely aggrandized, states and lands are seized. Corpses number in the hundreds of thousands, the old and weak starve and freeze to death—uncountable. From this time onward, the world never again finds peace in its nature or joy in its customs.\n\nThen the worthy and sagely rise in sudden emergence, upholding the Dao and virtue, aided by benevolence and righteousness. Those near advance in wisdom, those far are embraced in virtue. The world unites as one, and generations of descendants serve as ministers. They cast out the roots of slander and flattery, silence the clamor of disputes, abolish harsh laws, and remove vexatious affairs. They banish the traces of slander, block the gates of faction, and dissolve cunning and skill. They follow the great constancy, dismantle the branches, cast aside cleverness, and embrace simplicity. The great Dao flows unimpeded, and the myriad things each return to their root.\n\nThe sage does not create the times; when the time comes, he does not miss it. Thus, he does not meet with ruin.\n\nLaozi said: The depths of the Feng River measure ten *ren*, yet it does not hold dust or filth. Gold and stone lie within, their forms visible without—not for lack of depth or clarity. Yet fish, turtles, and dragons do not gather there. On barren rocks, the five grains do not grow; on bald mountains, deer and elk do not roam, for there is no shelter. Thus, in governance, to take severity as discernment, sharpness as clarity, harshness as loyalty, and calculation as merit—this is like stretching leather to its limit, a path that leads to great defeat and rupture. Such governance is murky, yet the people remain pure; it is meticulous, yet the people are flawed.\n\nLaozi said: Govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with the unexpected. First establish an invincible governance, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack another’s chaos with one’s own disorder is like meeting fire with fire, water with water—neither can overcome the other. Thus, the unexpected lies in difference: stillness overcomes restlessness, order overcomes chaos, satiety overcomes hunger, ease overcomes toil. The interplay of the unexpected and the upright is like the mutual conquest of water, fire, metal, and wood—how can it not prevail? Thus, when virtue is equal, the many overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise overcome the foolish; when wisdom is equal, those with strategy overcome those without.

      "translated_text": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Section: Masters, Subsection 14 – Descriptive Catalog*\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi* (The *Wenzi* with Annotated Explications), Twelve Scrolls\n*Category: Daoist Works*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Wenzi Zuan Yi* was compiled by Du Daojian of the Song dynasty. Daojian, styled Nangu, was a native of Dangtu. He once served as a Daoist priest at Shengyuan Abbey on Jichou Mountain in Wukang. His biographical details are not recorded in local gazetteers, and this work is seldom mentioned in bibliographic catalogs. Only upon examining *Lingyang Ji* by Mou Yan do we find a preface written for Daojian. Additionally, the *Jichou Feng Zhen Shuai Lu* contains another preface, which states: \"Master Dongwei, Zu Chang, presided over Shengyuan Abbey and Deshou Palace, where he was honored with imperial calligraphy. In the year such-and-such, Daojian arrived, marking twelve generations since Master Zu’s time—barely a century later.\" Tracing from Emperor Gaozong’s abdication and retirement to Deshou Palace to the *renxu* year of Jingding (1262), precisely one hundred years had passed. Thus, Daojian must have been a contemporary of Emperor Lizong.\n\nThe *Wenzi* is a text of profound diction and recondite meaning, requiring explication to circulate. Since the Northern Wei, three scholars—Li Xian, Xu Lingfu, and Zhu Yuan—had composed commentaries. Those by Xian and Yuan are long lost, while Lingfu’s survives only in fragments, largely incomplete. Inspired by the traces of the *Wenzi* at Jichou Mountain, where he resided, and admiring its author, Daojian gathered existing interpretations, supplemented them with his own insights, and compiled the *Zuan Yi*. His grasp of Daoist subtleties is evident: though his language appears plain, he clarifies and extracts much of the *Wenzi*’s abstruse meaning, sparing readers the snares of textual thorns. While he does not attribute the old explanations he cites, his work preserves fragments of pre-Song commentaries that would otherwise be lost, offering no small benefit to the text itself.\n\nSince the Yuan dynasty, copies of this work have been exceedingly rare. Only the *Yongle Encyclopedia* preserves its contents under various rhyme categories, including the complete *Jingcheng*, *Fuyan*, *Shangde*, *Xiade*, *Weiming*, *Ziran*, and *Shangyi* chapters. The *Daoyuan*, *Jiushou*, *Daode Shangren*, and *Shangli* chapters, however, are missing from the *Zuan Yi*’s original edition—whether omitted during the *Yongle Encyclopedia*’s transcription or left unannotated by Daojian remains uncertain. For now, we retain the lacunae while preserving the original text, dividing it into twelve scrolls according to the chapters.\n\nThe text contains numerous discrepancies with the Ming dynasty edition printed by the Mingdao Studio. For instance, in the *Fuyan* chapter, the phrase \"seek governance through action, yet prefer tranquility\" (*qiu wei er ning*) appears in the Ming edition as \"seek governance through non-action\" (*wu wei*), directly contradicting the surrounding context. Elsewhere, the line \"the past cannot be retrieved, yet one may draw upon it\" (*shi zhi qu bu ke zhui er yuan ye*) is corrupted in the Ming edition to \"the past cannot be retrieved, yet one may tread upon it\" (*zhu* miswritten as *zu*). Another example: \"As for qi, it may be regulated through the Dao\" (*fu qi zhe keyi dao er zhi ye*) appears in the Ming edition as \"As for the two qi, they may be regulated through the Dao once it is attained\" (*er qi zhe ke dao yi er zhi ye*).",

      "translated_text": "Additionally, in the *Weiming* chapter, the phrase \"the sage perceives fortune within the layered gates\" (*shengren jian fu yu zhong guan zhi nei*) appears in the Ming edition with *jian* (\"perceives\") miswritten as *xian* (\"precedes\"). In the *Xiade* chapter, the lines \"The emperor embodies yin and yang, yet encroaches; the king models the four seasons, yet diminishes\" (*di zhe ti yin yang ji qin, wang zhe fa si shi ji xue*) are corrupted in the Ming edition by the interpolation of *bu* (\"not\") beneath both \"emperor\" and \"king,\" rendering the passage incoherent and unintelligible—far less lucid than this edition. In the *Fuyan* chapter, the two lines \"Thus one who can achieve great victory with what the multitude cannot overcome—only the sage is capable of this\" (*gu neng yi zhong bu sheng cheng da sheng zhe, wei sheng zhe neng zhi*) are reduced in the Ming edition to a single line by the omission of the latter. The subsequent line, \"One who can become a true king must possess surpassing virtue\" (*neng cheng wang zhe bi de sheng zhe ye*), is further corrupted in the Ming edition by the omission of *de* (\"virtue\"). In the *Shangyi* chapter, the phrase \"Thus the world may be unified\" (*gu tianxia ke yi ye*) appears in the Ming edition with the interpolation of *ren* (\"person\") beneath *yi* (\"unified\"), among numerous other such errors—all of which serve to demonstrate the fallibility of the printed edition.\n\nOther instances where both versions convey plausible meanings are too numerous to count. As Daojian lived during the late Song dynasty, he was still able to consult various fine editions. Though the present text has long been corrupted by later hands, we are fortunate that this surviving compilation remains, allowing us to correct its errors and restore its integrity. This work is thus all the more precious.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the fifth month of the forty-second year of the Qianlong reign.\nCompiled by the Grand Academicians:\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi",

      "translated_text": "Grand Collator: Minister Lu Feichi\n\n**Preface to *Zuan Yi* of the *Wenzi***\n\nWhen Yu received the reckoning at Kuaiji, \"Kuaiji\" meant \"accounting.\" Mount Jichou in Wukang derived its name from Jiran, who once surveyed the land here. Yet its meaning surely has an origin. Fan Li studied under Jiran, as recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*; Yan Shigu held that he was a contemporary of Confucius. The book titled *Wenzi* contains dialogues with King Ping, leading Xu Lingfu to mistakenly assume he lived during the reign of King Ping of Zhou. Liu Xiang’s catalog records only nine chapters of the *Wenzi*. Li Xian’s commentary, however, comprises twelve chapters, and one cannot help but suspect later interpolations. Some claim he was King Ping of Chu, for during that time, Chu and Yue contended in strength, and as Chu’s affairs daily worsened, Wu Zixu fled to Wu while Jiran left Chu—might he have taken a secret route to Yue? This cannot be verified.\n\nMaster Du of Nangu was discerning and erudite, sincere and steadfast, serene yet perceptive. Though capable of serving the world, his resolve lay in reclusion. Though he once oversaw the Xiantai and Zhen Pavilions, he soon relinquished them to build the Cloud-Dispelling Hermitage atop Mount Jichou. There, in leisure, he gathered the *Wenzi* and its scattered references from other texts, compiling and carving them into print. That a relic of antiquity from the Three Dynasties should suddenly emerge from obscurity is truly a marvel of the mountains and forests.\n\nI observe that since ancient times, ministers of finance have seldom preserved themselves. Jiran’s strategies were partially employed by Fan Li in Yue: after a decade of rebuilding, Yue avenged itself upon Wu, whereupon Fan Li vanished into distant seclusion, escaping the poisoned grasp of the black crow’s beak. Yet Jiran’s plans were so cunning they seemed those of an immortal who had attained the Dao—surely he had once studied under Laozi.\n\nOne who excels in reckoning requires no counting rods. How could this be the trivial work of buying low and selling high, toiling at the end of a whip and abacus? He does not prize rare goods, nor abandon frugality and thrift. He does not supply excess to those in want. He generates wealth yet does not possess it; he achieves success yet does not claim it. Such a one nearly embodies the Dao, transcending profit and harm, fortune and misfortune. Yet those in the world who hoard wealth and monopolize profit often defy the seasons, exhaust the earth’s bounty, and boast of their mental calculations, splitting hairs. They know not that they violate what Daoists most abhor, thereby inviting calamity. The cycle of ruin repeats, yet they remain oblivious—how lamentable!\n\nNangu once annotated the *Laozi*, grasping its essential teachings. Now he has compiled this book, allowing it to circulate alongside the master’s sayings. Its warnings to the world are urgent indeed. Scholars would do well to study them together.\n\nYet books are but dregs. To roam in vast contemplation, to wander in the boundless void, to sweep away the clouds of worldly entanglements from one’s breast—is this not a supreme joy? How might one ascend Mount Chou with Master Nangu, gaze upon the distant ruins, and seek the very shores where Chiyi Zi once set sail upon the lake?\n\nRespectfully composed by Mou Yan of Lingyang\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Volume One\nBy Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty\n*Dao Yuan* Chapter",

Its source flows ceaselessly, surging yet never full. When turbid, it stills itself and gradually clears. It dispenses endlessly, without fixed time, manifesting without ever filling a single grasp. Contracted, it can expand; hidden, it can shine; soft, it can be firm. It contains yin and exhales yang, thereby revealing the three luminaries. Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it, birds fly by it. Unicorns roam by it, phoenixes soar by it. Stars and planets move by it. By non-being it takes being; by humility it takes honor; by retreat it takes precedence.\n\nOf old, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao and stood at the center.

      "translated_text": "Harmony encompasses ten thousand differences yet accords with life. Harmony regulates yin and yang, orders the four seasons, and harmonizes the five phases, moistening grasses and trees, seeping into metal and stone. Birds and beasts grow large, their fur and feathers lustrous; bird eggs do not spoil, beast embryos do not miscarry. Fathers know no grief for lost sons, elder brothers no lament for younger; children are not orphaned, women not widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not arise—all this arises from the attainment of virtue.\n\nThe eternal Dao of heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. All things rely on it to live, yet none know its power; rely on it to die, yet none can resent it. It gathers and stores, accumulates and amasses, yet does not grow richer; it bestows and endows, yet does not become poorer. Vague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form; indistinct and vague, its use is inexhaustible. Dark and obscure, it responds to transformations without shape; profound and penetrating, it moves without false action. Now yielding, now firm, it coils and unfurls with yin and yang; bowing and rising, it follows their rhythms.\n\nLaozi said: The great man is serene, without thought; tranquil, without care. He takes heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, yin and yang as his drivers. He travels where there are no roads, roams where there is no weariness, emerges where there is no exit.",

      "translated_text": "With heaven as his canopy, there is nothing he does not cover; with earth as his chariot, there is nothing he does not bear. With the four seasons as his horses, there is nothing he cannot employ; with yin and yang as his drivers, there is nothing he does not prepare for. Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoving, his clarity undiminished, he illumines and perceives all under heaven—this is grasping the essence of the Dao and observing the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of all under heaven cannot be forced; follow their spontaneity and guide them. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be saved; hold fast to their essence and return to it. Thus, the sage inwardly cultivates the root and does not outwardly adorn the branches, honing his spirit and laying aside his knowledge and perceptions. Therefore, he is profoundly non-active, yet nothing is not done; he does not govern, yet nothing is not governed.\n\nWhat is called \"non-action\" is not acting before things do; \"non-governance\" is not altering their spontaneity; \"nothing is not governed\" is following the natural course of things.\n\nLaozi said: One who grasps the Dao to guide the people responds to matters as they arise and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their response; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their match.\n\nThus, the Dao is empty and nonexistent, level and easy, clear and tranquil, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Emptiness and nonexistence are the abode of the Dao; levelness and ease are its plainness; clarity and tranquility are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function; simplicity is its constancy. Softness is the firmness of the Dao; weakness is its strength; purity, unadornment, and simplicity are its trunk.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. Having no desires or cravings is the perfection of emptiness; having no likes or dislikes is the perfection of levelness; unchanging unity is the perfection of tranquility; not mingling with things is the perfection of purity; neither sorrow nor joy is the perfection of virtue.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected person, he discards his cleverness, erases his embellishments, relies on the Dao, and abandons wisdom, emerging with the people in commonality. He simplifies what he upholds, reduces what he seeks, removes his temptations and longings, eliminates his noble desires, relinquishes his thoughts and concerns, and restricts what he guards. When he examines and reduces what he seeks, he attains it. Thus, by ordering the inner to control the outer, no affair is neglected. If the inner attains it, the outer can be shepherded. When the inner attains it, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts and concerns are balanced, sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes are keen.\n\nThe great Dao is smooth and easy; it does not depart from the self, yet those who seek it afar go forth only to return.\n\nLaozi said: The sage forgets governance of others and resides in self-cultivation; he values forgetting.",

      "translated_text": "The power of position lies within self-attainment; when one attains the self, the world attains me. Joy is forgotten, yet wealth and honor lie within. Harmonizing knowledge to enlarge the self and diminish the world—this nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: utmost emptiness, profound stillness. When the myriad things arise together, I observe their return. The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, silent and unmoving. Vastly penetrating, profoundly obscure, boundlessly expansive—it cannot be made external, nor can the finest hair or sharpest point be made internal. Though it has no walled dwelling, it gives birth to the general names of being and non-being.\n\nThe perfected person embodies it with emptiness and non-being, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity. Unmixed with things, this is the utmost virtue, the Dao of heaven and earth—thus they are called perfected persons. The perfected person knows how to enlarge the self and diminish the world, values governing the self and disdains governing others. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to confuse their essence. They conceal their name and surname: when the Dao prevails, they remain hidden; when the Dao is absent, they appear. They act without acting, engage without engaging, know without knowing.\n\nEmbracing the heavenly Dao, encompassing the heavenly mind, they inhale and exhale yin and yang, exhale the old and inhale the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they contract and expand. With yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with heaven, their body one with the Dao. They take no delight, feel no suffering, know no joy, harbor no anger. The myriad things are profoundly the same—nothing is not, nothing is.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the cruelty of cold, heat, dryness, or dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, or worry, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Thus, the perfected person employs the heart to restore nature, relies on the spirit for mutual support, and attains beginning and end. Therefore, in sleep they do not dream, and when awake they have no worries.\n\nConfucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and heavenly harmony will arrive. Gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come. Abandon virtue, and it will become your countenance; the Dao will become your dwelling. Your pupils will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the old. Your form will be like withered wood, your heart like dead ashes. Truly, their knowledge does not bend to circumstances, and they hold themselves with boundless ease. Clear and bright, extending in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who serve life respond to change and act, for change arises from the times. Those who know the times engage in no constant conduct. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words, yet words emerge from knowledge. The wise do not know the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the one concealed in books. Much learning leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center. Abandon learning, and there will be no worries; discard sagacity and wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nAt birth, humans are still—this is the nature of heaven. Moved by things, they stir—this is the nature’s desire. When things arrive and one responds, this is the movement of knowledge.\"",

      "translated_text": "When knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. As likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self—and heaven’s principle perishes. Thus, the sage does not exchange heaven for man: externally, they transform with things, yet internally, they do not lose their true nature. Those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who exhaust themselves in things end in non-action. Cultivating knowledge with tranquility, uniting the spirit with emptiness—thus, abiding by the gate of non-doing, they wander with the Dao. Those who follow men mingle with the vulgar.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not disturb heaven with affairs, nor disorder their nature with desires. Without scheming, they attain; without speaking, they are trusted; without deliberation, they obtain; without acting, they accomplish. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand ahead, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the wicked fear them, for they contend with nothing. Thus, none dare contend with them.\n\nLaozi said: \"People, following desires, lose their nature; their movements are never upright. Governing a state thus brings chaos; governing the self thus brings defilement. Those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not comprehend things cannot attain stillness. The original nature of humans is without depravity. Long immersed in things, it alters and forgets its root, merging with the false. The nature of water desires clarity, yet sand and stone muddy it; the nature of humans desires equilibrium, yet cravings harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge, nor disrupt harmony with desire. In joy, they are not exultant; in sorrow, they are not grieved. Therefore, though exalted, they are not imperiled; though secure, they are not overthrown.\n\nThus, though fools delight in good words and clever plans, and even the unworthy admire lofty virtue and noble conduct, those who praise are many, yet those who apply are few; those who admire are many, yet those who practice are few. Why? They are entangled in things and bound by custom.\"\n\nHe said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity. Stillness is the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is without mind, yet harmonizes with all under heaven.\n\nSpreading virtue without exhaustion, its use is inexhaustible. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is soundless. Formless, yet it gives birth to form; voiceless, yet the five notes resound; tasteless, yet the five flavors take shape; colorless, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, reality from emptiness. The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond viewing.\n\nIn sound, when the gong is established, the five notes take form; in flavor, when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; in color, when whiteness is established, the five hues are complete. In the Dao, when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. Thus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One pervades heaven and earth—its wholeness is perfect.\n\nHow solid!—it resembles uncarved wood. How vast!—it resembles turbid waters. Turbid, yet slowly clarifying; empty, yet slowly filling. Vast and deep like the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent, yet present; seemingly lost, yet enduring.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage establishes a single measure, follows the track, and does not alter its constancy. They take the plumb line as their standard, the marking cord as their guide, bending with what is straight, aligning with what is constant.\n\nJoy and anger are the depravities of the Dao; sorrow and grief are the depravities of virtue; likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "Desires and cravings are the fetters of life. When a person rages greatly, they rupture their yin; when they rejoice excessively, they collapse their yang. Thin qi surges forth, and speech is lost; terror and dread induce madness. Sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness accumulates. If one can eliminate these five, they align with the numinous. The numinous resides within; attaining it within, the five viscera find peace, thoughts grow balanced, ears and eyes keen, sinews and bones robust. One becomes unobstructed yet not perverse, firm yet not exhausted—nothing too excessive, nothing beyond reach.\n\nNone in the world is more supple than water, for water embodies the Dao. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable; its length stretches without end, its far-reaching ripples without limit. Though it ebbs and flows, waxes and wanes, it surpasses all reckoning. Above, heaven makes it rain and dew; below, earth makes it moisten and nourish. The myriad things cannot but grow; the hundred affairs cannot but be accomplished. It embraces all life without partiality, bestowing moisture upon ants and worms without seeking repayment. It enriches the world without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not harmed; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not scorched. Supple and yielding, flowing and following, it cannot be scattered. Its sharpness pierces metal and stone; its strength pervades the world, ever sufficient, never lacking. It bears the world’s burdens, receives and imparts to the ten thousand things without precedence or delay, without partiality or impartiality. With heaven and earth, it shares a vast unity—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat water can perfect its utmost virtue is because of its suppleness and smoothness. Thus it is said: \"The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap.\" The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great origin of tones. The true person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with creation. They hold dark virtue in their heart, and their transformations dart like spirits. Therefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken is vast indeed! Without issuing commands, it shifts customs and alters mores—only the heart’s conduct can achieve this.\n\nThe ten thousand things have their origins, yet only the root is singular; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet only the gate is singular. Thus, one can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without weariness, respond without aging.\n\nLaozi said: \"In the Dao and virtue, the will is weak while affairs are strong; the heart is empty while responses are fitting. The weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, and still—concealed in non-acquisition, enacted in inability. Placid and inactive, moving without missing the moment, thus the noble must take the lowly as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Relying on the small, it encompasses the great; residing within, it governs without. Acting with softness yet firmness, its strength overcomes all; no enemy can resist, no force can overpower. It adapts to transformations, measures the times, and nothing can harm it. Those who desire firmness must guard with softness; those who desire strength must preserve with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or ruin.\n\nStrength overcomes what is weaker than itself; when matched against its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it tears. Teeth are harder than the tongue yet perish first. Therefore, softness and weakness are the stalks of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. Those who initiate first tread the path of exhaustion; those who act later follow the source of attainment.\n\nGrasping the Dao to adapt to change, the first also controls the last, and the last also controls the first. How so? By not losing what controls others, others cannot control them. The so-called 'later' adjusts its calculations to align with the time. When the time shifts, even a moment’s gap cannot be tolerated. Acting too soon is excessive; acting too late is insufficient. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not tarry with people. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the moment, establishes merit by relying on resources, upholds the pure Dao, restrains with feminine restraint, follows and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. Soft and weak, tranquil and composed, their achievements are vast—no firmness can contend with them.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors scheming, even pure whiteness is not unsullied, and the spirit’s virtue is not complete. How can one who does not know how distant they are from harm harbor harmful desires? When the heart forgets such intentions, even a starving tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculation labor yet achieve nothing. Those who enact laws, carve punishments, and execute penalties do not engage in the work of emperors and kings. Those who frequently employ whips and rods do not govern for distant ends. When likes and dislikes multiply, calamities follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. Therefore, following leads to greatness, while acting leads to pettiness; upholding leads to stability, while doing leads to failure.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to listen and see wearies the heart and obscures clarity; governing with cunning and planning exhausts the heart and yields no success. Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient for great governance; one person’s ability cannot manage even three acres of land. Following the principles of the Dao, relying on the naturalness of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not enough to equalize.\n\nHearing is lost to slander and praise; the eyes are seduced by colors. Ritual and sincerity are insufficient to dispel attachment; only a sincere heart can embrace the distant. Thus, nothing is more bitter than the will—swords and halberds are inferior weapons. No bandit is greater than yin and yang, yet drums and gongs are minor tools. The so-called great bandit leaves corpses uncounted; the middle bandit hides in the mountains; the petty bandit flees among the people. Thus it is said: When the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits increase. Abandon one and take the other—heavenly calamities do not arise.\n\nTherefore, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s thief; not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s virtue. The formless is vast, while the formed is small; the formless is many, while the formed is few; the formless is strong, while the formed is weak; the formless is solid, while the formed is hollow. The formed is the completion of affairs; the formless is the beginning of creation. The completion of affairs produces tools; the beginning of creation is without form.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Wenzi’s Exposition of the Dao, Volume One**\n*Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*\n**Wenzi’s Exposition of the Dao, Volume Two**\n*By Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n**The Chapter on Sincerity**\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height; earth attains its depth. The sun and moon illuminate; the stars array themselves in order. Yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by aligning with the Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. Yet when spirit and clarity connect, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within and lodges spirit in the heart. Still and silent, serene and tranquil, the breast is vast and formless, silent and soundless. Offices seem empty of affairs; courts seem empty of men. There are no recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. The world looks up to the ruler’s virtue, emulates the sovereign’s intent. Distant lands and alien customs, though no envoy reaches their doors, all come through repeated translation—this is not because one visits each household, but because one extends sincerity to the world. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent are but government decrees; what enables their enforcement is sincerity. Now, though one may be enlightened, one cannot act alone—sincerity is required. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to govern the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\n**Exposition:** The sages of antiquity governed heaven and earth, administered the myriad things, concealed essence, and preserved sincerity—formless and soundless. They aligned with the Dao and entrusted things to their nature. In those times, courts had no favored ministers; the wilds had no neglected recluses; the state had no idle folk. Weapons were not raised; forced labor did not arise. The four classes delighted in their work. Thus, without visiting each household, they sat and achieved great peace.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven established the sun and moon, arrayed the stars, extended the four seasons, and regulated yin and yang. Day exposes; night rests. Wind dries; rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see how they are lost, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit and clarity. Therefore, the sage emulates this: in bestowing blessings, none see how they arise, yet blessings come; in removing misfortune, none see how it departs, yet misfortune vanishes. Investigating yields no trace; examining reveals no falsehood. Daily reckoning falls short; yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs the world—this is the transformation of the unintentional. Thus, when sincerity takes form within, qi moves heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge.\n\n**Exposition:** The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit. Heaven’s nurturing of things is unseen, yet daily they grow. The sage’s nurturing of the people, removing harm, and promoting benefit is the same—all arise from sincerity taking form within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, spirit and clarity aiding, and auspicious omens arriving.\n\nDefying heaven and harming things, the sun and moon are eclipsed, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons clash, day encroaches on night, mountains collapse, rivers dry, winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate. Thus, when a state declines, celestial signs change; when customs corrupt, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the workings of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved through cunning or forced by strength. Thus, the great person harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, aligns brightness with the sun and moon, unites numinosity with gods and spirits, and matches trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing heaven’s heart, holding earth’s qi, grasping the mean and containing harmony, one need not leave the hall to traverse the four seas, transform customs, and guide the people toward goodness as if it arose from oneself—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\n**Exposition:** Heaven and humanity share qi, the hidden and manifest communicate. Harmonious qi brings auspiciousness; pestilent qi brings calamity—none arise apart from the ruler. Thus, defying heaven, harming things, violating the Dao, and corrupting virtue provoke heaven’s wrath, and disaster follows. As when King Cheng repented, the grain stalks bent, and the wind reversed; or when the Lord of Song spoke, the fire star retreated—these are signs of sincerity moving heaven, turning misfortune into fortune.\n\nLaozi said: The human Dao is to preserve one’s nature, safeguard truth, and not harm the body. When pressed by urgency and difficulty, essence penetrates heaven. How can one who has never departed from the source fail to succeed? Life and death share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overpowered. How much less can one who governs heaven and earth, administers the myriad things, returns to creation, and contains ultimate harmony be subject to life and death? Sincerity takes form within and is understood by others—this is the unerring Dao.\n\n**Exposition:** All humans receive life from heaven, so their natures are without evil. Preserving one’s nature, safeguarding truth, and not harming the body, essence penetrates heaven—how can one fail to succeed? Returning to creation, attaining ultimate harmony, and transcending life and death—this is the true person.\n\nWhen the sage is above, embracing the Dao without speaking, grace extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words is vast indeed. When ruler and minister are at odds, deceit appears in heaven, and spirit and qi respond—signs manifest. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the Dao-less. To summon the distant, one acts without action; to draw near, one speaks without affairs. Only the night traveler can achieve this. Thus, turning back horses to fertilize fields, tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness, moving through the land.\" The heavenly Dao is impartial: it approaches without favor, departs without bias. The capable have surplus; the inept fall short. Following it brings benefit; opposing it brings misfortune. Thus, governing with cleverness makes holding the state difficult. Only those who align with great harmony and uphold natural response can possess it.\n\n**Exposition:** When the sage embraces the Dao, grace extends to the people—auspiciousness is visible. When ruler and minister are at odds, calamity appears in heaven—misfortune is visible. The distant act without action; the near speak without affairs. Spirit and qi respond—no summons is needed. Impartial approach, impartial departure, surplus and deficiency, alignment with great harmony—the teaching without words is simply natural.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide: distance makes them near; proximity makes them distant. Investigating yields no trace; examining reveals no falsehood. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing. The myriad things are unharmed. What one gains is what one loses; what one loses is what one gains. Therefore, one who penetrates great harmony is dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining, roaming within as if never having departed from the source—this is called great penetration. This is the use of the seemingly useless.\n\n**Exposition:** The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit. Heaven’s nurturing of things is unseen, yet daily they grow. The sage’s nurturing of the people, removing harm, and promoting benefit is the same—all arise from sincerity taking form within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, spirit and clarity aiding, and auspicious omens arriving.",

      "translated_text": "The transmission of meaning holds the Dao as revered and virtue as noble—though their names differ, they emerge from the same source, residing within our hearts, not obtained from without. To give life and nurture is neither to possess nor to lack. The heart of the sage is like a bright mirror: when things come, it responds; when they depart, it remains still. It embraces pure sincerity, untainted by morality and virtue—what could corrupt it? What could it lose? As if never having departed from its source, even spirits cannot discern it.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the numbers of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying high and low, ensuring the strong did not overpower the weak, the many did not oppress the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were in harmony without grievance. Laws and decrees were clear and not obscure; assistants were just and not partial. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets had no false pricing. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished. Phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nThe transmission of meaning observes the Dao of heaven and grasps the movements of heaven. The Yellow Emperor attained this, and the world was well-governed. Later, he relinquished the world, pursued emptiness, and in humble reverence, sought the Master of Vast Accomplishment, asking how to govern the body so as to attain longevity. The Master of Vast Accomplishment said: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and subtle; its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing. Embrace spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure. Do not weary your form; do not agitate your essence. Only then can you attain long life.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on stone and slept on ropes, killed in autumn and stored in winter, embraced the square earth and the round heaven. Where yin and yang were obstructed and stagnant, he opened the pathways; where qi turned contrary and harmed the people, he severed and halted it. His people were simple and ignorant, unaware of east or west, their eyes dim, their steps unsteady, yet content and at ease, knowing not whence they came. They roamed freely, unaware of their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing where they were headed. At that time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes, all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and venom. His work matched heaven and earth, yet he grasped the subtleties beneath the Great Ancestor, not displaying his merit, not proclaiming his name. He concealed the Dao of the True Person, following the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because the Dao ascended above, and human cunning vanished.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: As the Six Records neared their end and the Two Emperors did not reappear, the Heavenly Sovereign emerged. At that time, great simplicity scattered, and human affairs began. The world first had action. Observing images, he crafted tools; tying knots into nets, he tamed birds and beasts—this was called Fuxi. Smelting metal into cauldrons, he transformed raw into cooked—hence the name Paoxi. Yet at that time, he did not regard it as merit. Birds and beasts, insects and snakes, though bearing claws and fangs, did not harm people. Later, when he created writing and rectified human relations, his work matched heaven and earth, yet he did not regard it as merit. Thus, he was honored as Taihao—was this not fitting?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear; if earth is unsettled, plants and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Therefore, only with the True Person does true knowledge arise. If what one holds is unclear, what can one know? What I call knowledge is not ignorance. Accumulating favors and amassing wealth to make the people joyful, delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Achieving great deeds and displaying illustrious names, ordering ruler and minister, clarifying high and low, distinguishing close and distant, preserving endangered states, continuing severed lineages, establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, discarding wisdom and returning to non-discernment, wandering blithely beyond the dust, carefree in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang, harmonizing with the myriad things—this is virtue. Thus, the Dao scatters and becomes virtue; virtue overflows and becomes benevolence and righteousness. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: The Dao and virtue in relation to the Five Constants, yin and yang in relation to the Five Phases—these are one. Knowing that the sun and moon alternate in brightness, the four seasons intermingle to complete the year, one understands that the human Dao, the Dao and virtue, and the Five Constants can coexist but cannot be without one another. Thus, when Laozi said, \"Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom; abandon benevolence, discard righteousness,\" what did he despise? The pretense of their names and their practice. If one truly had the heart to abandon them, the *Daodejing* would not speak of sages, nor of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, only with the True Person does true knowledge arise.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue dissipates, conduct becomes false. When essence is exhausted within, yet words and actions are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things. Essence may be exhausted, but conduct has no end. If what one holds is not firm and one indulges in the winds of the secular world, how can one avoid this?\n\nThe transmission of meaning: The Dao and virtue are the ancestors of the Five Constants. To have an ancestor without descendants is impossible; to have descendants without knowing their ancestor—how can this be? The Five Constants are the five spirits. When the Dao resides within, spirit does not scatter without. Once one loses what one holds, spirit scatters, words become flowery, virtue dissipates, and conduct becomes false—rarely does one not become enslaved by things. Only the sage knows the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, roaming in the harmony of spirit. If the ancestor is preserved, how can the descendants not be preserved?\n\nLaozi said: As for the wanderings of the sage, they move in utmost emptiness, roam the heart in great nothingness, gallop beyond boundaries, act through no gates, listen to no sound, see no form. Unconstrained by the world, unbound by custom, the sage’s way of moving the world is that the True Person does not exceed it; the way of correcting the world is that the sage does not observe it. If one is bound by custom, the body is fettered and spirit leaks—how can one avoid entanglement? If I can be fettered, it must be that my fate lies without.\n\nThe transmission of meaning: If the body is not bound by custom, people will not weary of me; if the heart is not constrained by the world, I will not weary of others. This is called roaming with the Creator. Thus, those who move the world are True Persons who do not exceed it; those who correct the world are sages who do not observe it. If will is enslaved by things, the body is fettered and spirit leaks—even the worthy are not exempt, let alone the common people.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts are such that spirit does not gallop within his breast, and wisdom does not extend beyond the four directions, when he cherishes a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. He monthly examines the seasons, annually assesses the end of the year, presents tribute, nurtures the people with impartiality, wields awe without admonition, reduces laws without complexity. His teachings are like spirits; his laws are lenient, punishments mild. Prisons are empty; the world is of one custom, none harboring treacherous hearts—this is the grace of the sage. If the ruler covets endlessly, the people below will vie for merit without yielding. The people grow poor and distressed, disputes arise, labor is toilsome yet fruitless. Cunning and deceit emerge; bandits and thieves multiply. Superiors and inferiors resent each other; orders are not carried out.",

      "translated_text": "The inheritance of righteousness unifies chariots and aligns their tracks, standardizes script and unifies writing—thus the world shares one custom. Rewards are not excessive, punishments not indiscriminate; the Four Seas beat as one heart. If this is so, then the ruler’s thoughts do not extend beyond the four domains, yet his transformative influence is like that of spirits. If the ruler covets without measure, those below will vie for merit without yielding. Cunning and deceit arise, the people’s strength is exhausted, superiors and inferiors resent each other, Heaven and Earth fail to commune, and the myriad things cease to flow.\n\nWhen water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. If the ruler’s desires are many, deceit below multiplies; if the ruler is restless, those below grow unsettled. If the ruler’s demands are many, contention arises below. Addressing symptoms rather than the root is no different from digging channels to halt water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire. The sage governs with minimal affairs, seeks little yet suffices, enacts benevolence without action, establishes trust without speech, attains without seeking, and accomplishes without striving. Embracing naturalness and preserving utmost truth, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows him as echo answers sound, as shadow mirrors form—what he cultivates is the root.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: Heaven hangs forth its signs, revealing fortune and misfortune, which all see. The ruler issues decrees, clarifies rewards and punishments, and the people all trust him—is he not like Heaven? When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, if the ruler’s desires are many, deceit arises below; if the ruler values stillness, the people do not contend. The sage holds to the Dao and extends sincerity, and the world follows him—this may be called knowing the root.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters outward and wisdom strays within, one cannot govern the body. Where spirit is employed afar, what is left behind is near. Thus, without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one knows the Dao of Heaven. The farther one ventures, the less one knows—this speaks of sincerity issuing from within, where spirit and qi move Heaven.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: When Heaven and Earth commune, the myriad things flow; when the sage acts, the myriad things behold—this is the Dao of natural resonance and response. The human heart connects with Heaven, for the form one receives and the mandate one bears both originate from Heaven. Thus, when sincerity issues from within, spirit and qi move Heaven. When the human heart is empty and bright, Heaven’s light shines forth, as a mirror reveals beauty and ugliness—how can one not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things turn to them without being summoned, drawn by the utmost essence of natural resonance. Unbidden they come, unprompted they go, subtly and obscurely, their workings unknown, yet their achievements are self-fulfilled. If one must wait for eyes to see or words to command, governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as the great judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for speech? Shikuang was blind yet served as the great minister, and the state of Jin knew no disordered governance—what need was there for sight? The sage’s way of leading lies in this.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: The yang mirror summons fire only when the sun shines; the fangzhu vessel summons water only when the moon glows. Thus, with the Dao but no position, affairs cannot be established; with the position but no Dao, achievements cannot be completed. As with the rulers and ministers of Tang and Yu, when Dao aligned and transformative teachings spread, the hundred officials were upright and the myriad people submitted—this is why the sage serves as the teacher of a hundred generations.\n\nThe people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but their conduct. Thus, if the ruler favors courage yet does not cause strife, the state will face many calamities, and gradually there will arise the chaos of robbery and murder. If the ruler favors beauty yet does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into disorder, and over time there will arise the disasters of debauchery. Therefore, the sage distinguishes sincerity within and clarifies likes and dislikes without, uttering words that match his feelings and issuing commands that clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to prohibit villainy—only spiritual transformation is prized. Where essence reaches is spirit; where spirit moves is like the spring’s life-giving force and the autumn’s killing force. Thus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: When the standard is upright, the shadow is straight; when the source is clear, the stream is long—this is the Dao of root and branch mutually sustaining each other. Knowing the heart as the root of the body, one knows the ruler as the root of the people. Thus, the ruler’s preferences must not be unprincipled: favoring courage gives rise to the chaos of robbery and murder; favoring beauty gives rise to the disasters of debauchery. Only by favoring virtue, distinguishing sincerity within, and clarifying likes and dislikes without can punishments go unused and villainy submit. When the root is firmly established, the state naturally finds peace.\n\nLaozi said: Laws are promulgated and rewards are set, yet customs are not transformed—this is because sincerity is not embraced. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their customs; observing their music reveals their manners; seeing their manners reveals their transformation. Those who hold to truth and manifest sincerity move Heaven and Earth, their spirit surpassing the four directions. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions observed; their Dao is unobstructed, and their intent is conveyed. Though they utter not a word, the world’s myriad people, birds, beasts, and spirits transform with them. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: Stone contains jade, and the mountain glows; water holds pearls, and the abyss shines—what is within manifests without. Water and stone are silent, yet people trust them. If a state embraces benevolence and sincerity, extends trust and truth, and punishes not out of resentment nor rewards out of favor, then without the need for promulgated laws or set rewards, the people will transform. Thus, hearing of Boyi’s integrity, the obstinate become upright and the timid find resolve—what words did Boyi speak? His person transformed them. If words are spoken yet not enacted, the people will not follow.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action is non-being. What is non-being does not abide; what does not abide resides in formlessness. What is formless does not move; what does not move is wordless. What is wordless is still and silent; what is formless and silent cannot be seen or heard—this is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit, continuous yet ever-present, the root of Heaven and Earth. The Dao is formless and soundless, so the sage forces a form upon it, naming it with a single phrase. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is great, taking the small as its root; abundant, taking the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven takes Heaven and Earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are utmost, his power and name most eminent—these two virtues match Heaven and Earth, so he must not deviate from the Great Dao, the mother of the world.\n\nThe inheritance of righteousness: The Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the king—these are the four great ones within the realm. The Dao is non-action, thus enduring; Heaven is wordless, thus lofty and bright; Earth is soundless, thus vast and deep. The king encompasses them all, for he is Heaven’s son, Earth’s master, and the people’s father and mother. Only by loving and nurturing the myriad things without considering it a favor do his merit and virtue become utmost, his power and name most eminent—none can surpass him.",
      "overlap_context": "thout complexity. His teachings are like spirits; his laws are lenient, punishments mild. Prisons are empty; the world is of one custom, none harboring treacherous hearts—this is the grace of the sage. If the ruler covets endlessly, the people below will vie for merit without yielding. The people grow poor and distressed, disputes arise, labor is toilsome yet fruitless. Cunning and deceit emerge; bandits and thieves multiply. Superiors and inferiors resent each other; orders are not carried out.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent brings forth reputation; eliminating harm and establishing benefit achieves merit. When the world is free from disasters, even sages have no virtue to display; when superiors and inferiors are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, extends sincerity, and delights in giving—his wisdom is inexhaustible, yet he rests in silence without speech. The world does not know his worth, for it is his very silence that is prized. Thus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\" What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved on metal and stone, or transmitted to others—these are but its coarse manifestations.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different affairs with the same heart, followed different paths to the same end. Scholars of the degenerate age do not grasp the embodiment of the Dao or the summation of the One Virtue. They merely seize upon the traces of accomplished deeds, reciting them in kneeling posture. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid disorder.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, extending sincerity and delighting in giving—this is the Way of the superior. Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent, establishing benefit and eliminating harm—this is the Way of the middle. Being content with victory without seeking it, and yielding—this is the Way of the inferior. Adapting to the times and comprehending change, one is not bound by office or reclusion; different affairs yield the same merit. Without relying on bamboo, silk, metal, or stone, one may yet stand as a peer to the ancients.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can work spiritual transformations but cannot be spoken of as the Dao. The sage does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world—his influence surpasses the owl’s cry. Thus, shared words inspire trust, for trust precedes the words; shared commands are obeyed, for sincerity lies beyond the command. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit. His emotions precede them, yet when he acts above, there is no response below—this is because emotions and commands differ. A three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet the loving mother cherishes him all the more—this is the power of emotion. Thus, the use of words effects change, but the change is small; the use of silence effects change, and the change is great. When a noble person’s words are sincere and his intentions loyal, sincerity and loyalty take shape within and move others without—this is the transformation of the worthy and the sage.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The *Scripture of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism. The ruler is the heart of Heaven and Earth, the abode of spirit and intelligence. When emotions stir within, words issue forth. If good, a response arises a thousand *li* away; if not, opposition arises a thousand *li* away. Thus, when the sage is above, his transformation is like spirit—he does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: When a son dies for his father or a minister for his lord, it is not to seek fame by facing death. Rather, the heart of gratitude is concealed within, and they do not shirk difficulty. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned; it arises from within. One must examine his conduct. The sage is not ashamed before his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. Forsaking the near, one becomes distant and obstructed. Thus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, the people long for his will, never forgetting his desire to benefit others.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: When a scholar faces danger and offers his life, or stands firm in great integrity without wavering, it is loyalty and filial piety that compel him. Consider Chang Hong, who died for his lord, or Shen Sheng, who died for his father—the heart of gratitude was concealed within, and they did not shirk difficulty. How could they have sought fame by facing death? When the sage-king is above, the people delight in his governance—such were the Two Emperors and Three Kings. When the sage is below, the people long for his will—such were the Uncrowned Sages and Unadorned Kings.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior issues a single cry, the three armies retreat—this is the power of his sincerity. If one leads but none follow, or speaks but none bear the burden, there must be discord within. Thus, one who does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world seeks the source within himself. Where persuasion does not reach, demeanor does; where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does. When the heart’s sincerity is fully expressed, it takes form. The utmost essence can be met in form but cannot be awaited by expectation.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Words issue from the mouth, conduct emanates from the heart—this is the movement of sincerity. Words arise from the near, conduct extends to the far—this is the response of sincerity. When a brave warrior issues a cry, his sincerity moves the three armies to retreat. Consider Sunzi’s military teachings—bravery arises from sincerity. When he executed the king’s beloved concubine, it was because the king’s words lacked sincerity, and disaster befell his subordinates. For those who hold state and family, how can their words and deeds not be sincere?\n\nLaozi said: Words have a source; affairs have a root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, one is not as good as speaking little. To harm the multitude, even Yu the Craftsman would have his finger cut off to show that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise carpenter does not rely on skill but on timing. He does not know how to close, so he must bar the door before opening it.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: Many words and many affairs are what the sage warns against. Only by taking the Dao as the source and virtue as the root, teaching without words, and acting without striving can one avoid failure and harm. The degenerate customs of later ages, though skilled in many techniques, are enslaved by cleverness and seldom avoid injury. The carpenter’s work does not rely on wisdom or skill, so there is no lock that cannot be opened. Yet if one must bar the door before opening it, where is the source and root? Laozi said: The sage’s undertakings follow different paths but reach the same end. Whether preserving or destroying, stabilizing or toppling, his will is unified and never forgets the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy; wailing, the expression of sorrow. What is felt within is expressed without, so the means of moving others lies in this. The sage’s heart day and night does not forget the desire to benefit others—how far-reaching is his influence!\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The sage is not without desire; he benefits others by what benefits them. The sage is not without affairs; he acts when it is fitting to act. Different paths lead to the same end; preservation and destruction share a single purpose. Sacrificing oneself to benefit others, never forgetting the world—though customs differ across lands and languages vary, human nature is one. What is felt within is expressed without: joy is sung, sorrow is wailed, and responses arise with feeling. All are our people—how can they be forgotten? Consider the Duke of Zhou, who toiled day and night, sitting to await dawn—this is one who never forgot, day or night. How far-reaching was his influence!\n\nLaozi said: When people govern through non-action, it is because action harms non-action. Those who act cannot achieve non-action; those who cannot achieve non-action cannot achieve action. When people are wordless, the spirit has words—this harms the wordless. Those who are wordless harm the spirit’s spirituality.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The body has form; the spirit is formless. The formed has words; the formless is wordless. Knowing the mutual generation of being and non-being, one suffers no harm. Being does not harm non-being. Thus, when the sage governs through non-action, his body is not harmed, nor is his spirit. Knowing that the spirit is not spiritual in itself, the two do not harm each other.",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi said: A name may be forcibly established, and merit may be forcibly accomplished. In ancient times, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent within himself alone. Journeying south to see Laozi, he received instruction, and with a single word, his spirit became enlightened, his obstructions dissolved, and his hardships ceased. For ten days he ate nothing, yet it was as if he had feasted on the finest meats. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the realm, his name endured for posterity, his wisdom connected heaven and earth, his discernment distinguished the finest details, and his praises resounded in the most elegant speech—unceasing even to this day. This is what is meant by a name being forcibly established.\n\nTherefore, the farmer who does not exert himself will not fill his granary; the official who does not refine his conduct will not perfect his sincerity; the general and minister who do not strive will not achieve great deeds; the king and marquis who grow indolent will leave no name for posterity. The perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. Acting in accord with the times and establishing merit through available resources, he encounters no difficulty in advance or retreat, and nothing is beyond his reach.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: When one struggles in knowledge yet strives in action, success is as one—just as with Nanrong Chu. Was this not one who learned knowledge for its benefit and acted for its advantage? Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent within himself alone, so he entrusted his studies to Gengsang Chu’s gate. Later, journeying south to see Laozi, he heard the *Scripture on Nurturing Life*. His brilliance illuminated the realm, his name endured for posterity—thus proving that a name may be forcibly established and merit forcibly accomplished. The sage moves in concealment, acts in accord with the times, and establishes merit through available resources—what difficulty could there be in advance or retreat?\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, he is alarmed as if in mourning. He who worries with the people’s worries—his people worry with his worries; he who delights in the people’s delight—his people delight in his delight. Thus, he who worries with the world and delights with the world—yet does not become king—has never existed.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. It abides in an unshakable place, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and is carried in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices of no contention. He opens doors that are certain to be entered, does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain, and does not act where he cannot repeat.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings joy, and none fail to follow his commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, goodness becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: The perfected person, the sage, and the great person—these should be distinguished. The perfected person regards the people as himself, sharing in their benefit and harm. When people rejoice, he rejoices; when people worry, he worries—there has never been one who did not become king. The sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. His decrees issue forth like flowing water. The great person enacts a governance that brings joy, issuing commands in accord with the times. When commands are followed, people comply; when commands are defied, the people are harmed.\n\nWhat is called the great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous. Inwardly strong like heaven and earth, outwardly luminous like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and support all without fail; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person displays goodness to others, never altering his fundamental principles or changing his constancy. The world follows his decrees like grass bending to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, the stars expand and contract, unsettled in their regularity. When governance falters in summer, Mars moves in retrograde. When governance falters in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, entering and exiting without constancy. When governance falters in winter, the Chen star does not appear in its proper region. When the four seasons lose their governance, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon display portents, the five planets move in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, the millet flourishes; when summer governance is not lost, timely rains descend; when autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; when winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being.\n\n*Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness*: People receive the numinous essence of heaven and earth, and the heart is the abode of spirit and illumination. The great person, however, is even more numinous than others. The slightest movement of his mind—whether good or evil—heaven necessarily observes. Thus, the success or failure of governance manifests in omens and portents, responding to affairs without error.\n\nThe *Book* says: \"To slight the spirits and oppress the people—August Heaven will not protect them.\" Those who hold office—can they not be cautious?\n\n*Wenzi: Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness, Scroll 2*",

      "translated_text": "*The Imperial Four Treasuries: Wenzi: Continuation of the Inheritance of Righteousness, Scroll 3*\n*Composed by Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**Nine Principles**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was but a profound obscurity, an undifferentiated unity—still, clear, and serene. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. They separated into the four seasons, divided into yin and yang. The essence of qi became humans; the coarse qi became creatures. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born. Spirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit departs through its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and complies with earth, unbound by custom, undeluded by others. He takes heaven as his father, earth as his mother, yin and yang as his warp, and the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. Those who go against them perish; those who follow them live. Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are the dwelling of the Dao/Way.\n\nThat which is spirit originates from heaven; that which is bones and flesh is endowed by earth. The Dao/Way gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the blending of qi.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born. In the first month, the essence forms; in the second, the vessels develop; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus forms; in the fifth, the sinews develop; in the sixth, the bones form; in the seventh, the body is completed; in the eighth, it moves; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera divide: the liver governs the eyes, the kidneys govern the ears, the spleen governs the tongue, the lungs govern the nose, and the gallbladder governs the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has the four seasons, the five phases, the nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have the four limbs, the five viscera, the nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder becomes clouds; the lungs become qi; the spleen becomes wind; the kidneys become rain; the liver becomes thunder. Humans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs them. The ears and eyes are like the sun and moon; blood and qi are like wind and rain.",

      "translated_text": "When the sun and moon lose their proper course, eclipsing one another and dimming their light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, destroying and breaking to bring forth calamity; when the five stars stray from their paths, states and lands suffer their misfortune—such is the Dao of heaven and earth, vast and great, yet ever governed by measure, its brilliance cherishing its numinous clarity. How can human ears and eyes long endure fumigation without rest? How can the spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external.\n\nBlood and qi are the blossoming of humanity; the five viscera are the essence of humanity. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not scatter outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision sharp—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart, qi and intent prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not dissipate. Thus, in listening, nothing is unheard; in seeing, nothing is unseen; in acting, nothing is unaccomplished. Misfortune and disaster have no means of entry, and perverse qi cannot invade. Those who seek much gain little; those who perceive broadly know narrowly.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; blood and qi are the messengers of the five viscera. Thus, when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera tremble and cannot settle, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and the spirit gallops without restraint. Though calamity and fortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to recognize them.\n\nThus the sage cherishes without transgressing. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and penetrating, with nothing to lure or entice, and that intent and qi do not falter, remaining pure and with few desires, the five viscera are at peace, the spirit guards within, and the form does not transgress. Then, observing the external affairs of past ages and the internal misfortunes and fortunes between them, one may fully perceive. Thus, the farther one ventures outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds confuse the ears, rendering them unhearing; the five flavors confuse the mouth, causing it to suffer harm. Preferences and aversions unsettle the heart, causing conduct to fly astray. Thus, desires cause qi to overflow, and likes and dislikes cause the spirit to labor. If one does not swiftly depart from them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is due to their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who take no action for the sake of life thereby attain longevity.\n\nHeaven and earth move and mutually communicate; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to be unable to know the One is to be unable to know anything. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and things are also things. How can things be used to measure one another? The desire for life cannot be served; the hatred of death cannot be avoided. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling it, daring not to exhaust it—daring not to exhaust it is the utmost joy.\n\nLaozi said: The so-called sage follows the times and rests in his position, engaging with the world and delighting in his work. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the way of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. At rest, one harmonizes with yin; in motion, one moves with yang. Thus, the heart is the master of the form, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. When the form labors without rest, it stumbles; when essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage abides by this and dares not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its measures. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one completes one’s mandate, neither distant nor close, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony to follow heaven. With the Dao as one’s boundary and virtue as one’s neighbor, one neither initiates fortune nor precedes calamity. Life and death bring no change to oneself. Thus it is said: The utmost spirit seeks and obtains all; it acts and accomplishes all.\n\nLaozi said: To regard the world lightly is to keep the spirit unburdened; to treat the myriad things as trivial is to keep the heart unconfused. Equalizing life and death keeps intent unafraid; unifying transformations keeps clarity unimpaired. The perfected person leans on an unyielding pillar, walks an unbounded path, draws from an inexhaustible storehouse, and studies with an immortal teacher. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nowhere they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace fate without confusion, turning with misfortune and fortune, advantage and harm, which are insufficient to trouble the heart.\n\nThose who act for righteousness may be compelled by benevolence but cannot be coerced by arms; they may be rectified by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or nobility; they act for righteousness and cannot be terrified by death. How much more so for those who practice non-action? Those who practice non-action are without burdens. The burdenless person takes the world as a shadow, a reflection. Looking up, they observe the ranks of the perfected; deeply investigating the intent of the Dao and examining the conduct of the vulgar below, they find it sufficient to feel shame.\n\nThose who take the world as nothing are like a drum beaten in vain. To guard equilibrium:\n\nLaozi said: Esteeming power and abundant profit are what people covet, yet compared to the body, they are base. Thus, the sage eats enough to fill the void and connect qi, wears enough to cover the form and ward off cold, and satisfies desires without excess. Not coveting gain, not hoarding much, they keep the eyes clear and unseeing, the ears still and unhearing, the mouth closed and silent, the heart relinquished and unthinking. Abandoning cleverness, returning to simplicity, resting the spirit, and discarding knowledge—thus, without likes or dislikes, this is called great penetration. To eliminate filth and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What cannot be accomplished? To know the harmony of nurturing life is not to be lured by profit; to understand the correspondence of internal and external is not to be enticed by power. The external of the external is the greatest; the internal of the internal is the noblest. To know great nobility, where does one not succeed?\n\nTo guard simplicity:\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who practiced the Dao ordered emotions and nature, governed the heart’s arts, nurtured with harmony, and held with appropriateness. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot baseness; content with virtue, they forgot poverty. What nature did not desire, they did not desire and did not obtain; what the heart did not enjoy, they did not enjoy and did not do. What harmed nature, they did not burden virtue with; what inconvenienced life, they did not disturb harmony with. Not indulging the body or following whims, their system could serve as a model for the world. Measuring food by the belly, clothing by the form, dwelling in contentment, and acting in accord with emotion, they had surplus in the world yet did not possess it, entrusted the myriad things yet did not profit from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness, cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who can do this may be said to embody the Dao.\n\nTo guard clarity:\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes relate to sounds and sights; the nose and mouth relate to fragrances and odors; the skin and flesh relate to cold and warmth—their essence is one. Some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty. What governs them differs. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level. No one mirrors in flowing water but mirrors in still water because it is clear and still. Thus, when the spirit is clear and intent is level, one can perceive the essence of things. Those who employ it must borrow from those who do not. A bright mirror is not sullied by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. Thus, when the heart reaches a point, the spirit is present in it; returning to emptiness, agitation vanishes, and the storehouse of the spirit rests. This is the wandering of the sage. Therefore, to govern the world, one must first understand the essence of nature and life.\n\nThus, the heart is the master of the form, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. When the form labors without rest, it stumbles; when essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage abides by this and dares not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its measures. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one completes one’s mandate, neither distant nor close, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony to follow heaven. With the Dao as one’s boundary and virtue as one’s neighbor, one neither initiates fortune nor precedes calamity. Life and death bring no change to oneself. Thus it is said: The utmost spirit seeks and obtains all; it acts and accomplishes all. To guard the insubstantial.",

      "translated_text": "To Guard the Real\n\nLaozi said: What is called the sage merely accords with human nature, eating according to the measure of the belly and clothing according to the measure of the form, restraining the self so that the heart of greed and corruption has no means to arise. Thus, one who can possess the world must not take the world as one’s own; one who can possess fame and reputation must not seek them through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness follow as natural attachments.\n\nAs for the spirit, nothing obscures it; the heart bears no burden. Penetrating and unimpeded, all things flow through; tranquil and unoccupied, one is free from affairs. Power and profit cannot entice, sounds and sights cannot seduce, sophistry cannot persuade, cunning cannot move, and bravery cannot terrify—this is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThat which gives life does not itself live; that which transforms does not itself transform. One who does not grasp this Dao, though one may govern heaven and earth, illuminate like the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make words flow like metal and stone, is still of no benefit in governing the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what one guards.\n\nTo Guard Stillness\n\nLaozi said: Stillness and tranquility, serenity and simplicity—these nurture life. Harmony and joy, emptiness and nothingness—these uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one attains one’s nature and finds its proper place. Stillness does not move; harmony rests in virtue and finds its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to complete one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nIn such a state, the blood and vessels flow without stagnation, the five viscera hold no accumulated qi. Fortune and misfortune cannot deceive, praise and blame cannot defile. Without possessing the world, who could bring it to order? Possessing talent but not meeting the right time, the body cannot even free itself—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nThe eye that discerns the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; the ear that harmonizes the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus, if one sets the mind on small things, one forgets great things. Now, the myriad things assail and seize one’s life, snatching at one’s essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf the water in a basin is clear, after a day one can see the brows and lashes; if it is muddied, even a single stir prevents one from seeing its shape, whether square or round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like the water in a basin. Guard the law.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The highest sage models himself on Heaven; the next reveres the worthy; the lowest relies on ministers. To rely on ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to revere the worthy is the source of delusion and confusion. To model oneself on Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness are its foundation: emptiness admits all, stillness sustains all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus the sage takes stillness as order and movement as chaos. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb, do not agitate—then the myriad things will clear themselves. Do not startle, do not alarm—then the myriad things will order themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\n**Embrace Weakness**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world and a single state as their household, and the myriad things as their storehouse. When the world is vast and the myriad things are many, qi becomes replete and the will grows arrogant. The great use force to invade the small; the small grow insolent and domineer over the lowly. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long. Therefore the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and acting without contrivance, never diminishing. The qi of the Unwrought appears small, embraces weakness, retreats, and claims nothing. He models himself on the rivers and seas: the rivers and seas do not act, yet their merit and fame transform of themselves. Not forcing, they thus complete their kingship. As the female of the world, they can spiritually endure without perishing. Loving themselves, they thus achieve their nobility. The power of ten thousand chariots and the authority over the myriad things are of the utmost weight—one cannot treat them lightly. To treat them lightly is to fail in merit and fame.\n\nThe Dao is great, yet it is completed through the small; it is rich, yet it takes the few as its master. Thus the sage, governing the world with the Dao, sees the subtle in the supple and wondrous, sees the few in frugality and restraint. Seeing the small, he thus completes the great; seeing the few, he thus completes the beautiful. The Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to them and offers them tribute. The sage is humble, tranquil, and yielding—he appears lowly. Emptying his mind, he appears insufficient. Appearing lowly, he thus attains the high; appearing insufficient, he thus completes his worth. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure. The violent die; the self-satisfied perish. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot remain full for even a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains move with the qi of violence, thus they cannot last and are destroyed. Small valleys occupy the place of violence, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, discards extravagance and arrogance, and dares not move with the qi of violence. Holding to the female and the yielding, he thus establishes his maleness; not daring extravagance and arrogance, he thus endures long.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—sun and moon are thus. Therefore the sage daily diminishes and the qi of the Unwrought does not dare become full. Daily advancing with the female, his merit and power do not decline. The Dao of Heaven is thus. The nature of man is to love the high and hate the low, to love gain and hate loss, to love profit and hate harm, to love honor and hate disgrace, to love nobility and hate baseness. The multitude act accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; grasping, they thus cannot obtain. Therefore the sage models himself on Heaven, achieves without acting, and obtains without grasping. His nature is the same as others, yet his Dao differs—thus he endures long.\n\nTherefore the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called \"Admonishing Goblets.\" When empty, they stood upright; when full, they overturned. Things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its full wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Thus, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom guard themselves with foolishness; those with much learning and wide eloquence guard themselves with restraint; those with martial strength and courage guard themselves with fear; those with wealth and nobility guard themselves with humility; those who bestow virtue upon the world guard themselves with yielding. These five were how the former kings preserved the world. Those who serve this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one remain whole without renewal.\n\nLaozi said: The sage moves with the yin, closing when it closes; moves with the yang, opening when it opens. He can reach the state of no joy, and thus there is nothing that does not bring joy. With nothing that does not bring joy, he reaches the ultimate joy. This is inner joy, not delighting the inner with outer joys. Thus he has joy of himself, and his will is honored throughout the world. The reason for this is that he acts for the world through the world’s essentials. It does not lie in others but in oneself; it does not lie in people but in the body. When the body attains it, the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, those who penetrate the discourse on the arts of the mind have desires and aversions beyond them. Therefore, they have nothing to delight in, nothing to anger them, nothing to bring them joy, nothing to cause them suffering. The myriad things are profoundly the same—nothing is not so, nothing is right. Thus the scholar has a constant discourse, the woman has unchanging conduct. They do not wait for power to be honored, do not require wealth to be rich, do not need strength to be mighty. They do not profit from goods and wealth, do not covet worldly fame. They do not find security in nobility, nor danger in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nForm is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life.",
      "overlap_context": " the mind on small things, one forgets great things. Now, the myriad things assail and seize one’s life, snatching at one’s essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf the water in a basin is clear, after a day one can see the brows and lashes; if it is muddied, even a single stir prevents one from seeing its shape, whether square or round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like the water in a basin. Guard the law.",

      "translated_text": "When any one of these loses its proper place, all three are harmed. Thus, those who take spirit as their master find form following to their benefit; those who take form as their master find spirit following to their harm. The greedy and gluttonous, driven by excessive desires, stumble blindly after power and profit, lured by the allure of fame and rank. As they surpass others in cunning and rise above the world, their spirit daily depletes, drifting ever farther in dissipation without return. When form seals itself in resistance, there is no way for it to admit anything. Hence arise the afflictions of blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, will, and qi—when at rest, they daily grow full and vigorous; when agitated, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage preserves and nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, floating and sinking with the Dao. Thus, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart, and the changes of the hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nTo guard simplicity—Laozi said: \"The so-called True Person’s nature accords with the Dao.\" Thus, they have yet seem as though they have not; they are full yet seem as though empty. They cultivate their inner without managing their outer, understanding the Great Simplicity, acting without contrivance, and returning to uncarved simplicity. They embrace their spirit and wander to the root of Heaven and Earth, drifting faintly beyond the dust and grime, at ease in the work of no-affair. Schemes, wit, and cleverness are not carried in their heart; they discern the flawless and do not shift with things. They perceive the transformations of affairs yet hold fast to their origin. Their mind and intent are concentrated within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding, they know not what they do; moving, they know not where they go. Without learning, they know; without looking, they see; without acting, they accomplish; without governing, they order. They respond to stimuli, move under pressure, proceed only when unavoidable—like light shining, like a shadow following. They take the Dao as their guide, acting when conditions allow. Vast and empty, clear and still, they hold nothing, regarding a thousand lives as one, taking the myriad differences as a single origin.\n\nThey possess essence yet do not employ it; they possess spirit yet do not use it. They guard the great undifferentiated simplicity, standing at the center of utmost refinement. They do not dream in slumber, their wisdom does not sprout; their movement leaves no form, their stillness no substance. They exist yet seem to vanish; they live yet seem to die. They enter and exit without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits—such are the powers of those who ascend to the Dao through spirit.\n\nWhen spirit flows freely and does not lose its origin, day and night without interruption, it becomes springtime to all things—this is harmony arising in the heart. Thus, though form may decay, spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation without transforming, through a thousand changes and ten thousand shifts, it never reaches an end. That which transforms returns to formlessness; that which does not transform is born together with Heaven and Earth.\n\nTherefore, that which gives life has never truly given life—what it gives life to is but life’s transformation. That which transforms has never truly transformed—what it transforms is but transformation itself. Such is the wandering of the True Person, the pure and unalloyed Dao.\n\n*Wenzi, in \"Weaving the Meaning,\" follows this.*",

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Volume Four\nBy Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty\n\"Fu Yan\" (Words as Tokens) Chapter\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It enfolds Heaven and Earth yet has no exterior or interior; it pervades and covers all yet encounters no obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao neither rages nor rejoices. Seated, they harbor no anxieties; awake, they dream no dreams. They perceive things and name them; affairs arise, and they respond.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: \"Fu\" (tokens) demonstrate trust; \"yan\" (words) convey sincerity. The world speaks of \"mandates as tokens,\" \"seals as tokens,\" \"golden tokens,\" \"jade tokens\"—all capable of demonstrating trust and conveying sincerity, where this evokes and that responds. Hence, \"fu yan\" (words as tokens). The Dao is without limit in height or depth, near or far, yet it penetrates all. Without form or name, it possesses sentiment and nature. The sage embodies the Dao, neither privately rejoicing nor raging. They perceive things and name them; affairs arise, and they respond. Their wordless words can serve as tokens of trust.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame as their corpse must generate affairs. Generating affairs means abandoning the public to pursue the private, forsaking the Dao to rely on one’s own views. Seeking praise by doing good, establishing a name by being worthy—such governance does not accord with principle, and such affairs do not align with the times. Governance that does not accord with principle leads to excessive blame; affairs that do not align with the times yield no merit. Rash actions aimed at achieving success cannot absolve one of responsibility; failed affairs are sufficient to destroy the self.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Fame is the instrument of self-destruction, which the sage guards against. Those who covet fame as their corpse must defy Heaven and contravene the Dao, abandoning the public to pursue the private, seeking praise and establishing a name by generating affairs that harm the multitude. Thus, governance does not accord with principle, and merit cannot absolve one of responsibility; failed affairs destroy the self. This is no falsehood.\n\nLaozi said: Do not act as the corpse of fame, do not act as the storehouse of schemes, do not act as the burden of affairs, do not act as the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not seek to be first in fortune, do not initiate calamity. Begin with formlessness, move only when unavoidable. To seek fortune, first avoid calamity; to seek benefit, first distance harm. Thus, those who seek tranquility lose their tranquility and invite peril; those who seek order lose their order and invite chaos.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Thus, those who act without action to seek tranquility lose their tranquility and invite peril; those who act without action to seek order lose their order and invite chaos. Upon examining this passage, the *Zuan Yi* states: 'Those who seek tranquility, when tranquility is lost, invite peril; those who seek order, when order is lost, invite chaos.' It appears the main text should not read 'act without action.' This can be compared with the Ming printed edition for textual variants.*]\n\nTherefore, do not desire to be as dazzling as jade or as unyielding as stone. That which has fine patterns will surely be flayed; that which has beautiful horns will surely be slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words will later incur transgressions; mountains bearing jade will be harmed. The suffering of the black-headed people is already present before the words are spoken.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow. Doing good brings blessings; doing evil brings calamity. Evil must not be committed; fame must not be coveted as one’s corpse. Those who seek tranquility, when tranquility is lost, invite peril; those who seek order, when order is lost, invite chaos. Fine patterns lead to flaying; beautiful horns lead to death. No destruction comes that is not self-invited.\n\nLaozi said: Those who move with the times yet do not know the Dao turn fortune into misfortune, Heaven into a canopy, Earth into a crossbar. Those who skillfully employ the Dao ultimately suffer no exhaustion. Earth as a crossbar, Heaven as a canopy—those who skillfully employ the Dao ultimately suffer no harm. When the five phases are arrayed, there must be conquest. What Heaven covers is without exception fitting. Thus, to know yet not claim to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Thus, to know yet not claim to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\"]\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Heaven as a canopy covers all without exception; Earth as a crossbar bears all without exception. Heaven and Earth’s benevolence toward humanity is boundlessly great. The sage models this, acting in accordance with the times. Where there is movement, there must be following. Like the five phases, which mutually generate and mutually conquer, those who skillfully employ the Dao know without speaking—this is the supreme. Not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal, stones give birth to jade; they mutually erode. Trees give birth to insects, which turn and consume them. People generate affairs, which turn and harm them. Those who delight in affairs are never without misfortune; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Good swimmers drown; good riders fall. Each is harmed by what they delight in.\n\n[*Note in the original*: The Ming printed edition reads: \"Each turns and harms themselves.\"]\n\nTo gain lies in timing, not in contention; to govern lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth abides below, contending not for height, thus it is secure and not imperiled. Water flows downward, contending not for speed, thus it departs yet does not lag. Therefore, the sage holds to nothing and thus suffers no loss; acts without action and thus suffers no defeat.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things mutually steal to nourish one another. When theft is appropriate, there is security; when theft is inappropriate, there is harm. Thus, food can nourish people yet also harm them; people can support their lord yet also rebel against him. When those above enact laws and initiate affairs to plunder the people’s strength, it may initially seem beneficial, but in the end, none do not harm themselves. Knowing that to gain lies in timing, not in contention, and that to govern lies in the Dao, not in sagacity, one avoids the loss of mutual theft.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the ancestral teaching of the world. Three words are the heroes of the feudal lords; four words are the pairs of the world. Integrity and trust cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the ancestral teaching of the world. Elevating worthies and virtue makes the feudal lords heroes; hating the few and loving the many makes the world a pair.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Few words invite few faults; few actions invite few regrets. It lies in conduct, not in words. Grasping the great image, the world comes to you—it lies in virtue, not in peril. Only when the mouth utters good can it avoid stirring conflict. Can words not be cautious?\n\nLaozi said: People have three deaths that are not fated. Immoderate eating and drinking, belittling the body—disease kills them. Unrestrained joy and insatiable seeking—punishment kills them. Attacking the many with the few, overpowering the strong with the weak—weapons kill them.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: Life must end in death; who among people can avoid it? Yet to die not by fate is truly lamentable. Gluttony and desire die by disease; greed and desire die by punishment; aggression and strength die by weapons. Though the causes of these three deaths differ, their lack of fate is the same.\n\nLaozi said: Those who bestow generously receive beautiful recompense; those who harbor great resentment suffer deep calamity. To bestow little yet expect much, to harbor resentment yet hope for no misfortune—such has never existed. Examine what has gone forth, and you will know what will return.\n\n*Zuan Yi*: The principle of bestowal and recompense is like planting melons to harvest melons, planting fruit to harvest fruit. The retribution of kindness and resentment follows the same principle.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the mandate of Heaven, order the arts of the heart, regulate likes and dislikes, and adapt to the nature of the emotions—thus the governance of the Dao is unimpeded. Tracing the mandate of Heaven prevents confusion about fortune and misfortune; ordering the arts of the heart prevents reckless joy and anger; regulating likes and dislikes prevents greed for the useless; adapting to the nature of the emotions prevents excessive desire. Not being confused about fortune and misfortune ensures that movement and stillness accord with principle; not being reckless in joy and anger ensures that rewards and punishments are not biased; not being greedy for the useless ensures that desire does not harm one’s nature; not exceeding the bounds of desire ensures nurturing life and knowing contentment. These four do not seek from without or borrow from others; they return to the self and are obtained.",

      "translated_text": "The four—tracing the mandate of Heaven, ordering the arts of the heart, regulating likes and dislikes, and adapting to the nature of the emotions—are interconnected, like the moon in water: its waxing and waning, its fullness and crescence, appear as reflections following its form. The rectitude or perversity of the heart’s arts brings fortune or misfortune in its wake.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue conduct that invites reproach; do not resent others’ reproaches of oneself. Cultivate virtue sufficient for praise, yet do not seek others’ praise. One cannot ensure misfortune does not arrive by trusting in one’s refusal to welcome it; one cannot ensure fortune must come by trusting in one’s refusal to yield it. Misfortune’s arrival is not of one’s own making, thus one may be impoverished yet not anxious. Fortune’s coming is not of one’s own achievement, thus one may be prosperous yet not proud. Therefore, dwelling in leisure brings joy; acting without contrivance brings governance.\n\nTracing the mandate: Trusting oneself, what is there to seek? Resenting others, what is there to hate? Virtue and conduct arise from oneself; praise or blame arise from others. Thus, praise does not spur one on, nor does slander discourage. Dwelling in leisure, one finds joy; governing without ceasing, one finds order.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao consists in preserving what one already possesses, not seeking what one has not yet obtained. Seeking what one has not yet obtained causes what one already has to be lost; following what one already possesses causes what one desires to arrive. Governance that is not firmly rooted in non-chaos yet strives for order is surely perilous. Conduct not yet free from wrongdoing yet hastily seeking fame is surely thwarted. Thus, no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune; no benefit is greater than the absence of defense. Some things, when augmented, are diminished; when diminished, are augmented. The Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue advantage, yet it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Thus, one may constantly be without misfortune, yet not constantly possess fortune; one may constantly be without guilt, yet not constantly achieve merit.\n\nThe Dao is vast and obscure, following Heaven’s majesty, sharing Heaven’s qi. It is without thought or planning, without preparation or hoarding. What comes is not welcomed; what goes is not pursued. Though people move east, west, south, or north, one stands alone at the center. Thus, amidst the crooked multitude, one does not lose one’s straightness; flowing with the world, one does not depart from one’s domain. One does not act for goodness nor avoid ugliness, following Heaven’s Dao. One does not initiate nor act alone, following Heaven’s principle. One does not premeditate nor abandon the times, taking Heaven as one’s measure. One does not seek gain nor refuse fortune, following Heaven’s norm. Within, there is no extraordinary fortune; without, there is no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise.\n\nIf others act as thieves, the utmost virtue speaks the same words, shares the same path, and enjoys the same fortune. Above and below are of one heart, without divergence. Those who stand by the roadside are sent away; the path is opened to goodness, and the people turn toward the proper direction.\n\nTracing the mandate: Coveting gain and forgetting loss is a malady common to all. Without desire, one is thus tranquil—this is called the perfected person. The principles in the world cannot be certain. Preserving what one already has may bring what is not yet obtained; seeking what is not yet obtained may cause what one already has to be lost. Therefore, one of the Dao within has no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. One joins Heaven as a companion—how could others act as thieves against one?\n\nLaozi said: Acting with goodness spurs one on; acting without goodness invites observation. Spurring gives rise to esteem; observation gives rise to trouble. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame; it can only be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor seek praise through knowledge. Governance follows nature; one who does nothing has nothing unaccomplished; one who seeks nothing has nothing unattained. People may be limited, yet the Dao is unimpeded. One may possess knowledge, yet acting without contrivance achieves the same merit as the unknowing. One may possess ability, yet acting without busyness achieves the same virtue as the incapable. Possessing knowledge yet appearing unknowing, possessing ability yet appearing incapable—when the principle of the Dao is thoroughly understood, human talent vanishes.\n\nPeople and the Dao cannot both be illustrious. If people love fame, they do not employ the Dao. When the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao recedes and fame flourishes, peril and ruin follow.\n\nTracing the mandate: Acting with goodness yet not seeking fortune, fortune arrives; acting with evil yet not seeking misfortune, misfortune arises. Leaving behind a fragrant reputation for ten thousand generations, through the ages, one should indeed be at ease. Thus, loving fame and valuing it causes the heart not to employ the Dao; delving deeply into the Dao causes the self not to seek fame. Herein lies the division between Heaven and humanity.\n\nLaozi said: If trustworthy men were to divide wealth, it would be better to determine shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intention cannot achieve fairness as well as those without. If vigilant men were to guard wealth, it would be better to close the doors and seal it completely. For those with desire cannot be as secure in defense as those without. If people point out one’s flaws, one resents them; if a mirror reveals one’s ugliness, one improves oneself. One who can engage with things without involving the self is free from entanglement.\n\nTracing the mandate: Dividing wealth by drawing lots—having intention is not as fair as being without intention. Guarding wealth by closing doors—having desire is not as incorruptible as being without desire. Pointing out flaws causes resentment in others, thus one does not love them; reflecting on ugliness to improve oneself is within oneself, thus one loves it. Only when engaging with things yet having no involvement with the self does one have no such intention, and others have no flaws in one.\n\nLaozi said: In all matters of serving others, if not with treasures or gifts, one must use humble words. Gifts are exhausted, yet desires remain unfulfilled; the body is humbled, words are exhausted, yet alliances are not formed. Oaths and covenants are sworn, agreements are made, yet one betrays them first. Therefore, the noble person does not outwardly adorn benevolence and righteousness but inwardly cultivates virtue and the Dao. One attends to the affairs within one’s borders, exhausts the expanse of one’s land, encourages the people to hold fast to death, and strengthens the city walls. Above and below are of one heart, defending the altars of the state together. Thus, one who acts for fame does not attack; one who acts for profit without guilt does not invade. This is the certain way to preserve wholeness and the certain principle of securing benefit.\n\nTracing the mandate: Serving others with treasures and gifts—gifts are exhausted, yet desires remain unfulfilled. Forming alliances with humble words—words are exhausted, yet agreements are betrayed first. Only by inwardly cultivating virtue and the Dao, with above and below of one heart, can one defend the altars of the state and protect the people. This is the complete Dao.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome the heart; the multitude does not overcome desire. The noble person acts with upright qi; the petty person acts with perverse qi. Internally, one accords with one’s nature; externally, one harmonizes with righteousness. Moving in accordance with principle, not bound by things—this is upright qi. Indulging in flavors, addicted to sounds and colors, giving rein to joy and anger without regard for later consequences—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright harm each other; desire and nature harm each other. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Therefore, the sage reduces desire to follow nature.\n\nThe eyes love beauty, the ears love sounds, the nose loves fragrance, the mouth loves flavor—gathering and indulging in these, one does not depart from considerations of benefit and harm, from cravings and desires. The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; it is the heart that controls them, each obtaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desire cannot prevail.\n\nTracing the mandate: This is the division between the heart of the Dao and the human heart, between Heavenly principle and human desire. When principle prevails, all actions are Heavenly; when desire prevails, all actions are human. Herein lies the division between the noble person and the petty person. Principle and desire contend; the perverse and the upright harm each other. If even the noble person does not act thus, how much less the sage?",
      "overlap_context": "the emotions prevents excessive desire. Not being confused about fortune and misfortune ensures that movement and stillness accord with principle; not being reckless in joy and anger ensures that rewards and punishments are not biased; not being greedy for the useless ensures that desire does not harm one’s nature; not exceeding the bounds of desire ensures nurturing life and knowing contentment. These four do not seek from without or borrow from others; they return to the self and are obtained.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Those who govern the body and nurture their nature regulate their rest and dwelling, moderate their diet, harmonize their joy and anger, and adjust their movement and stillness—thus what lies within the self is attained, and pernicious qi has no means of entry. Those who indulge what is external injure what is internal; those who gratify their emotions harm their spirit. Those who are dazzled by appearances are obscured in their truth.\n\nThus, one who must pause without forgetting their worthiness will surely exhaust their nature; one who walks a hundred paces without forgetting their appearance will surely burden their form. Therefore, those with beautiful plumage injure their bones and frame; those with lush branches and leaves harm their roots. One who can perfect both is nowhere to be found under Heaven.\n\nTracing the mandate: The true Dao nurtures the spirit; the human Dao nurtures the form. What lies within is attained; what lies without is made light. Distancing oneself from sounds and sights, moderating rich flavors—this is the Way of nurturing the form. Cutting off thought and guarding the essence-qi—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. To govern the body and nurture one’s nature, attaining both inner and outer, how could this be achieved through mere sounds and smiles?\n\nLaozi said: Heaven possesses brightness and does not worry over the people’s darkness; Earth possesses wealth and does not worry over the people’s poverty.",

      "translated_text": "The perfected Daoist, like a mountain’s peak, stands immovable—unyielding, self-sufficient. Travelers take it as their landmark, yet it remains straight and complete unto itself. Things do not bestow upon it, nor does it accept their virtue. Thus, abiding in stillness, it endures; Heaven and Earth have no part in it. Hence, nothing is taken from it, no virtue is owed, and so no resentment arises.\n\nThose who excel in anger invite much resentment; those who excel in giving invite much taking. Only by following the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth can one master principle. Thus, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil attends. Profit becomes harm’s beginning, blessing becomes misfortune’s precursor. Seek no profit, and harm does not arise; seek no blessing, and misfortune does not come. The body takes wholeness as its constant; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nTracing the mandate: The sage illuminates all within the seas, yet the people are not benighted; treasures all beneath Heaven, yet the people are not impoverished. Accord with the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth, let the myriad things grow of themselves. Give nothing in private, and nothing is taken in public; bestow no light rewards, and no heavy punishments arise. Regard wealth and honor as floating clouds—only then can one preserve one’s true nature.\n\nLaozi said: The sage wears no eccentric garments, performs no strange deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious—unobstructed yet not florid, impoverished yet not cowed, honored yet not conspicuous, humbled yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In common use, he cannot be named—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nTracing the mandate: Plain and unadorned, strange conduct—how could these be the sage’s affairs? Shining yet not dazzling, sharp yet not cutting, he shares common use with the people—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is straight unto itself, awaiting the arrival of its time. One cannot hasten its return; when its time departs, one cannot pull it back. Thus, the sage does not advance to seek, does not retreat to yield, but follows the time. When the three seasons pass, the time leaves me behind; when the three seasons come, the time follows behind me. Neither departing nor approaching, I stand at the center of my place. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—only virtue is its companion. Blessings arrive not from one’s seeking, so one does not boast of merit; misfortunes come not from one’s doing, so one does not regret one’s conduct. The heart abides in tranquility, unburdened by virtue. Dogs bark, yet one is not startled—trusting in one’s nature, sincere and without transgression, thus the one who embodies the Dao is not deluded. Knowing fate, one is not anxious. When emperors and kings perish, their bones are buried in the wild, yet their sacrifices are offered in the Bright Hall—spirit is prized above form. Thus, when spirit governs form, form obeys; when form overcomes spirit, spirit is exhausted. Though wisdom and insight are employed, they must return to spirit—this is called the Great Unobstructed.\n\nTracing the mandate: The Dao is the shared path of all under Heaven. The sage is straight unto himself, awaiting the time’s coming and going, neither leading nor welcoming, standing at the center to govern the four directions. He does not boast of merit, does not regret his conduct. His heart is tranquil, embodying the Dao and knowing fate. Though wisdom and insight are employed, they must return to spirit.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness—thus their names did not move. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty—thus their hearts did not move. Therefore, humility brought joy, stillness brought contentment. Counting their years, they grieved over the world’s chaos as one grieves over a river’s drying, weeping to replenish it. Thus, those who do not grieve over the world’s chaos but delight in their own governance can be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nTracing the mandate: The Dao is honored, virtue is prized—delighting the heart and preserving the self. Thus, poverty and lowliness do not move one’s heart and will. If the self is governed, what need is there to worry over the world? How could one, with a lifespan of less than a hundred years, take on the world’s burdens?\n\nLaozi said: People have three resentments: those with high rank are envied; those with great office are despised by their lord; those with generous emoluments are resented. Thus, the higher the rank, the more one’s intent should humble; the greater the office, the smaller one’s heart should be; the thicker the emoluments, the more one’s giving should spread. Cultivate these three, and resentment will not arise. Therefore, lowliness is the root of nobility, and humility is the foundation of height.\n\nTracing the mandate: High rank breeds arrogance, and people will envy; great office breeds haughtiness, and the lord will despise; thick emoluments breed stinginess, and people will resent. This is the way of high and low overturning each other. Only through humility and generosity, never forgetting lowliness or humility, can one avoid resentment and blame.\n\nLaozi said: Speech is the means by which one communicates oneself to others; hearing is the means by which others communicate to oneself. Being both deaf and blind, the human way is obstructed. Those with deafness and blindness do not know how to manage affairs—how could only the body suffer from deafness and blindness? The heart, too, has them. Blockage—no one knows what it obstructs. This is the blindness and deafness of the heart. The Dao is the ancestor of all things—all that has form is born from it, and its kinship is deep. Those who consume grain and breathe qi all live long—its lordship is generous. All the wise study it—its teaching is bright. Yet people harm what is useful with what is useless. Thus, knowledge is not broad, and days are insufficient. With the days spent on chess and gambling, one asks about the Dao. Yet not hearing, not asking—this is like the deaf and blind among people.\n\nTracing the mandate: Receiving form and being born, one owes the debt of kinship; consuming grain and living long, one owes the debt of the lord’s generosity; through study and enlightenment, one owes the debt of the teacher’s virtue. Growing to adulthood, the body is also noble. Speech is the voice of the heart, communicating oneself to others—without speech, it is not conveyed. Communicating others to oneself—without speech, it is not heard. Speech is the spirit’s manifestation. If one does not let private speech obstruct public speech, does not harm what is useful with what is useless, then one’s hearing of the Dao is deep and not isolated—one becomes a person of the highest order.\n\nLaozi said: Human nature is such that the heart submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue is present or absent—this is what one seeks. Thus, the sage who desires to be valued by others first values others; who desires to be honored by others first honors others; who desires to overcome others first overcomes himself; who desires to humble others first humbles himself. Thus, nobility and lowliness, honor and humility are governed by the Dao. The ancient sage-kings spoke to humble themselves before others, placed themselves behind others—thus the world delighted in pushing them forward and did not tire, in bearing them and did not find it heavy. This is because their virtue was abundant and their qi harmonious. Thus, knowing that giving is taking, that putting oneself last is putting oneself first—this is guarding the Dao.\n\nTracing the mandate: Ritual values putting oneself first; speech values putting oneself last—this is human nature. Thus, one can be made to submit through virtue, not through force. Therefore, the sage advances and retreats with measure, puts himself first and last with propriety—thus the world delights in pushing him forward and bearing him.\n\nLaozi said: Little virtue with much favor invites ridicule; low talent with high position invites danger; no great merit with thick emoluments invites calamity. Thus, some things are increased yet diminished, discarded yet increased. The multitude knows the benefit of benefit but not the harm of harm. Only the sage knows that harm is benefit and benefit is harm. Thus, a tree twice laden with fruit will have its roots injured; a family with much stored wealth will have its posterity imperiled. Great profit reverses into harm—this is the Way of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The *Zuan Yi* states: Virtue is not weary of breadth, and one’s share must not be overstepped. When water is shallow and the boat large, it runs aground; when a tree is great but its roots shallow, it is uprooted. A man’s virtue thin and talent meager, harboring no benevolence yet occupying high position—rarely does he not meet uprooting. Only one who knows the reversal of benefit and harm, who cherishes no excessive hoarding, and attains harmony of righteousness and profit—what harm can befall him?\n\nLaozi said: The petty man engages in affairs saying, “Let me but gain”; the noble man says, “Let me but act with righteousness.” The doer of good does not seek fame, yet fame follows him. Fame does not arrange to meet profit, yet profit accrues to him. Their pursuit is the same, but their ends differ. Thus, where action brings benefit, harm follows; where words lack constancy and conduct lacks propriety—this is the petty man. One discerning in one matter and proficient in one skill is a middling man. One who encompasses all and possesses manifold abilities, whose talents are employed with skill—this is the sage.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Round skulls and square feet, bearing teeth and wearing hair—all are equally human. Yet the endowment of qi differs, and wisdom and folly are thereby distinguished. The petty man, in his pursuit of gain, has talent that outstrips virtue; the noble man, in his pursuit of righteousness, has virtue that outstrips talent. One who can rise or descend is a middling man; one whom Heaven endows with manifold abilities—is he not the sage?\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, when the world is ordered, one defends the self with righteousness; when the world is chaotic, one defends righteousness with the self. The day of death is the culmination of one’s conduct. Therefore, the noble man is cautious in his every application. Life is what we receive from Heaven; fate is what we encounter in time. To possess talent but not meet one’s era—this is Heaven’s doing. The noble man can do good but cannot ensure he will obtain fortune; he refrains from doing wrong yet may not escape calamity. Thus, when the noble man meets his time, he advances—if he obtains it through righteousness, what good fortune is there? When his time does not come, he retreats—if he yields with propriety, what misfortune is there? Thus, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he does not regret, for he has attained what he values.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: We receive our mandate from Heaven and are endowed with form as humans. Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. What we encounter in time—whether straitened or flourishing—is none other than fate. To possess talent yet not meet one’s era—this is Heaven’s doing. Therefore, the noble man does good, yet fortune does not necessarily follow; he does not do wrong, yet calamity does not necessarily depart. Thus, when he meets his time, he rides forth; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. What is noble lies within me.\n\nLaozi said: People have qi of compliance and opposition, born of the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi complies; when the heart is disordered, qi opposes. The order or disorder of the heart lies in the Dao. Attaining the Dao, the heart is ordered; losing the Dao, the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, there is deference; when the heart is disordered, there is contention. Deference engenders virtue; contention breeds harm. With virtue, qi complies; with harm, qi opposes. When qi complies, one diminishes oneself to serve others; when qi opposes, one diminishes others to serve oneself. Qi can be governed by the Dao. The Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to sound: virtue accumulates and fortune arrives; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises. Officialdom corrupts learning; filial piety wanes amid wife and children. Worry breeds disaster; illness worsens when near recovery. Thus, if one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning, no affairs will fail.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The *Yin Fu Jing* says: The five thieves reside in the heart and act upon Heaven’s qi. When qi complies, there is order; when qi opposes, there is chaos. Order brings deference; chaos brings contention. When qi opposes the heart, it harms the self; when qi opposes the times, it harms the state. Only by governing qi with the Dao can one diminish oneself to serve others. Though one’s office flourishes, it cannot corrupt one’s learning; though one has wife and children, they cannot weaken one’s filial piety. How can there be the disaster of worry or the illness of near recovery? If one is cautious to the end, nothing will be lost.\n\nLaozi said: To lift the crooked and place them with the straight—how can this not succeed? To lift the straight and place them with the crooked—do not do so, and they will not go. This is what is meant by “sharing the same filth yet dwelling in different mud.”\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: It does not say “discard the crooked and correct the straight” but rather “lift the crooked and place them with the straight.” Why? To lift the crooked and place them with the straight is to elevate petty men and return them to the noble man—how can this not succeed? To lift the straight and place them with the crooked is to push noble men into the realm of petty men—noble men will not go. To share the same filth yet dwell in different mud is to abide by the petty man’s way, harmonizing without flowing away.\n\nLaozi said: The sage treats life and death as one; the fool also treats life and death as one. The sage’s unity of life and death is clarity regarding the division of principle; the fool’s unity of life and death is ignorance of where benefit and harm lie. The Dao hangs in the heavens and spreads upon the earth; harmony resides in man. If the ruler’s heart is not harmonious, Heaven’s qi will not descend, earth’s qi will not rise, yin and yang will not align, wind and rain will not come in season, and the people will suffer illness and hunger.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The use of harmony is supreme. Heaven attains it, and the ten thousand images are bright; earth attains it, and the ten thousand things are born; man attains it, and the ten thousand affairs are accomplished. Can the ruler’s heart afford to lose harmony? If lost, Heaven and earth will not interact, and the people will suffer illness and hunger. Though sage and fool share the same life and death, what differs lies between righteousness and profit. Profit is the harmony of righteousness. The sage is clear about the division of principle—profit is also righteousness. The fool does not know where benefit and harm lie—righteousness is also profit.\n\nLaozi said: To obtain the troops of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing one apt word. To obtain the Marquis of Sui’s pearl is not as good as obtaining the origin of affairs. To obtain the He Shi jade is not as good as obtaining the proper application of affairs. Though the world is vast, those who delight in using troops will perish; though the state is secure, those who delight in war will be imperiled. Thus, a small state with few people, though possessing weapons of ten or a hundredfold, does not use them.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Yu bowed to wise counsel, dismissed the army, and set the troops in order—thus the Miao people submitted. Hearing one apt word surpasses ten thousand troops. Obtaining the Marquis of Sui’s pearl or the He Shi jade is not as good as obtaining the origin and proper application of affairs. Thus, the sage values the Dao, not treasures; esteems virtue, not merit. How could he willingly endanger himself with troops?\n\nLaozi said: One who can become a hegemon or king must be one whose virtue prevails. One who can prevail over enemies must be strong. One who can be strong must employ the strength of others. One who can employ the strength of others must win their hearts. One who can win their hearts must first win himself. One who wins himself must be yielding and weak. To prevail over those not equal to oneself—when it comes to those equal to oneself, one must be measured. To prevail through yielding surpasses those equal to oneself—its outcome cannot be fathomed. Thus, to achieve great victory with those who cannot prevail—only the sage can do this.",
      "overlap_context": "le; low talent with high position invites danger; no great merit with thick emoluments invites calamity. Thus, some things are increased yet diminished, discarded yet increased. The multitude knows the benefit of benefit but not the harm of harm. Only the sage knows that harm is benefit and benefit is harm. Thus, a tree twice laden with fruit will have its roots injured; a family with much stored wealth will have its posterity imperiled. Great profit reverses into harm—this is the Way of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "He who inherits the meaning of virtue prevails as a hegemon by winning the hearts of others; he who prevails over enemies is strong by employing the strength of others. Yet without winning the hearts of others, none can employ their strength. How then can enemies be overcome? How can strength lead to hegemony? Virtue arises from self-attainment. Self-attainment yields yielding and weakness, which prevail over rigidity and strength. Thus, one can prevail over those not equal to oneself. When it comes to those equal to oneself, this is a case of equal virtue. Yet yielding surpasses those equal to oneself—its outcome cannot be fathomed. Here, virtue again prevails over oneself. Therefore, to achieve great victory with those who cannot prevail—only the sage can do this.\n\n*Wenzi, Inheriting the Meaning, Scroll 4*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, Wenzi, Inheriting the Meaning, Scroll 5*\n*By Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**The Dao and Virtue**\n\nWenzi asked Dao of Laozi, saying: \"When learning is not refined and listening to the Dao is not profound, how can one who listens hope to attain wisdom, perfect conduct, or achieve merit and fame? Without refinement, there is no clarity; without depth, there is no attainment. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with spirit; in middling learning, one listens with the heart; in inferior learning, one listens with the ears. To listen with the ears is to have learning in the skin; to listen with the heart is to have learning in the flesh; to listen with spirit is to have learning in the bone marrow. If listening is not profound, knowledge is not clear; if knowledge is not clear, one cannot exhaust its essence; if one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct cannot be perfected.\n\nIn general, the principle of listening requires an empty mind, tranquility, and the reduction of qi—without excess, without thought, without worry. The eyes must not gaze recklessly, nor the ears listen carelessly. One must concentrate, accumulate, and store within, filling the intent and merging it. Once attained, one must firmly guard it and preserve it for long.\n\nThe Dao is the origin and source of all things, the beginning of all beginnings. It begins in softness and weakness, and is completed in hardness and strength. It begins in brevity and scarcity, and is completed in abundance and length. A tree ten spans in girth begins as a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below. This is the Way of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below; withdrawal is how one places oneself behind; frugality is how one makes oneself small; reduction is how one makes oneself few. Thus, humility leads to honor, withdrawal to precedence, frugality to expansiveness, and reduction to greatness—this is what the Way of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of virtue, the root of Heaven, the gate of fortune. All things depend on it to live, to be completed, and to find peace. The Dao is non-action and formless. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and affairs are established, it neighbors Heaven. It is non-action, yet nothing is left undone. None know its true nature, none know its reality, yet within it there is sincerity.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, all under Heaven submit, and the altars of soil and grain endure. When the feudal lords possess the Dao, the people are harmonious and do not lose their states. When the scholar-commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their persons and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without battle. When the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contention. When affairs are undertaken with the Dao, success is achieved and fortune is gained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness. When father and son possess the Dao, there is affection and filial piety. When scholar-commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao there is harmony; without it, there is harshness. From this, it is evident that the Dao is fitting for all people in all circumstances.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune. When practiced to its fullest, all under Heaven submit. Submission leads to cherishing. Thus, the emperor is the one to whom all under Heaven turn; the king is the one to whom all under Heaven go. If all under Heaven do not turn or go, one cannot be called emperor or king. Therefore, even if an emperor or king gains the people, without the Dao he cannot succeed; even if he gains the people but loses the Dao, he cannot preserve his position.\n\nThose who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and lazy. They are haughty, self-important, and self-aggrandizing. They hold to dominance and rigidity, create difficulties, sow enmity, provoke warfare, and become the instigators of chaos. When petty men practice this, they bring great calamity upon themselves; when great men practice it, their states perish. The calamity may be shallow, affecting only themselves, or deep, extending to their descendants. No crime is greater than lacking the Dao; no resentment is deeper than lacking virtue. This is the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"One who practices the Dao causes others, though brave, to be unable to pierce him, and though skillful, to be unable to strike him. Though they cannot pierce or strike him, he is still humiliated—this is not as good as causing others, though brave, to dare not pierce him, and though skillful, to dare not strike him. Yet even this 'daring not' is not the absence of intent—it is not as good as causing others to have no such intent. When there is no such intent, there is no mind of love or benefit—it is not as good as causing all men and women under Heaven to rejoice and desire to love and benefit him. When this is so, there is no land where one is not a ruler, no office where one is not a leader. All under Heaven wish for his peace and benefit. Thus, courage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life.\"\n\nWenzi asked about virtue. Laozi said: \"To nurture, nourish, foster, and grow; to benefit all without partiality; to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue. What is benevolence? To be above without boasting of merit, to be below without shame of faults; in great matters not to be arrogant, in small matters not to be negligent; to love universally without selfishness, and to endure without decline—this is called benevolence. What is righteousness? To be above and assist the weak, to be below and uphold integrity; when prosperous, not to indulge one’s desires; when impoverished, not to change one’s principles; to measure by the standard, follow principle, and not act selfishly or perversely—this is called righteousness. What is propriety? To be above and be reverent and solemn, to be below and be humble and respectful; to yield and be the female of all under Heaven; to stand in not daring, to establish in inability—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue causes those below to follow commands; cultivating benevolence causes those below not to contend; cultivating righteousness causes those below to be upright; cultivating propriety causes those below to be respectful. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure. Therefore, the Dao gives birth to things; virtue nurtures them; benevolence loves them; righteousness rectifies them; propriety respects them. Without nurturing and nourishing, one cannot foster growth; without kindness and love, one cannot bring to completion; without rectitude and correction, one cannot endure; without respect and honor, one cannot esteem and value. Thus, virtue is what the people cherish; benevolence is what the people embrace; righteousness is what the people fear; propriety is what the people respect. These four are the proper sequence of culture and the means by which the sage governs the myriad things.\n\nWhen the noble man lacks virtue, those below resent him; without benevolence, those below contend; without righteousness, those below are violent; without propriety, those below are chaotic. When these four classics are not established, it is called lacking the Dao. There has never been one who lacked the Dao and did not perish.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"In the age of utmost virtue, merchants find convenience in the marketplace, farmers delight in the fields, great officers are secure in their posts, recluses cultivate their ways, and the people enjoy their occupations. Thus, wind and rain do not destroy, plants and trees do not die prematurely, the Yellow River yields its diagrams, and the Luo River yields its writings. When the age declines, taxes and levies are without measure, killing and execution are unceasing, those who remonstrate with punishments are killed, and worthy scholars are suppressed. Thus, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, creeping things do not rest, and the wilds lack all vegetation.\n\nTherefore, when the world is well-governed, even fools cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil in life. When the utmost virtue and the Dao prevail, it is fate. Thus, life encounters fate and then can act; fate meets the times and then can be understood. There must be the right age before there can be the right person.\"",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom. Laozi said: \"To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. Thus, the sage constantly perceives where fortune and misfortune arise and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise constantly see fortune and misfortune take shape and choose their conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious of Heaven’s Dao, thus knowing where fortune and misfortune arise. The wise foresee their formation, thus knowing the gateway of fortune and misfortune. To hear before they arise is sagacity; to see before they form is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"If a ruler favors righteousness, he will trust the times and rely on himself, abandoning calculation to employ kindness. Broad knowledge with shallow means cannot deeply provide; broadness without depth has never existed. Relying solely on one’s wisdom, failures will be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhausted strategies; favoring courage is the path to peril and ruin. Favoring bestowal leads to no fixed share—if the ruler’s portion is not fixed, the people’s expectations will be endless. If heavy exactions are made, it turns the people into enemies. Taking little but giving much, such calculations will cease. Thus, favoring bestowal is the path that invites resentment. From this, it is clear: wealth is insufficient to employ the Dao and its arts; one must rely on clarity.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How did the kings of antiquity govern the world with the Dao?\" Laozi said: \"They held to the One and practiced non-action, following Heaven and Earth and adapting to their transformations. The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped or acted upon. To act is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it. Those who grasp see only the small; seeing the small, they cannot accomplish the great. Non-action means maintaining stillness. By maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in great fullness without overflowing, dwelling in high nobility without arrogance—abiding in greatness without overflowing, full yet not deficient; dwelling above without arrogance, exalted yet not imperiled; full yet not deficient, thus long preserving wealth; exalted yet not imperiled, thus long preserving nobility. Wealth and nobility do not depart from one’s person, and blessings extend to descendants. The kingly Dao of antiquity was complete in this.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The people have a Dao they all follow, laws they all uphold. Righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler holds to the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Dao is not for action but for non-action. The wise do not make virtue their task; the brave do not employ force for violence; the benevolent do not use position for favor—this is called unity. Unity is the Dao without preference, the root of the myriad things. If a ruler frequently changes the state’s laws, and the state frequently changes its ruler, people use their positions to pursue their likes and dislikes, and the tasks of subordinates become unmanageable. Thus, if a ruler loses the One, the chaos is worse than having no ruler. The ruler must hold to the One before he can unite the many.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How many are the kingly ways?\" Laozi said: \"Only one.\" Wenzi said: \"In antiquity, some ruled with the Dao, others with military force—how are they one?\" Laozi said: \"Those who rule with the Dao do so through virtue; those who rule with military force also do so through virtue. In the use of arms, there are five types: righteous armies, responsive armies, resentful armies, greedy armies, and arrogant armies. Punishing the violent and aiding the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use force, it is called responsive; contending over small matters without restraining one’s heart is called resentful; desiring others’ lands and coveting their wealth is called greedy; relying on one’s state’s greatness, boasting of its people’s multitude, and seeking superiority over enemy states is called arrogant. Righteous armies triumph; responsive armies prevail; resentful armies are defeated; greedy armies perish; arrogant armies are destroyed—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Abandoning the Dao to rely on wisdom leads to peril; discarding calculation to employ talent leads to distress. Thus, maintaining one’s role and following principle, one does not grieve over losses nor rejoice over gains. Success is not sought; what is obtained is not pursued. Incoming, there is reception without taking; outgoing, there is bestowal without giving. Following spring to give life, following autumn to bring death—those who live owe no gratitude; those who die bear no resentment. This is near to the Dao.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How does a ruler gain the people’s joyful hearts?\" Laozi said: \"Be like the rivers and seas—bland and without flavor, inexhaustible in use. Putting the small before the great, if one wishes to lead others, one must humble one’s words before them; if one wishes to precede others, one must place oneself behind them. The world must emulate one’s joy and love, advancing one’s benevolence and righteousness without harshness. Dwelling above, the people do not find one burdensome; standing before them, the multitude is not harmed. The world delights in advancing one without weariness. Though distant lands and foreign customs, even the flying insects and creeping things, none are not cherished and loved. There is nowhere one does not reach, no place one does not succeed. Thus, one is honored by the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Holding to the world’s laws and records to oppose the customs of succeeding generations is like gluing the pegs of a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexible adaptation, applying measures suited to circumstances. As eras differ, affairs change; as times shift, customs transform. Thus, one does not model after already established laws but models after the principles that create laws, moving with transformation. The sage’s laws can be observed, but the reasons for their creation cannot be traced; his words can be heard, but the sources of his speech cannot be discerned. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, considered the myriad things insignificant, equated life and death, and harmonized with change. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the feelings of the myriad things. Above, they befriended the Dao; below, they accompanied transformation. Now, if one wishes to learn their Dao but does not attain their clarity and mysterious sagacity, merely adhering to their laws and records and enforcing their statutes and decrees, one certainly cannot govern effectively.\"\n\nWenzi asked about governance. Laozi said: \"Guide them with the Dao, nourish them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not impose force. Diminish and hold to the One. Have no place for profit, no display of desire. Be square without cutting, be sharp without wounding. Be without pride, without boasting. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will attach themselves; nourish them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not impose force, and the people will be simple. Not displaying worthiness is frugality; not imposing force is humility. Descend to gather them, bestow to obtain them, be frugal to preserve oneself, be humble to secure oneself. Without descending, they scatter; without nourishing, they rebel. Displaying worthiness causes the people to contend; imposing force causes them to resent. Scattering weakens the state’s power; rebellion strips the ruler of authority. Contention leads to disregard for wrongdoing; resentment of superiors endangers one’s position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Dao is near.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The superior’s words are employed by the inferior; the inferior’s words are employed by the superior. The superior’s words are constantly used; the inferior’s words are used flexibly. Only the sage can know the flexible words and yet be certain, fulfill expectations and yet be appropriate. The highest conduct in the world is to testify for one’s father with integrity, for one’s daughter to die for trust—who can esteem such? Thus, the sage discusses the right and wrong of affairs, bending and extending with them without fixed standards. When blessed, he is a named lord; when drowned, he is seized by his father—circumstances compel this. Flexibility is how the sage uniquely foresees. To first oppose and then conform is called flexibility; to first conform and then oppose is to not know flexibility. Those who do not know flexibility turn good into ugliness.\"",
      "overlap_context": "rs dry up, creeping things do not rest, and the wilds lack all vegetation.\n\nTherefore, when the world is well-governed, even fools cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil in life. When the utmost virtue and the Dao prevail, it is fate. Thus, life encounters fate and then can act; fate meets the times and then can be understood. There must be the right age before there can be the right person.\"",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi asked, \"Master, in your teaching, none but the Dao and virtue can govern the world. Yet among the kings of antiquity who inherited their thrones and continued their legacies, some were without the Dao—how did they pass their eras without calamity or ruin?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own life, yet the sustenance varies in abundance. The world often sees states perish and families break apart, not for lack of the Dao and virtue. With the Dao and virtue, one rises early and retires late, ever vigilant, trembling with fear of peril. Without the Dao and virtue, one indulges desires and grows indolent—ruin comes without warning. Had Jie and Zhou followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even the worthy Tang and Wu could have achieved no merit.\n\nThe Dao and virtue are what nurture life, what rear and sustain, what foster love and affection, what command respect and esteem. Even the deaf and mute, though foolish, do not harm what they love. If all under heaven held a heart of benevolence and love, how could disaster or misfortune arise?\n\nThose without the Dao yet free from harm still retain some thread of benevolence, some remnant of righteousness. But when benevolence is not wholly severed and righteousness not entirely lost, the feudal lords grow contemptuous of their superiors. When lords scorn their superiors, the court becomes irreverent. Should they then defy orders and disobey, when benevolence is severed and righteousness lost, lords rebel, the strong oppress the weak, the great encroach upon the small, and the people take assault as their trade. Disasters arise, chaos erupts—ruin comes swiftly. How could one expect to escape harm?\n\nLaozi said, \"When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people grow deceitful. When the ruler is meddlesome, the subjects adopt many guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To create trouble to resolve trouble is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate peril through cunning and then rely on cunning to guard against it is like stirring water and hoping for clarity.\n\nLaozi said, \"If a ruler favors benevolence, he rewards those without merit and pardons the guilty. If he favors punishment, he dismisses the meritorious and condemns the innocent. Without preferences or aversions, he metes out punishment without resentment and bestows favors without expectation. He follows the plumb line and levels himself by the standard, remaining uninvolved like heaven and earth. How could he not cover and sustain, harmonizing all? To unite and reconcile is the role of the ruler; to distinguish and punish is the function of the law. When the people accept punishment without resentment, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said, \"Under heaven, right and wrong are never fixed. Each age approves what it deems good and condemns what it loathes. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but what aligns with themselves. They do not reject wickedness but what contradicts their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and abide by it, to select what is wrong and discard it, I would not know what the world calls right or wrong. Thus, governing a great state is like frying a small fish—do not stir it.\n\nThose who rush to conform speak to flatter and grow closer, yet when their counsel is sound, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await the world’s response, how would I know what the age expects of me? If I raced with the crowd, it would be like fleeing the rain—nowhere to go without getting drenched. To desire emptiness yet be unable to attain it—only one who does not strive for emptiness yet naturally embodies it achieves what they seek without fail.\n\nThus, one who penetrates the Dao is like a chariot’s axle: it does not move itself yet, with the wheel, travels a thousand miles, turning endlessly on the infinite plain. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao, returning to the ultimate and unchanging, awaiting transformation. Moving yet without action.\n\nLaozi said, \"A state that wages frequent wars and achieves repeated victories will surely perish. Frequent wars exhaust the people; repeated victories make the ruler arrogant. An arrogant ruler indulges without restraint, pushing things to extremes; an exhausted people grow resentful, their grievances reaching their limit. When both ruler and people are at their extremes, ruin is inevitable. Thus, to withdraw when one’s work is done is the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi, \"I have heard that you attained the Dao from Lao Dan. Yet even worthy men, though possessed of the Dao, encounter eras of chaos. With the authority of one man, how can they transform a long-corrupted people?\"\n\nWenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue correct the crooked to make it straight, quell disorder to restore order, and refine excess to return to simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world finds peace—all hinges on the one man. The ruler is the people’s teacher; the superior is the inferior’s model. If the superior embodies beauty, the inferior emulates it. If the superior possesses the Dao and virtue, the inferior cultivates benevolence and righteousness. With benevolence and righteousness below, there can be no age of chaos.\n\nAccumulated virtue makes a king; accumulated resentment makes ruin. Piled stones form a mountain; gathered waters form a sea. Nothing is accomplished without accumulation. One who accumulates the Dao and virtue gains the favor of heaven, the aid of earth, the assistance of spirits. Phoenixes soar in his courtyard; qilin roam his outskirts; dragons dwell in his ponds. Thus, to govern the world with the Dao is to be the world’s virtue; to govern without the Dao is to be the world’s scourge. To set oneself against the world as an enemy is to court destruction—longevity is unattainable.\"",

The Dao of the Three Dynasties has declined, and the virtue of the Five Hegemons has waned. Thus, it is fitting to cultivate virtue to bring the world into submission.

When the heart is ordered, the hundred limbs are at peace; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred limbs are in chaos.\n\nThe old commentary states: Governing the state lies in the ruler’s clarity; when clear, the myriad people delight in their work. Cultivating the self lies in rectifying the heart; when rectified, the hundred limbs rest in their proper place.\n\nThus, when the self is ordered, the limbs are free from affliction.\nThe old commentary states: Without illness or suffering.\n\nWhen the state is ordered, ruler and minister forget one another.\nThe old commentary states: Without anxiety or care.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Virtue is one, yet it has two aspects. Nurturing the myriad things is the virtue of heaven; cherishing and nourishing the hundred clans is the virtue of the ruler. The ruler is the heart of the state. When the ruler possesses virtue, the heart is expansive, the body at ease, the qi unconfused, and the self is naturally ordered. Governing the state is like cultivating the self. When ruler and minister are at peace, can the state fail to be ordered? Thus it is said: \"Supreme virtue does not act as virtue\"—this means possessing virtue without relying on it as virtue, and so virtue is truly present.\n\nLord Lao studied under Chang Cong.\nThe old commentary states: The teacher of Lord Lao, surnamed Chang, named Cong. Lord Lao himself said he received instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: \"See the ancient and embrace softness.\"\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"ancient\" as \"tongue.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Seeing the ancient Dao, one embraces the feminine and yielding.

      "translated_text": "Retiring, one gazes upon the river.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"目\" as \"因,\" an error for \"目.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Lamenting that all things in passage never cease.\n\nObserving one’s shadow, one knows to hold to what comes after.\nThe old commentary states: Not preceding things.\nThus the sage is empty and non-contending, following the constant and remaining behind rather than ahead—like stacked firewood, where what is kindled later lies above.\nThe old commentary states: What comes after is first; what is below is above. This is the constant principle of things. He who seeks to be first among others cannot be first.\n\nZuan Yi: Chang Cong was a sage of antiquity. Laozi studied under Chang Cong as Confucius studied under Laozi. Laozi perceived the Dao with his eyes and spirit, thus able to \"see the ancient and embrace softness\" and \"observe his shadow and know to hold to what comes after.\" Therefore, the sage follows the empty and non-contending, neither striving nor daring to be first. This is called \"supreme virtue.\"\n\nLaozi said: The clapper sounds and destroys itself; the candle burns and consumes itself. The patterns of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the agility of gibbons and monkeys brings capture. Thus the valiant perish through strength, the eloquent are ensnared by their wit, and those who rely on knowledge know only what can be known, not what cannot.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition omits the character \"而\" in the phrase \"而未能以智不知.\"*\nThe old commentary states: This is to say that ability harms oneself, while inability preserves oneself; knowledge destroys oneself, while ignorance sustains oneself.\n\nThus, courage in a single ability or discernment in a single argument may suffice for narrow persuasion but not for broad response.\nThe old commentary states: Holding to the courage of a common man cannot govern the multitude; clinging to a corner’s argument is not the way of thoroughfare.\n\nZuan Yi: People value virtue, not excessive knowledge. With too much knowledge, one strays from oneself and returns to oneself—rarely does this not bring harm. The patterns of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the agility of gibbons and monkeys brings capture. The valiant die by their strength, the wise are ensnared by their eloquence—this is fitting. Only he who does not rely on knowledge to know but on knowledge to *not* know is not confined to one corner but responds broadly.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao takes non-being as its essence.\nThe old commentary states: The essence of the Dao is emptiness and non-being—what is called subtle and wondrous.\n\nWhat is seen but has no form, heard but makes no sound, is called \"dark and obscure.\" Yet \"dark and obscure\" is how the Dao is discussed, not the Dao itself.\nThe old commentary states: Like the fish-trap is for catching fish but is not the fish, words discuss the Dao but are not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is perceived by inward reflection.\nThe old commentary states: Turning the ear inward and gazing within, one finds it within oneself.\n\nThus, one who does not indulge in petty learning does not fall into great delusion; one who does not indulge in petty cleverness does not fall into great folly.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"不小学\" as \"不小觉.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Clutching a firefly’s glow to compare with the sun—what delusion could be greater? Holding a pebble to match a piece of jade—what folly could be greater?\n\nDo not mirror yourself in flowing waters but in still waters, for their inner stillness keeps them from outward disturbance.\nThe old commentary states: When the mind’s dust scatters outward, it flows turbid and remains dim; when water’s nature is inwardly empty, it is deep and clear, mirroring itself.\n\nWhen the moon is full, the sun’s light is diminished. Time cannot be entrusted to the yang; when the sun rises, the stars fade and cannot compete with its brilliance. The branch cannot be stronger than the trunk; the top cannot outweigh the bottom without risking collapse.\nThe old commentary states: This means that the great ruler issues commands, and petty men should not be employed. If they are, it is like yin usurping the sun’s light. The root and branch should be proportionate, the noble and base in their proper places—then there will be no danger of toppling or ruin.\n\nA single abyss does not harbor two dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. Where there is oneness, there is stability; where there are two, there is strife.\nThe old commentary states: When the ruler is one, the state is at peace; when the lord is one, the heart is at ease.\n\nJade lies in the mountain, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the banks do not wither.\nThe old commentary states: Mountains and rivers conceal jade and become lush; the noble accumulates virtue and radiates brilliance.\n\nThe earthworm has no strong sinews or sharp claws and teeth, yet above it eats the dry clods, below it drinks the yellow springs—all through the unity of its mind.\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"上食晞块\" as \"上食晞堁.\"*\nThe old commentary states: When the earthworm is hungry, it eats soil; when thirsty, it drinks water—it has no other concerns, so it needs no sinews or claws. When a person unifies the mind and guards the Dao, what need is there for fame or profit to feel content?\n\nZuan Yi: The Dao takes non-being as its essence, so it can coexist with all things. Things take form as their function, so they cannot stand together. Non-being as essence brings unity and stability; form as function brings duality and strife. Yet there are distinctions between great and small, divisions between ruler and minister. If the ruler embraces the Dao and holds to virtue, never claiming them as his own—this is why the Dao is great and virtue enduring. Who in the world would dare to contend with such strength?\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water can reveal the pupil of the eye. Turbidity brings harm: a river’s waters cannot reveal Mount Tai.\nThe old commentary states: Though small, clarity can reflect the finest details; though vast, turbidity cannot reveal even mountains and peaks.\n\nOrchids and iris do not cease to be fragrant because no one wears them; a boat does not sink in rivers and seas because no one rides it. The noble person practices the Dao not because no one knows him but because it is his nature to do so.\nThe old commentary states: The fragrance of orchids and iris is their nature—they cannot but be fragrant. The noble person’s practice of goodness is the Dao—he cannot but act.\n\nEntering the turbid with clarity brings distress and disgrace; entering the clear with turbidity brings ruin and collapse.\nThe old commentary states: The worthy and the foolish do not stand together; the clear and the turbid are not the same vessel.",
      "overlap_context": "hang, named Cong. Lord Lao himself said he received instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: \"See the ancient and embrace softness.\"\n*Editor’s note: The Ming printed edition reads \"ancient\" as \"tongue.\"*\nThe old commentary states: Seeing the ancient Dao, one embraces the feminine and yielding. The character for \"ancient\" was originally written as \"tongue,\" which also signifies softness.\n\nGaze up at the eaves and trees.\nThe old commentary states: Cherishing the fleeting light of time.",

      "translated_text": "The two qi of heaven form the rainbow; the two qi of earth leak and store; the two qi of man generate illness. The old commentary states: The Dao of the Three Powers values unity above all. Yin and yang cannot be both winter and summer at once; the moon cannot know day, nor the sun know night. The old commentary states: Winter and summer cannot be confused; day and night do not encroach upon one another.\n\nWhere rivers are broad, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall; where the land is vast, virtue is profound. The old commentary states: If rivers are not broad, they cannot nurture giant scales; if wisdom is not comprehensive, it cannot reach the ultimate principle. Thus, one knows that without profound virtue, one cannot deeply understand or see far.\n\nTherefore, fish cannot be caught without bait; beasts cannot be summoned with empty vessels. The old commentary states: Things cannot be obtained by sitting idly; the Dao cannot be attained without the proper means.\n\nWhere mountains have fierce beasts, their forests remain uncut; where gardens have stinging insects, their mallows and beans remain unpicked; where a state has worthy ministers, it repels enemies a thousand *li* away. The old commentary states: Fierce beasts and stinging insects still shelter grass and trees; worthy and noble persons naturally aid their lord and people.\n\nOne who is attuned to the Dao is like a wheel’s axle turning within the hub: it does not move itself, yet with it, one travels a thousand *li*, ever returning to the beginning, revolving in an inexhaustible source. The old commentary states: This has been explained previously.\n\nThus, to lift the crooked while ignoring the straight—how can this suffice? Do not lift the straight while abandoning the crooked; do not proceed once the goal is achieved. The old commentary states: This explains the \"Tallying Words\" chapter.\n\nWater’s clarity mirrors reflections; the heart’s clarity mirrors things with clarity. When turbid, all is obscured. The noble and the petty cannot stand together; winter’s cold and summer’s heat cannot coexist. If they do, disasters and plagues arise; if both hold power, calamities ensue. Yet how can the noble, seeing the petty in office and the Dao obstructed, forever remain withdrawn?\n\nA bird is about to arrive, and one sets a net to await it. The bird is caught by a single mesh of the net—yet if one sets a net of but one mesh, the bird will never be caught. The old commentary states: Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient to govern the many; a net of one mesh cannot catch birds.\n\nThus, some matters cannot be planned in advance; some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment. The old commentary states: The sage’s conduct follows heaven; his actions follow the times. When the time has not come, he guards the Dao; when it arrives, he acts. This is how King Wen rose to establish the Zhou and how Emperor Gaozu flourished to build the Han.\n\nTo attract fish, first clear the valley streams; to seek birds, first plant trees. Water gathers, and fish assemble; trees flourish, and birds gather. To obtain fish, one does not carry them into the depths; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees. One simply follows what benefits them. The old commentary states: The mutual reliance of lord and minister is like fish returning to water and birds nesting in trees. Following what benefits them, they come unbidden. Thus, a wise ruler in the world naturally draws loyal worthies.\n\nWhat the feet tread is shallow, yet one must await what they do not tread to walk; what the heart knows is limited, yet one must await what it does not know to attain clarity. The old commentary states: What the feet tread is little; what they do not tread is much. What the heart knows is few; what it does not know is many. By not using what is unused, its use is perfected; by not knowing what is unknown, its knowledge is preserved.\n\nWhen rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, deep pools fill; when lips are gone, teeth grow cold; when river waters run deep, fertile soil remains in the mountains. The old commentary states: This well illustrates how lord and people depend on one another, just as mountains and rivers connect. When river waters run deep, rich soil remains in the mountains; when the lord levies heavily, the people’s wealth is exhausted. When those above demand, those below are depleted. When the people’s strength is spent, the lord’s position is imperiled—this is the meaning of \"when lips are gone, teeth grow cold.\"\n\nWhen water is still, it is clear; when clear, it is level; when level, it is easy to see the forms of things. Yet forms cannot be taken as the standard. The old commentary states: When the ruler is enlightened, it is like still water’s clarity, deeply reflecting the true nature of things—good and evil cannot escape its scrutiny. When governance is even and harmonious, its policies spread.\n\nTo summarize: Those who know the essentials of governance understand that ruling a state depends on one person, not the many. Without first cultivating scholars, can one obtain worthies? Thus, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment. When the right person is found, the state flourishes—none will fail to serve him.\n\nLeaves fall because the wind shakes them; water grows turbid because things disturb it. The old commentary states: Without wind, trees shed leaves on their own; without disturbance, water remains clear—this has never been otherwise.\n\nThe beauty of jade and fine rings comes from the polishing of *jian* stone; the sharpness of *Moye* and *Yanyue* swords comes from the grinding of whetstones. The old commentary states: Even fine jade and precious swords, though naturally excellent, ultimately rely on the work of whetstones to become extraordinary implements. Likewise, though the noble and worthy possess talent and quality, they ultimately rely on teachers and masters to perfect their work.\n\nFang Yu and Ji could travel a thousand *li* without flying; without provisions, they did not hunger. The old commentary states: When a state relies on worthies, its achievements are great, and it rests without worry. When things attach to the good, their reach is far, and they move swiftly without labor.\n\nWhen the cunning hare is caught, the hunting dog is cooked. The old commentary states: This is the inevitable outcome.\n\nWhen the high-flying birds are gone, the fine bow is put away. The old commentary states: It is no longer used.\n\nWhen fame is achieved and success attained, one retreats—this is the Way of Heaven. The old commentary states: One who understands the proper times for advance and retreat, who exhausts the principles of rise and fall, who embraces the Dao and guards virtue, preserving his person and protecting his name—such a one may be called worthy.\n\nAnger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. Seeing in the absence of forms, one obtains true vision; hearing in the absence of sound, one obtains true hearing. The old commentary states: Human nature is originally without anger—anger arises from circumstances. Human nature is originally without action—action arises from desires. To know that anger is excessive and action is improper, one must inwardly see what has no form and reverse-hear what has no sound. This means returning to one’s original nature, where there is no sound, no form, no anger, no action. What is valued is seeing what is not there—seeing what is.\n\nFlying birds return to their homeland; hares run back to their burrows; foxes die with their heads toward the hills; cold cicadas cling to trees—each depends on its origin. The old commentary states: Creatures do not forget their roots; people, however, may stray from the Dao.\n\nTo summarize: The Dao can be practiced alone, but it cannot be monopolized alone. A man may walk vigorously, yet after a hundred *li*, he tires. With a fine horse, a thousand *li* can be reached. Anger arises from non-anger—this is how Kings Wen and Wu pacified the world’s people. Action arises from non-action—this is how Yao and Shun achieved governance without effort. For the state, those who skillfully employ others—how could the people not know where to return?\n\nTo obtain fish, one does not carry them into the depths; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees. One simply follows what benefits them. The old commentary states: The mutual reliance of lord and minister is like fish returning to water and birds nesting in trees. Following what benefits them, they come unbidden. Thus, a wise ruler in the world naturally draws loyal worthies.\n\nWhat the feet tread is shallow, yet one must await what they do not tread to walk; what the heart knows is limited, yet one must await what it does not know to attain clarity. The old commentary states: What the feet tread is little; what they do not tread is much. What the heart knows is few; what it does not know is many.

      "translated_text": "Water and fire despise each other, yet the tripod stands between them, harmonizing the five flavors; bones and flesh love one another, yet slanderers sow discord between them, endangering father and son. The old commentary states: The natures of things may be opposed—though water and fire attack each other, when used with proper method, they achieve harmony. Father and son love one another, yet slander and malice sow suspicion between them. The worthy cannot but be discerning.\n\nDogs and swine eat from any vessel and grow fat, hastening their death.

Can clear, cool waters be used to rinse my cap strings?\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of neither rejecting the muddy nor favoring the clear—both worthy and unworthy are employed, but each is given tasks according to ability and matched to their nature.\n\nSilk floss may become either a cap or a sock. *[Pronounced \"wà.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: Its use is not fixed.\nA cap is worn on the head, while socks are trampled underfoot.\nThe old commentary states: There is no conflict in their roles; each fulfills its proper function.\n\nTo continue the meaning: People have no constant right, things have no constant wrong. When qi flows in accord, they unite; when qi flows in opposition, they part. Fire flames upward, water moistens downward—when the tripod harmonizes them, the work of \"Completion\" is achieved. When a father is kind and a son filial, slanderers sow discord, and the enmity of Shen and Shang arises. Dogs and swine grow fat and near death; the phoenix soars high, beyond reach. Clear waters rinse cap strings, turbid waters wash feet—yet those who cannot purify themselves and instead soil others should take heed.\n\nThe power of metal overcomes wood, yet a single blade cannot fell a forest; the power of earth overcomes water, yet a handful cannot dam rivers and streams; the power of water overcomes fire, yet a ladle cannot extinguish a cartload of kindling.\nThe old commentary states: This illustrates how one man’s uprightness cannot correct many crooked ways, nor can one man’s wisdom enlighten a multitude of delusions.\n\nIn winter, there is thunder; in summer, there is hail. Cold and heat do not alter their seasons, and frost and snow fall thickly. *[Pronounced \"biāo,\" meaning \"abundant.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: *[Biāo, from *bēi xiū*, meaning \"dense.\"]*\nThe sun rises and flows onward.\nThe old commentary states: Winter thunder and summer hail cannot fully disrupt the seasons; the sun’s turning light cannot be fixed by frost and snow.\n\nCollapse is easy to overturn; leaning is easy to topple. *[Pronounced \"fǔ.\"]*\nNearness is easy to assist; dampness is easy to rain upon.\nThe old commentary states: The worthy draw near to the good, while the foolish draw near to the wicked—their influence is easily followed, their affairs easily tainted.\n\nOrchids and angelica are fragrant, yet when touched by frost, toads and toads alone repel weapons and live long—on the full moon of the fifth month. *[According to the *Wanbi Shu*: \"On the fifth month’s full moon, kill a toad and apply its blood to weapons; entering battle, one will not be harmed.\"]*\nThe old commentary states: These all have their uses yet suffer harm—how much better to remain nameless and preserve oneself.\n\nThose who dissipate their essence are easily broken within.\nThe old commentary states: When inner essence is expended, outer branches and trunk wither.\n\nFruit that blooms out of season should not be eaten.\nThe old commentary states: To eat what is not in season brings illness; to take what is not in accord with right brings harm.\n\nTo continue the meaning: The mutual overcoming of the Five Phases has its fixed order. When the weak take on what is too great, none do not in the end suffer its control. Wood overcomes metal, water overcomes earth, fire overcomes water—yet these are not their true natures. Winter thunder and summer hail are not their proper seasons, and their duration is not even a morning or evening. How can one fail to measure oneself?\n\nWhich fails first, the tongue or the teeth? Which remains straight longer, the rope or the arrow?\nThe old commentary states: The hard, though firm, comes to ruin; the soft, though yielding, sets things right.\n\nIt is form that makes the shadow crooked; it is sound that makes the echo muddy.\nThe old commentary states: When form is upright, the shadow cannot be crooked; when words are good, the echo cannot be bad.\n\nThose who share the same illness as the dead are difficult to cure; those who follow the same path as a ruined state cannot offer loyal counsel.\nThe old commentary states: A fatal illness cannot be saved, even by a skilled physician; a doomed state cannot be preserved, even by a loyal minister.\n\nHave musicians play the *yu*; have craftsmen shape the holes—though they may hit the notes, they cannot be made to judge the ruler’s form, for it is lost.\nThe old commentary states: The musician is the performer; the craftsman shapes instruments. This speaks of musicians playing the *yu* and craftsmen shaping the holes—though the rhythm may be correct, their functions differ. Heart and hand do not respond; how can they judge? This means the ruler’s form is lost.\n\nThe deaf do not sing, for they have no way to delight themselves; the blind do not gaze, for they have no way to engage with things.\nThe old commentary states: Sound does not reach the ears, so they cut off thoughts of joy; color does not meet the eyes, so they cease observation in the heart.",
      "overlap_context": "hus, a wise ruler in the world naturally draws loyal worthies.\n\nWhat the feet tread is shallow, yet one must await what they do not tread to walk; what the heart knows is limited, yet one must await what it does not know to attain clarity. The old commentary states: What the feet tread is little; what they do not tread is much. What the heart knows is few; what it does not know is many. By not using what is unused, its use is perfected; by not knowing what is unknown, its knowledge is preserved.",

      "translated_text": "One who walks through the forest cannot take the straight path; one who travels through peril cannot tread the plumb line.\nThe old commentary states: Walking through the forest, one does not seek the crisscrossing paths but focuses on moving forward; treading through peril, one does not follow the carpenter’s square and compass but acts to overcome danger.\n\nWhat the seas and lands produce endures, and thus can be great.\nThe old commentary states: Born without ceasing, used without exhaustion—thus it is called great.\n\nTo carry on virtue in a place not one’s own, to rely on those not one’s kin—how difficult this is! Teeth, though hard, break first; arrows, though strong, snap first. This is like a fatal illness where even a skilled physician cannot save, or a doomed state where even a loyal minister cannot preserve.\nWhen a ruler abandons the Dao and a minister forces his counsel, their minds diverge—can success be achieved?\n\nThe sun does not rise twice; the fox does not have two alphas. The spirit-dragon does not pair; fierce beasts do not flock. Birds of prey do not fly in pairs.\nThe old commentary states: These all stand alone and do not flock, thus they become leaders of the hundred beasts and flocks of birds.\n\nWithout the canopy’s ribs, the sun’s wheel cannot be shaded; without the spokes, swiftness cannot be pursued. Yet the wheel alone is not sufficient to rely upon.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of how things mutually depend on one another and cannot be entrusted to one side alone.\n\nTo draw a bow and shoot, without the bowstring the arrow cannot be loosed—such is but one-tenth of archery.\nThe old commentary states: Though the bow may be strong, without the bowstring it cannot hit the mark. Though the ruler may be sagely, without loyalty, nothing can be accomplished in governance. Among all who draw the bow, many seek to shoot, but those who truly aim to hit the mark are but one in ten. So too are those who seek office plentiful, but those who seek worthiness are as rare as one in ten thousand.\n\nA starving horse in the stable makes no sound; cast fodder beside it, and its competitive heart arises.\nThe old commentary states: When one lacking fodder is given it, they will contend. Those thirsting for fame and position, once given it, will surely compete. Thus the noble person yields their emolument, while the petty person vies for rank.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot hold even ten *shi* of the world’s grain, yet with a stopper, it can hold a hundred *dou*.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of the insatiable greed of the avaricious, which has no limit, just as a vessel without a bottom is difficult to fill.\n\nCutting along the plumb line will not err; measuring with the suspended balance will not miscalculate. Suspending the ancient methods of the *jun* and *zhuo* may at times succeed, while implements like the staff and cangue may at times be applied. To act in accord with this is called judgment; to act contrary to it is called chaos.\nThe old commentary states: Moving in accord with the plumb line, nothing can transgress it; establishing measures with the suspended balance, nothing will be amiss. As ancient and modern times differ, so too do laws and standards. Adapting to the times brings order; clinging to obsolete methods brings chaos.\n\nTo carry on virtue, the sun does not rise twice, the spirit-dragon does not pair, fierce beasts do not flock—how much more so for humans! The ribs support the canopy; the axle turns the wheel—this is the Dao of mutual reliance between ruler and minister. A starving horse contends for fodder; rewards must not be recklessly bestowed. Cutting along the plumb line, the law does not err; ancient methods and implements are applied in their proper time—it lies in the hands of those who enact them.\n\nThe farmer toils while the noble person is nourished; the foolish speak while the wise select.\nThe old commentary states: In plowing, toil lies within; in learning, emolument lies within.\n\nTo see clearly is to handle things as jade and stone; to see dimly and obscurely is to surely retain one’s schemes.\nThe old commentary states: When the principles of affairs are clear, they can be distinctly divided without doubt. But when perception is crude and hasty, understanding becomes difficult, and thus one’s schemes are preserved.\n\nThe brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows fully opened do not equal the brightness of one door.\nThe old commentary states: Though petty persons may be many, they are not sufficient to be entrusted; though a worthy person may be few, one is more than enough. King Wen obtained Lü Wang; Gaozu obtained Zhang Liang—does it lie in numbers?\n\nThe venomous snake cannot be given feet; the tiger cannot be given wings.\nThe old commentary states: No person is perfectly capable; no thing is doubly excellent.",

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nA six-foot mat—lying down, even an inferior talent can cross beneath it; standing, even a superior talent cannot step over it. The difference lies in the circumstances.\nThe old commentary states: Clearly, people’s talents are unequal. In one situation, they may excel; in another, they may falter. Their abilities differ, and so do their outcomes.\n\nThose who assist in sacrifices may taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights may be wounded.\nThe old commentary states: When one encounters goodness, one receives its blessings; when one meets evil, one suffers harm.\n\nSheltering beneath an ill-omened tree, one may be struck by thunder.\nThe old commentary states: Taking refuge under an ill-omened tree, one cannot escape Heaven’s wrath; harboring an evil person, one will surely face the nation’s law.\n\nThe sun and moon wish to shine, but floating clouds obscure them; the river wishes to run clear, but sand and soil pollute it. The orchid wishes to flourish, but autumn winds wither it; human nature wishes to be balanced, but desires harm it. Covered in dust, how can one avoid being blinded? Purity is unattainable.\nThe old commentary states: Dwelling in darkness, how can one perceive brightness? Living amid desires, what one is tainted by becomes like frost and sleet falling together—how can orchids and irises preserve their fragrance? Sand and mud pollute the flow, so how can the river’s source remain pure?\n\nGold and jade with tortoise-shell knobs may be worn by the worthy as ornaments; earth and soil may be spread upon the ground, yet the capable consider them wealth.\nThe old commentary states: Those who do not recognize their use may treat gold and jade as dung; those who know their application may regard earth and soil as jewels.\n\nThus, giving gold and jade to the weak is not as good as giving them plain silk.\nThe old commentary states: The weak here refers to the foolish. Giving them plain silk may preserve them, but giving them gold and jade will harm them—just as petty men should not occupy high positions, for it will surely lead to danger and ruin.\n\nIf the plowman does not toil, the gentleman has nothing to eat; if the gentleman does not govern, how can the plowman be at peace? A snake cannot have feet, nor a tiger wings—one cannot have both. Floating clouds cover the sun, but the fault does not lie with the sun; desires harm one’s nature, but the illness does not come from others.\n\nA wheel’s hub is hollow at its center, and the thirty spokes each exert their strength. If one spoke were to protrude alone, all the others would be abandoned—how then could it travel near or far?\nThe old commentary states: A cart must rely on many spokes to achieve its purpose of long travel; governing a state must also depend on many talents to secure lasting peace.\n\nOranges and pomelos have their native soil; reeds and rushes grow in clusters. Beasts with the same feet travel together; birds with the same wings soar together.\nThe old commentary states: Those of the same qi summon one another; those of the same kind seek one another.\n\nTo observe the land of the Nine Provinces, one cannot do so without traveling a thousand *li*; without the source of governance and teaching, one cannot stand above the myriad people.\nThe old commentary states: To survey the Nine Domains, how can one arrive without traveling? To govern the myriad affairs, how can one do so without the Dao?\n\nThe fierce are hunted; the clustered are shot.\nThe old commentary states: The fierce are the wicked; the clustered are the many. When the wicked gather, they will surely be struck down and punished. *Ti* (提) is pronounced *shi*.\n\nThus, the purest white appears tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\nThe old commentary states: Only brightness appears white, so it seems to bear humiliation; virtue does not display itself outwardly, so it appears lacking.\n\nThe gentleman has wine—\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of excess.\n\nThe petty man beats the clay pot. Though it cannot be considered good, it can at least serve as a warning.\nThe old commentary states: The gentleman’s overindulgence in wine is excessive; the petty man’s beating of the clay pot serves as a caution. Even for the petty man, this is not good—how much more shameful is it for the gentleman?\n\nIf the August Ultimate resides at the center, it relies on the Eight Assistants to establish itself; if the wheel’s hub is hollow at its center, it depends on the many spokes to move. The Son of Heaven stands at the center of the world, above the myriad people, yet without the source of governance and teaching, it is like having no feet to travel a thousand *li* and observe the land of the Nine Provinces—how can one proceed? Only by rectifying one’s position, sitting upright, and assigning duties to the hundred officials can the world be governed without leaving the hall.\n\nHuman nature is suited to wearing silk, yet one may be shot and don armor—what is inconvenient becomes convenient when it serves its purpose.\nThe old commentary states: To ward off cold, one relies on silk and floss; in battle, one wears armor. One acts according to the time to achieve convenience—this is human nature.\n\nThe thirty spokes share one hub, each aligned with its own mortise and unable to encroach upon one another—just as ministers each guard their own duties.\nThe old commentary states: This meaning is no different from the previous explanation.\n\nOne who is skilled in employing others is like the centipede’s many feet, numerous yet not harming one another; like the tongue and teeth, hard and soft rubbing together yet not defeating one another.\nThe old commentary states: The centipede is a many-footed creature. This speaks of one who is skilled in employing the many—is it not like the centipede? The tongue and teeth work together, hardness and softness both serving, the foolish and the wise all gathered, each following their proper place without losing their abilities.\n\nStone is born hard; the angelica is born fragrant. To possess these qualities in youth is to become even more radiant with age.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of their original nature. Stone is hard, angelica is fragrant—just as the worthy are bright and the foolish are dim. Thus, hardness and fragrance cannot be taken away, nor can foolishness and dimness be altered. To possess these in youth is to become even more steadfast with age.\n\nSupporting and lifting, declining and yielding, gaining and losing, promising and reneging—these differ by a thousand *li*.\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of their vast and distant disparity—who would say they are the same?\n\nIf governance has its methods, no affair will fail; if employing people has its principles, no one will be unhelpful. The wheel’s spokes each align with their own mortise—this clarifies that officials each have their own duties. The centipede’s many feet do not harm one another because their use is appropriate. Stone is hard, angelica is fragrant—employing each according to their abilities, the worthy become bright and the foolish exert their strength, yet success is one and the same.\n\nThose that bloom again do not bear fruit; those that blossom too early do not need frost to fall.\nThe old commentary states: Those that bloom again do not bear fruit; when yang reaches its extreme, it naturally withers.\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "If one soils the nose and powders the forehead—this is like treating the foot when the hand is afflicted, a most irregular affair. A rotten rat lies in the hall, yet one burns incense within—entering water yet hating to be wet, holding stench yet seeking fragrance: even the most skilled cannot craft success from this.\n\nWinter ice may be broken, summer trees may be bound; opportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose. The old commentary states: Time is precious, fate is rare—this illustrates how the noble person awaits the moment to act, for it must not be lost.\n\nA tree in full vigor, though felled all day, will regrow; yet when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night. This speaks of building merit and accomplishing deeds—one cannot delay the hour.\n\nThe target is set and arrows strike; the forest is lush and axes enter—not by any summons, but by the force of circumstance. The old commentary states: Without seeking its use, the felling comes—this is the natural course.\n\nA nursing dog will bite a tiger; a brooding hen will strike a fox—where favor is bestowed, strength is not measured. The old commentary states: It is the care of nurture that makes them forget their lives.\n\nThose who climb for profit and drown will surely drown others for profit. A boat can float, can sink—the fool does not know moderation. The old commentary states: A boat floats by water yet can also drown; a person thrives by profit yet can also drown. Only by discerning the measure of sufficiency can one avoid the calamity of sinking.\n\nA steed, though driven, does not advance; though pulled, does not stop—the ruler does not seek the Dao in this. The old commentary states: When the people are utterly exhausted and the ruler’s exactions know no limit, driving a weary steed further makes distant roads impossible to govern. Opportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose; the people are easily wearied yet hard to revive. Thus, what blooms again bears no fruit; what blossoms too early falls without waiting for frost—this is when the time is not favorable. The target is set and arrows strike; the forest is lush and axes enter—this is the force of circumstance. A nursing dog bites a tiger; a brooding hen strikes a fox—this is the impulse of affection. A rotten boat, if loaded, will sink; a weary steed, if driven, will perish—how can the people bear further hardship?\n\nThough water is level, it must have waves; though a balance is true, it must have discrepancy; though a measure is even, it must have danger. Without compass and square, one cannot determine circle and square; without level and plumb, one cannot correct crooked and straight. Those who use compass and square must also have the mind of compass and square. The old commentary states: When the ruler establishes impartial laws yet the people generate discord, this is like waves arising from level water, discrepancy from a true balance—traces of favor and resentment give rise to calamity and chaos. This is not because the ruler lacks laws, but because ministers lose their compass and square.\n\nMount Tai’s height, though doubled, cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair, though small, can be discerned when viewed directly. The old commentary states: When one’s aim is true, even the tip of an autumn hair, though small, can be discerned; when one’s conduct is contrary, even Mount Tai, though vast, cannot be seen.\n\nBamboo and wood contain fire, yet without drilling, no smoke arises; earth contains water, yet without digging, none emerges. The old commentary states: Fire is hidden in wood, water in earth—without drilling or digging, they cannot emerge. The Dao resides in people, yet without study, it is not known.\n\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two li; yet with half-steps unceasing, a lame turtle travels a thousand li. Piling clods without rest, mountains and hills form. The old commentary states: In all learning, one must not prize swiftness at the outset; what matters is long devotion to the Way—then a thousand li may be reached, mountains and hills surely formed.\n\nTo stand by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning to weave a net. The old commentary states: Fish in the river are caught by nets; the Dao in people is grasped by the mind.\n\nFirst tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek excellence; first establish trust, then seek ability. The old commentary states: From these three examples, one may discern the essentials of all affairs.\n\nA skilled smith cannot melt wood; a master craftsman cannot carve ice—there are things that cannot be forced. The noble person does not dwell on them. The old commentary states: Things that cannot be worked cannot become vessels; though a master craftsman exists, his skill has no application. People who cannot be guided cannot be turned from their ways; though a sage exists, there is no way to convey his intent.\n\nOne may command a person not to cross the river, but one cannot command the river to have no waves. The old commentary states: A river must have waves; the world must have misfortune. To prevent people from encountering misfortune is easy; to make a river have no waves is difficult.\n\nIf guiltless, the pot will not fall into the well. The old commentary states: *Gu* means fault. What misfortune one incurs is not without cause—if the pot did not fall into the well, how could there be no reason?\n\nThe old commentary states: Level water cannot be without waves; a true balance cannot be without discrepancy—how can the mind not be cautious? The rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame of the noble person are like the compass, square, level, and plumb of the craftsman. First tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek excellence. Without first establishing trust, can ability be attained? Thus, the noble person does what can be done and does not do what is beyond remedy.\n\nThose who criticize my conduct wish for my friendship; those who covet my goods wish to trade with me. The old commentary states: They seek to move the inner, and it appears in the outer.",

      "translated_text": "A single move in chess is insufficient to reveal one’s understanding; a single pluck of the zither is insufficient to express sorrow. The old commentary states: Mastery of one matter does not yet encompass the full principle; the first strum of a zither cannot yet be called exquisite.\n\nNow, if a single burning coal is picked up, it scorches the fingers—yet if a myriad tons of coal are ignited, the smoke pervades all, and even at ten paces away, one does not die. Those of the same qi may differ in accumulation. Where there is flourishing splendor, there must also be sorrow and withering. The old commentary states: Prosperity and decay alternate; joy and grief oppose each other.\n\nAbove, there are silken gauze and fine fabrics; below, there must be coarse hemp and rags. The old commentary states: ** (pronounced *fúfèi*): When the ruler above is extravagant and frivolous, indulging in fine silks, the people below suffer from cold and hunger, lacking adequate clothing and food. How can a ruler fail to examine this?\n\nThe greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base. The old commentary states: The ruler takes the people as the root, the lowly as the foundation.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Bitter words benefit conduct; bitter medicine benefits illness. Those who criticize my conduct wish for my friendship—this is the noble person following righteousness. Those who covet my goods wish to trade with me—this is the petty person pursuing profit. A person’s good fortune cannot be overindulged; excess is unnecessary. The greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base. When the people are prosperous, the state flourishes.\n\nLaozi said: The drum does not conceal sound, thus it can produce sound; the mirror does not obscure form, thus it can reflect form. The old commentary states: The drum does not conceal sound, the mirror does not conceal form—thus they can produce sound and reflect form.\n\nMetal and stone have voices, yet if not struck, they do not ring; pipes and flutes have tones, yet if not blown, they make no sound. The old commentary states: Metal, stone, flutes, and pipes cannot sound on their own; only when struck or blown do they produce sound. This is like people: all receive the Dao and virtue, yet without learning, they never attain completion.\n\nThus, the sage conceals within and does not initiate; when affairs come, he governs them; when things arrive, he responds. The old commentary states: The sage does not speak recklessly; his actions are never empty responses.\n\nThe Way of Heaven moves without cease, ending and then beginning again—thus it endures long. The wheel returns to its turning—thus it travels far. The old commentary states: The movement of Heaven is divine and unfathomable, operating without end.\n\nThe movement of Heaven does not err, thus it is without fault. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends; yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are harmonized as one. The old commentary states: Heaven’s movement is singular and without error; the ruler governs with flawless governance—thus Heaven and Earth interact smoothly, all things flourish, ruler and minister are joyful, above and below are at peace.\n\nWhen the noble person is employed, the petty person vanishes—this is the Way of Heaven and Earth. The old commentary states: Removing the wicked and appointing the worthy accords with the Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang do not interact, and the myriad things do not prosper. When the petty person gains power and the noble person vanishes, the five grains do not grow, and the Dao and virtue are concealed within. The old commentary states: When the qi of Heaven and Earth do not interact and the qi of yin and yang do not communicate, it is because the ruler does not employ the Dao and virtue, allowing treacherous and flattering petty persons to hold office while the noble person remains in obscurity—causing the myriad things to fail and the five grains not to grow.\n\nThe Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to benefit the deficient; the Way of Earth diminishes the high to supplement the low. The old commentary states: The Way of Heaven and Earth... *[Note: The text here appears to have a lacuna; no alternate version is available for collation.]*\n\nThe Way of spirits restrains arrogance and aligns with the humble. The old commentary states: It curbs the nature of arrogance and associates with those who are modest.\n\nThe Way of humans does not give to those who already have much. The old commentary states: It does not increase those who are already abundant.\n\nThe Way of the sage is lowly, yet none can surpass it. The old commentary states: It never seeks to be above, thus people honor it.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The mind does not conceal things, thus it can respond to them; the drum does not conceal sound, thus it can respond to being struck. If it rings without being struck, it is monstrous. Thus, the sage conceals within and does not initiate—he merely responds. When Heaven and Earth interact, the myriad things are harmonized as one. This illustrates the time when worthy encounters and the noble person is employed. If this is reversed, it is the day when the petty person gains power.\n\nOnly the sage, though in high position, listens to the lowly and does not become complacent, never placing himself above. When the sun is bright, it can illuminate the four directions; when the ruler is enlightened, the minister is enlightened, and the realm is at peace. When the realm has these four enlightened ones, it can endure long. To be enlightened in governance is to be enlightened in transformation. The old commentary states: When the four enlightened ones are complete, all the people are transformed.\n\nThe Way of Heaven creates patterns. The old commentary states: The sun, moon, stars, and constellations.\n\nThe Way of Earth establishes order.

      "translated_text": "The Dao gives life to the myriad things and is thus named. The old commentary states: It nurtures and sustains the myriad things without acting as their master, hence it is called the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is level and broad, never far from the self. Cultivate it within the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in things, and its virtue never ceases. The old commentary states: Cultivating it within is called truth; nurturing it externally is called virtue.\n\nHeaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nourish them, giving without taking—this is the highest virtue. Thus, in virtue, none is higher than Heaven, none lower than the marsh. Heaven is high, the marsh low; the sage emulates this, establishing hierarchy and order, and the world is settled. The old commentary states: High and low are arrayed, noble and base find their places.\n\nEarth bears the myriad things and makes them grow, giving and taking—thus bones and skeletons return to it. Giving and taking is the lesser virtue; the lesser virtue does not lose virtue, yet it is called \"without virtue.\" The old commentary states: Not taking means Heaven gives life to the myriad things, merely nurturing them without claiming their substance, so the spirit returns above. Taking means Earth, though it matures the myriad things, reclaims their essence, so bones and skeletons return below—this is called \"without virtue.\"\n\nEarth follows Heaven, thus it is settled and at peace. When Earth is settled and at peace, the forms of the myriad things take shape. Earth is vast and thick, and the myriad things are numerous. Settled and at peace, there is nothing it does not bear; vast and thick, there is nothing it does not contain. Earth’s depth and thickness gather water and springs; its breadth and expanse endure long. The sage emulates this, and his virtue admits all. The old commentary states: Heaven and Earth follow one another to achieve vastness and thickness; ruler and minister trust one another to achieve governance and harmony. The ruler embodies the Way of Heaven, the minister the Way of Earth. Heaven is noble, Earth base—the distinction between ruler and minister is fixed. When the ruler is enlightened and the minister enlightened, they illuminate the four directions—is this not like Yao’s radiance filling the world, where the hundred clans are bright? Thus, to emulate Heaven and Earth in completing the myriad things is the Dao. Nurturing them, giving without taking, is the highest virtue; giving and taking, virtue becomes lesser.\n\nYin submits to yang, and the myriad things flourish; yang submits to yin, and the myriad things perish. When things flourish, none lacks abundance; when they perish, none lacks joy. When things are joyful, none is ungoverned. [Note in the Ming printed edition: After \"things are joyful,\" there is an additional \"then.\"]\n\nYin harms things, yang yields of itself; yin advances, yang retreats. When petty men gain power, the noble withdraw to avoid harm—this is the Way of Heaven. The old commentary states: When yang is constrained by yin, the world is harmonious and well-governed; when ministers overpower the ruler, petty men hold office.\n\nYang qi moves, and the myriad things are at ease, each in its place. Thus, the sage follows the yang Way. Those who follow things, things follow them; those who oppose things, things oppose them. Thus, one does not lose the nature and feelings of things. When marshes are full, the myriad things mature; when marshes dry, the myriad things wither. Thus, when rain and moisture do not flow, the world perishes. Yang rises and then returns below—thus it is the master of the myriad things, not long abiding, yet able to end and begin anew, thus enduring long. Enduring long, it becomes the mother of the world. The old commentary states: The sage follows Heaven’s Way, acting without striving, thus enduring long; opposing the feelings of things, even with position, none can preserve it.\n\nYang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who, without accumulation, could transform. Thus, the sage is cautious in what he accumulates. The old commentary states: Accumulating virtue brings blessings; accumulating evil leads to ruin.\n\nWhen yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow fat; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Thus, kings and lords esteem the yang Way, and the myriad things flourish; they esteem the yin Way, and the world perishes. The old commentary states: Yang is uprightness and life, thus things grow fat—fat means flourishing. Yin is depravity and death, thus things decline—decline means perishing.\n\nIf yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not mature; if the ruler does not descend to the minister, virtuous transformation does not spread. Thus, when the ruler descends to the minister, wisdom and clarity prevail; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue. The old commentary states: Unless the ruler is supremely sagely, he cannot descend to the minister; unless the minister is supremely worthy, he cannot assist the ruler. Yu Shun humbled himself before Bo Cheng; King Wen treated Jiang Shang as his teacher—these may be called wise and clear.\n\nContinuing the thread: yang gives life, yin kills. Thus, the noble man cherishes life, the petty man delights in killing. Kings and lords esteem the yang Way, and the myriad things flourish; they esteem the yin Way, and the world perishes. Yang values descending, yin does not. Thus, when the ruler descends to the minister, wisdom and clarity prevail, and the state is well-governed; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue, and virtuous transformation does not spread.\n\nThe sun rises from the earth, and the myriad things thrive; kings and lords stand above the people, illuminating the Dao and its virtue. The sun sets into the earth, and the myriad things rest; petty men stand above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. The old commentary states: This means when yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not flourish; when the ruler does not descend to the minister, the myriad things conceal themselves.\n\nWhen thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The conduct of great men resembles this. The movement of yin and yang has constant measure; the actions of great men do not exceed things. The old commentary states: The majesty of great men is like spring thunder; their commands are like the warm wind—all is harmonious in sound and qi, thus they do not exceed things.\n\nThunder moves upon the earth, and the myriad things are at ease; wind sways the trees, and grasses and trees scatter. Great men remove evil and pursue goodness, and the people do not wander far. The people have departures and arrivals—departing from the extreme, arriving at the lesser. [Note in the Ming printed edition: Before \"the people have departures and arrivals,\" there is an additional \"thus.\"] The old commentary states: Moreover, when great men have goodness, the hundred clans gather to them. Like King Tai leaving Bin—how far did the people go?\n\nWhen wind does not move, fire does not emerge; when great men do not emerge, petty men have nothing to transmit. Fire emerges only when there is fuel; the words of great men must be trustworthy. With trust and truth, what cannot be accomplished? The old commentary states: Fire emerges and spreads through fuel; words are issued and trust is established. Thus, the words of great men proceed without retreating, their trust like the four seasons.\n\nThe Yellow River’s waters are deep, its banks lie in the mountains; hills and mounds rise and fall into the abyss. Yang qi flourishes and transforms into yin; yin qi flourishes and transforms into yang. Thus, desire must not be filled, joy must not be extreme. The old commentary states: The Way of Heaven humbles the high and raises the low. Only by moderating desires and preserving harmony can one follow Heaven’s principle, not allowing things to reach extremity.\n\nAnger without harsh words, wrath without fierce expression—this is called calculated gain. The old commentary states: Though angry, one does not forget; though enraged, harsh words and fierce expressions do not appear externally—this is calculated gain within, governed by the Dao.\n\nFire flames upward, water flows downward; the sage’s Way seeks harmony through yielding. When yang prevails, the world is harmonious and united; when yin prevails, the world is submerged and sunk. [Note in the Ming printed edition: After \"seeks harmony,\" there are two characters, \"圣入,\" likely superfluous.]",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states: When yang prevails, it draws near to the loyal and worthy, thus the world is harmonious and united; when yin prevails, it draws near to the treacherous and sycophantic, thus the world is submerged and sunk. To continue the analogy: Heaven’s sun—is it not the ruler of men? When the sun rises from the earth, dukes and lords govern above the people, and the myriad things flourish; when the sun sets into the earth, petty men govern above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. The movement of yin and yang has its constant measure, thus the year does not disorder the seasons; the movement of the great person does not reach extremity in things, thus the people do not wander far. When things reach extremity, they transform. Desires must not be filled to the brim—yin and yang are of Heaven, but order and chaos depend on man.\n\nLaozi said: \"Accumulating thinness makes thickness; accumulating lowness makes height.\" The noble person daily strives to achieve radiance; the petty person daily indulges to reach disgrace. The old commentary states: The noble person diligently cultivates the Dao, daily increasing in brilliance; the petty person seizes leisure to gratify desires, ultimately reaching distress and disgrace. Though its waxing and waning may not yet be visible, one sees goodness as if never sufficient, and lodges evil as if it were an ill omen. If one inclines toward goodness, though there be faults, there is no resentment; if one does not incline toward goodness, though there be loyalty, evil comes. Thus, resenting others is not as good as resenting oneself; exhorting others is not as good as seeking within. Sound summons itself; harmony seeks itself; reputation commands itself; office is self-assumed. There is nothing that is not oneself. Wielding a sharp point to stab, grasping a blade to strike—why resent others? Therefore, the noble person is cautious in the subtle.\n\nThe old commentary states: To be cautious in the subtle is not a matter of greatness. If one inclines toward goodness, then blessing does not depend on others; if one exhorts oneself, then if one does not incline toward goodness, calamity returns to oneself—why resent others? Evil is like grasping a blade to cut oneself; accumulating fire to burn oneself—who else can one blame? The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, using qi to achieve harmony. Harmony resides in the center, thus the fruit of trees grows from the heart, the seed of grasses grows from the pod, and eggs and wombs generate from the center. Those that are neither egg nor womb but require time to be born—\n\nThe old commentary states: Things differ in kind, but all speak of what is generated as arising from central harmony and forming substance. Those that are neither womb nor egg but depend on transformation must await their time to come into being.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow; when light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt. The old commentary states: When the earth is level, water has no rushing force; when the scale is balanced, things have no bias of light or heavy.\n\nThe generation and transformation of things have their causes. The old commentary states: The birth of the myriad things each has its stimulus, not arising without reason. To continue the analogy: Yin and yang stimulate each other to form central harmony, thus the myriad things are born; ruler and minister unite to attain the central Dao, thus the myriad people are at peace. Therefore, the noble person harmonizes his heart and will, daily striving to achieve radiance; the petty person disrupts his natural harmony, daily indulging to reach disgrace. Thus, the noble person is cautious in the subtle, rectifies his heart, and seeks within himself. I do not resent others, and others harbor no resentment.\n\nLaozi said: \"When mountains reach their height, clouds and rain arise; when waters reach their depth, dragons are born; when the noble person attains the Dao, virtue and grace flow forth. Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown.\" The old commentary states: The numinous mountains must send down clouds and rain; the lofty Dao must bestow virtue and grace. There has never been one who did not first perform the deed and later receive the reward.\n\nThose who plant millet do not reap millet; those who plant resentment receive no return of virtue. The old commentary states: To plant millet and reap millet, or to repay virtue with resentment—such has never been.\n\nTo continue the analogy: Doing good without others knowing is called utmost goodness; doing evil without others knowing is called utmost evil. Mountains conceal clouds and form rain and dew; abysses conceal water and generate dragons; the noble person cherishes the Dao, and grace flows to the world. Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward—Heaven aids them; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown—people esteem them. Only those who possess Heavenly virtue know this.",
      "overlap_context": " The old commentary states: Though angry, one does not forget; though enraged, harsh words and fierce expressions do not appear externally—this is calculated gain within, governed by the Dao.\n\nFire flames upward, water flows downward; the sage’s Way seeks harmony through yielding. When yang prevails, the world is harmonious and united; when yin prevails, the world is submerged and sunk.

      "translated_text": "**The Subtle Illumination**\n\nThe old commentary states: To perceive the formless form, to hear the soundless sound—hence it is called \"subtle illumination.\" Laozi said: The Dao may be weak, may be strong; may be yielding, may be firm; may be yin, may be yang; may be obscure, may be luminous. It can envelop Heaven and Earth, respond to all directions without limit. What is known of it is shallow; what is unknown, deep. What is perceived of it lies without; what is unperceived, within. What is grasped of it is coarse; what is ungrasped, refined. To know it is not to know; not to know is to know. Who understands that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Who comprehends the formless form?\n\nThus, when all under Heaven know goodness as goodness, this is already not goodness. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: \"Subtle illumination\" is the Dao. To see without the eyes, to hear without the ears—it is attained in Heaven and inscribed in the heart. Thus it can envelop Heaven and Earth, respond to all directions without limit. It cannot be sought through cunning or force; only by knowing not-knowing, acting not-acting, speaking not-speaking can it be grasped.\n\nWenzi asked: Can one speak subtly?\nLaozi replied: Why not? Only those who know speech do not speak. Those who contend for fish become drenched; those who chase beasts hasten—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the utmost word abandons words; the utmost act abandons acts. What the shallow-minded contend over is but the trivial.\n\nSpeech has its origin; affairs have their ruler. Only the ignorant do not understand me.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao cannot be spoken; if it could, it would be spoken of as a thing—yet this is not the Dao. If not spoken, it would remain obscure. When Wenzi asked whether one could speak subtly, Laozi replied that only those who know speech can do so—this is to speak without speaking, to not speak while speaking. Those who contend for fish or chase beasts do not understand speech. Clinging to words and attaching to things, what they contend over is but the trivial. How can one abandon words and acts to speak with such a person?\n\nWenzi asked: Is there a method for governing a state?\nLaozi replied: Consider those who pull a cart: the front calls out *xiehu*, and the rear responds. This is the song that encourages their strength. Though the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu may be fine, it does not match the meaning of this. In governing a state, propriety exists, but not in ornate debate. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Those who govern a state are like Heaven and Earth. Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not utter, yet the myriad things grow. When Wenzi asked about the method of governing a state, Laozi replied with the song of the cart-pullers—front calling, rear responding—just as the sage precedes Heaven without opposing it, follows Heaven in its seasons. Governing a state begins with propriety, not with florid debate. Those who do not understand the essence of governance and instead multiply laws and decrees merely provide thieves with tools to plunder the people.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao has no fixed norm, yet it can serve as the norm. It is like forests and mountains, which can provide timber. Yet timber does not surpass forests and mountains; forests and mountains do not surpass clouds and rain; clouds and rain do not surpass yin and yang; yin and yang do not surpass harmony; harmony does not surpass the Dao. The Dao is what is called the formless form, the imageless image. Its meaning cannot be fully conveyed. Between Heaven and Earth, all can be molded and transformed.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao has no fixed form; things take shape in accordance with it. Observing forests and mountains transforming into clouds and rain, yin and yang harmonizing—one knows that all formless and imageless things between Heaven and Earth can be molded and transformed. How wondrous is the Dao!\n\nLaozi said: The sage establishes teachings and implements governance only after examining their beginning and end, perceiving their origin and outcome. Thus, when the people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know machinery, sincerity declines. The zither does not sound of itself, yet its twenty-five strings each respond with their own tone. The axle does not turn of itself, yet its thirty spokes each rotate with their own force. Only when there is tension and release can music be completed; only when there is labor and rest can distant journeys be achieved. If what has sound were made soundless, if what turns were made motionless—then the high and low would follow different paths. When governance is easy, disorder arises. Those in high positions with great Dao engage in great affairs; those with small Dao meet with misfortune. Minor virtue harms righteousness; minor goodness harms the Dao; minor debate harms governance; harshness injures virtue. Great uprightness is not perilous, so the people are easily guided. Excessive defenses lead to betrayal below. Utmost loyalty returns to simplicity, so the people do not conceal or deceive.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The sage establishes teachings and implements governance out of necessity, examining their beginning and end, acting without contrivance. Knowing writing, calculation, contracts, and machinery is to act with intention—thus virtue, benevolence, trust, and sincerity decline. The ruler relies on ministers for governance, just as the zither has sound and the spokes achieve distance. Grasping the essential and employing the great—then no age will be ungoverned.\n\nLaozi said: When laws of mutual implication are established, the people resent them. When decrees reducing ranks are issued, meritorious officials rebel. Thus, those who scrutinize the traces of brush and ink do not understand the root of order and chaos. Those practiced in military formations do not grasp the authority of temple strategy. The sage perceives fortune within the innermost gates, considers calamity beyond the outermost defenses. The foolish are deluded by small gains and forget great harm. Thus, affairs may benefit the small but harm the great; gain may be had here while loss occurs there. There is no greater benevolence than loving people; no greater wisdom than knowing people. Loving people leaves no resentment; knowing people leaves no disordered governance.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Governance cannot be overburdened with affairs; laws cannot be frequently altered. When affairs multiply and changes are frequent, the people resent them, and meritorious officials rebel—this is the ruler’s doing. The root of order and chaos, the authority of temple strategy—the sage discerns the unseen, possessing foresight.\n\nLaozi said: The great floods of rivers and streams do not last beyond three days. Fierce winds and torrential rains do not persist past noon. Where virtue is not accumulated, there is no cause for worry—yet ruin comes swiftly. Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, transform misfortune into fortune. The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: A state’s harsh policies erupt like the great floods of rivers, like the sudden storms of wind and rain—yet they do not last long. Ruin comes swiftly. Only those who worry over lacking virtue and know how to change can turn misfortune into fortune, weakness into strength. That one must not be self-satisfied is clear.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Serenity and harmony are the nature of man; propriety and rules are the systems of affairs. Knowing man’s nature, one nurtures the self without transgression; knowing the systems of affairs, one’s actions are never disordered. Issuing a single command, scattering without contention—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"without end\" for \"without contention\"]—unifying all under one guiding principle is called the heart. Seeing the root and knowing the branch, holding to the One and responding to the myriad is called technique. Abiding in knowledge to act, knowing where one goes, knowing what one relies upon in movement, knowing where one stops—this is called the Dao. Causing others to praise and esteem oneself is the power of the heart; causing others to belittle and slander oneself is the fault of the heart. Words spoken from the mouth cannot be forbidden by others; actions begun nearby cannot be forbidden from afar. Affairs are difficult to accomplish yet easy to ruin; reputation is difficult to establish yet easy to destroy. All people take lightly small harms and trivial matters, yet these lead to great calamity. When misfortune arrives, man himself gives birth to it; when fortune comes, man himself brings it to completion. Misfortune and fortune share the same gate; profit and harm dwell in the same neighborhood. Without utmost clarity, none can distinguish them. Thus, wisdom and foresight are the gate and door of misfortune and fortune; movement and stillness are the pivot and trigger of profit and harm. One cannot but examine them carefully.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Heavenly principle and human desire arise from the same heart; the noble man and the petty man emerge from the same self—yet they share a single origin but bear different names. Holding to the One and responding to the myriad is called technique; seeing movement and knowing where to stop is called the Dao. Words issue from the mouth; actions arise from the heart. Misfortune and fortune, profit and harm follow like shadows and echoes. Without utmost clarity, who can distinguish them? Can one not examine them within oneself and be cautious in the heart?\n\nLaozi said: All know the mechanism of order and chaos yet none know the tools for preserving life. Thus, the sage assesses the world and acts accordingly, weighing affairs to devise plans—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"weighing affairs\" as \"weighing matters\"]. The sage can be yin or yang, soft or hard, weak or strong, moving or still with the times, establishing merit by relying on resources. Observing things’ tendencies, one knows their return; attending to one affair, one examines its transformations, then models and responds accordingly. Thus, one may practice this all one’s life without encountering困. Some matters can be spoken of but not practiced; some can be practiced but not spoken of; some are easy to do yet difficult to complete; some are difficult to complete yet easy to ruin. What can be practiced but not spoken of is taking and abandoning; what can be spoken of but not practiced is deceit and falsehood. What is easy to do yet difficult to complete is affairs; what is difficult to complete yet easy to ruin is reputation. These four are what the sage attends to, what the wise alone perceive.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Times may be ordered or chaotic, but governance lies with man. Knowing the mechanism of order and chaos yet not knowing the tools for preserving life—this failure lies in man, not in the times. The sage moves or is still with the times, examining their changes, practicing this all one’s life without encountering困. How can those who hold power in their time be indolent and not know the tools for preserving life?\n\nLaozi said: The Dao reveres the minute and subtle, never missing the moment. In archery, one is cautious of misfortune, lest it grow. Calculating fortune does not compare to considering misfortune; on the same day, those covered by frost are not harmed. The foolish, when prepared, share the same merit as the wise. Accumulating love brings fortune; accumulating hatred brings misfortune. All know how to rescue from calamity, yet none know how to prevent calamity from arising. Preventing calamity from arising is easier than rescuing from calamity. Now, people do not strive to prevent calamity from arising but strive to rescue from calamity—even a divine being could not devise a plan for this. The sources of misfortune and calamity are boundless. The sage dwells in seclusion to avoid calamity, remains silent to await the moment. The petty man, unaware of the gate of misfortune and fortune, moves and falls into punishment. Though he bends every effort to prepare, it is not enough to preserve his life. Thus, the superior man first avoids calamity, then pursues profit; first distances himself from disgrace, then seeks reputation. Therefore, the sage always attends to what lies beyond the formless and does not dwell on what is already accomplished within. Thus, misfortune has no way to arrive, and neither praise nor blame can tarnish him.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao reveres the minute and subtle, never missing the moment—this is caution at the outset. The foolish, when prepared, share the same merit as the wise. Man’s misfortunes cannot be averted beforehand but are sought to be rescued afterward—even a divine being could not devise a plan for this. Thus, the superior man takes avoiding calamity and distancing disgrace as primary, placing reputation and profit afterward without insistence. How then could misfortune arrive? How could praise or blame tarnish him?\n\nLaozi said: In the Dao of man, the heart desires smallness, the will desires greatness, wisdom desires roundness, conduct desires squareness, abilities desire multiplicity, affairs desire fewness. What is called a small heart is to consider misfortune before it arises, to be cautious of calamity and vigilant in subtleties, never indulging one’s desires. A great will—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"a great will desires\" with \"desires\" likely an interpolation]—encompasses the myriad states, unifying disparate customs, with right and wrong converging like spokes at the hub. Round wisdom has no beginning or end, flowing to the four directions like a deep spring that never runs dry. Square conduct stands upright without bending, pure and unstained, unwavering in poverty, unrestrained in success. Multifaceted ability encompasses civil and martial, moving and still in accord with propriety, with actions and placements perfectly fitting. Few affairs mean grasping the essential to pair with the many, holding the simple to govern the broad, abiding in stillness to restrain restlessness.\n\nThus, a small heart forbids the minute; a great will embraces all; round wisdom knows all; square conduct refrains from all; multifaceted ability governs all; few affairs mean simplicity in what one holds. Therefore, the sage, in regard to goodness, leaves nothing small undone; in regard to faults, leaves nothing subtle uncorrected. He does not employ shamans or mediums, yet spirits dare not precede him—this may be called utmost nobility. Yet he trembles and quakes, cautious day by day, thus achieving effortless unity through sincerity—[note: the Ming printed edition mistakenly reads \"sincerity\" as \"completion\"]. The foolish man’s wisdom is already meager, yet the affairs he undertakes are many, so he inevitably falls into困. Thus, using uprightness to transform—[note: the Ming printed edition reads \"governance\" for \"uprightness,\" but since it opposes \"deviance\" below, \"uprightness\" seems correct]—is easy and will surely succeed; using deviance to transform is difficult and will surely fail. Abandoning what is easy and sure to succeed to engage in what is difficult and sure to fail—this is the result of foolish delusion.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The will desires greatness, yet the heart desires smallness; wisdom desires roundness, yet conduct desires squareness; abilities desire multiplicity, yet affairs desire fewness—these six are what all people cannot but strive for. A great will embraces all things; a small heart is cautious of the slightest detail. Round wisdom is unobstructed in all matters; square conduct is upright and unbending. Multifaceted ability accomplishes all; few affairs mean simplicity in what one holds. The sage’s conduct does not employ shamans or mediums, yet spirits dare not precede him—unified through sincerity alone.",

Ruin comes swiftly. Only those who worry over lacking virtue and know how to change can turn misfortune into fortune, weakness into strength. That one must not be self-satisfied is clear.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Fortune arises softly, softly; misfortune arises in tangled profusion. The workings of fortune and misfortune are subtle and invisible, yet the sage perceives their beginning and end—therefore, one cannot but examine them closely. The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for his own sake but for the sake of the state. If something pleases him yet brings no benefit to the state, he does not bestow reward; if something offends him yet benefits the state, he does not impose punishment. Thus, one whose actions are borne by what is fitting is called a noble person; one who abandons what is fitting is called a petty person. Those who attain understanding without toil rank highest; those who toil without suffering harm rank next; those who suffer harm yet toil all the more rank lowest. The ancients savored without ceasing; the people of today cease without savoring. When Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi wept; when Lu buried with wooden figurines, Confucius sighed. Seeing the beginning, one knows the end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The mechanism of fortune and misfortune has an opening—must one not examine it? Reward and punishment are the ruler’s great handles, not for his own sake but for the sake of the state. Between the noble person and the petty person lies the distinction of righteousness and profit. Governing without toil is the highest form of governance; toiling without suffering harm is the next; suffering harm yet toiling all the more is the lowest. When Jizi wept over ivory chopsticks and Confucius sighed over wooden figurines, the fate of the state could be known without awaiting its end.\n\nLaozi said: Benevolence is what people admire; righteousness is what people esteem. To be admired and esteemed by others, yet to perish oneself or lose one’s state—this is due to being out of step with the times. Thus, one who knows benevolence and righteousness but does not know the balance of the world does not attain the Dao. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is not the Dao. Therefore, good and bad coincide; praise and blame lie in custom; conduct is equal; compliance and opposition lie in the times. Knowing Heaven’s actions and understanding human conduct—only then can one manage the world. Knowing Heaven but not people, one has no means to engage with custom; knowing people but not Heaven, one has no means to guard the Dao. A steadfast will and compliant nature—these are firm and strong, yet they are harmed by the self and enslaved by things, consumed by yin and yang.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The Dao does not prevail—I know why: the times have changed. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is to be ignorant of the times. Ignorant of the times, one is ignorant of Heaven and people—how can one manage the world? The person who attains the Dao adapts outwardly yet remains unchanged inwardly. Outward adaptation is how one knows others; inner constancy is how one preserves the self. Thus, inwardly possessing a steadfast principle while outwardly bending and stretching, moving with things—no action leads to entrapment. What is prized in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation. Clinging to a single node, advancing a single conduct, though one may achieve fulfillment, is still not as good as being unbound by petty preferences and unobstructed by the great Dao. The Dao is quiescent and empty, not acting upon things, nor acting upon itself. Therefore, in acting in accord with the Dao, it is not the Dao that acts—it is the Dao’s application.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The dragon and tiger transform—this is the Dao of the great person. The person who attains the Dao moves with things yet does not fall into entrapment. Thus, Laozi was called \"like a dragon.\" Embracing the Dao, empty and formless, outwardly not possessing things, inwardly not possessing the self—the Dao is applied without exception, and the world is transformed.\n\nWhat Heaven covers and Earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate, what yin and yang warm, what rain and dew moisten, what the Dao and virtue support—all share a single harmony. Thus, one who can bear the great circle walks the great square; one who mirrors the great clarity sees the great brightness; one who establishes great peace dwells in the great hall. One who guards what is to be guarded shines like the sun and moon. Without form, it is born from form. Thus, the true person entrusts their destiny to the numinous terrace and returns to dwell in the origin of things. Seeing what is to be guarded, hearing the soundless—within what is to be guarded, there is unique understanding; within quiescence, there is unique illumination. Its use is non-use; only through non-use can it be used. Its knowledge is non-knowledge; only through non-knowledge can it be known.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Harmony is the universal Dao of the world. Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing share a single harmony—how can the ruler who wears the circle, walks the square, dwells in the great hall, and establishes great peace lose it? The true person returns to dwell in the origin of things and must have unique insight within what is to be guarded. Thus, use arises from non-use, and only then can it be used; knowledge arises from non-knowledge, and only then can it be known. This is called the great harmony.\n\nThe Dao is what things follow; virtue is what life relies upon; benevolence is the proof of accumulated kindness; righteousness is what aligns with the heart and accords with the multitude. When the Dao declines, virtue arises; when virtue wanes, benevolence and righteousness emerge. Thus, the highest age followed the Dao without virtue; the middle age upheld virtue without cherishing it; the later age clung tightly, fearing the loss of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, the noble person cannot live without righteousness; losing righteousness, one loses what sustains life. The petty person cannot survive without profit; losing profit, one loses what sustains existence. Thus, the noble person fears losing righteousness; the petty person fears losing profit. Observing what they fear, fortune and misfortune diverge.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness split, and the Yellow Emperor, emperors, kings, and hegemons divided the ages—changes in the world made it so. The Dao guides; virtue gives life; benevolence bestows kindness; righteousness makes fitting. The governance of the four ages may differ, yet the distinction between ruler and minister remains the same. Those who follow the Dao without virtue are sovereigns; those who possess virtue without cherishing it are emperors; those who fear losing benevolence and righteousness are kings; when righteousness loses its fittingness, cunning and deceit arise.\n\nLaozi said: Some matters, when one desires to benefit them, only end in harm; others, when one desires to harm them, end in benefit. Those with dampness ailments who force themselves to eat, those with heat ailments who force themselves to drink cold—these are what the multitude nurtures, yet what the good physician treats as illness. Pleasing to the eye, delightful to the heart—these are what the foolish consider beneficial, yet what the person of the Dao avoids. The sage first opposes and later aligns; the multitude first aligns and later opposes. Thus, the gate of fortune and misfortune, the reversal of benefit and harm—these cannot but be examined.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Some matters, when one desires to benefit them, end in harm; others, when one desires to harm them, end in benefit—not by human effort can this be determined, for things may cause it. Thus, first opposing and later aligning is the Dao of the sage; first aligning and later opposing is the way of the multitude. Fortune and misfortune intertwine; benefit and harm reverse—how can one not examine them?",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Those who achieve merit yet depart from benevolence and righteousness will be met with suspicion; those who commit faults yet possess benevolence and righteousness will surely be trusted. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the constant compliance of affairs, the exalted rank of the world. Even if plans are obtained and calculations prove fitting, one must still consider calamities and resolve schemes; for the state to endure, its affairs must be preserved. Those who depart from benevolence and righteousness—though their merit may seem complete—will not ultimately succeed. Though their words may not breach defenses and their plans bring no benefit to the state, if their hearts are devoted to the ruler and align with benevolence and righteousness, their persons will surely be preserved. Thus it is said: A hundred words, a hundred plans—if none ever prove fitting, it is better to abandon haste and carefully examine benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Benevolence and righteousness—are they not the grandchildren of the Dao and the children of virtue? Though these four may seem unrelated, they have never been separate. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the exalted rank of the world. For one who values governing the world with their person, how can they not abandon haste and carefully examine these—benevolence and righteousness?\n\nLaozi said: Teaching originates with the noble person, yet the petty person receives its benefit; profit originates with the petty person, yet the noble person enjoys its fruits. When noble and petty persons each attain their proper place, their functions interchange and affairs proceed smoothly. When desires multiply, righteousness is harmed; when anxieties multiply, wisdom is impaired. Thus, in governing a state, joy preserves it; in a tyrannical state, joy destroys it. Water flows downward and becomes vast; the ruler lowers himself before his ministers and gains clarity. When the ruler does not contend with his ministers, the Dao of governance flows freely. Thus, the ruler is the root, the ministers the branches. Never has there been a case where the root is unsound yet the branches flourish.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Noble and petty persons are equally human. If one is noble yet their teaching does not extend to the petty, what virtue can provide for the petty’s sustenance? When a state is well-governed, joy preserves it; when a state is tyrannical, joy destroys it. When the ruler excels in humility and does not contend, ministers offer their loyalty. When the root is firm and deep, the state is secure.\n\nLaozi said: The compassionate father’s love for his child does not seek repayment; it cannot be dissolved within the heart. The sagely ruler’s nurturing of the people is not for personal use—it is a nature that cannot be restrained. Yet if one relies on their strength, depends on their merit, and inevitably exhausts it, once there is something to be gained, kindness no longer reaches them. Thus, employing what the multitude loves, one gains the multitude’s strength; raising what the multitude delights in, one gains the multitude’s hearts. Therefore, seeing their beginning, one knows their end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The bond between father and child is a heavenly nature. The father’s love for his child and the ruler’s nurturing of the people—if either harbors an expectation of repayment, kindness is lost. Thus, benefiting others through what benefits them, one gains the multitude’s strength; promoting goodness through what is good, one gains the multitude’s hearts. How could children then be disobedient, or ministers disloyal?\n\nLaozi said: People unite through righteousness and grow strong through fellowship. Thus, where virtue is bestowed widely, its authority extends far; where righteousness is applied thinly, military control is limited.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: When the ruler takes the world as his heart and people unite through righteousness, loyalty and filial piety flourish; when factions grow strong through fellowship, treacherous heroes arise. The balance of safety and danger cannot but be examined and discerned.\n\nLaozi said: One who obtains through unrighteousness and does not distribute, bringing calamity upon themselves—unable to serve others, yet having nothing for themselves—can only be called a fool, no different from the owl that loves its young. Thus, holding and filling it is not as good as stopping; sharpening and honing it cannot be long preserved. In the center of virtue lies the Dao; in the center of the Dao lies virtue. Its transformations cannot be exhausted. Within yang lies yin; within yin lies yang. All things are thus—beyond enumeration. When fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear; when calamity approaches, auspicious signs precede it. Seeing the auspicious yet not doing good, fortune does not come; seeing the inauspicious yet practicing goodness, calamity does not arrive. Profit and harm share the same gate; misfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors. None but the divine and sagely can distinguish them. Thus it is said: Calamity—fortune leans upon it; fortune—calamity lies concealed within. Who knows their limit?\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Misfortune and fortune lean upon each other like a shadow following form. Wealth doubled in entry will be doubled in exit. Accumulating goodness yet not employing it is like raising an owl as one’s child—few do not harm themselves. The mechanism of profit and harm turns back and forth—none but the divine and sagely can know it.\n\nWhen a person is about to fall ill, they first crave the rich flavors of fish and meat; when a state is about to perish, it first detests the words of loyal ministers. Thus, one on the verge of death cannot be saved by a good physician; a state on the verge of collapse cannot be aided by loyal counsel. Cultivate the self, then one can govern the people; order the household, then one can advance to office. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes genuine; cultivate the household, and one’s virtue overflows; cultivate the state, and one’s virtue abounds. The people’s means of living are clothing and food. When affairs are sufficient in clothing and food, merit is achieved; when insufficient, merit is absent. Without merit, virtue does not grow. Thus, following the times without success—do not alter the punishments; adapting to the times without success—do not change the principles. When the time is about to turn, this is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: A state does not stand without its people; the people do not live without food—this is an unchanging principle. Thus, when the people have enough clothing and food, they can live; when they lack clothing and food, merit is obstructed. Without merit, virtue does not grow.\n\nThe true king enriches the people; the hegemonic king enriches the land; the endangered state enriches its officials; the well-governed state appears insufficient; the doomed state’s granaries are empty. Thus it is said: When the ruler does nothing, the people enrich themselves; when the ruler does not act, the people transform themselves. Mobilizing an army of a hundred thousand costs a thousand gold per day. After military campaigns, there are inevitably years of famine. Thus, arms are inauspicious instruments, not the treasure of the noble person. Reconciling great resentment must leave lingering resentment—how can it be used for what is not good? In ancient times, those nearby were not summoned with words, and those afar were not dispatched with words. When those nearby are pleased, those afar come. When desires are shared with the people, harmony is achieved; when defenses are shared with the people, stability is secured; when thoughts are shared with the people, wisdom is gained; when the people’s strength is obtained, wealth is secured; when the people’s praise is won, renown is achieved. Actions invite bandits; words bring calamity. There is no misfortune greater than speaking before others—merely following them. Whispered words travel a thousand miles. The speaker invites calamity; the tongue is the trigger. Once words are spoken amiss, even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: From ancient times to the present, what has not changed is the land; what has varied between order and chaos is the relationship between ruler and people. The true king enriches the people; the hegemonic king enriches the land; the endangered state enriches its officials; the well-governed state appears insufficient; the doomed state’s granaries are empty. Thus, in the eras of Yao and Shun, the world was prosperous; in the Warring States period, there were no wealthy people.\n\nFormerly, Zhonghuangzi said: Heaven has five directions, earth has five phases, sound has five notes, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and people have five positions. Thus, between heaven and earth, there are twenty-five types of people.",

His words state: \"Humans have five positions, each with five gradations, totaling twenty-five in all. The highest is the divine person; the lowest is the petty person. The difference between the highest five and the lowest five is like that between humans and oxen or horses—petty persons violate the Dao and defy virtue, no different from oxen or horses in robes. The sage does not match the perfected person; the worthy person does not match the sage. Only because their attainment of the Dao differs in depth do their ranks likewise follow.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Wenzi Zuan Yi, Scroll Eight**\n*Compiled by Du Daojian of the Song*\n**The Spontaneous**\n\nThe ancient commentaries state: The supreme Dao is vast and boundless, the mother of the myriad things, the bellows and key that open and close without limit or boundary—this is called the Spontaneous. For the Dao’s transmission is utterly cut off: things are so without knowing why, yet it is not that they are not so. All things are thus, cannot but be thus. Yet the Spontaneous is not something that can make them so; it has no cause or dependence. Hence it is called the Spontaneous.\n\nLaozi said: “Purity and emptiness are Heaven’s clarity; non-action is governance’s constancy.”\nThe old commentary: Within emptiness there is spirit; within darkness there is light. Who can perceive it? It is one with the Dao. Through non-action, one governs the self, and the myriad things all attain completion.\n\nAbandon kindness and favor, set aside sageliness and wisdom, cast out worthiness and ability, discard benevolence and righteousness, extinguish affairs and events, reject flattery and sophistry, forbid deceit and falsehood—then the worthy and the unworthy are equalized in the Dao.\nThe old commentary: Remove these seven, and the worthy have nothing to esteem, the foolish nothing to shame themselves over. The vast Dao returns to the Spontaneous.\n\nStillness is identical to emptiness; in emptiness, there is penetration. Supreme virtue is non-action, and the myriad things all find accommodation. The Dao of emptiness and stillness is as enduring as Heaven and Earth. Its spirit is subtle, pervading all things without dominion.\nThe old commentary: When the mind is empty, nothing is impenetrable; when virtue is full, nothing is excluded. Thus it functions spiritually without a master, circulating without end.\n\nThe twelve months revolve in cycles, returning to their beginning.\nThe old commentary: The twelve months turn without cease, ending and beginning anew—such is Heaven’s Dao.\n\nMetal, wood, water, fire, and earth: their forces harm one another, yet their Dao depends on one another.\nThe old commentary: The five phases advance in succession, one flourishing while another declines. Cold and heat alternate in due measure; advance and retreat occur in season. Generation and destruction follow the Dao, never losing their proper order.\n\nThus extreme cold harms things, yet without cold it cannot be; extreme heat harms things, yet without heat it cannot be. Therefore, what can be and what cannot be are both acceptable. The great Dao has nothing it cannot accept; its acceptance lies in principle. When what is acceptable is seen, do not hasten; when what is unacceptable is seen, do not withdraw. The acceptable and the unacceptable serve as each other’s left and right, as each other’s inner and outer.\nThe old commentary: Cold and heat succeed one another—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Ritual and punishment are the laws of the sage. Though cold and heat may be harsh, they cannot be absent; when the time is right, what harm is there? Though punishments may be severe, they cannot be abolished; when principle demands it, they are not harmful. When what is acceptable is seen, act; when what is unacceptable is seen, desist.\n\nThe essentials of all affairs must begin with unity; when the time is taken as their standard, from antiquity to the present they have never changed. This is called Heavenly principle.\nThe old commentary: Unity is the child of the Dao, the handle of the ruler. Though antiquity and the present differ, their functioning remains unchanged—like an axle turning a hub, controlling what is within while the wheel revolves endlessly, beginning and ending with Heaven.\n\nAbove, it grasps the great brightness; below, it employs its light. The Dao generates the myriad things, ordering them through yin and yang, transforming them into the four seasons, dividing them into the five phases. Each attains its place, coming and going with the seasons, following constant standards. Extending even to the incapable, the Dao above does not falter. All ministers are of one mind; the Dao of Heaven and Earth is non-action yet complete, without seeking yet attaining. Thus we know that non-action is beneficial.\nThe old commentary: Heaven hangs its images to illuminate the four directions; the ruler establishes laws to govern all under Heaven. Hibernating creatures awaken; the common people are protected. Yin and yang do not err; the myriad things have constancy. Without non-action, one cannot benefit the state. In ancient times, Yao governed all under Heaven by cultivating himself.\n\nLaozi said: “The greatest simplicity has no form; the greatest Dao has no measure.” Thus Heaven is round yet does not conform to the compass; Earth is square yet does not conform to the carpenter’s square. From past to present is called *zhou*; the four directions and above and below are called *yu*. The Dao is within them, yet none know its place. Therefore, those whose vision is not far-reaching cannot be spoken to of greatness; those whose knowledge is not broad cannot be discoursed with on the supreme. Those who receive the Dao and communicate with things have nothing by which to oppose one another.\nThe old commentary: The Dao is utterly great, without form; Heaven and Earth are utterly vast, without measure. It is near, in the space between a hair’s breadth, yet unseen; it is far, within the cosmos, yet unfathomable. Without broad understanding and communication with things, none can comprehend the source of the supreme Dao or the realm of right and wrong.\n\nThus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had different laws and methods, yet their attainment of the people’s hearts was one.\nThe old commentary: Though their systems of law differed, their reverence for the people was the same.",

      "translated_text": "If compass and square, carpenter’s curves and marking lines are the tools of craft, they are not craft itself. Thus, without the qin, even if one studies under Master Wen, one cannot produce its melodies; with the qin alone, one cannot evoke sorrow on one’s own. Therefore, the qin is the instrument of sorrow, not sorrow itself.\n\nThe old commentary: Though all things are said to be natural, they all rely on mutual support and cannot move alone. It is like carpenter’s curves and marking lines, which are the means of craft yet not craft itself. The marvel lies in the person. Without restraint, even the qin cannot be played well; the instrument is the means of sorrow, yet not sorrow itself. Without the qin, there is no sorrow.\n\nAs for divine harmony flowing between heart and hand, freely expressing spirit and discussing transformation while shaping it through the qin—even a father cannot teach this to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the untransmittable Dao.\n\nThe old commentary: Master Wen plays the qin, directing his fingers to pluck the strings, expressing spirit and freely roaming between heart and hand, harmonizing the signs of yin and yang. Thus, the transformations of the four seasons’ qi move all things. Even between father and son, though closely bound, this cannot be transmitted. Such marvel reaches its utmost—this, too, is the subtle Dao that cannot be passed down.\n\nThus, solemnity is the ruler of form, and stillness is the master of sound.\n\nThe old commentary: Solemnity is stillness; thus, stillness gives birth to form, and stillness is its ruler. Within stillness lies sound, and silence is its master.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of Heaven and Earth takes virtue as its master and the Dao as its mandate, allowing things to correct themselves. The utmost restraint lies within, not prizing affairs. Thus, it does not wait for achievement to stand, does not rely on position for honor, does not depend on fame to be manifest, does not require ritual for dignity, nor weapons for strength.\n\nThe old commentary: The Dao gives life as its mandate; virtue nurtures as its master. One who can harmonize spirit and qi, rectify nature and life, inwardly preserve essence and qi, and outwardly discard troubles—why would they need fame or position to be honored? Without relying on weapons, none would oppose them.\n\nThus, the Dao is established yet does not teach; it illuminates yet does not scrutinize. The Dao is established yet does not teach—it does not deprive people of their abilities. It illuminates yet does not scrutinize—it does not harm their affairs.\n\nThe old commentary: When the Dao exists, teaching is abandoned; when illumination is complete, there is no scrutiny. Only then can one entrust all matters without harm.\n\nThose who teach the Dao act contrary to virtue and harm things. Thus, yin and yang, the four seasons, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth share the same Dao yet differ in principle; all things share the same nature yet differ in form. The wise do not instruct one another; the capable do not receive from one another. Therefore, the sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts, allowing each to follow their nature. Thus, the living bear no gratitude, and the dead hold no resentment.\n\nThe old commentary: Acting contrary to virtue means that when virtue declines, teaching arises. Harming things means first diminishing and then benefiting. Moreover, the five phases have different natures, and the myriad things have distinct forms. Teaching has its roots and branches; people have the wise and the foolish. The sage enacts laws and teachings to guide the ignorant, enabling the wise to instruct one another and the capable not to conceal their skills. Each fulfills their role, returning to the natural. The living do not boast of their virtue; the dead do not resent Heaven.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—they regard the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nThe old commentary: Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things; the sage nurtures the hundred clans. How could they have a mind for things or partiality for people? Observed as one, they are like straw dogs.\n\nCompassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness are the narrow paths of the Dao. The narrow leads to confusion when entering the great; the near leads to bewilderment when traveling far. The sage’s Dao enters the great without confusion, travels far without bewilderment, constantly empty and self-guarding—this can be called the ultimate. This is called Heavenly virtue.\n\nThe old commentary: The Dao and virtue are profound and subtle; benevolence and righteousness are narrow and shallow. Following the middle way and treading small paths leads to confusion. Only the most sagely, ascending the great thoroughfare without obstruction—unless one’s inner palace is eternally bright, how can they reach the ultimate with Heaven?\n\nLaozi said: The sage covers like Heaven, bears like Earth, shines like the sun and moon, transforms like the four seasons, nurtures the myriad things without sameness—without old or new, without distance or closeness, without partiality.\n\nThe old commentary: This is the virtue of the sage. Covering and bearing like Heaven and Earth, shining and illuminating like the sun and moon, turning like the four seasons—though customs differ and forms vary, grasses, trees, and insects all dwell in peace and fulfill their natures. How could there be old or new, closeness or distance among them?\n\nThus, one who models Heaven does not rely on a single season; one who models Earth does not rely on a single resource; one who models people does not rely on a single affair. Affairs are manifold, pursuits are diverse.\n\nThe old commentary: If Heaven relied on one season, it could not complete the year; if Earth relied on one resource, its uses would be exhausted; if people relied on one ability, it would not be prized.\n\nThus, in warfare, some are light, some heavy, some greedy, some incorruptible—these four are opposed and cannot be uniform.\n\nThe old commentary: Each pursues their own advantage, so they are not uniform.\n\nThe light wish to advance; the heavy wish to halt; the greedy wish to seize; the incorruptible do not covet what is not theirs.\n\nThe old commentary: When troops are numerous, their hearts desire unity. Yet the heavy wish to halt while the light wish to advance—each pursues their own convenience, so they are not uniform. If they are not uniform, they will be defeated when encountering the enemy. Only by measuring their talents and balancing their strengths can they achieve victory without fail.\n\nThus, the brave may be ordered to advance and fight but not to hold firm; the heavy may be ordered to defend but not to assault the enemy; the greedy may be ordered to attack and seize but not to distribute spoils; the incorruptible may be ordered to guard their portion but not to advance; the trustworthy may be ordered to uphold agreements but not to respond to change. The sage employs all five, utilizing their talents.\n\nThe old commentary: Only the sage excels at employing abilities without losing their proper use—thus, none under Heaven can oppose them.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not cherish a single thing; yin and yang do not produce a single species. Thus, the sea does not refuse water from streams to become vast; mountain forests do not refuse crooked branches to become lofty. The sage does not reject the words of firewood carriers to broaden their fame. Those who guard a single corner and neglect all directions, or take one thing and discard the rest, gain little and govern shallowly.\n\nThe old commentary: Without breadth, the Dao cannot embrace the myriad things. Without depth, the sage’s virtue cannot accept all words. Thus, one ability must not be prized; one corner must not be guarded. Those who guard it are narrow; those who prize it are shallow.\n\nLaozi said: What Heaven covers, Earth bears, and the sun and moon illuminate—though forms differ and natures vary, each has its peace and joy. Yet joy in what one does is the very cause of sorrow; peace in what one does is the very cause of danger.\n\nThe old commentary: If one delights in their own joy, it becomes sorrow; if one delights in another’s joy, it remains joy. If one finds peace in their own peace, it becomes danger; if one finds peace in another’s life, it remains peace.\n\nThus, the sage governs the people by allowing each to suit their nature, dwell in their proper place, do what they can, fulfill their needs, and apply what is fitting. In this way, the myriad things are as one, with none surpassing another.\n\nThe old commentary: The sage governs the people, allowing different natures and forms to each find their proper place. Though the myriad things exist, they are as one body, unable to surpass one another—thus, they are called \"as one.\"",

      "translated_text": "The things of the world are neither inherently noble nor base; if one deems something noble, then all things become noble by that standard, and if one deems something base, then all things become base by that standard.\n\nOld commentary: Nobility and baseness have no fixed division; prosperity and adversity have no constant measure.

Old commentary: These were the Three Dukes, who deliberated on the Dao, managed governance, harmonized yin and yang, and served as the limbs, throat, and tongue of the Son of Heaven. Hou Ji oversaw agriculture. Old commentary: He taught the people to sow and cultivate. Xi Zhong served as Master of Crafts. Old commentary: He created tools to provide for the people’s needs. The sage employed the worthy in this manner; his achievements reached the cosmos, and his virtue flowed to the four seas. Only Heaven is great, and only Yao emulated it.\n\nIn guiding the people, he allowed those who dwelled by water to fish, those in forests to gather, those in valleys to herd, and those on land to farm. Each place suited its tasks, each task suited its tools, and each tool suited its material. Marsh-dwellers wove nets, hill-dwellers tilled fields. In this way, the people exchanged what they had for what they lacked, traded their skills for their ineptitudes, and bartered their strengths for their weaknesses. Thus, those who rebelled were few, and those who obeyed were many. Like the wind passing through panpipes, they responded instantly, each according to its pitch. All things pursued their advantage and avoided harm. Therefore, neighboring states could see one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard across borders, yet no one trod within the lords’ territories, and no chariot tracks extended beyond a thousand li—all dwelled content in their places.\n\nOld commentary: The sage guided the people by following their circumstances and settling them where fitting. Thus, the haves and have-nots exchanged goods, the skilled and unskilled aided one another—like the wind passing through panpipes or rain nourishing all things, sounds followed what moved them, and beings pursued their advantage. Thus, neighboring states could see one another, weapons were unused, and the people lived to old age, all content in their dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a disordered state appears prosperous, a well-governed state appears empty, a ruined state appears lacking, and a preserved state appears abundant. The empty is not without people—each guards its duties. The prosperous is not overpopulated—all vie for trivialities. The abundant is not wealthy—desires are restrained and affairs are few. The lacking is not without goods—people are scarce and expenses are many.\n\nOld commentary: Understanding these four reveals the root of order and disorder, the conditions of survival and ruin.\n\nThus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but followed what already existed. Their prohibitions and punishments were not of their own doing but upheld what was already established. This is the Way of supreme virtue.\n\nOld commentary: Prohibitions and punishments are the laws the former kings established, not for the sake of killing but as dikes and barriers. Yet foolish people do not observe their commands, so many fall into them and perish—this is unavoidable.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world by the Dao is not to alter human nature but to order and smooth what already exists. Thus, to follow is to make the great, and to act is to make the small. The ancients who dredged waterways followed the flow of water; those who grew crops followed the suitability of the land; those who waged war followed the people’s desires. If one can follow, one will be invincible under Heaven. Things must have their natural state before human affairs can be ordered.\n\nOld commentary: Observe that things have their natural natures, then follow what is fitting for them. If you act according to the people’s desires, nothing will fail, and no action will be unprofitable.\n\nThus, the former kings’ systems of law followed human nature and established its patterns. Without that nature, one cannot be guided; with that nature but without its resources, one cannot follow the Way.\n\nOld commentary: Like wood that cannot be made to produce water or metal that cannot be made to generate fire.\n\nHuman nature possesses the resources of benevolence and righteousness, but without the sage’s laws and institutions, one cannot be directed toward the proper path. Following what people detest to prohibit wrongdoing, punishments are unused, and authority works like a spirit. Following their nature, the world obeys; opposing their nature, laws are enacted but unused.\n\nOld commentary: Though morality, benevolence, and righteousness are rooted in human nature, without the sage-king’s laws and the exercise of his power—rewarding with virtue, ordering with ritual, and restraining with punishment—there would be no way to return to the natural state and direct people toward the proper path. Following their nature, their response is divine; opposing their nature, even commands are disobeyed.\n\nVirtue and the Dao are the foundation of merit and fame, what the people cherish. When the people cherish them, merit and fame are established.\n\nOld commentary: Without virtue and the Dao, how could merit and fame be established?\n\nThe ancients who were good at being rulers modeled themselves on rivers and seas. Rivers and seas achieve their greatness through non-action, their vastness through humility. Thus, they endure long as the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they gather the hundred streams; through not seeking, they obtain; through not acting, they reach. Therefore, they take the world without effort, do not value themselves and so are rich, do not display themselves and so are illustrious, do not boast and so endure, do not possess and so become kings of the world. Not contending, none can contend with them. Never striving to be great, they achieve greatness. Rivers and seas are close to the Dao, thus they endure long, preserving themselves like Heaven and Earth. Kings and lords cultivate the Dao, achieve success without possession, and without possession, they become strong and firm. Strong and firm without oppressing others, the Dao deepens; the Dao deepens, and virtue deepens; virtue deepens, and merit and fame are accomplished. This is called profound virtue—vast and far-reaching, the opposite of all things.\n\nOld commentary: The world exalts the lofty, but I humble myself; the world values boasting, but I do not contend. Dwelling in non-possession, I am thus the opposite of all things.\n\nThe world has a beginning, but none know its principle. Only the sage knows its cause. It is neither male nor female, neither yin nor yang. Born yet undying, it completes Heaven and Earth, forms yin and yang, shapes the myriad things, and gives them life. Thus, yin and yang have round and square, short and long, existence and extinction. The Dao commands them, hidden and inactive in the mind, deeply guarded by the Dao, profoundly rich. Life and death share the same principle; the myriad things transform and unite in the One Dao. Simplify life, forget death—what path does not lead to longevity? Abandon affairs and words, follow non-action. Guard the Dao, be thorough with things, do not control. To the utmost, be cautious, formless. The beginning of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things are one in the Dao yet differ in form. To the utmost, there are no things—thus one can care for all. To the utmost, vast and without bounds—thus one is the shelter of the myriad things. To the utmost, fine and without interior—thus one is the treasure of the myriad things. Value the Dao to preserve life, virtue to secure form. The measure of the supreme Dao: abandon likes and dislikes, be without knowledge, and intentions will be at ease; harmonize the mind, do not oppose the Dao.",

In this way, the myriad things are as one, with none surpassing another.\n\nThe old commentary: The sage governs the people, allowing different natures and forms to each find their proper place. Though the myriad things exist, they are as one body, unable to surpass one another—thus, they are called \"as one.\"",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states: \"That Heaven and Earth have a beginning refers to the Dao.\" Yet none in the world can recognize it—this is to say, it cannot be distinguished as male or female, nor inferred from form or color. Though one may seek it, there is nothing to speak of; though one may discuss it, nothing can be grasped. Yet it endures eternally.\n\nHeaven and Earth have their positions of high and low; the sun and moon have their proper times of day and night; yin and yang have their principles of hardness and softness; the myriad things have their endowments of long and short. As for the Dao, it is neither hidden nor manifest, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither vast nor fine, neither round nor square. It revolves without limit, transforms without direction. Yet those who embody it can preserve life and secure form, abandon affairs and words, be vast in non-action, and yield in compliance—thus they return to great simplicity and enter the realm of benevolence and longevity.\n\nHeaven and Earth are whole as one, divided into two, yet when reversed and united, above and below do not lose their wholeness. Whole as one, divided into five, yet when reversed and united, they must align with the compass and square. The old commentary states: \"One is the distribution of qi; two is the flow of form; five are the Five Phases. Above and below refer to Heaven, Earth, and humanity, who dwell between them. Those who harmonize their virtue with Heaven and Earth, concentrate their essence into one, must align with the standards and return to the origin.\"\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be guarded against; it is most near yet cannot be sought afar. Those who seek it far away go and return in vain. The old commentary states: \"To seek it in external things is to know nothing; to seek it within oneself is to find it.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The emperor has a name, yet none know his true nature. The emperor values virtue; the king esteems righteousness; the hegemon is adept in principle.\" The old commentary states: \"Virtue nurtures and fosters the myriad things; righteousness rescues the drowning and upholds the imperiled; principle responds to the mechanisms of fate.\"\n\nThe Way of the sage in relation to things: when the Dao is narrow, one relies on wisdom; when virtue is thin, one relies on punishment; when clarity is shallow, one relies on scrutiny. Those who rely on wisdom have hearts in turmoil; those who rely on punishment incur resentment above and below; those who rely on scrutiny do not seek goodness in serving their superiors—this is corruption. The old commentary states: \"Wisdom gives rise to falsehood and obscures truth; punishment breeds legalistic deception; scrutiny arises from pretense. Once these three change, even the sage cannot overcome them—here lies the corruption of losing the Dao.\"\n\nThus, the sage follows Heaven and Earth to transform their virtue. Heaven covers and Earth bears; the Dao nourishes in accordance with the seasons. When nourishment is abundant, governance is achieved. Even if there are divine sages, what can replace this? Abandoning the mind’s knowledge, reducing punishments, returning to tranquility—things will right themselves. The Dao as ruler is like a corpse: solemn, profound, and silent, yet all under Heaven receive its blessings. One person is covered without excess; ten thousand are covered without insufficiency. Therefore, to heavily bestow favors or heavily impose violence is to oppose the Dao. Bestowing favors is to distribute alms. The old commentary states: \"The sage observes the corruption of the times and the reliance on cunning deception, thus governs with the Dao and responds by returning to tranquility, allowing things to right themselves. By guarding profound silence, they restore simplicity. Thus, rewards are not recklessly given, and punishments are not recklessly applied—violence and chaos do not arise, and the Dao is followed.\"\n\nWithout merit, to grant generous rewards; without labor, to confer high ranks—those who hold office will grow lax in their duties, and the idle will hasten to advance. Those who are violent recklessly execute the innocent, and those who walk the Way are subjected to punishment. Thus, those who cultivate themselves are not encouraged toward goodness, and those who act wickedly lightly offend their superiors. Therefore, bestowing favors gives rise to treachery; imposing violence gives rise to chaos. A society of treachery and chaos is the wind that topples states. The old commentary states: \"Punishment cannot be applied to those with the Dao; rank cannot be attained without merit. Otherwise, those who hold office will show signs of laxity, and those who walk the Way will have hearts of decline—this is a society of treachery and chaos, the wind that topples states.\"\n\nThus, when the state executes, the ruler does not grow angry; when the court bestows rewards, the lord does not intervene. Those executed do not resent the ruler, for their crimes are fitting; those rewarded do not feel indebted to the lord, for their achievements are deserved. The people know that rewards and punishments arise from their own conduct, thus they devote themselves to merit and cultivation, not seeking gifts from others. Therefore, the court is uncluttered and without traces; the fields are opened and without weeds. The old commentary states: \"Rewards suffice to encourage goodness; punishments suffice to deter treachery. Those who reward show no arrogance; those who punish show no sorrow. Thus, those near receive its blessings; those far submit to its virtue. All cultivate their work and exhaust their strength—thus the court is without disputes, and the fields flourish with crops.\"\n\nThus, the highest ruler is unaware yet possesses it. The old commentary states: \"This speaks of later ages knowing that the highest ruler has the Dao, and later kings emulate it.\"\n\nThe kingly Way: abides in the affairs of non-action, practices the teaching of no words, is tranquil and unmoving, consistent and unshaken. It follows and entrusts to subordinates, holds them accountable without labor, devises without miscalculation, acts without error. Speech and writing, conduct and demeanor, advance and retreat, movement and stillness—all accord with the seasons, follow principle. Beauty and ugliness are not loved or hated; rewards and punishments do not bring joy or anger. Each is named according to its nature; each follows its affairs naturally, without anything issuing from the self. If one seeks to grasp it, this is to depart from it; if one seeks to adorn it, this is to harm it. The old commentary states: \"The king must be great to contain the myriad things, tranquil to harmonize the hundred clans. Free from love and hate, earnest in simplicity, narrow yet not intimate, refined yet not harmful—thus all things return to the natural.\"\n\nHeaven’s qi forms the spirit; Earth’s qi forms the corporeal soul. When reversed, the profound and wondrous each dwell in their abode—guard them and do not lose them. Above, they connect with the Great One. The essence of the Great One communicates and unites with Heaven. The Way of Heaven is silent, without form, without rules—vast beyond measure, deep beyond fathoming. It constantly transforms with humanity, yet wisdom cannot grasp it. It revolves without end, transforms like a spirit, empty and compliant, always following and never leading. The old commentary states: \"The spirit in humanity is yang, life—received from Heaven. The corporeal soul is yin, death—received from Earth. Each guards its principle. The spirit is the yang’s numen; the corporeal soul is the yin’s essence. Spirit and corporeal soul are the utmost essences of Heaven and Earth—thus they are called profound and wondrous. Heaven attains them and is eternally bright; humanity attains them and is eternally alive—thus it is said, 'guard them and do not lose them.' Above, they connect with the Great One—the Great One is the Supreme Dao Lord, what humanity is endowed with. This means that if one can guard their essence and spirit, keeping them from leaving the body, they will unite above with Heaven and the Great One. Concentrating essence and accumulating thought, they can communicate. The method of guarding is only through essence and silence, without form, without rules—boundless and immeasurable, its subtlety unfathomable. Thus it is said, 'it constantly transforms with humanity, yet wisdom cannot grasp it; it revolves like a wheel, transforms like a spirit.' In the space of emptiness and compliance, it always follows and never leads—profound and unknowable, thus it is called the utmost subtlety.\"\n\nIn governing, listen with an empty mind and a yielding will, clear and bright without obscurity. Thus, all ministers gather like spokes converging on a hub, advancing together—whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, none fail to exhaust their abilities. The ruler attains what controls the ministers; the ministers attain what serves the ruler—thus the governance of the state is enlightened.\"",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states: One who possesses a mirror of clarity and brightness will surely perceive the essence of purity. In governing the state, all ministers will vie to support him without contempt; in cultivating the self, the myriad things will encircle and guard him without departure.\n\nLaozi said: \"He who knows and delights in inquiry is wise; he who is brave and delights in inquiry prevails. He who rides upon the wisdom of the multitude can accomplish all tasks; he who employs the strength of the multitude can overcome all obstacles. Relying on the strength of the multitude, even Wu Huo is not sufficient to depend upon; riding the momentum of the multitude, all under heaven is not enough to employ.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: One who skillfully employs the multitude finds no strength under heaven too great to overcome. Using the strength of the multitude, even mountains and hills, though heavy, can be moved by their force; employing the wisdom of the multitude, even ghosts and spirits, though obscure, can be illuminated in their principles. Without strategic advantage, one cannot create a position of power; without following the patterns of principle, even the sagely cannot succeed.\n\nThe old commentary states: Once the mechanism of strategic advantage is set, even an ordinary man can release the tension of a ten-thousand-jun crossbow; once the principles of affairs are violated, even a sage cannot bend the words of a child.\n\nThus, the sage in undertaking affairs never fails to rely upon and employ available resources. One with a single merit is placed in a single position; one with a single ability is assigned a single task. When strength surpasses the task, the undertaking is not burdensome; when ability matches the affair, the accomplishment is not difficult. The sage employs all without exception, thus no person is discarded, and no material is wasted.\n\nThe old commentary states: Employing each according to their capacity, none fail to exhaust their talents; utilizing each according to their ability, none fail to devote their utmost effort.\n\nLaozi said: \"The so-called non-action does not mean drawing them will not bring them near or pushing them will not send them away—petty and unresponsive, unmoved by stimuli; rigid and stagnant, unflowing; coiled and grasped, undispersed.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: Only by adapting to circumstances, following the times, and responding to things without obstruction is it called non-action. It means private will does not enter public Dao, desires do not cling to correct methods; following principle in action, establishing merit by relying on resources, and leveraging natural tendencies—thus affairs cannot but be accomplished. Success is achieved, yet the self does not boast; merit is established, yet the name is not claimed.\n\nAs for water employing boats, sand employing embankments, mud employing sledges, mountains employing baskets, summer canals, and winter reservoirs—forming mountains from heights and ponds from lowlands—these are not what I have made.\n\nThe old commentary states: Each employs what is beneficial and attains its convenience, thus it is said, \"not what I have made.\"\n\nThe sage does not feel shame for the lowliness of his person or the failure of his Dao to prevail; he does not grieve over the brevity of his fate but worries for the suffering of the people. Thus, he remains constantly empty and non-active, embracing simplicity and revealing the uncarved block, not mingling with things.\n\nThe old commentary states: Constantly in harmony with the Dao, not mingled with things.\n\nLaozi said: \"The ancient establishment of emperors and kings was not to indulge their desires. The sage who ascends the throne does not seek ease and pleasure for himself. For the people of the world, the strong oppress the weak, the many bully the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, the brave invade the timid. Moreover, those who harbor cunning and deceit do not teach one another; those who accumulate wealth do not share with others. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established to unify their conduct; the brilliance of one man cannot illuminate all within the four seas, so the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers are established to assist him; distant lands and foreign customs cannot receive his beneficence, so feudal lords are established to instruct them. Thus, heaven and earth, the four seasons—none fail to respond. Offices have no neglected affairs; the state has no wasted benefits. Clothing the cold, feeding the hungry, nurturing the elderly and weak, giving rest to the weary—none are left unattended.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: The sage in the superior position does not desire to honor his position or delight in his person but seeks to relieve the people and remedy their ills. Thus, the Son of Heaven holds to the One to unify them; the Three Dukes discuss the Dao to correct them; the Nine Ministers uphold the law to assist them; the feudal lords proclaim teachings to guide them. Therefore, distant and near share the same customs, ruler and ministers are of one mind, officials have no deceit, salaries and markets have no corrupt thoughts. Thus, the *Book of Songs* says: \"With towering virtue, the four states submit.\"\n\nShennong appeared emaciated, Yao grew thin, Shun was swarthy, Yu developed calluses, Yi Yin carried the cauldron to serve Tang, Lü Wang drummed the knife to enter Zhou, Baili Xi was sold in servitude, Guan Zhong was bound in fetters, Confucius had no soot on his chimney, Mozi had no warmth on his mat—none sought position or coveted salary. They desired to initiate the world’s benefits and eliminate the harms to all things.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the common people, if the four limbs are not labored and thoughts are not troubled by affairs, those who seek sustenance have never been heard of.\n\nThe old commentary states: From Shennong onward, those whose bodies were emaciated and hands and feet calloused did not seek to stand above the people or pursue honor but aimed to save the world. There has never been one who, sitting idly, expected salary or reaped without sowing.\n\nLaozi said: \"The so-called Son of Heaven possesses the heavenly Dao to establish the world. The Dao for establishing the world is to hold to the One as its safeguard, returning to the root, practicing non-action, emptiness, and tranquility—without distraction, without boundaries, without limit, without end. Gazing upon it, no form is seen; listening to it, no sound is heard. This is called the warp of the great Dao.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: As in the previous explanation.\n\nLaozi said: \"The Dao embodies the round and models the square; it turns its back on yin and embraces yang; left is yielding, right is firm; it treads the dark and bears the bright. Its transformations are endless; attaining the source of the One, it responds to all directions—this is called spirit and illumination.\"\n\nThe old commentary states: The human head is round like heaven; the feet are square like earth. The back faces yin, the front faces yang; the left hand holds the yielding, the right hand holds the firm. The feet tread the nine depths, the head bears the three luminaries. Circling without end, its essence shines in all directions, one and unchanging, wheeling without constancy—this is called spirit. Those who see it prosper.\n\nHeaven is round without end, thus its form cannot be observed; earth is square without boundary, thus none can peer into its gate. Heaven’s transformations proceed without form; earth’s growth is without measure.\n\nThe old commentary states: Transforming without limit, even the keenest cannot perceive its form; generating without end, even the wisest cannot know its number.\n\nAmong things, there are those that prevail, but the Dao has no rival. The reason it has no rival is that it has no constant form or position. Wheeling without end, it resembles the movement of the sun and moon, the alternation of spring and autumn, the succession of day and night—ending and beginning again, brightening and darkening again. It shapes forms yet has no form, thus its achievements can be accomplished; it creates things yet is not a thing, thus it prevails without exhaustion.\n\nThe old commentary states: Forms emerge from the formless, thus forms are endless; things emerge from the non-thing, thus things are inexhaustible.\n\nHe who excels in temple warfare becomes an emperor; he who excels in spiritual transformation becomes a king. He who excels in temple warfare models the heavenly Dao; he who excels in spiritual transformation illuminates the four seasons. Cultivating governance within his borders, distant lands cherish his virtue; achieving victory before battle, the feudal lords submit as guests.\n\nThe old commentary states: He who excels in temple warfare governs by the Dao to become emperor; he who excels in spiritual transformation prevails by arms to become king. These are employed only when unavoidable.",
      "overlap_context": ", it always follows and never leads—profound and unknowable, thus it is called the utmost subtlety.\"\n\nIn governing, listen with an empty mind and a yielding will, clear and bright without obscurity. Thus, all ministers gather like spokes converging on a hub, advancing together—whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, none fail to exhaust their abilities. The ruler attains what controls the ministers; the ministers attain what serves the ruler—thus the governance of the state is enlightened.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those of old who attained the Dao were quiescent and modeled heaven and earth; in motion, they accorded with the sun and moon. Joy and anger followed the four seasons; commands resounded like thunder, their qi never clashing with the eight winds. Flexion and extension never transgressed the five measures.\n\nThe old commentary states: Those who attain the Dao do not rashly give vent to joy or anger, nor rashly issue commands. They model heaven and earth, accord with the sun and moon—thus the eight winds never clash, and the five planets never deviate.\n\nThey followed the people’s desires and harnessed their strength, removing cruelty and eliminating harm. Those who share benefits die for one another; those who share sentiments complete one another; those who share conduct assist one another. Moving in accord with the Dao, the world becomes a crucible. Thus, he who excels in employing troops employs their self-interest; he who cannot employ troops employs them for his own ends. Employing their self-interest, none in the world cannot be employed; employing them for his own ends, not a single person can be employed.\n\nThe old commentary states: Remove what harms them, and though the world be vast, all will serve of their own accord. Oppose their desires, and though one be few, none will belong to oneself.\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Eight\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Library Collection*\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Nine\nBy Du Daojian of the Song\n*Lower Virtue* Chapter\n\nThe old commentary states: The supreme Dao is empty and merged, formless—thus it acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone. As for those who dedicate themselves to nurturing and encounter things with governance, holding to the Dao without loss and guarding virtue without deviation—these belong to the lower virtue. Yet this chapter specifically sets forth the essence of the *Upper Virtue* to clarify the meaning of the *Lower Virtue*.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the self, the highest is to nurture the spirit.\nThe old commentary states: When the spirit is serene and joyful, the self attains great governance.\n\nNext is to nurture the form.\nThe old commentary states: When the form is free from toil, the flesh is full; the spirit is clear, the mind is at peace, and all joints are at rest—this is the root of nurturing life.\n\nThe old commentary states: When the spirit is unagitated and the form is unlabored, this is the foundation of governance and nurturance.\n\nTo fatten the flesh, fill the belly, and supply desires—this is the end of nurturing life.\nThe old commentary states: When nurturing the form reaches this point, the spirit and mind no longer remain clear and at peace—thus it is called the end.\n\nIn governing the state,\nThe old commentary states: This speaks of the Dao of governing the state.\n\nThe highest is to nurture transformation.\nThe old commentary states: To nurture the transformation of virtue and power.\n\nNext is to rectify the law.\nThe old commentary states: To rectify the laws of punishment and reward.\n\nPeople yield to one another, contend to occupy the lowly, vie for few gains, and strive for labor—daily transforming upward toward goodness, unaware of why they do so. This is the root of governance.\nThe old commentary states: The sage rectifies himself and awaits them—none fail to daily employ and transform toward goodness, unaware of why they do so.\n\nUsing profit to encourage goodness and fear of punishment to deter wrongdoing, with laws rectified above and the people compliant below—this is the end of governance.\nThe old commentary states: Relying on this for governance, ruler and minister mutually sustain and compete in vigilance to preserve it—thus it is called the end.\n\nThe ancients nurtured the root; later ages attended to the end.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: *Lower Virtue* means holding to virtue. The highest is nurturing the spirit—the root of governing the self. Next is nurturing the form—the end of governing the self. The highest is nurturing transformation—the root of governing the state. Next is rectifying the law—the end of governing the state. Descending further, there is yet a lower than the *Lower Virtue*.\n\nLaozi said: Rulers capable of governance do not appear in every generation; ministers capable of assisting governance do not number one in ten thousand. Seeking one in ten thousand among those who do not appear in every generation—this is why supreme governance occurs but once in a thousand years.\n\nThe old commentary states: A sage descends once in a thousand years; a worthy is born once in five hundred—when virtue converges and timing aligns, it is rare to encounter. Some say: When the ruler is sagely, the minister is worthy, and the minister can guide the ruler to become like Yao and Shun. Yet when heavenly qi descends and earthly qi does not respond, when the earth has fertile soil but heaven sends drought or flood—even between heaven and earth, harmony is not always achieved. How much less can ruler and minister constantly share virtue? Thus, one knows that eras of supreme governance are rare indeed.\n\nFor the achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every generation.\nThe old commentary states: The Dao of hegemons and kings cannot be passed down through successive generations.\n\nFollow their good intentions, guard against their perverse thoughts, and share with the people a single Dao—then the people can be made good, and customs can be made beautiful.\nThe old commentary states: Nurture goodness, restrain perversity, do not rely on hanging laws, and move together along the Dao—daily transformation occurs unawares. This is called attaining the root of governance and achieving perfect goodness.\n\nWhat is prized in the sage is not that he follows crimes to enact punishments, but that he knows where disorder arises.\nThe old commentary states: What is valued is governing before things take shape.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edge and indulges them, letting them become dissolute and licentious, then abandons them to the law and follows with punishments—though one may slaughter the world, one cannot suppress their villainy.\nThe old commentary states: Preventing disorder does not lie in addressing the root but in controlling what is inevitably violated—like holding firewood to put out a fire, only feeding its intensity.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The convergence of a wise ruler and a worthy minister occurs but once in a thousand years. Wise rulers do not appear in every generation; worthy ministers do not number one in ten thousand. When a ruler who does not appear in every generation obtains a minister who is one in ten thousand—from Tang and Yu onward, examples like Tang with Yi Yin or King Wen with Lü Wang are rarely seen. Even cases like Duke Huan of Qi with Guan Zhong do not appear in every generation. Thus, eras of governance grow fewer while eras of disorder grow more numerous—perhaps because the noble are few and the petty are many?\n\nLaozi said: One who dwells by rivers and seas yet keeps his heart in the palace—this is valuing life. Valuing life means轻轻利.\nThe old commentary states: Though one has not forgotten worldly glory, one can place oneself in tranquility and vastness—this may be called one who values life and轻轻利.\n\nIf one cannot overcome oneself but follows it, the spirit suffers no harm.\nThe old commentary states: When the inner struggle is not overcome, one should follow the heart and fulfill the will—this still avoids harm to life.\n\nIf one cannot overcome oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called重伤. One who is重伤 will not live long.\nThe old commentary states: If one cannot forget attachments yet suppresses them to return to stillness, this重伤s life. One who重伤s life will no longer be among the long-lived.\n\nThus it is said: Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Increasing life is called auspiciousness; the mind employing qi is called strength.\nThe old commentary states: One who can release emotions and fulfill the will still approaches knowing harmony. One who guards constancy is clear about his lot. Increasing life and employing qi are also fitting for this—how much more so when one attains the supreme harmony of heaven and earth, draws upon the enduring virtue, understands the unity of life and death, and lives without perishing? This is the luminous penetration of heavenly nature.\n\nThis is called \"using its light and returning to its clarity.\"\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: In the Dao of serving or reclusion, there is no bending or extending. Though the self dwells in rivers and lakes, the heart remains in the palace—this is not forgetting the furrowed fields. Thus, the man of Dao recludes by this Dao: when the time is to stop, he stops; when the time is to act, he acts. This is called \"using its light and returning to its clarity.\"\n\nLaozi said: Nothing in the world is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. What is called doing good? Being quiescent and without action, suiting one’s emotions, rejecting excess, free from enticement, following one’s nature, preserving authenticity, and never changing within oneself—thus it is said that doing good is easy.",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states that this does not exceed the bounds of one’s inherent nature—how could it not be easy? What is called \"doing evil is difficult\" refers to murder, usurpation, deceit, restlessness, and excessive desires—these are not of human nature. Thus, it is said that doing evil is difficult. The old commentary states that this exceeds the bounds of ordinary nature—how could it not be hard? That which accords with the Dao brings good fortune and is easy; that which opposes the Dao brings misfortune and is difficult.\n\nWhat is now considered the greatest affliction arises from lacking constancy and measure. The old commentary states: If one acts recklessly, affliction follows; if one acts without restraint, affliction grows. Thus, in matters of profit and harm, fortune and misfortune, one must be discerning. The sage has no desires and no aversions. The old commentary states: Having no desires, what would one avoid? In some matters, pursuing desire only leads to loss; in others, avoiding harm only brings it closer. The old commentary states: Seeking to nourish life yet losing it, striving to avoid misfortune yet encountering it. When the will is set on desire, one forgets one’s purpose. The old commentary states: Like grasping for gold, one becomes blind to others and forgets all caution.\n\nThus, the sage examines the changes between movement and stillness, adapts to the measure of giving and receiving, harmonizes the emotions of love and aversion, and moderates joy and anger. When movement and stillness are balanced, affliction cannot intrude. The old commentary states: The common affliction of people is their inability to avoid calamity. When giving and receiving are appropriate, guilt does not burden one. The old commentary states: When one acts according to one’s capacity, one is no longer bound by guilt. When love and aversion are principled, sorrow does not approach. The old commentary states: If one’s choices are upright, one avoids proximate sorrow. When joy and anger are moderated, resentment does not arise. The old commentary states: With consistent rewards and punishments, resentment does not take root.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Though good and evil take different forms, both arise from the heart. Nothing in the world is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. The steps to fortune and misfortune are unpredictable—one may seek gain yet lose, strive to avoid harm yet encounter it. Thus, the sage examines the changes between movement and stillness, harmonizes joy and anger, and acts without error. What sorrow or resentment could there be?\n\nThe person who embodies the Dao does not grasp at what is not theirs nor refuse misfortune. They do not discard what is not theirs nor control what is beyond them. The old commentary states: They are unified in their circumstances—what comes is not refused, what has not yet arrived is not sought. They remain full yet do not overflow, ever empty yet easily sustained. The old commentary states: This is the result of self-sufficiency. Thus, when one measures oneself by the Dao and its arts, food fills the void, clothing wards off the cold—enough to warm and nourish this seven-foot frame. Without the measure of the Dao and its arts, even the power of ten thousand chariots cannot bring joy, nor can the wealth of the world bring delight. The old commentary states: Abiding in the Dao, all desires may be followed without limit.\n\nThus, the sage’s heart is at peace, their will is yielding, their spirit is inwardly guarded, and external things cannot delude them. The old commentary states: Without desire, one is naturally at peace; without greed, one is naturally yielding.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Cultivating the self has its Dao; engaging with the world has its art. The person who embodies the Dao upholds their natural constancy, accepts their fate, eats to fill the void, clothes themselves to ward off the cold, does not grasp at what is not theirs, does not discard what they possess, avoids misfortune without seeking it, and does not recklessly pursue fortune. They are not arrogant in success nor change their conduct in adversity. They delight in their natural truth and remain with the Dao for long.\n\nLaozi said: One who overcomes others is strong; one who overcomes themselves is mighty. Those who are mighty must employ the strength of others. The old commentary states: This refers to the power of virtue that subjugates others. Those who can employ the strength of others must win their hearts. Those who win the hearts of others must first master themselves. There has never been one who mastered themselves yet lost others, nor one who lost themselves yet won others. The old commentary states: This was already explained in the *Fuyan* chapter.\n\nThus, the foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people. The foundation of pacifying the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency. The foundation of ensuring sufficiency lies in not seizing the seasons. The old commentary states: The seasons refer to the three periods of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest. The foundation of not seizing the seasons lies in reducing affairs. The foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderating use. The foundation of moderating use lies in eliminating arrogance. The old commentary states: This means attaining the proper mean. The foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in emptiness and non-action. The old commentary states: The root lies in emptying oneself and governing without action—how could this not embody the principle of moderation and the virtue of cherishing the people?\n\nThus, one who understands the nature of life does not pursue what life cannot provide; one who understands the nature of fate does not worry over what fate cannot bestow. Why is this? The old commentary states: The body’s own limits—thus, the wise do not worry, and only then can they fully realize the way of preserving life and entrusting themselves to fate. The eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves rich flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds—the seven apertures contend with one another, harming the singular nature. Day by day, deviant desires drain one’s celestial harmony. If one cannot even govern oneself, how can one govern the world? The old commentary states: There has never been one who harmed themselves yet could also govern others—how much less the world?\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: To overcome others, one must first overcome oneself. There has never been one who failed to overcome themselves yet could overcome others. Overcoming others requires strength—this is about using force to prevail. Overcoming oneself requires might—this is about principle prevailing over desire. When principle prevails, one wins the hearts of others, and they willingly offer their strength. When desire prevails, one employs the strength of others, yet they first withdraw their hearts. The difference between heavenly principle and human desire is thus clear.\n\nWhat is called \"gaining the world\" does not refer to treading upon power and bearing a noble title. It means moving the hearts of the world and winning the strength of the world. The old commentary states: Thus, one’s radiance extends to the four directions, reaching above and below—people cannot bear to oppose them. To have the name of facing south yet lack the praise of even one person is to lose the world. Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings. The old commentary states: This means they lost the hearts and strength of the world. Tang and Wu were not exiles. The old commentary states: It was not that Tang and Wu could exile Jie and Zhou—rather, they followed the hearts of the world and employed the strength of the world.\n\nThe Son of Heaven who attains the Dao is guarded by the four barbarians; the Son of Heaven who loses the Dao is guarded by the feudal lords. The old commentary states: *Guarded* means protected—when the Dao is attained, protection lies with foreign customs; when the Dao is lost, protection lies with ministers. The feudal lord who attains the Dao is guarded by the four borders; the feudal lord who loses the Dao is guarded by his attendants. The old commentary states: If one does not righteously support the royal house and benevolently care for the people, even those as close as liver and gallbladder become as distant as Chu and Yue.\n\nThus, it is said: Do not rely on others not seizing from you; rely on what cannot be seized from you. The old commentary states: Do not defend against the difficulty of virtue; rely on the Dao, which cannot be seized. To practice a Dao that can be seized, even if one avoids murder and usurpation, it is of no benefit in preserving the world. The old commentary states: Dwelling in a position that can be seized, even if one avoids usurpation for a lifetime, it is still insufficient to uphold and protect the divine vessel.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: If one cherishes me, they follow; if one oppresses me, they become enemies. The sage moves the hearts of the world and wins the strength of the world—thus, the world is governed. As for Jie and Zhou as rulers, they had the name of facing south yet lacked the praise of even one person—this is why Tang and Wu could not serve them as ministers. When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao and the feudal lords become his guardians, whose fault is this?",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Those who govern a state well do not alter its ancient ways nor change its constant norms. The old commentary states: They govern by following these.\n\nAnger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is what throws people into chaos. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue; delighting in the use of instruments of misfortune to govern what throws people into chaos is the height of perversity. The old commentary states: This is not the way to govern people.\n\nOne cannot bring misfortune upon others without bringing it upon oneself. The old commentary states: Simply following what one does. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their brilliance, and merge with their dust. The old commentary states: Crush their instruments of ferocity, release their entangled hearts, and harmonize with the myriad things, blending with their dust and transforming them.\n\nHuman nature invariably desires to surpass others and resents falling short. The old commentary states: This is the common nature of people. The desire to surpass others gives rise to contention; resentment at falling short breeds grievance and strife. The old commentary states: Because they harbor resentment, there is much grievance and strife. When grievance and strife arise, the heart is thrown into chaos and qi becomes contrary. The old commentary states: Qi is harmonious and smooth when it follows its proper course.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old withdrew from contention, and grievance did not arise. The old commentary states: This means they did not exalt worthiness. When the heart is at peace and qi follows its course, it is said: \"Do not exalt worthiness, and the people will not contend.\" The *Zuan Yi* states: Contention leaves one lacking; yielding leaves one with a surplus—a way for both self and others to be preserved.\n\nAnger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is what throws people into chaos. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue; delighting in the use of instruments of misfortune to govern what throws people into chaos is the height of perversity. Wenzi transmitted these words to Fan Li, who admonished Goujian when Yue sought to attack Wu. Goujian did not listen and was defeated at Fujiao. Thus, it is known that those who seek to bring misfortune upon others only bring it upon themselves. Would the worthy act in such a way?\n\nLaozi said: Those who govern things do not do so through things but through harmony. The old commentary states: Using harmony to engage with things, they can be governed. Those who govern harmony do not do so through harmony but through people. The old commentary states: When people attain what is fitting, they naturally harmonize. Those who govern people do not do so through people but through the ruler. The old commentary states: When the head is upright, the limbs stand on their own. Those who govern the ruler do not do so through the ruler but through desire. The old commentary states: Without desire, the self is upright; when the self is upright, all under heaven is upright. Those who govern desire do not do so through desire but through nature. The old commentary states: When one attains the principle of nature, all things are untied. If one uses desire to eliminate desire, it is like using affairs to stop affairs. Those who govern nature do not do so through nature but through virtue. The old commentary states: When nothing is lacking, nature is complete. Those who govern virtue do not do so through virtue but through the Dao. The old commentary states: If one does not lose virtue, this is what virtue is. Abiding in the ultimate Dao, virtue arises of itself.\n\nWhen the root of the Dao is taken as nature, there is no deviation. Dwelling long among things, one forgets their root; forgetting their root, one merges with the so-called nature. The old commentary states: Departing from the pure and simple root, one takes the desires of acquired habits as nature. Clothing, food, ritual, and custom are not human nature; they are received from without. The old commentary states: They are outside the bounds of one’s nature.\n\nThus, human nature desires equilibrium; desires harm it. Only those with the Dao can relinquish things and return to themselves. The old commentary states: They can recover the root of nature. When one has something with which to reflect upon oneself, one does not lose the true nature of things; when one has nothing with which to reflect upon oneself, one moves and is deluded by confusion. The old commentary states: Reflecting upon oneself with the Dao, the original nature of the myriad things remains unstained. If one cannot do so, when things come, they delude and confuse, and one loses the proper course in all movements.\n\nThose who indulge their desires lose their nature; their movements are never proper. In managing life, they lose themselves; in governing the state, they throw people into chaos. Those who have not heard the Dao have no means to return to their nature. The old commentary states: Thus, it is said: \"Returning is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: Nature and desire are fundamentally distinct. All people are like this, but rulers are especially so. Those who govern things do not do so through things but through harmony—first clarifying their own nature, then clarifying the nature of things. When the nature of things is clarified, one can assist in transformation and nurturing, participating in the work of heaven and earth.\n\nThe sages of old were able to attain this within themselves, thus their commands were carried out and prohibitions were effective. The old commentary states: When one’s self is upright, commands are followed without being issued. In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit. When the spirit is clear and the mind is calm, things can be set right. The old commentary states: Clarity allows one to discern the true nature of things; calmness allows one to set things right. Then, nothing is neglected, and good is accomplished.\n\nIf one’s hearing is misled by false praise and one’s eyes are seduced by dazzling colors, it will be difficult to set affairs right. The old commentary states: Listening to words amid right and wrong, gazing upon fine silks—when the self is not settled, how can one set things right? Therefore, emptiness is valued. The old commentary states: Because it is unburdened, its responses are inexhaustible.\n\nThus, when water is agitated, waves arise; when qi is disordered, wisdom is clouded. Clouded wisdom cannot be used to set things right; turbulent water cannot be used to level things. The old commentary states: When clouded, it does not reflect; when turbulent, it does not settle. When settled, it is level and still; when reflecting, it is right and fitting.\n\nThus, the sage-kings held to the One to govern the nature and feelings of things. The old commentary states: The clear and calm One can penetrate the principles of the myriad things. The One is most noble, having no preferences under heaven. The sage-kings entrusted themselves to having no preferences, thus they issued commands for all under heaven. The old commentary states: If they were partial to something, it would not be noble under heaven. The sage-kings, being without desire, had no preferences. With no preferences, all preferences were met, thus they could transform and command all under heaven.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: The scholars of old studied for themselves. Once the way of cultivating the self was established, the way of benefiting others could be practiced. The sages attained this within themselves, thus clarity and brightness resided in their persons, illuminating all without exception. They grasped the true nature of the myriad things, and their commands were carried out under heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Yin and yang shape and smelt the myriad things, all riding upon a single qi to come into being. The old commentary states: The three powers share a single harmonious qi to mold the myriad things. When superiors and inferiors are at odds, qi rises and steams upward; when ruler and ministers are not in harmony, the five grains do not ripen. The old commentary states: This is what is meant by storing and communicating harmonious qi.\n\nSpring frost and autumn blossoms, winter thunder and summer frost—all arise from pernicious qi. The old commentary states: That which harms the constant norms is called pernicious qi. Between heaven and earth, it is like the body of one person. The old commentary states: It depends solely on the ruler’s transformation. Within the six directions, it is like the form of one person. The old commentary states: The patterns of movement and function all correspond.\n\nThus, those who are enlightened about nature cannot be coerced by heaven and earth; those who are discerning about signs cannot be deluded by strange phenomena. The old commentary states: Knowing the mutual resonance of spirit and nature, trusting the correspondence of signs between heaven and humanity, one does not fall into fear or confusion. The sages knew the distant through the near. The old commentary states: Comparing to what is within the self.",
      "overlap_context": "d and protect the divine vessel.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: If one cherishes me, they follow; if one oppresses me, they become enemies. The sage moves the hearts of the world and wins the strength of the world—thus, the world is governed. As for Jie and Zhou as rulers, they had the name of facing south yet lacked the praise of even one person—this is why Tang and Wu could not serve them as ministers. When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao and the feudal lords become his guardians, whose fault is this?",

      "translated_text": "Accumulating the harmonious qi of mutual resonance thus arises.\n\nThat which treats the myriad differences as one unity—the old commentary states: This follows from the principle of inference. Qi steams throughout heaven and earth—the old commentary states: The qi of central harmony pervades above and below. When ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are not established, the myriad people will inevitably invade and oppress one another, remaining in a state of chaotic obscurity—the old commentary states: The governance of the utmost Dao transforms through resonance, not through the allure of ritual and righteousness to external things. Thus, in pure simplicity and constancy, one does not know how this state is achieved, yet it is attained.\n\nWhen integrity and shame decline, and the age falls into decay—using much yet possessing little, laboring strenuously yet lacking sustenance—the people grow impoverished and bitter, giving rise to resentment and strife. Hence, benevolence is esteemed—the old commentary states: Temporarily borrowing universal love to govern the people. Yet when people are base and unequal, forming cliques and factions, each promoting their own allies while harboring hearts of scheming, craftiness, and deceit, righteousness is esteemed—the old commentary states: Righteousness is the regulation that accords with what is fitting, after which things are rectified in their reality.\n\nWhen men and women dwell in mixed groups without distinction, ritual is esteemed—the old commentary states: Ritual is the restraint of the self to conform to measure, after which people are ordered in their proper relations. When the passions of life and destiny become excessive and press upon one another in unavoidable ways, leading to disharmony, music is esteemed—the old commentary states: Music harmonizes the heart and calms the mind, after which it transforms customs through resonance.\n\nThus, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are means to remedy decay, not the Dao of universal governance—the old commentary states: They remedy the decay of dissipation and excess, not the universal Dao of governance. To inherit this principle: Heaven and earth are as one body; the world is as one qi. The transformations of yang and the changes of yin shape and refine the myriad things, all riding upon this single qi. The sage cherishes and nurtures the myriad people, regarding them as one family; thus, the world attains peace.\n\nYet when use is excessive and resources are few, when labor is strenuous and sustenance is insufficient, the people grow impoverished and bitter, giving rise to resentment and strife—this is not the Dao of universal governance. If one can truly settle the numinous clarity throughout the world and return the heart to its origin—the old commentary states: Through resonance and transformation, causing it to revert to the original nature—then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang, follow and encompass it—the old commentary states: Through great compliance, great penetration is achieved. Thus, resources are sufficient and people are provided for; the hearts of greed, baseness, resentment, and strife cannot arise—the old commentary states: Through attaining their nature and being fulfilled, they do not know of other things.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet virtue and the Dao are settled throughout the world, and the people do not indulge in sensual pleasures—the old commentary states: If they have not been subjected to benevolence and righteousness, then the Dao between above and below flows freely without dissipation, and the virtue of ruler and minister remains plain and undecorated. Thus, when virtue declines, then benevolence and righteousness are adorned—the old commentary states: Losing virtue, then benevolence is lost; losing benevolence, then righteousness is lost. When harmony is lost, then sounds are tuned—the old commentary states: Tuning sounds to seek harmony clearly shows that harmony has already been lost. When ritual becomes excessive, then deportment is adorned—the old commentary states: Excess here means surpassing the mean, thus leading to the adornment of conduct.\n\nThus, only by knowing virtue and the Dao can one recognize the insufficiency of benevolence and righteousness; only by knowing benevolence and righteousness can one recognize the insufficiency of ritual and music. To inherit this principle: When the sage is sincere and enlightened, returning to the original nature, the people revert to goodness. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang, follow and encompass it; resources are sufficient and people are provided for; greed and baseness do not arise, and resentment and strife cease. Benevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet virtue and the Dao are settled throughout the world.\n\nLaozi said: The governance of clarity and stillness is harmonious and compliant, tranquil and serene, plain and unadorned, leisurely and unhurried—the old commentary states: The desireless abide constantly in the wondrous, thus all virtues are naturally preserved. Within, it accords with the Dao; without, it aligns with righteousness—the old commentary states: Internally, it harmonizes with the Dao; externally, it rectifies affairs. His words are concise yet follow principle; his conduct is joyful yet accords with the passions—the old commentary states: Words that accord with principle are naturally simple; conduct that follows things is thus compliant. His heart is harmonious yet without falsity; his affairs are plain yet without adornment—the old commentary states: Internally harmonious and externally plain, a heart with falsity leads to adorned affairs.\n\nHe does not scheme about beginnings nor discuss endings; at ease, he remains, and when stirred, he acts—the old commentary states: Dismissing cleverness and abandoning knowledge, he abides in action and responds to stimuli. His entire being accords with heaven and earth; his essence unites with yin and yang; he harmonizes with the four seasons; his clarity illuminates like the sun and moon. Those who transform with the Dao become human—the old commentary states: The self does not possess itself; it becomes human with the Dao, thus heaven and earth, sun and moon, unite in their luminous virtue.\n\nScheming, craftiness, and deceit do not lodge in his heart. Thus, heaven covers with virtue; earth bears with music; the four seasons do not lose their order; wind and rain do not act with cruelty; the sun and moon are clear and still, their radiance unimpeded; the five stars do not deviate from their courses—this is what clarity and stillness reveal—the old commentary states: Through clarity and stillness, non-action, heaven and earth do not fail in their constant virtue.\n\nTo inherit this principle: Heaven is clear and earth is still, thus they endure long. The sage governs with clarity and stillness, modeling himself on heaven and earth. When the heart is clear, it internally accords with the Dao; when the body is still, it externally aligns with others. Thus, without leaving his door, his transformation spreads.\n\nLaozi said: The duties of governing the age are easy to maintain—the old commentary states: Without affairs, they are easy to maintain. Its affairs are easy to perform—the old commentary states: Without disturbance, they are easy to perform. Its rituals are easy to practice—the old commentary states: Without adornment, they are easy to practice. Its obligations are easy to fulfill—the old commentary states: With lenient laws, they are easy to fulfill.\n\nThus, people do not hold multiple offices; offices do not manage multiple affairs. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are distinguished by village and separated by state—the old commentary states: They do not encroach upon one another’s proper relations. Thus, farmers speak with farmers about storing, scholars speak with scholars about conduct, artisans speak with artisans about skill, and merchants speak with merchants about profit—the old commentary states: Profit refers to the calculations of what is advantageous. Thus, scholars do not neglect their conduct, artisans do not suffer in their work, farmers do not abandon their labor, and merchants do not lose their goods; each abides in their nature—the old commentary states: Each abides in what is convenient for their nature and practices according to their time.\n\nThough their forms and appearances differ, they exchange tasks without confusion—the old commentary states: Though the four classes differ in appearance and their paths of entry and exit vary, they exchange their tasks without mutual disorder. Those who lose their occupation are base; those who attain their aspirations are noble—the old commentary states: Those who attain do so naturally; those who lose do so naturally.\n\nTo inherit this principle: The ancients guarded one office for life; each office guarded one affair. Thus, in a well-governed age, officials’ duties were easy to maintain, and affairs were easy to perform. Later ages implemented the system of holding multiple offices and sharing affairs, leading to increasingly redundant officials and increasingly complex affairs. With governance issuing from many sources, it instead harms order.\n\nThose with foresight and far-reaching vision possess abundant talent, yet a well-governed age does not demand this of the people. Those with extensive knowledge, strong memory, eloquent speech, and quick wit possess overflowing knowledge, yet a enlightened ruler does not seek this from his subordinates. Those who scorn the world and despise things do not sully themselves with vulgar customs, yet a well-governed age does not use them to transform the people. Thus, those who are too lofty to be emulated are not taken as a measure for the people; conduct that cannot be matched is not taken as the custom of the state—the old commentary states: The Dao of utmost principle unifies customs; esteeming worthies and valuing goods gives rise to contention and theft.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, exceptional talent cannot be exclusively employed, nor can standards be rigidly imposed—old commentary: because their capacities differ. The Dao and its arts can be transmitted through generations—old commentary: the Dao adapts to each according to their share, while arts grasp the one to respond to the myriad, hence their transmission through the ages remains viable. Therefore, state laws may be upheld by the simple-minded, and military discipline may be maintained in unison—old commentary: when the state unifies customs, even the simple-minded can uphold its laws; when the army unifies its methods, even discipline can be uniformly observed. One need not rely on the heroic talents of antiquity, for people are self-sufficient when their existing capacities are employed in parallel—old commentary: in an age without turmoil, the talents of the worthy and the unworthy alike find their proper place and are used together. In the degenerate laws of later ages, standards are set too high, yet punishments fail to reach them; burdens are made too heavy, yet penalties cannot bear them; tasks are made too difficult, yet those who dare not attempt them are condemned—old commentary: demanding beyond their proper share. When tasks are light, all can bear them; when duties are easy, all dare to fulfill them. When the people are oppressed by these three demands, they adorn their intelligence to deceive their superiors, violate norms to pursue perilous paths—old commentary: seeking only to escape blame. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, their deceit cannot be suppressed—old commentary: for their deceit evades the very punishments meant to restrain it. When beasts are cornered, they gore; when birds are cornered, they peck; when people are cornered, they deceive—this is what it means.\n\nThose of abundant talent with foresight and vision are not held to account by a well-governed age; those of extensive knowledge with eloquent and persuasive speech are not sought after by an enlightened ruler. Scorning the world and holding oneself aloof while demanding much of others and imposing the impossible only invites the deceit of those driven to desperation. Laozi said: The sound of thunder and thunderclaps can be likened to bells and drums; the changes of wind and rain can be known through musical tones—old commentary: when confined to sound and appearance, none can escape detection. What is vast enough to be seen can be measured; what is clearly visible can be obscured; what can be heard can be tuned; what can be observed can be distinguished—old commentary: within the bounds of perception. Yet the vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot be contained, nor can the subtlety of spirits and numina be grasped—old commentary: referring to the primordial era when the Dao’s essence was undifferentiated and its virtue’s workings were imperceptibly refined. Once calendars were established, the five colors distinguished, and the pure and turbid, sweet and bitter flavors separated, simplicity scattered and gave way to artifacts—old commentary: with the differentiation of the five colors and the six pitch-standards, the undifferentiated whole dispersed, each finding its place within the realm of instruments. When benevolence and righteousness were instituted and rites and music refined, virtue shifted and became artificial—old commentary: what was once inherent virtue now depends on external cultivation—how could it not be false? The people adorn their intelligence to astonish the foolish and devise deceit to assail their superiors. Though some may hold power over the world, none can bring it to order—old commentary: though they may hold it, they cannot govern it. The more intelligence and ability proliferate, the more virtue declines into depravity. Thus, the perfected person preserves simplicity and does not scatter it.\n\nIn this vein, the sage splits the great unhewn wood, models Heaven and Earth, and observes their images to craft instruments. Just as thunder and thunderclaps relate to bells and drums, and wind and rain to musical tones, all are shaped by their likenesses. Yet the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the subtlety of spirits and numina cannot be fully fathomed. Only the perfected person, preserving simplicity and not scattering it, can serve as the teacher of all ages. In the governance of the perfected person, emptiness and stillness prevail, no desires are visible, the mind abides with the spirit—old commentary: acting without domination—and form harmonizes with nature.",

Those who scorn the world and despise things do not sully themselves with vulgar customs, yet a well-governed age does not use them to transform the people. Thus, those who are too lofty to be emulated are not taken as a measure for the people; conduct that cannot be matched is not taken as the custom of the state—the old commentary states: The Dao of utmost principle unifies customs; esteeming worthies and valuing goods gives rise to contention and theft.",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states: inner and outer flow in harmony, stillness embodies virtue, and movement aligns with principle—following the Dao of nature only when necessity arises. Old commentary: responding only when moved. Acting with serene non-action, the world attains harmony; free from desires, the people naturally return to simplicity. Without contention, wealth suffices; the giver claims no virtue, the receiver offers no deference, yet virtue returns of itself, and none perceive it as a favor. Old commentary: when the world knows not whence its blessings come, nor declines what arrives, then the highest virtue returns, and none regard it as a gift.\n\nEloquence without words, the Dao unspoken—if one attains this, it is called the Celestial Treasury. Old commentary: abiding in this Dao to transform the people and share in their virtue. Drawing from it does not diminish it; partaking of it does not deplete it. None know its source—this is called the Radiant Light. Old commentary: that which has abundance and bestows its surplus upon things is called *light*; that which moves in accordance with the needs of things is called *radiance*. The Radiant Light is the sustenance of the myriad things. Old commentary: the Dao is capable of bestowing and completing, hence it is called *sustenance*.\n\nIn this vein, the Northern Asterism is the honored sovereign of Heaven, dwelling at the center of the celestial pole while the host of stars encircle it. The perfected person models this in governance: the mind abides with the spirit, serene and non-active, and the world attains harmony. The Radiant Light resides at the handle of the Northern Dipper, sustaining the myriad things as it revolves with the leftward turning of Heaven, completing a daily cycle. The Dipper does not descend, yet blessings arise, and the people are fed without want. Shun observed the turning of the jade armillary to align the Seven Governors—was he not one who understood Heaven?\n\nLaozi said: Heaven cherishes its essence, Earth cherishes its balance, and humans cherish their nature. Old commentary: *cherishes* here means *values*. Heaven’s essence consists of the sun, moon, stars, thunder, wind, and rain; Earth’s balance consists of water, fire, metal, wood, and soil. Old commentary: Heaven distributes the essence of the Six Qi, Earth divides the balance of the Five Phases. Human nature encompasses thought, discernment, joy, and anger. Thus, closing the Four Gates and halting the Five Escapes, one merges with the Dao, spirit and numina concealed in formlessness, essence and qi returning to the true. Old commentary: the Four Gates are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth; the Five Escapes are the five emotions straying from their root. By closing and halting them, one merges with the Dao, preserving spirit and qi. The eyes see clearly yet do not fixate on sights; the ears hear keenly yet do not cling to sounds; the mouth speaks rightly yet does not indulge in words; the mind flows unimpeded yet does not engage in thought. Old commentary: acting thus, one avoids external toil and internal harm. Essence stored in the eyes sharpens vision; stored in the ears, it refines hearing; retained in the mouth, it ensures right speech; gathered in the heart, it clarifies thought. Old commentary: if even the mind’s exertions may approach this, how much more so when essence is preserved? Thus, closing the Four Gates ensures lifelong freedom from harm; the four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live—this is the True Person. Old commentary: *neither die nor live* means they are neither abandoned nor employed. The True Person is simply unified: the limbs and orifices are pervaded by pure qi.\n\nEarth’s generation of wealth stems fundamentally from the Five Phases; the sage regulates the Five Phases to govern without disorder. Old commentary: the qi of life and sustenance lies in the Five Phases; governing by modeling them prevents mutual harm. In this vein, humans possess Five Natures corresponding to the Five Stars of Heaven and the Five Phases of Earth. When the Five Natures stir, the Seven Emotions arise—can one remain unaware of their value? The spirit is stored in the heart, essence in the kidneys, the hun-soul in the liver, the po-soul in the lungs, and intention in the spleen. Spirit and numina are concealed in formlessness, neither living nor dying—this is the True Person.\n\nLaozi said: the balance is impartial between left and right, thus it can serve as a level; the plumb line is impartial between inner and outer, thus it can serve as a standard. The ruler is impartial in law, free from personal likes and dislikes, thus he can issue commands. Old commentary: *commands* here means *decrees*. Without partiality, one can rectify the world. Virtue is not established, resentment is not harbored—this is following the Dao and harmonizing with the people’s hearts. Old commentary: yielding to the Dao, one goes where all is the same; sameness without intention precludes both virtue and resentment. Thus, in governance, knowledge is not employed. Old commentary: employing knowledge is inappropriate. Water’s turbulence capsizes boats; wood’s impact snaps axles—one does not resent the wood or stone but blames the clumsiness of the craftsman. Knowledge is not to be relied upon. Old commentary: the unburdened heart incurs no resentment; relying on knowledge never ensures lasting fortune.\n\nThus, when the Dao employs knowledge, disorder arises; when virtue harbors intention, peril ensues; when the heart has eyes, obscurity follows. Old commentary: knowledge disrupts the Dao of non-action; intention endangers the virtue of self-so; eyes obscure the clarity of the heart. Yet the balance, the compass, the square, and the marking-line remain constant and unchanging, ever uniform and unerring, ever square and unobstructed. Their form endures for a day, their transmission for ten thousand generations—this is the non-action that acts. Old commentary: *uniform* means non-action; the Hundred Kings employed it, and it was transmitted through the ages without alteration. All things devoid of partiality or selfishness, when met with this unity, though responding all day, never act—this is the ultimate governance, upright and constant. Otherwise, how could balances and measures, created in a single day, remain unchanged for ten thousand generations? In this vein, when humans harbor selfishness, none fail to harm the Dao; when the ruler is impartial, the law is unified and decrees are implemented. Thus, when virtue harbors intention, peril ensues; when the heart has eyes, obscurity follows. Knowing that the balance, the compass, the square, and the marking-line remain constant and unchanging, one understands that unity is the non-action employed by the Hundred Kings, transmitted through the ages.\n\nThe saying goes: a state may have a ruler who perishes, but the world never lacks the Dao. Old commentary: the Dao does not change with the ages; only humans cultivate it. Humans may reach an impasse, but principle knows no obstruction. Old commentary: one who thoroughly investigates a matter encounters no impassable principle. Thus, non-action is the root of the Dao; attaining the root of the Dao, one responds without limit. Old commentary: without intention in the midst of things, one moves in harmony with the myriad beings without exhaustion. Therefore, not relying on the patterns of principle but instead depending on one’s own abilities will lead to an impasse not far off. Old commentary: only by not relying on oneself but following Heaven’s principle can one remain at ease, unaware of where limitations lie.\n\nThe ruler who does not leave his chamber yet knows the world does so by relying on things to understand things and on people to understand people. Old commentary: taking non-action as one’s heart is the means of reliance. Simply following principle to deduce it, the world can be known. Thus, the strength of accumulated effort achieves all it undertakes; the plans of collective wisdom accomplish all they intend. A thousand-strong host never runs out of provisions; a ten-thousand-strong assembly never fails in its work. Old commentary: when the ruler does not monopolize affairs, he can rely on the people’s strength to bear the world’s burdens. Losing the Dao of reliance, knowledge is exhausted, and affairs are abandoned.",

      "translated_text": "The old commentary states: When commands issue like the wind scattering, then the four seasons—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—take and give in measure, go out and come in with proportion. Joy and anger, firmness and softness do not depart from principle. Soft yet not brittle, firm yet not harsh, broad yet not wanton, solemn yet not perverse, gentle and yielding to nurture the multitude—such virtue embraces the foolish and accommodates the unworthy, without partial love.\n\nOld commentary: Only when all these excellences are gathered does the way of hegemony take shape. Thus, who but the sage can attain the realm between emperor and king?\n\nOne who employs the six pitch-pipes governs life and death, reward and punishment, giving and taking—without these, there is no Dao.\n\nOld commentary: The Dao lies in following the six seasonal indicators to administer all affairs; in the application of rewards and punishments, nothing contravenes what is fitting.\n\nTo strike down disorder and restrain violence, to elevate the worthy and depose the unfit, to correct the crooked and make it straight, to transform peril into peace—this is to be clear about the Dao of bestowing and withholding, opening and closing, riding the moment and leveraging circumstances to subdue and employ the hearts of the people.\n\nOld commentary: Without impartiality, one cannot govern the myriad things; without timing and circumstance, one cannot employ the people.\n\nThe emperor embodies yin and yang, yet encroaches.\n\nOld commentary: This is the virtue of the Great One, the Dao of non-action.\n\nThe king models himself on the four seasons, yet pares away.\n\nOld commentary: This is the governance that equalizes punishments and rewards among the people.\n\nThe hegemon employs the six pitch-pipes, yet brings humiliation.\n\nWhen the ruler loses the plumb line, he is deposed.\n\nThus, to act greatly in small matters is to become isolated and estranged from one’s kin.\n\nOld commentary: This is the insufficiency of relying on wisdom and position.\n\nTo act small in great matters is to become narrow and unable to accommodate.\n\nOld commentary: This is the inability to apply virtue and power.\n\nWhy does the *Zuan Yi* speak not of the \"august\" but of the \"emperor,\" the \"king,\" the \"hegemon,\" and the \"lord\"? It is to honor the august. The emperor loses the Dao and then relies on virtue; the king loses virtue and then relies on benevolence; the hegemon loses benevolence and then relies on righteousness; the lord loses righteousness and then relies on ritual. When the great is established, the small is contained within; when the small is established, the great is lost.\n\nLaozi says: Vast lands and numerous people are not enough to make one strong.\n\nOld commentary: Losing the Dao, all become enemies.\n\nStrong armor and sharp weapons are not enough to ensure victory.\n\nOld commentary: Relying on victory leads to arrogance; arrogance leads to defeat.\n\nHigh walls and deep moats are not enough to make one secure.\n\nOld commentary: Security lies in virtue, not in peril.\n\nHarsh punishments and cruel killings are not enough to inspire awe.\n\nOld commentary: When kindness spreads, awe is established; when laws are severe, people rebel.\n\nIn governance that preserves, even the small must be preserved; in governance that destroys, even the great must perish. Thus, the skilled defender has none to resist him.\n\nOld commentary: He abides in governance that cannot be seized.\n\nThe skilled warrior has none to contend with.\n\nOld commentary: He exploits their anger to employ them.\n\nRiding the moment, leveraging circumstances, and following the people’s desires, the world submits.\n\nOld commentary: This is the way of Tang and Wu.\n\nThus, the skilled governor accumulates virtue; the skilled commander stores up anger. Accumulating virtue makes the people usable; storing up anger establishes awe. Where culture extends deeply, the sway of authority is great; where virtue is bestowed widely, the reach of power is broad.\n\nOld commentary: Cultivating civil virtue draws them in—then shields and spears become discarded objects.\n\nBroad reach makes me strong and the enemy weak. The skilled commander first weakens the enemy, then engages in battle.\n\nOld commentary: He rides the heart of all under Heaven.\n\nThus, the cost is halved, yet the achievement is tenfold. A state of a thousand chariots that practices civil virtue will become a king; a state of ten thousand chariots that delights in war will perish. The king’s army first secures victory, then battles.\n\nOld commentary: It always holds the calculation of certain victory—thus, it conducts campaigns without fighting.\n\nThe defeated army first battles, then seeks victory.\n\nOld commentary: Not knowing constancy, it abides in a position of certain defeat.\n\nThis is to be unclear about the Dao.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* states: One who practices civil virtue, though small, will surely be preserved; one who delights in war, though great, will surely perish. The skilled governor accumulates virtue; the skilled commander stores up anger. Only by knowing the root of warfare—to stop disorder and not cause it—will the people remain unharmed and the state endure long.\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Nine\n*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Wenzi Zuan Yi*",

      "translated_text": "**Imperial Annotated Four Books Repository**\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Ten\n*Chapter on Supreme Humaneness*\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of the noble person is tranquility for self-cultivation and frugality for nurturing life. Tranquility means not disturbing those below; not disturbing those below means the people do not resent. Disturbing those below means governance falls into chaos; the people’s resentment means virtue is thin. When governance is chaotic, the worthy do not offer counsel; when virtue is thin, the brave do not fight. A disordered ruler acts otherwise: possessing the wealth of the world and the power of a state, he exhausts the people’s strength to serve his sensory desires. His will is fixed on palaces, terraces, moats, ponds, parks, and menageries of fierce beasts and rare curiosities. The poor starve while tigers and wolves feast on fodder; the people freeze while the palace is clad in brocade. Thus, the ruler accumulates these useless things, and the world cannot preserve its nature.\n\nLaozi said: Without indifference, virtue cannot be clarified; without serenity, the distant cannot be attained; without magnanimity, all cannot be embraced; without impartiality, judgments cannot be made. Use the eyes of the world to see, the ears of the world to hear, the mind of the world to deliberate, and the strength of the world to contend. Thus, decrees penetrate below, and the sentiments of ministers rise above. The hundred officials are well-ordered, and the assembled ministers converge like spokes. Joy is not expressed through rewards, nor anger through punishments. Laws are clear yet not harsh; ears and eyes are keen yet not dim. The sentiments of good and ill are daily presented without obstruction. Thus, the worthy exhaust their wisdom, the unworthy exert their strength, those near are at ease in their nature, and those far cherish their virtue. This is the Dao of employing people.\n\nOne who rides a carriage and horse does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*; one who boards a boat and oar does not swim yet crosses rivers and seas. If words are correct, though spoken by a woodcutter or grass-gatherer, they cannot be discarded. If words are incorrect, though spoken by a ruler, minister, or high official, they cannot be used. Right and wrong cannot be judged by nobility or baseness, honor or humility. If a plan is usable, one need not be ashamed of one’s position; if words are practicable, one need not value their eloquence.\n\nA benighted ruler acts otherwise: among his assembled ministers, those who offer sincere loyalty are rarely employed, while those who curry favor with the crooked are drawn near. The worthy cannot be seen; the distant and lowly, though they exhaust their strength in loyalty, cannot be heard. Those who speak are silenced with sophistry; those who remonstrate are punished with crimes. Wishing thus to pacify the realm and preserve the myriad regions, he distances himself ever further from clarity and wisdom.\n\nLaozi said: One who values life, though rich and noble, does not harm the body with indulgence; though poor and lowly, does not burden the form with profit. Now, inheriting the hereditary rank of one’s ancestors, one must esteem the loss of it—life’s origin is long-established, yet one lightly discards it. Is this not delusion? He who governs the world by honoring the self entrusts the world; he who governs the world by cherishing the self commits the world.\n\nWenzi asked about the root of governing the state. Laozi said: The root lies in governing the self. Never has one whose self is well-governed ruled a disordered state; never has one whose self is disordered ruled a well-governed state. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. The subtlety of the Dao is such that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\nWenzi asked: What conduct makes the people cherish their superiors? Laozi said: Employ them in due season and treat them with reverence and caution, as if standing at the edge of a deep abyss or treading on thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good are my charges; the not-good are my enemies. In ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang turned against their foes Jie and Zhou to serve Tang and Wu; the people of Susha attacked their own lord and submitted to Shennong. Thus, what people fear cannot but be feared.\n\nLaozi said: He who governs the great cannot act small; he who rules vast lands cannot impose narrow constraints; he whose position is lofty cannot be troubled by trifles; he who governs the multitude cannot be harsh in teaching. Affairs are cumbersome and difficult to govern; laws are strict and difficult to enforce. Seeking much is difficult to sustain. Measuring by inches to reach a *zhang* will surely err; weighing by *zhu* to reach a *dan* will surely exceed. The *dan*-scale and *zhang*-measure are straightforward and seldom err; the general outline is easy to grasp. Clever sophistry is difficult to fathom, yet it brings no benefit to governance but only to disorder. The sage does not act thus; what brings no benefit to use but only to waste, the wise do not pursue. Thus, achievements do not disdain simplicity; affairs do not disdain frugality; seeking does not disdain scarcity. Simple achievements are easy to accomplish; frugal affairs are easy to govern; scarce seeking is easy to sustain. Entrusting tasks to the multitude is easy. Thus, petty disputation harms righteousness; petty righteousness breaks the Dao. A narrow Dao cannot be unimpeded; unimpededness must be simple. The Yellow River winds yet reaches far; mountains rise gradually yet attain height; the Dao wanders yet transforms. One who is skilled in a single craft, precise in a single matter, or discerning in a single ability may excel in a narrow scope but cannot respond broadly.\n\nOne who tunes strings makes the small tight and the large loose; one who establishes affairs makes the lowly labor and the noble rest. The words of the Dao say: Vast and obscure, it follows heaven’s majesty, shares its *qi* with heaven. Those who share *qi* with heaven become emperors; those who share righteousness become kings; those who share achievements become hegemons. Those who share none perish. Thus, without speaking, there is trust; without acting, there is benevolence; without anger, there is awe—this is the movement of heaven’s heart. Acting with benevolence, speaking with trust, and displaying anger with awe—this is the work of utmost sincerity. Acting without benevolence, speaking without trust, and displaying anger without awe—this is the work of outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the Dao to govern, few laws suffice for order; without the Dao to govern, many laws suffice for chaos.\n\nLaozi said: When the whale loses water, it is controlled by ants; when the ruler abandons his proper role and contends with ministers over affairs, he is controlled by his officials. One who holds position and duty through non-action listens and follows, taking compliance from his subordinates. If ministers conceal their wisdom and do not use it, instead monopolizing affairs, the ruler who does not employ ability but delights in acting himself will find his wisdom daily obstructed and bear responsibility alone. When his plans are exhausted below, he cannot extend governance; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control. If wisdom is insufficient for governance and awe insufficient for punishment, he cannot engage with the world.\n\nWhen joy and anger appear in the heart and desires manifest outwardly, those who hold office depart from rectitude to flatter their superiors; officials bend the law to follow the wind. Rewards do not match merit; punishments do not fit crimes. Thus, superiors and subordinates grow estranged, ruler and ministers resent each other, the hundred officials are troubled and confused, and wisdom cannot resolve it. Praise and blame arise, yet clarity cannot illuminate. If one does not reflect on one’s own faults but instead blames others, the ruler labors ever more while ministers grow ever more idle. This is like replacing the master carpenter’s adze—few who do so avoid injuring their hands.",

Only by knowing the root of warfare—to stop disorder and not cause it—will the people remain unharmed and the state endure long.\n\n*Wenzi Zuan Yi*, Scroll Nine\n*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Wenzi Zuan Yi*",

      "translated_text": "When racing a horse, even if one’s sinews snap, one cannot catch up. Mounting a chariot, grasping the reins, the horse submits to the crossbar—Bo Le appraises it, Wang Liang drives it, and a enlightened ruler rides it, achieving a thousand *li* without the toil of driving or guiding. This is the excellence of relying on others’ abilities.\n\nThe Dao of the ruler is to achieve without acting, to accomplish without preferences. Where there is action, there is debate; where there is preference, there is flattery. Debate can be seized; flattery can be seduced. Those who establish yet are controlled by others cannot hold the state. Thus, the wise establish without guarding against words, for what is established has no form.\n\nOnly in spiritual transformation can nothing overcome things. When inner desires do not leak out, it is called \"bolting the inner\"; when external perversities do not enter, it is called \"closing the outer.\" With inner bolted and outer closed, what affair is not moderated? With outer closed and inner bolted, what affair is not accomplished? Thus, without employing, there is employment; without acting, there is action. Without boasting of words, without seizing affairs, one follows names to demand realities, allowing ministers to act on their own. Taking ignorance as the Dao and forbidding harshness as the principle, all officials’ duties are thus examined.\n\nLaozi said: \"Food is the people’s root; the people are the state’s foundation.\" Thus, the ruler follows the heavens above, exhausts the earth below, and employs human effort in between. Thereby, all living things grow, and the myriad beings flourish. In spring, withered branches are pruned; in summer, fruits are gathered; in autumn, vegetables are stored; in winter, firewood is collected—these sustain the people’s livelihood. Without them, the living have no use, and the dead leave no corpse.\n\nThe laws of the former kings did not cover flocks to take the young, did not drain marshes to fish, did not burn forests to hunt. Before the jackals’ sacrifice, nets were not set in the wild; before the otters’ sacrifice, fishing nets did not enter the waters; before hawks struck, snares were not spread on the marshes. Before plants withered, axes did not enter the mountains and forests; before insects hibernated, fire was not used in the fields. Pregnant creatures were not killed; fledglings were not taken; fish under a foot long were not caught; pigs and dogs under a year old were not eaten. Thus, the sprouting of the myriad things was like steam rising from *qi*.\n\nThis was how the former kings responded to the seasons, cultivated preparations, enriched the state, and benefited the people—yet not by seeing with their eyes and acting with their feet.

      "translated_text": "The heart thus readied, the people naturally prepared themselves. Laozi said: In ancient times, enlightened rulers took from the people with restraint and maintained their own sustenance with moderation. They necessarily calculated the year’s harvest and measured the people’s stores, knowing the surplus and deficiency. Only then did they take their due. Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed and avoided the calamity of hunger and cold. Their compassion for the people was such that if the state suffered famine, they did not indulge in rich flavors; if the people endured cold, they did not wear furs in winter. Sharing in the people’s joys and sorrows, the realm knew no grieving subjects nor benighted rulers.\n\nOtherwise, they took from the people without sparing their strength, demanded without measuring their stores. Men and women could not attend to plowing and weaving, yet still had to meet the ruler’s demands. Their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted, they lived from dawn to dusk in want. Now, a single man plowing with his foot could till no more than ten *mu*. The yield of middling fields did not exceed four *shi*. His wife and children, the old and weak, depended on this for food. Should disaster strike, there would be nothing to meet the ruler’s demands—then the lord would pity them.\n\nGreedy rulers and violent lords drained their people to satisfy boundless desires, so the common folk could not receive Heaven’s harmony or tread Earth’s virtue. Laozi said: Of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, none is greater than harmony. Harmony is the balance of yin and yang, the division of day and night. Thus, all things are born at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Birth and maturation must attain the essence of harmony. Excess yin does not generate; excess yang does not transform. Only when yin and yang unite can harmony be achieved. Therefore, the sage’s Way is lenient yet firm, stern yet warm, yielding yet upright, fierce yet benevolent. Too rigid, it snaps; too pliant, it coils. The Way lies precisely between rigidity and pliability.\n\nThe carpenter’s line can be coiled and stored, drawn out and stretched straight, laid out long without warping, kept short without constraint, straight yet not rigid—thus the sage embodies it. If kindness is overindulged, weakness follows; weakness lacks awe. If severity is overindulged, cruelty follows; cruelty lacks harmony. If love is overindulged, license follows; license lacks command. If punishment is overindulged, calamity follows; calamity severs ties. Thus, harmony is prized.\n\nLaozi said: A state endures because it attains the Way; it perishes because its principles are obstructed. Therefore, the sage observes transformations to discern their signs. Virtue waxes and wanes, and the winds of change appear first as sprouts. Those who attain the Way of life, though small, must grow great. Those who bear the signs of ruin, though established, must fail. A state’s demise lies not in its size but in the loss of the Way; its survival lies not in its smallness but in attaining the Way. Thus, the rulers of disordered states pursue territorial expansion but not benevolence and righteousness, seek high rank but not the Way and virtue. They abandon what ensures survival and create what ensures ruin.\n\nIf above, they disrupt the radiance of the Three Luminaries, and below, they lose the hearts of the myriad people, who could not bear it? Thus, he who examines himself need not prepare against others. The ancients who ruled deeply called it the Way and virtue; those who ruled shallowly called it benevolence and righteousness; those who ruled superficially called it ritual and wisdom. These six are the guiding principles of the state. Deep practice brings profound blessings; shallow practice brings meager blessings. Those who practice them fully win the submission of all under Heaven.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating the Way and virtue rectified all under Heaven; cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a single state; cultivating ritual and wisdom rectified a single village. Profound virtue is great; shallow virtue is small. Thus, rank is not established by might, victory is not won by hardness, and attainment is not gained by greed and contention. To stand in the world, extend the self; to prevail in the world, humble the self; to gain the world, yield to it—it does not lie in seizing for oneself. Thus, the female and the yielding stand firm; the soft and weak prevail. With benevolence and righteousness, one attains; without contention, none can contend. Thus, the Way in the world is like the rivers and seas.\n\nHeaven’s Way: to act is to fail; to grasp is to lose. Those who seek great fame and contend for it, I see them not attaining it. Even if they grasp and obtain it, it does not endure. Fame cannot be sought and gained; it is bestowed by the world. What the world bestows is virtue. Thus, the highest virtue wins the world’s submission; the highest benevolence wins the submission of all within the seas; the highest righteousness wins the submission of a state; the highest ritual wins the submission of a village. Without these four, the people do not submit. Without submission, to resort to arms is perilous.\n\nThus, arms are inauspicious instruments, used only when unavoidable. To kill and wound, though victorious, is not to be glorified. Thus, it is said: Where death reigns, thorns grow. Mourn with sorrow, dwell in mourning rites. Therefore, the noble man devotes himself to the Way and virtue, not prizing the use of arms.\n\nWenzi asked: Why are benevolence, righteousness, and ritual considered inferior to the Way and virtue? Laozi said: Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy; those who practice righteousness must clarify taking and giving. Within the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal; the wealth of the treasury cannot suffice to provide for the myriad people. Thus, it is known that cultivating the Way and practicing virtue, following the nature of Heaven and Earth, all things rectify themselves and the world is provided for. Benevolence and righteousness are but adjuncts.\n\nTherefore, the great man dwells in profundity, not in shallowness. Ritual is the ornament of reality; benevolence is the effect of kindness. Thus, ritual is established according to human feelings, not exceeding reality. Benevolence does not exceed kindness. Sorrow embraces emotion; sending off the dead accords with benevolence. Nurturing life does not compel what people cannot reach; it does not sever what people cannot cease. Measures and standards do not lose their appropriateness. Without praise or blame, no cause arises.\n\nThus, music is made sufficient to unite joy, not exceeding harmony. It clarifies the distinction between life and death, accommodates the appropriateness of extravagance and frugality. In later ages, it was otherwise: words contradicted deeds; emotions opposed appearances. Ritual became ornate with excess; music disturbed with licentiousness. Customs drowned in worldliness; praise and blame converged in the court. Thus, the perfected man was abandoned and unused.\n\nTo race a thoroughbred on foot, man cannot outrun it; to place it in a chariot, the thoroughbred cannot outrun man. Thus, those who skillfully employ the Way ride the people’s resources to establish merit, entrusting what they can do to what they cannot. The lord bestows in due season, and the people repay with wealth. The lord treats them with ritual, and the people repay with their lives. Thus, there are endangered states but no secure rulers; anxious lords but no joyful ministers.\n\nVirtue exceeding rank brings honor; emoluments exceeding virtue bring misfortune. Esteeming virtue without exalting it, valuing righteousness without excess—those who exalt without virtue usurp rank; those who take without righteousness steal wealth. The sage is content in poverty, delights in the Way, does not harm life with desires, nor burden the self with profit. Thus, he does not violate righteousness to take wantonly.\n\nIn ancient times, none without virtue were honored; none without ability were appointed; none without merit were rewarded; none without guilt were punished. In advancing people...",

      "translated_text": "In dismissing people, employ ritual; in the age of petty men, in advancing people, employ righteousness. When the superior dismisses people, it is like casting them into an abyss; when speaking of the ancients, it is with urgency for the present. In selecting horses, one errs by favoring the lean; in choosing officers, one errs by favoring the poor. A plump pig fills the kitchen, but its bones, though fine, are not appointed to office. The gentleman examines reality and does not trust slander. When the lord errs and is not admonished, it is not the loyal minister; when admonished and not heeded, the lord is not enlightened. When the people are drowning in distress and not grieved, it is not the worthy lord. Thus, to uphold integrity and die for difficulty is the duty of a minister; to clothe the cold and feed the hungry is the kindness of a compassionate father.\n\nTo serve the great with the small is called adapting to others; to offend the great with the small is called defying Heaven. Though one may ascend to Heaven before, one must inevitably plunge into the abyss. Thus, in villages and hamlets, the elderly are honored by age; in the court, the noble are distinguished by rank. Those who exalt the honored do so because they draw near to the lord; those who respect the elderly do so because they draw near to kin; those who revere their elders do so because they draw near to their elder brothers. Those born to nobility grow arrogant; those born to wealth grow extravagant. Thus, few among the rich and noble, who do not illuminate the Way and examine themselves, can avoid wrongdoing.\n\nTo learn without weariness is how one cultivates the self; to teach without fatigue is how one governs the people. Few who abandon worthy teachers and good friends commit wrongdoing. To recognize worthiness is called wisdom; to love worthiness is called benevolence; to honor benevolence is called righteousness; to respect worthiness is called ritual; to delight in worthiness is called music. Those who were good at governing the world in ancient times practiced non-action yet nothing was left undone.\n\nThus, in governing the world, one who is tolerant can gain tolerance; one who practices non-action can achieve merit. Without tolerance, all actions lead to misfortune. One who is tolerant in governing the world is cautious, as if crossing a great river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing the four neighbors; solemn, as if a guest; melting, as if ice dissolving; simple, as if uncarved wood; turbid, as if muddy water; vast, as if a valley.\n\nTo be cautious as if crossing a great river in winter is to dare not act rashly. To be hesitant as if fearing the four neighbors is to fear self-injury. To be solemn as if a guest is to be modest and reverent. To be melting as if ice dissolving is to dare not hoard. To be simple as if uncarved wood is to dare not claim refinement. To be turbid as if muddy water is to dare not seek clarity. To be vast as if a valley is to dare not be full and overflowing.\n\nOne who dares not act rashly in advancing will not dare to take the lead in retreating. One who fears self-injury guards softness and weakness and does not dare to be proud. One who is modest and reverent humbles the self and respects others. One who dares not hoard diminishes the self and does not dare to be steadfast. One who dares not claim refinement diminishes the self and does not dare to be complete. One who dares not seek clarity dwells in turbidity and disgrace and does not dare to be fresh and pure. One who dares not be full and overflowing sees insufficiency and does not dare to consider the self worthy.\n\nThus, the Dao retreats and so can advance; it guards softness and weakness and so can be proud; it humbles the self and so can be exalted; it diminishes the self and so is truly steadfast; it diminishes and is incomplete and so can be complete; it dwells in turbidity and disgrace and so can be fresh and pure; it sees insufficiency and so can be worthy. The Dao practices non-action yet nothing is left undone.\n\n*Wenzi, \"Weaving the Meanings,\" Scroll Ten*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*",

      "translated_text": "**Wenzi, \"Weaving the Meanings,\" Scroll Eleven**\n*On the Supreme Principle*\n*Composed by Du Daojian of the Song Dynasty*\n\nLaozi said: In all learning, one who can clarify the distinction between Heaven and man, comprehend the root of order and chaos, purify the mind and settle the intent to preserve it, perceive its beginning and end, and return to emptiness and nothingness—this may be called attainment.\n\nThe root of governance is benevolence and righteousness; its branches are laws and institutions. What gives rise to man is the root; what does not give rise to him is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet their nature is to love both. He who puts the root first is a noble person; he who puts the branch first is a petty person. Laws arise to assist righteousness. To value laws while abandoning righteousness is like prizing one’s cap and shoes while forgetting one’s head and feet.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness are vast and lofty. To diminish their depth while expanding their breadth is to invite ruin. To not broaden the foundation while increasing the height is to court collapse. Thus, without a great ridgepole, one cannot bear heavy burdens. Nothing bears weight like the ridgepole; nothing sustains the state like virtue. The ruler’s possession of the people is like a city’s possession of its foundation or a tree’s possession of its roots: when the roots run deep, the base is firm; when the foundation is thick, the heights are secure. Therefore, affairs not rooted in the Dao and virtue cannot serve as enduring principles. Words not aligned with the former kings cannot serve as the Way. To seize upon a single practice and claim it as a universal method is not the universal Dao of the world.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: \"On the Supreme Principle\" clarifies the distinction between Heaven and man and comprehends the root of order and chaos. Governance has root and branch; knowing what to prioritize brings one close to the Dao and virtue. How can such methods govern the world?\n\nLaozi said: The way of governing people is like Zaofu driving a team of four horses. He harmonizes them with the reins and bit, aligns them with the chest and breast, inwardly attains the center of the mind, and outwardly accords with the horses’ intent. Thus, he can traverse the Way and reach distant places, with strength to spare. Advancing and retreating, turning and curving—nothing fails to conform to his will. Truly, he has mastered the method.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the ruler’s team of four horses. The body cannot depart from the comfort of the chariot; the hand cannot lose the horses’ hearts. If the team of four is not harmonized, even Zaofu cannot traverse the Way. If ruler and ministers are not in accord, even a sage cannot bring about order. Holding to the Dao to govern them, even those of middling talent can fully understand. Making divisions clear to them, treachery and deceit can be halted. When things arrive, observe their changes; when affairs come, respond to their transformations. If those near are not disordered, those far will be governed. Without relying on arbitrary teachings, one attains the natural Dao. In ten thousand actions, nothing is lost.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: Heaven and earth are one horse; the myriad things are one finger. The sage’s utmost understanding of things compares the chariot to power and authority and the team of four to great ministers. The ruler thereby rides them without exhausting wisdom or strength, and no distance remains unsubdued. This is the method of governance. How can one speak of governing with those who merely grasp the reins?\n\nLaozi said: In all who practice the Dao, block the paths of depravity and guard against what has not yet arisen. Do not value self-righteousness; value the inability to do wrong. Thus it is said: Do not allow what can be desired, lest there be daily seeking; do not allow what can be seized, lest there be daily contention. In this way, human desires dissolve and the public Dao prevails. Those with surplus stop at the measure; those with insufficiency reach the use. Thus, the world can be unified.\n\nTo abandon duties and heed slander and praise, to discard merit and employ cliques—then extraordinary skills flee, and those who guard their posts do not advance. Customs are disordered within the state; meritorious ministers contend within the court. Therefore, with the Dao, one governs others; without the Dao, one is controlled by others.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: A good physician does not treat an illness after it has arisen but treats what has not yet fallen ill. One who practices the Dao blocks the paths of depravity and governs what has not yet arisen—is this not what the good physician means? Thus, do not value self-righteousness; value not doing wrong. Then there will be no seeking of what can be desired, no contention over what can be seized. Therefore, with the Dao, one can govern others; without the Dao, one is controlled by others.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the state, there is a constant: benefiting the people is the root. In government and teaching, there is a Dao: commands must be carried out. If it benefits the people, one need not follow antiquity; if it suits the matter, one need not adhere to custom. Thus, the sage’s laws change with the times; rites transform with customs. Clothing, utensils, and tools each suit their use; laws, institutions, and commands each fit their circumstances. Therefore, changing antiquity cannot be condemned, nor can following custom be overpraised.\n\nReciting the former kings’ books is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping what gave rise to their words. What gave rise to their words is that which words cannot express. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Therefore, what the sage follows is called the Dao—like metal and stone, once tuned, it cannot be altered. Affairs are like the zither and lute: when a melody ends, the tuning changes. Laws, institutions, rites, and music are the tools of governance, not governance itself. Thus, one of limited understanding cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao, for he is awakened by custom and bound by teaching.\n\n*Weaving the Meanings*: The Dao is the substance of laws; laws are the function of the Dao. That governance has a constant and benefits the people as its root is the Dao. Government and teaching are the Dao, and commands must be carried out—this is the law. The sage’s laws change with the times; rites transform with customs. Laws, institutions, and commands each fit their circumstances. Thus, one of limited understanding cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao, for he is bound by teaching.\n\nLaozi said: Does the world possess constant laws? One must be appropriate to the affairs of the age, accord with human principles, follow the Heavenly Dao, and be detailed in spirit and gods—then one can rightly govern.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns had no decrees, yet the people followed; the Five Emperors had decrees but no punishments. The Xia dynasty did not break its word; the Yin people swore oaths; the Zhou people made covenants. In the decline of later ages, people endured disgrace and slighted shame, coveted gain and lacked modesty. Therefore, laws, institutions, and commands assess customs and moderate urgency and ease. Tools and implements adapt to changes in the times and suit what is appropriate.\n\nThose constrained by laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those bound by rites cannot respond to change. One must possess unique insight and singular hearing, then one can act with the Dao. He who knows the origin of laws responds to the times and changes; he who does not know the source of governance, though he follows, will ultimately cause disorder.\n\nNow, scholars follow the past, inherit practices, grasp texts, and uphold written laws, wishing to govern—this is like forcing a square peg into a round hole. To seek what is fitting is also difficult.\n\nIn preserving danger and governing chaos, even the wise cannot foresee; in praising antiquity, even the foolish have more than enough. Therefore, the sage does not employ unused laws.",

      "translated_text": "Unverified words the enlightened ruler does not heed. The sages established laws to prohibit evil, redress grievances, and protect the people. The Three Sovereigns had no decrees, but from the Five Emperors onward, the laws and ordinances, rewards and punishments they instituted differed with each era—such were the changes of the times. How could the enlightened ruler fail to investigate this?\n\nWenzi asked: \"From whence do laws arise?\"\nLaozi said: \"Laws arise from *yi* (rightness); *yi* arises from what suits the multitude, conforming to the human heart. This is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from heaven, nor do they emerge from the earth. They arise among men, returning to self-correction and sincerity to reach their root, not disordering their branches. Knowing the essential, one is not confused by doubts. What one possesses oneself, one does not condemn in others; what one lacks oneself, one does not demand of them. What is established below is not abolished above; what is forbidden to the people is not violated by oneself. Thus, when the ruler enacts laws, he first uses himself as the model. If prohibitions prevail over his own person, then his commands will be obeyed by the people.\"\n\nTo continue: *Yi* means \"fitting.\" The former kings established laws to suit the conditions of the multitude, thus first using themselves as the model. What they forbade the people, they dared not violate themselves. Therefore, their commands were carried out, and all under heaven followed.\n\nNow, the law is the plumb line of all under heaven, the measure of the ruler. To suspend the law is to make the law lawless. Once the law is fixed, those who meet the line are rewarded; those who fall short are punished. Though noble and exalted, one does not lightly bestow rewards; though lowly and base, one does not heavily impose punishments. Those who violate the law, though worthy, are surely punished; those who meet the measure, though unworthy, incur no guilt. Thus, the public Way prevails, and private desires are blocked.\n\nThe ancients appointed officials to restrain the people from wantonness; they established rulers to control the officials from acting arbitrarily. Laws, standards, the Way, and techniques exist to restrain the ruler from overreaching. When none can act wantonly, the Dao prevails, and principle is attained. Thus, one returns to non-action. Non-action does not mean inactivity; it means that all proceeds from oneself.\n\nTo continue: The law is the ruler’s measure, the plumb line for all under heaven. Once the law is fixed, there is no duality in its application. Those who violate the law, though noble, are surely punished; those who meet the measure, though base, incur no guilt. Thus, private desires are blocked, and the public Way prevails. In ancient times, the appointment of officials, the establishment of rulers, and the institution of rites and laws—if these three were not abolished, the world had no resentful people, and the age could return to simplicity. What need was there for laws and commands?\n\nLaozi said: \"The skilled rewarder spends little yet encourages much; the skilled punisher uses few penalties yet prohibits evil. The skilled giver employs restraint yet bestows virtue; the skilled taker receives much yet incurs no resentment. Thus, the sage follows what the people favor to encourage goodness and follows what they detest to prohibit evil. Rewarding one, all under heaven rushes to follow; punishing one, all under heaven stands in awe. Therefore, the utmost reward costs nothing, and the utmost punishment is not excessive. The sage governs broadly through restraint—this is what is meant.\"\n\nTo continue: Growth and killing, storing and concealing—these are the ways of heaven. Reward and punishment, giving and taking—these are the ways of man. The sage models himself on the Way of heaven and follows the hearts of the people to establish the foundation of good governance. He who possesses all under heaven, mastering these four handles in every matter to the utmost, rewards one, and all under heaven turns to him; punishes one, and all under heaven stands in awe.\n\nLaozi said: \"The way of the minister is to discuss matters and act appropriately, taking the lead in affairs, upholding his duties, and clarifying his responsibilities to achieve success. If ruler and minister follow different ways, there is order; if they follow the same way, there is chaos. Each attains what is fitting and occupies his proper place, so that above and below have means to employ one another.\n\nThus, the branch cannot exceed the trunk, nor the tip surpass the root. There must be a means to regulate light and heavy, great and small. He who attains power and influence holds little yet entrusts much, guards sparingly yet controls broadly. A tree ten spans around supports a house of a thousand *jun*—this is attaining the proper leverage. A bolt five inches long can control opening and closing—this is occupying the crucial point. Commands that must be obeyed bring benefit to those who comply and harm to those who resist. All under heaven heeds them because they are in accord. Issuing orders and enforcing prohibitions relies on the power of the multitude.\n\nRightness does not mean benefiting all the people under heaven; it benefits one, and all under heaven follows. Tyranny does not mean harming all within the seas; it harms one, and all under heaven rebels. Thus, the raising and abolishing, the establishment and removal of measures must be carefully considered.\"\n\nTo continue: The ruler stands by relying on his ministers; the ministers act by relying on the ruler. The ruler practices non-action above; the ministers act below. Discussing matters and acting appropriately, upholding duties and clarifying responsibilities—these are the affairs of ministers. When ruler and minister each attain what is fitting, above and below have means to employ one another, great and small have means to regulate one another. If they follow different ways, there is order; if they follow the same way, there is chaos. The raising and abolishing, the establishment and removal of measures bear on order and disorder. The ruler cannot but be careful.\n\nLaozi said: \"Yield an inch to extend a foot; bend slightly to straighten greatly. The sage acts thus. Now, when the ruler evaluates his ministers, if he does not consider their great achievements but tallies their minor conduct and seeks petty virtues, he loses the way of valuing the worthy. Thus, one with profound virtue should not be questioned about minor faults; one with great renown should not be criticized for small flaws. For human nature is such that none is without shortcomings; what matters is achieving the great outline. Even if there are minor faults, they are not enough to be a burden. If one fails to achieve the great outline, even village conduct is not enough to praise. Thus, the overly cautious achieve no great success, and those with flawed conduct are not tolerated by the multitude.

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: From ancient times to the present, there has never been one whose conduct was entirely flawless. Thus, the noble person does not demand perfection from any single individual. Square yet not cutting, sharp yet not wounding, upright yet not unrestrained, broadly learned yet not disparaging—this is the Way of moral and martial virtue, not demanding perfection from others. Cultivating oneself through the Dao and not imposing demands on others is easily repaid. Cultivating oneself through the Dao leaves no fault.\n\nThe jade tablet of the Xia dynasty could not be without flaw, nor could the luminous moon-pearl be without blemish, yet the world treasures them, not allowing minor defects to mar great beauty. Now, those who fixate on others’ shortcomings and forget their strengths will find it difficult to seek worthies throughout the world. The common view—judging by lowly position, humble status, or base and shameful deeds—fails to grasp the greater pattern. Thus, the way to evaluate others is this: when prosperous, observe what they promote; when wealthy, observe what they bestow; when impoverished, observe what they refuse; when lowly, observe what they decline to do. Observe how they conduct themselves in difficulty to know their courage, how they act in joy to gauge their steadfastness, how they respond when entrusted with wealth to discern their benevolence, and how they react when shaken by fear to measure their integrity. In this way, the true nature of a person may be known.\n\nTo continue: Those who excuse themselves do not correct their faults; those who blame others do not preserve their relationships. The noble person does not demand perfection from others, knowing that not even Yao or Shun could make every matter entirely good. If a person possesses great talent, how can one discard them for minor flaws?\n\nLaozi said: To bend is to seek extension; to yield is to seek uprightness. To yield an inch is to extend a foot; a small yielding brings great uprightness. The noble person acts thus. All rivers flow to the sea—those that do not are not valleys. Those who take divergent paths do not return to goodness—they are not noble persons. Good words are valued for their practicability; good deeds are valued for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe noble person’s faults are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not diminish their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act recklessly, and the brave do not kill without cause. Choosing what is right and acting with deliberation, proceeding with due measure—this is how affairs are accomplished and merits are made reliable, how one’s name endures even after death. Though one may possess wisdom and ability, these must be rooted in benevolence and righteousness to stand firm. The sage takes benevolence and righteousness as the standard: those who meet it are called noble persons; those who do not are called petty persons. Even if a noble person dies, their name does not perish; even if a petty person gains power, their guilt is not erased.\n\nOne who grasps the map of the world in the left hand and cuts their own throat with the right—even a fool would not do this, for the body is more precious than the world. One who faces death for their lord or parents regards it as a homecoming, for righteousness is weightier than life. Thus, the greatest good in the world is compared to the body, and the body is deemed small; the body is compared to benevolence and righteousness, and it is deemed light. This is the standard of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTo continue: The principle of yielding and extending is this: the noble person endures a small yielding to achieve great uprightness, like the hibernation and resurgence of dragons and serpents. Good words and good deeds nourish all living things, all arising from humbling oneself and cultivating virtue. The sage takes benevolence and righteousness as the standard, knowing that the body is weightier than the world and righteousness weightier than the body. Thus, they can face death for their lord or parents. This is why the noble person’s name does not fade even after death.\n\nLaozi said: The completeness of the Dao and virtue is like the sun and moon. Even among the Yi, Di, Man, and Mo peoples, none can alter its essence. Whether praised or blamed in custom, whether one’s conduct is uniform or not, whether one is in poverty or success depends on the times. When one’s affairs align with the world, merit is accomplished; when one’s tasks accord with the times, one’s name is established. Thus, those who establish merit and fame are discerning about the world and cautious about the times. When the moment arrives, not even a breath can be spared.\n\nThe ancients who waged war did not covet land or treasure but sought to preserve life, pacify disorder, and eliminate harm for the people. Those who are greedy, rapacious, and full of desire bring calamity to the world, stirring the myriad people into turmoil, leaving none at peace. The sage rises resolutely to punish the strong and violent, pacify a disordered age, and eliminate harm for the world—turning turbidity into clarity, peril into peace. Thus, they cannot but act decisively.\n\nTo continue: Human morality is like the sun and moon of Heaven; the five human natures are like the five stars of Heaven. Even among the Yi, Di, Man, and Mo, none can alter them. Whether one advances or retreats lies with oneself; whether one is praised or blamed lies with others. Whether one is employed or not depends on the times; whether one’s conduct succeeds or fails rests with fate. Thus, the noble person, when the time comes to practice the Dao, does not spare even a breath.\n\nThe Red Emperor brought fire disaster, so the Yellow Emperor captured him. Gonggong brought water harm, so Zhuanxu executed him. They instructed through the Dao and guided through virtue, but if they did not listen, they confronted them with martial might. If they still did not submit, they subdued them with arms. To kill innocent people and sustain an unrighteous lord—what harm could be greater? To exhaust the world’s wealth to satisfy one person’s desires—what calamity could be deeper? To indulge one person’s desires and prolong suffering throughout the world—this is something Heaven’s principles do not permit.\n\nThe purpose of establishing a ruler is to suppress violence and disorder.",

      "translated_text": "Now, riding upon the strength of the myriad people, they instead become cruel oppressors—this is like giving wings to a tiger; why should they not be removed? Those who keep fish must remove otters and eels; those who raise birds and beasts must eliminate jackals and wolves. How much more so for those who shepherd the people? Thus, the rise of arms and armor has its reasons.\n\nThe succession of virtue and the cycles of the Five Phases in the state have endured since antiquity. In the Fire Phase of the Red Emperor, when the ruler lost his virtue, fire became a disaster. In the Water Phase of Gonggong, when the ruler lost his virtue, water became a disaster. From this, we know that when a ruler loses virtue, disasters arise in accordance with the phase. How can any lord of the land lose virtue, invite calamity, and remain unaware or unrepentant?\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of governing a state is this—above, there are no harsh decrees; officials are not overburdened with governance; scholars do not act with deceit; artisans do not craft excessive finery. Affairs are managed without disturbance, tools are kept whole without ornamentation. In a disordered age, it is otherwise: those who act vie to outdo one another in loftiness; those who observe ritual compete in ostentation. Chariots and carriages are carved to excess; vessels and utensils are engraved beyond measure. Those who seek wealth contend over what is rare, prizing it as treasure; those who indulge in rhetoric chase after complexity, deeming it urgency. Scholars engage in deceptive argument, prolonging disputes without resolution, bringing no benefit to order but only to chaos. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete them, yet they serve no practical use.\n\nThus, the laws of Shennong state: If able-bodied men do not farm, the world will suffer hunger; if women in their prime do not weave, the world will suffer cold. Therefore, he himself tilled the fields, and his wife herself wove, setting the example for all under heaven. They did not value rare goods or esteem useless objects. Thus, if farmers did not exert themselves, they could not sustain life; if weavers did not labor, they could not clothe the body. Surplus and deficiency each returned to the self. With clothing and food abundant, deceit and wickedness did not arise; with peace and ease prevailing, the world was harmonious. The wise had no need to deploy their defenses; the brave had no occasion to display their might.\n\nThe succession of virtue shows that the Dao of governance differs between ancient and modern times because customs have changed. The ancients were simple and honest: above, there were no harsh decrees; officials were not overburdened; scholars did not act with deceit; artisans did not craft excessive finery. Thus, the people’s hearts were easily satisfied, and governance was not difficult. In later ages, customs shifted, winds changed, and the example set above was followed below. Extravagance was esteemed, and greed knew no bounds. Thus, the people’s hearts were hard to satisfy, and governance became arduous.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of hegemons and kings relies on planning and foresight, acting with righteousness—not to secure survival, but to preserve or end it. Thus, when they heard that the ruler of an enemy state was cruel and oppressive to his people, they would raise an army and advance to its borders, reproaching him for his unrighteousness and rebuking him for his misdeeds. When the army reached the outskirts, the commanders would issue orders: \"Do not fell trees, do not dig up graves, do not ruin the five grains, do not burn stored grain, do not seize the people, do not gather livestock.\" Then they would proclaim: \"The ruler of this state defies Heaven and Earth, insults the spirits, metes out unjust judgments, and slaughters the innocent. He is one whom Heaven condemns and the people revile. Our army has come to depose the unrighteous and enthrone the virtuous. Whoever dares defy the Dao of Heaven and disturb the people’s peace shall be put to death, and their clan exterminated. Those who yield by household shall be rewarded by household; those who yield by village shall be rewarded by village; those who yield by township shall be enfeoffed by township; those who yield by county shall be enfeoffed by county. If we conquer the state, we shall not harm its people. We shall depose its ruler, reform its governance, honor its outstanding scholars, exalt its worthy and good, relieve its orphans and widows, succor its poor, release its prisoners, and reward its meritorious. We shall open our granaries to feed them and store grain to sustain them. Our only fear is that they will not come to us.\"\n\nWhen a righteous army reaches the border, the enemy does not fight but surrenders. When an unrighteous army arrives, corpses lie strewn, blood flows, and battle is joined. Thus, those who fight for land cannot establish kingship; those who seek personal gain cannot achieve great deeds. Those who act for the sake of others receive widespread support; those who act for themselves are widely abandoned. What is supported by the many, though weak, must become strong; what is abandoned by the many, though great, must perish.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* comprises twelve chapters, arranged in three sections of four, wherein the rise and fall of former emperors, kings, and hegemons are recorded. In the age of hegemons, when one observes their words—not for securing survival but for restoring what is lost—the spirit of reviving what has declined and continuing what has been severed is vividly apparent. Compared to the unrighteous deeds of later ages, they are far removed.\n\nLaozi said: The highest righteousness is this—governing the state, ordering the realm within, practicing benevolence and righteousness, spreading virtue and bestowing kindness, establishing just laws, and blocking the path of evil. Ministers draw near, the people are harmonious, above and below are of one heart, and all officials unite in strength. The feudal lords submit to his might, and the four directions cherish his virtue. In the ancestral temple, he deliberates policies that repel enemies a thousand *li* away. When he issues commands, the world responds—this is the highest.\n\nWhen the land is vast, the people numerous, the ruler worthy, and the generals capable; when the state is rich and the army strong; when discipline is firm and orders clear—even if two evenly matched enemies face each other, before blades clash or arrows fly, the enemy flees. This is the next best.\n\nWhen one knows the suitability of the land, is familiar with the advantages of strategic passes, understands the shifts in harsh governance, and discerns the dynamics of battle formations; when blades cross and arrows rain down, the wounded are carried and the dead lie strewn for a thousand *li*, corpses littering the fields—this is the lowest form of righteousness.\n\nThe victory or defeat of an army lies in governance. When governance prevails and the people submit to their superiors, the army is strong and the people victorious. When governance fails and the people rebel against their superiors, the army is weak. Benevolence and righteousness suffice to win the hearts of the world’s people; deeds suffice to meet the world’s crises; selection and appointment suffice to win the hearts of worthy scholars; planning and foresight suffice to decide matters of weight and urgency—this is the Dao of the highest righteousness.\n\nThe *Zuan Yi* on military strategy states: The first to act is the host; the one who responds is the guest. There is a saying in warfare: \"I dare not act as host but only as guest,\" meaning that armies should not be lightly raised. When there is no choice but to use them, acting with righteousness is best; pursuing a fleeing enemy is next; fighting is the lowest.\n\nLaozi said: A state becomes strong through the willingness of its people to die; the willingness to die arises from righteousness; righteousness is carried out through might. Thus, one commands with civility and unifies with martiality—this is called certain victory. Might and righteousness advance together—this is called certain strength. When blades clash and arrows fall like rain, yet the soldiers vie to be first, it is because rewards are certain and punishments clear. If the ruler regards his people as children, the people will serve him as a father, and he will rule the Four Seas. If the people regard their ruler as a father, they will rectify the world. If the ruler regards his people as younger brothers, they will be willing to die for him. If the people serve their ruler as an elder brother, they will be willing to perish for him. Thus, one cannot fight against enemies bound as father and son or brothers. Therefore, a righteous ruler internally cultivates governance to accumulate virtue, externally blocks evil to make his power clear, and examines the toil and ease of his people to know their hunger and satiety. When the day of battle arrives, they view death as a return home, for the ruler’s benevolence has reached them.",

      "translated_text": "To govern the world through accumulated virtue follows the Dao—why resort to arms? Only when unavoidable. The armies of a strong state fight to the death because righteousness compels them. Yet how can a ruler who embodies the Dao bear to drive his people to death by relying on a strong state? When the ruler regards his people as children and the people serve him as a father, the virtuous ruler cultivates governance to amass virtue, and the state will naturally grow strong—a principle inherent in the world since antiquity.\n\n*Wenzi: Accumulated Virtue*, Scroll Eleven\n*Wenzi: Accumulated Virtue*, Scroll Twelve\nImperially Commissioned *Siku Quanshu*\n*On Ritual*, compiled by Du Daojian of the Song\n\nLaozi said: In high antiquity, the True Person breathed in harmony with yin and yang, and all living beings looked up to their virtue, aligning themselves with its harmony. In that era, governance operated in hidden subtlety, naturally forming a state of pure simplicity. Before this purity dispersed, the myriad things flourished in abundance. As the age declined, by the time of Fuxi, people dimly stirred, each seeking to abandon their childlike hearts and awaken to the realm between Heaven and Earth. Their virtue grew disordered and inconsistent. By the eras of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, they began to systematically order the world, establishing the norms of the four seasons and harmonizing yin and yang. Thus, the people stood in reverence, eager to support and obey, seeing and listening with devotion. Though governance was achieved, harmony was lost.\n\nBy the Xia and Yin dynasties, desires extended to external things, and intelligence was lured outward, causing the loss of the true nature of life. This spread to the Zhou dynasty, where simplicity dissolved, and purity scattered. The Dao was abandoned in favor of artifice; perilous virtue became conduct. Cunning and craft emerged, and those who mimicked the sages with clever learning sought to deceive the masses. They carved and adorned the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* to trade for fame and reputation, each desiring to enact their schemes, feigning compliance with the world while losing the fundamental root of the great origin. Thus, the world erected barriers against nature, and the decline of life’s essence has long been its gradual course.\n\nTherefore, the learning of the Perfect Person seeks to return the nature to nothingness and roam the mind in emptiness. The learning of the vulgar world plucks at virtue and seizes at nature, inwardly distressing the five viscera, recklessly acting, and exceeding wisdom to clamor for fame in the world—this is what the Perfect Person does not do. Plucking at virtue is self-display; seizing at nature is severing life. As for the Perfect Person, they settle the meaning of life and death and penetrate its continuity.",

      "translated_text": "The principle of honor and disgrace is such that even if the whole world praises it, it does not increase encouragement; even if the whole world condemns it, it does not add to discouragement—this is grasping the essence of the supreme Dao.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, rulers wore their hair loose and without collars to govern the world. Their virtue gave life without killing, bestowed without seizing. The world did not conform in attire yet shared in their virtue. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious, the myriad things flourished, and the nests of flying birds could be reached and explored by bending down. Wild beasts could be leashed and followed. But as virtue declined, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all became harms to the people. Thus, iron was cast into blades to defend against these calamities. When people were pressed by hardship, they sought convenience; when afflicted by disaster, they prepared defenses. Each used their wisdom to avoid harm and pursue benefit, yet constant customs could not be followed, and implements could not be relied upon. Thus, the laws and institutions of former kings underwent changes.\n\nTherefore, it is said: \"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\" The Five Emperors followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; the Three Kings pursued distinct affairs yet their names endured for later generations—this is adapting to the times and changing accordingly. It is like the tuning of the five notes by the master musician Shi Kuang: though the shifts move up and down without constancy, with the measure of a ruler, none fail to strike true. Thus, one who understands the essence of music can create sound; one who has a fundamental principle within and knows the use of squares, curves, and plumb lines can govern people. Therefore, the institutions of former kings should not be immediately abolished, nor should the affairs of the latter age be blindly adopted. Thus, the sage who establishes rites and music does not let rites and music constrain them; the one who regulates things is not bound by things; the one who establishes laws is not confined by laws. Therefore, it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage kings of old took symbols from heaven above, measures from the earth below, and models from humanity between. They harmonized the qi of yin and yang, attuned the seasons of the four times, and examined the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—high and low—to establish affairs, generate wealth, eliminate the suffering of hunger and cold, and ward off the disasters of illness and plague. They received human affairs at their center to establish rites and music, practiced the Dao of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relations, and arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish the intimacy of father and son and form the family. They listened to the clear and turbid of the five notes and the mutual generation of the six pitch-standards to establish the righteousness of ruler and minister and form the state. They observed the sequence of the four seasons—first, middle, and last—to establish the hierarchy of elders and juniors and form offices. They divided the land into provinces and governed states, establishing universities to teach. These are the guiding principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Dao is attained, all things flourish; when the Dao is lost, all things decline. No thing has ever expanded without relaxing, flourished without decaying. Only the sage can flourish without decay. When the sage first created music, it was to return the spirit, restrain excess, and revert to the heavenly heart. But as it declined, it flowed without return, indulged in lust and favored beauty, disregarding proper laws, flowing into later generations until the ruin of states. When they first created writing, it was to order and manage the hundred affairs. The foolish used it to avoid forgetting; the wise used it to record events. But as it declined, it became a tool for deceit and fraud, exonerating the guilty and killing the innocent. When they first created parks, it was to prepare offerings for ancestral temples, train soldiers, and guard against the unforeseen. But as it declined, they galloped and hunted, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength. When they first honored worthies, it was to level education, rectify lawsuits, place the worthy in office, and employ the capable. Grace flowed downward, and the myriad people cherished virtue. But as it declined, cliques formed, each promoting their own, abandoning the public for private gain, recommending one another inside and out. The wicked held office while the worthy withdrew. The Dao of heaven and earth reaches its extreme and then returns; it gains and then loses. Thus, the sage governs decay by reforming institutions, ends affairs and begins anew.\n\nThe excellence of the sage’s Dao lies in harmony; its flaw lies in power. The sage’s Dao says: Without cultivating rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame, the people cannot be established. Without integrity and shame, they cannot be governed. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot rectify. Without exalting the good and abolishing the ugly, there is no turning toward rites and righteousness. Without laws, there can be no governance. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented. Laws can kill the unfilial but cannot make people filial; they can punish thieves but cannot make people honest. When the sage king is above, he clarifies likes and dislikes to show the people, uses praise and blame to guide them, draws near the worthy and advances them, despises the unworthy and retires them. Punishments are set aside and unused; rites and righteousness are cultivated, and the virtuous are employed. Thus, the highest in the world become the Three Dukes; the highest in a province become the Nine Ministers; the highest in a state become the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters; the highest in a village become the Eighty-One Elders. Those whose wisdom surpasses ten thousand are called heroes; a thousand, called talents; a hundred, called杰; ten, called豪. Those who understand the Dao of heaven and earth, comprehend the principles of human affairs, are vast enough to embrace the multitude, benevolent enough to cherish the distant, wise enough to know power—these are heroes. Those whose virtue suffices to transform, whose conduct suffices to set the standard, whose trust suffices to gain the people, whose clarity suffices to illuminate below—these are talents. Those whose conduct can serve as a model, whose wisdom suffices to resolve doubts, whose trust can keep promises, whose integrity can distribute wealth, whose actions can be emulated, whose words can be followed—these are杰. Those who hold office without neglect, abide in righteousness without cliques, face danger without fleeing, see profit without seizing—these are豪. Heroes, talents,杰, and豪 each occupy their positions according to the magnitude of their abilities, flowing from root to branch, using the heavy to control the light. Above they initiate, below they harmonize; within the four seas, all share one heart, turning from greed and baseness toward benevolence and righteousness. In transforming the people, it is like the wind bending grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy oversee the worthy, even with severe punishments, they cannot suppress their treachery. The small cannot control the great; the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of heaven and earth. Thus, the sage promotes the worthy to establish merit. The unworthy ruler promotes those he favors. Observe whom they promote, and the distinction between order and chaos is clear. Examine their cliques, and the worthy and unworthy can be assessed.\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice rites carve and polish human nature, distorting its true feelings. Though the eyes desire, they are restrained by measures; though the heart delights, they are moderated by rites. They strut and circle, bow and bend, their flesh congealing without eating, their wine settling without drinking. Outwardly, they bind their forms; inwardly, they distress their virtue, restraining the harmony of yin and yang and constraining the true feelings of life. Thus, they spend their lives in sorrow. Why? They do not address the root of desire yet prohibit what is desired; they do not trace the origin of joy yet block what brings joy. This is like penning beasts without sealing their enclosures, forbidding their wild hearts, or damming the flow of rivers with one’s hands. Therefore, it is said: \"Open its aperture, assist its affairs, and it will never be saved in a lifetime.\"\n\nRites suppress emotions and close desires, using righteousness to guard the self. Though the heart is choked and the form starved, they force themselves with what cannot be helped. Thus, none can complete their natural years. Rites cannot make people cease desiring.",
      "overlap_context": "rning of the Perfect Person seeks to return the nature to nothingness and roam the mind in emptiness. The learning of the vulgar world plucks at virtue and seizes at nature, inwardly distressing the five viscera, recklessly acting, and exceeding wisdom to clamor for fame in the world—this is what the Perfect Person does not do. Plucking at virtue is self-display; seizing at nature is severing life. As for the Perfect Person, they settle the meaning of life and death and penetrate its continuity.",

      "translated_text": "Yet those who would halt joy cannot make people cease rejoicing, only restrain it. To make the world fear punishment and refrain from theft—how is this better than eradicating the very thought of theft? Thus, when one knows a thing has no use, even the greedy will abandon it; when one does not know its use, even the incorruptible cannot relinquish it. The downfall of states, the death of rulers at the hands of others, the scorn of the world—were these not all born of desire? Like winter fans and summer furs, useless to oneself, all things crumble to dust when their time has passed. Thus, to scoop boiling water to stop its bubbling only makes it boil more fiercely. Those who know the root remove the fire and nothing more.\n\nLaozi said: To follow one’s nature and act is called the Dao; to attain one’s natural disposition is called virtue. When nature is lost, then benevolence and righteousness are prized. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. Unadorned simplicity scatters, and rites and music become embellishments. Right and wrong take shape, the people vie for pearls and jade, and the world falls into strife.\n\nRites serve to distinguish high and low, noble and base; righteousness serves to harmonize the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—the boundaries of human conduct. In later ages, rites become mere formal respect, and righteousness is reduced to calculated exchange. Gifts are given to win favor, and ministers become estranged from rulers; bonds of kinship breed resentment.\n\nThus, when water stagnates, it breeds creatures that devour one another; when earth piles up, it spawns beasts that consume themselves. When rites and music become mere adornments, deceit and falsehood arise. The governance of later ages does not accumulate the means of nurturing life. It thins the world’s purity, scatters its simplicity, and confounds the people, turning clarity into turbidity. Nature and destiny take flight in chaos, all striving for integrity and trust, yet these dissolve in decay. People lose their true nature, laws and righteousness oppose each other, actions and profit stand in contradiction. The rich and poor vie with one another, and the distinction between ruler and slave becomes negligible. When there is surplus, people yield; when there is scarcity, they contend. Yielding gives rise to rites and righteousness; contention breeds violence and disorder. Thus, excessive desire leads to unmanageable affairs; insatiable seeking ensures endless strife.\n\nTherefore, in times of order, petty men uphold integrity, and profit cannot seduce them. In times of chaos, even gentlemen turn to treachery, and laws cannot restrain them.\n\nLaozi said: The rulers of declining ages bore into mountains and stones to extract gold and jade, smelt mother-of-pearl and bronze, yet the myriad things do not flourish. They rip open wombs, burn the suburbs, overturn nests, and shatter eggs. The phoenix does not soar, the qilin does not roam. They build towers of timber, burn forests for hunting, drain marshes for fishing, pile earth into mounds, dig wells to drink, dredge rivers to make pools, and fortify walls for defense. They pen beasts as livestock, and thus yin and yang fall into discord, the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter, hail and frost wreak havoc, and half the myriad things wither and perish. Grass and trees wither in summer, the Three Rivers run dry. They divide mountains, rivers, and valleys into boundaries, count the multitudes to assign ranks, set up traps and barriers for defense, and establish distinctions in clothing and colors to mark noble and base, worthy and unworthy. They mete out rewards and punishments, and thus arms rise and strife is born. The innocent are slaughtered, the guiltless are punished—such calamities arise.\n\nLaozi said: When the world is about to suppress nature and destiny, it is like the rising of dark qi. The ruler is benighted and unclear, the Dao is abandoned and unenacted, virtue is extinguished and unmanifest. Affairs run counter to heaven, proclamations defy the four seasons. Spring and autumn contract their harmony, heaven and earth strip away their virtue. The ruler sits uneasily upon his throne, ministers retreat and fall silent, officials anticipate their lord’s will and disrupt constancy. Kin grow distant, and the self-serving find refuge. Flatterers scheme in secret, swiftly carrying the arrogant ruler toward chaos, shaping events to their advantage. Thus, ruler and minister grow estranged, kin drift apart, fields lie barren, roads are empty of travelers. Gold piles up but loses its edge, jade is hoarded until it cracks. Tortoise shells are hollow, yarrow stalks wither. The world fails to unite as one; feudal lords enact their own laws, customs clash, and defenses are built. They neglect the root and discard the foundation, carve punishments into harshness, and vie over the smallest gains. They slaughter the people, consuming more than half. They raise armies to wage war, besiege cities, and slaughter wantonly. They scale high walls, secure strongholds, and deploy troops to die on the roads, charging into fierce battles. For every hundred who march out, one returns. Reputations are falsely aggrandized, states and lands are seized. Corpses number in the hundreds of thousands, the old and weak starve and freeze to death—uncountable. From this time onward, the world never again finds peace in its nature or joy in its customs.\n\nThen the worthy and sagely rise in sudden emergence, upholding the Dao and virtue, aided by benevolence and righteousness. Those near advance in wisdom, those far are embraced in virtue. The world unites as one, and generations of descendants serve as ministers. They cast out the roots of slander and flattery, silence the clamor of disputes, abolish harsh laws, and remove vexatious affairs. They banish the traces of slander, block the gates of faction, and dissolve cunning and skill. They follow the great constancy, dismantle the branches, cast aside cleverness, and embrace simplicity. The great Dao flows unimpeded, and the myriad things each return to their root.\n\nThe sage does not create the times; when the time comes, he does not miss it. Thus, he does not meet with ruin.\n\nLaozi said: The depths of the Feng River measure ten *ren*, yet it does not hold dust or filth. Gold and stone lie within, their forms visible without—not for lack of depth or clarity. Yet fish, turtles, and dragons do not gather there. On barren rocks, the five grains do not grow; on bald mountains, deer and elk do not roam, for there is no shelter. Thus, in governance, to take severity as discernment, sharpness as clarity, harshness as loyalty, and calculation as merit—this is like stretching leather to its limit, a path that leads to great defeat and rupture. Such governance is murky, yet the people remain pure; it is meticulous, yet the people are flawed.\n\nLaozi said: Govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with the unexpected. First establish an invincible governance, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack another’s chaos with one’s own disorder is like meeting fire with fire, water with water—neither can overcome the other. Thus, the unexpected lies in difference: stillness overcomes restlessness, order overcomes chaos, satiety overcomes hunger, ease overcomes toil. The interplay of the unexpected and the upright is like the mutual conquest of water, fire, metal, and wood—how can it not prevail? Thus, when virtue is equal, the many overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise overcome the foolish; when wisdom is equal, those with strategy overcome those without.
