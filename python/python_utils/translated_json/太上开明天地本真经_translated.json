radiance and greatness make one a sage.\n\nDaoism embodies the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of one water and one fire—\nThe sun’s spirit and the moon’s essence, inner yin and outer yang, returning to life and reverting to the source.\nIt seizes the transformative power of Heaven and Earth, practicing the work of fire and timing.\nIt nurtures and completes the elixir, ascending together to immortality.\nThose who do not lose their place endure; those who die yet do not perish are long-lived.\nWith the original truth firm and secure, one attains the Dao and longevity.\n\nBuddhism embodies the great workings of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of one provisional and one real—\nAdapting to circumstances in engaging the world, perceiving form and illuminating emptiness.\nIt presses into the Middle Way between existence and nonexistence, refining practice to realize wondrous form.\nIt completes emptiness and together enters non-arising.\nThrough forbearance and transcendence, merit is accomplished.\nWith the great samādhi of *nāga*, it returns to the root and reverts to the source; with the true suchness of reality, the numinous eye shines forth.\nIt penetrates Heaven and Earth, realizing sagehood and becoming true.\n\nThus, each of the Three Teachings exalts its own honor, yet the root of the Dao is one.\nLife comes from the original truth; death departs through the original truth.\nAttaining truth is not a matter of male or female; illuminating the Dao has no coming or going.\nConfucianism cultivates the root, not falling into excess, harmonizing with the virtue of Heaven and Earth.\nDaoism guards the root, nurturing as its work, containing the transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nBuddhism returns to the root, clearly realizing the true return, transcending beyond Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet now the Three Teachings, though mingled in the One Truth, speak of cultivating the root while indulging in wayward thoughts and excess, lacking the careful measure of restraint;\nThey boast of guarding the root while straying into side doors and losing nurturance, devoid of the true mystery of fire and timing;\nThey speak of returning to the root while deluded by false thoughts and swept away by currents, lacking the wondrous method of refined practice.\n\nNow, we of the Three Teachings, in their interpenetration, point directly in many ways, compassionately pitying life and death, and revealing the truth of Heaven and Earth.\nThe nature of Heaven is the Heaven beyond Heaven;\nThe heart of Earth is the Earth that does not move.\nIt operates the great Dao of Heaven and Earth and conveys the great root of Heaven and Earth.\nIt announces to Heaven and prays for longevity, protecting the state and pacifying the people.\nAll return to the original body, universally delivering the karmically bound and the kin.\nThe deceased attain transformation; the living achieve numinous understanding.\nNo demons can harm them; no illnesses can invade.\n\nYet without circulating the true scripture of the hidden eye, one cannot obtain the true root;\nWithout reverting to the original source of the root, one cannot cultivate and nurture;\nWithout nurturing life and preserving destiny, one cannot attain numinous clarity;\nWithout stillness and illumination embracing emptiness, one cannot see the nature;\nWithout awakening to the nature’s perfect constancy, one cannot penetrate thoroughly;\nWithout penetrating the mysterious and awakening fully, one cannot return to truth.\nVainly seeking to become buddhas or immortals, one cannot transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.\n\nAbove all, one must worry over the great matter of life and death, without distinction of self and others or division among the Three Teachings.\nSeek the perfected person, point to the scriptural methods, illuminate this root, and return to the One Truth.\nIn daily practice, what does one cultivate?\nFrom the original source, what does one attain?\nIn true nature, what does one perceive?\nOn the path ahead, to what does one return?\n\nIf one thus understands and penetrates clearly, one will realize neither immortality nor buddhahood.\nOne will fully transcend the realm of sages and instantly penetrate past and present.\n\nI exhort the followers of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, the faithful and the virtuous:\nIf you uphold and circulate this scripture, you will swiftly attain penetration and benefit;\nIf you refine practice and awaken to understanding, you will immediately realize non-arising.\nIt surpasses the external paths and all scriptures, excelling the turning of a single canon of the Tathāgata.\nDo not vainly recite it ten thousand times; gather it into the radiant One Truth.\nThe meaning of the scripture, the method of the scripture, the secret of the scripture—\nNeither inner nor outer, neither mind nor beyond.\nUnderstanding the true scripture is not this scripture; obtaining the true root is not this root.\n\nYou should know that the true scripture of the Great Dao depends on oral transmission and heart-to-heart seal,\nFollowing the method of secret transmission, and joyfully practicing it.\n\nThe Supreme Scripture on the Dao of Sealing the Luminous and Returning to the Root of Heaven and Earth is hereby complete.",
