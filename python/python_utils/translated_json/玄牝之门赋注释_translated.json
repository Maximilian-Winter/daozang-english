  "full_translation": "The *Commentary on \"Rhapsody on the Mysterious Female\"* by Quán Yángzǐ\nAnnotated by Yìquán of Zuǒ Dàoyī of Chūnshēn River, Jiāngsū\n\n**Rhapsody:**\nThe One Aperture is the Mysterious Female,\nThe root-source of the Great Elixir.\nThis is the valley of emptiness and nothingness,\nMutually serving as the gate of ingress and egress.\n\n**[Annotation]**\nYìquán’s note:\nThe \"One Aperture, Mysterious Female\" speaks of this aperture residing within the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female unites with this single aperture, opening and closing in unison—only then may it be called a \"gate.\" Yet the gate merges indistinguishably with the aperture; if they do not open and close in concert, it is neither gate nor aperture.\n\nThe \"Mysterious Female\" refers to the two entities of yin and yang. \"Mysterious\" is yang, within which the essence of yin is generated. \"Female\" is yin, within which the qi of yang is produced. If the Mysterious Female lacked a gate, by what means would essence and qi enter and exit?\n\nThus, the Mysterious has its own gate, and the Female has its own portal. Only when they open and close in unison is the transformative power of creation fulfilled. If each opens and closes independently, it cannot be called a gate. Hence it is said: *mutually serving as the gate of ingress and egress.*\n\nThe meaning of \"mutually\" merits contemplation. The phrase \"opening and closing in unison\" corresponds to what the *Cantong Qi* describes:\n*\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering, abiding within the compass—\nRevolving and circling to perceive and listen.\"*\n\nOpening and closing both embody the meaning of unity. If this gate achieves perfect synchrony in its opening and closing, then the refinement of the elixir may be hoped for. Once the root and origin are attained, it is said: *The Great Elixir finds its root here.*\n\nThe term \"Great Elixir\" consists of two characters: \"great\" (大) and \"elixir\" (丹), which together imply that if a person attains the One, they may achieve greatness. The character for \"elixir\" (丹) is composed of a \"sun\" radical (日) at the top, a \"moon\" radical (月) at the bottom, and a horizontal stroke in between—signifying the union of sun and moon. The dot within represents the fusion of essence and qi, symbolizing a single grain of golden elixir.\n\nAs for the \"valley of emptiness and nothingness,\" this gate resides within the void, akin to the form of the character \"valley\" (谷). The meaning of \"emptiness and nothingness\" has been repeatedly expounded earlier and will not be reiterated here. The character \"valley\" (谷) depicts two persons with mouths joined, and this mouth lies beneath them—scholars should grasp this significance. The valley is hollow and empty, yet responsive in its emptiness. This responsiveness is spirit. Laozi called it the \"Valley Spirit.\" Ancestor Ziyang said: *\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\"* He also said: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world.\"* Without the guidance of an enlightened teacher, scholars will find this gate elusive—hence it is said to be \"rarely known.\" In truth, it is like an echo in a valley: it responds when called but cannot be grasped when sought.\n\nThe arrangement of the cauldron and vessel follows a clear hierarchy, standing in stark opposition. The mechanism of their opening and closing is wondrous yet indescribable.\n\n[Commentary: The hierarchy refers to the metaphor of male and female. The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Heaven is noble, earth is base—thus Qian and Kun are established.\"* Opposition signifies yin and yang standing face to face. Opening and closing are the ebb and flow of the gate, while the cauldron and furnace are the instruments of yin and yang. Their details are elaborated in the middle volume. \"Opening and closing\" here mean the same as before. Their subtlety defies description.]\n\nThe foundation of immortals' cultivation and refinement lies in the constant circulation of primordial qi throughout the upper and lower body.\n\n[Commentary: Those who seek immortality must take refining the self and laying the foundation as their root. Moreover, the primordial qi within a person should, day by day and hour by hour, circulate through the upper and lower body along fixed pathways.]\n\nThe lead furnace and mercury cauldron are established upon this principle.\n\n[Commentary: Lead and mercury represent essence and qi. The simultaneous establishment of furnace and cauldron marks the initial step in the alchemical process.]\n\nThe Jade Gate and Golden Pass are known to few.\n\n[Commentary: The Mysterious Gate and Female Portal are recognized by few, much as ordinary people gaze upon the Jade Gate and Golden Pass without knowing their location.]\n\nVast is the Mysterious Female—it cannot be named. It connects yin and yang, and thus is called the Gate.\n\n[Commentary: The Mysterious Female connects yin and yang. Vast is this Gate—none can name it. For it links yin and yang, serving as the creative transformation of all things. Both mortals and immortals are formed through it.]\n\nThis is called the cauldron and furnace, wherein lead and mercury are concealed.\n\n[Commentary: The cauldron, furnace, lead, and mercury have been discussed throughout this collection.]\n\nTo the east, it adjoins the land of Fusang.\n\n[Commentary: East represents green, wood, and the dragon. \"Adjoins\" means to join or connect. Fusang is where the sun rises.]\n\nTo the west, it reaches the peak of Mount Taihua.\n\n[Commentary: West represents white, metal, and the tiger. \"Reaches\" signifies coming and going. The peak of Mount Taihua is where the moon ascends.]\n\nGrasping the subtlety of the two earths, one must unite them.\n\n[Commentary: The two earths are wu earth and ji earth. Wu earth is received by Kan, and ji earth by Li. \"Uniting the two earths\" means Kan and Li interact, merging the two earths into one.]\n\nIt lies between the two crescents, evenly dividing them.\n\n[Commentary: This refers to the two halves of the Gate, its left and right leaves, akin to the moon’s waxing and waning crescents. The waxing and waning crescents are like the moon on the eighth and twenty-third nights. When united, they form the Gate, as the sun and moon achieve fullness.]\n\nIf they open and close in unison, one may understand the function of the crescents. The crescents resemble the shape of a bow. The two crescents signify two bowstrings facing each other, like the fullness of the sun and moon, metaphorically representing the two leaves of the Gate closing together. \"Evenly dividing\" means the Gate’s opening and closing occur neither too soon nor too late.\n\nAncestor Ziyang said:\n*\"After the waxing crescent and before the waning crescent,\nThe medicinal flavor is balanced, the qi complete.\nGather it and return to the furnace to refine,\nRefined through warmth and nurtured, it naturally simmers.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the Gate’s opening and closing in perfect harmony, enabling the attainment of the medicine. If there is the slightest discrepancy, the Gate will not be level, the qi incomplete, and the medicine elusive.\n\nVast, it encompasses all without boundary; small, it contains nothing within.\n\nBelow is called the *yin*; above is called the *mysterious*.\n[The terms] \"vast without boundary\" and \"small without interior\" refer to the qi of the medicine. Yet the medicine is spoken of as vast or small, external or internal—its details are discussed in the middle collection. The cinnabar tripod. The recumbent-moon furnace. A single mechanism operates in secrecy: the Gate of Returning to Life, the Cavity of Returning to the Root, with all wonders fully present.\n\n[Cinnabar is the mercury within *li*; the recumbent moon is the lead within *kan*. The gates and cavities are the wondrous apertures of the Mysterious Pass. Ancestor Ziyang said:\n*\"Within the recumbent-moon furnace, jade buds arise;\nIn the cinnabar tripod, mercury lies level.\nOnly when fire and force are harmonized after,\nDoes the yellow sprout take root and gradually grow.\"*\nOnly when all wonders are fully present may the single mechanism operate in perfect secrecy.\n\nThis Gate opens with yang and closes with yin, its opening and closing endless. The sun departs, the moon arrives—this coming and going never ceases. Above is called the Celestial Pass, which receives *qian* and *jia*; below is called the Earthly Portal, which conceals *kun* and *gui*. Boundless and without side, it is not a physical form. With each closing and opening, it is called the Gate. High and low unite in harmony—how great! How complete! Its circuits of coming and going, issuing from this and entering into this.\n\n[The Celestial Pass with *qian* and *jia* is the *mysterious*; the Earthly Portal with *kun* and *gui* is the *yin*. \"Boundless and without side, not a physical form\" refers to this Gate. \"High and low unite in harmony\" describes the union of *kan* and *li*—the Gate’s natural pairing. \"Issuing from this, entering into this.\"]\n\nImmortal, Buddha, and common folk—all issue forth and enter through this very Gate. Let us speak of this aperture, which all people share, yet what is not a gate is called a gate, a truth rarely known to the world.\n\n[All people share this because only when male and female unite does this Gate exist—it cannot belong to one alone. What is not a gate is called a gate because it has no form or trace, not a true gate in itself. Only when yin and yang unite imperceptibly does its image appear. Thus, it is said that no single person can create this Gate, which is why it remains unknown to most. Yet people know only of opening and issuing forth, not of closing and returning. How much less do they understand its simultaneous opening and closing?]\n\nFor heaven and earth constantly unite in the ceaseless coming and going, while spirit and *qi* ever merge in unbroken continuity.\n\n[When it speaks of heaven and earth constantly uniting, it refers to the *Yijing*’s \"male and female commingle their essence.\" The \"ceaseless coming and going\" describes the moment of human union, when people remain unaware of the subtle interplay of lesser departure and greater arrival, of opening and closing. \"Spirit and *qi* merge in unbroken continuity\" refers to the moment when the Gate is about to open or close—when the whole body feels harmonious and at ease, yet one does not perceive the how or why of its opening and closing.]\n\nNow this aperture breaks through the primordial chaos, laying the foundation of True Unity.\n\n[Breaking through the aperture of primordial chaos means the Gate of the Mysterious Female is opened. Laying the foundation of True Unity means that if one can, in due time, gather the prenatal True Unity *qi* within *kan*, then the foundation may be established, and the fruit of earthly immortality attained. The character for \"foundation\" (*ji*) is composed of earth (*tu*), which here refers to the *wu* earth received within *kan*—the root of this foundation lies in *kan*.]\n\nViewed through the twelve branches, the lower Female dwells in *zi*; seen through the eight trigrams, the upper Mysterious belongs to *li*. Here the Gate is distinct, while the aperture remains undivided and one.\n\n[The lower Female in *zi* is yin, *kan*, water, containing the true yang *qi*. The upper Mysterious in *li* is yang, *wu*, fire, containing the true yin essence. \"Here the Gate is distinct\" refers to the division between north and south, left and right, above and below. \"The aperture remains undivided and one\" means that only when opening and closing are united as one can it truly be called an aperture or a Gate. \"Issuing forth together\" refers to the one yin and one yang, both transformed from the primordial Unity *qi*—separate they are two, united they are one. Thus, the Dao’s Ancestor said, \"Issuing forth together yet bearing different names.\" The Purple Yang Ancestor said, \"Different names issuing forth together—few understand. Both are profoundly profound, the essential mechanism.\"]\n\nIt is said that the obscure Female Portal lies deep within the vast ocean, while the towering Mysterious Pass stands far atop Kunlun.\n\n[The Female Portal is the yang Gate within yin; the Mysterious Pass is the yin Portal within yang. The vast ocean is unfathomably deep; Kunlun is unreachably high.]\n\nOne yin, one yang—black and white may be discerned; neither form nor emptiness—cinnabar and ink cannot depict it.\n\n[The first two lines refer to the observable essence and *qi*; the latter two describe the Gate’s appearance, which cannot be captured by brush or ink. This echoes Lüzu’s words: \"If you seek meaning in written words, your brush will drain Dongting Lake.\" This means that without the true oral instructions of the immortal scriptures, the Gate cannot be described. Otherwise, the Mud-Pill Ancestor would not have said, \"If you have not yet met a master, just read the books—within them lies the secret for cultivation.\" Indeed, the true instructions in the alchemical classics are often revealed, yet scholars, with their shallow understanding, fail to grasp them.]\n\nThe Four Cardinals are arrayed here, aligning with *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*; the Two Luminaries revolve here, clustering at the dark moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. Subtle! Wondrous!\n\nThe two characters \"Mysterious Female\" (玄牝)—gather them, refine them, and the work takes but a moment. Below lies the White Tiger, serving as the pivot for kindling the fire; above soars the Azure Dragon, stirring the winds and waves of ascending clouds.\n\n[The Four Cardinals refer to Kan (坎), Li (離), Zhen (震), and Dui (兌). *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* denote north, south, east, and west. The Two Luminaries are the sun and moon. The dark moon (晦) is the day when sun and moon conjoin; the quarter (弦) is when their halves align; the new moon (朔) is the moon’s first day—here signifying the first true *zi* hour for generating the medicine. The full moon (望) is the day when sun and moon face each other. The phrase \"the work takes but a moment\" describes the Gate’s opening and closing, passing in an instant. \"Below lies the White Tiger\" refers to the Female (牝); \"kindling the fire\" denotes the stirring of yang qi. \"Above soars the Azure Dragon\" signifies the Mysterious (玄); \"ascending clouds\" mark the arrival of yin essence. The \"pivot\" and \"winds and waves\" allude to the difficulty of controlling the Dragon and Tiger’s dynamic forces.]\n\nAlas! These are but side doors and minor methods.\n\nConfusion among the multitude takes many forms. Those who claim exclusive mastery of a school and style themselves as virtuous [Annotation: referring to minor side methods]—alas, they lament for scholars who, though they understand yin and yang, remain ignorant of the principles of the Mysterious Female’s opening and closing. These, too, belong to the side doors. It is not only perverse arts that are called side doors; even those who do not grasp the method of the Mysterious Female’s opening and closing, allowing essence and qi to escape through these side paths, do not walk the Great Dao. These are called external ways. To speak of external ways is to say one does not recognize the true gate’s path—how can such a one discuss the cultivation of truth? The *Canon of Elixirs* states: \"Three thousand six hundred side doors, ninety-six kinds of external ways.\" Though some may seem close to the Great Dao, the difference is as between a hair’s breadth and a thousand miles. How deeply one sighs for those who, thus deluded, fail to congeal the elixir!\n\nThis gate, this method, is understood only by those who inherit the direct transmission of the Dao Ancestor. The *Triple Concordance* speaks of opening and closing as methods of unity. Yet without treading the path with steadfast sincerity, one can scarcely comprehend its application. For this method, since ancient times, the Immortal Ancestors have not set it forth plainly in writing. They merely hint at its great purport in the elixir classics, revealing but a glimpse of its secrets. To know the use of opening and closing is to be of the Dao Ancestor’s true lineage—none who grasp this fail to refine the elixir and ascend.\n\nYet today’s side doors and external ways—how can beginners, who do not yet understand even these, hope to attain the supreme Dao? To speak of minor methods is to say one has not grasped the great. Seeing only small effects, knowing merely the power to ward off illness, they believe the Dao is exhausted in this. Why seek the guidance of the lofty and wise? How can they ever hope to achieve true realization? Thus the Ancestor of Purple Yang mocked them: \"The frog in the well claims there is no dragon’s cave; the sparrow in the hedge disputes the existence of the phoenix’s nest.\"\n\nWithout clarifying the principles of the Dao, how can one harmonize with the immortal scriptures? [Annotation: referring to ignorance of the Mysterious Principle.] To pore over the classics of immortality and elixir texts is like a blind man riding a blind horse—how can one enter the true path without the guidance of an enlightened teacher? To call yin and yang the Mysterious Female is to waste effort in vain imagination; to take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female is to labor in futile breathwork. [Annotation: The mouth and nose are but the gates of postnatal breathing—how can true mercury or true lead arise from them?] Not recognizing the principles of yin and yang, how can one give birth to immortals or buddhas? The *Awakening to Reality* says: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world; do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose.\" Truly so!\n\nIf one abandons error and returns to the true, gaining knowledge of the path’s essence, then to explore the subtle and enter the wondrous—how could this lie beyond the gate? [Annotation: Exhorting those of the side doors to cast off error early and embrace the true, so they may readily attain the marvelous principles of the true path, explore the subtle, and enter the wondrous. With a teacher’s guidance, standing in the snow at Cheng Yi’s gate—how could they fail to move Heaven and silently receive the instruction of an enlightened master?] Ah! Consider the single aperture of spirit through which the primal qi flows.\n\nWhere lies the root and foundation of storage and concealment? The internal circulation of primordial harmony serves as the inception of the power of union. [Annotation: The \"aperture of spirit\" is the Valley Spirit. Laozi says: \"The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.\" Union refers to the timing of opening and closing. The harmony of spirit and qi depends entirely on this gate, which governs the inception of internal circulation.]\n\nYet when weighed and judged—why speak of the White Tiger and Azure Dragon, rather than the Black Tiger and Red Dragon? Why position the Mysterious above and the Female below, rather than the Mysterious to the left and the Female to the right? One must know that Wood and Fire are companions: Wood abides within Fire to be stored and nurtured. Metal and Water share a palace: Metal lies concealed within Water.\n\n[Annotation: The White Tiger is *dui*; the Azure Dragon is *zhen*. The Black Tiger is Metal within Water, the qi of *kan*. The Red Dragon is Wood within Fire, the essence of *li*. \"Above and below\" refer to Heaven above and Earth below, while \"left and right\" denote male and female. \"Wood and Fire as companions\" means Wood (three) and Fire (two) combine to form *li*—the Mysterious. \"Metal and Water sharing a palace\" means Metal (four) and Water (one) correspond to *kan*—the Female. This is what Ancestor Ziyang meant by: \"East three and south two together make five; north one and west four share the same principle.\" This is the \"mysterious within the mysterious,\" the \"wondrous within the wondrous.\"]\n\nThe workings of creation, when expounded, are inexhaustible.\n\n[This refers to the \"mysterious within the mysterious\" and the \"wondrous within the wondrous,\" where within the Mysterious lies the Gate of the Mysterious, and within the Wondrous lies the Aperture of the Wondrous. It is also called the \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial.\" Only by understanding the function of this profound mystery can one enter sagehood and transcend the ordinary. The profound mystery operates differently in pre-celestial and post-celestial practice, hence it is said that the workings of creation, when expounded, are boundless. The Gate of the Mysterious Female—how vast it is! How subtle it is! Those who delve deeply into the Great Dao will find the gateway to entry; how could one not penetrate its depths and explore its subtleties? This rhapsody has already provided brief annotations of personal insights, enabling readers to grasp its implicit meanings and thus find the gateway to the Dao.]\n\nMaiwang says: The Mysterious Female is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate inherent in the human body. Within it lies yin and yang, hence it is called the Mysterious Female. Spirit and qi return to their root here; sun and moon unite as one here. If one can establish their foundation upon this, the Valley Spirit will not die. The Valley Spirit is the designation for the pre-celestial, empty, numinous responsiveness—it is our original nature. It is also said: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the place of ingress and egress, the site of yin-yang union, the root and stem of elixir refinement, the dwelling for the return of true essence, and the locus where the Golden Elixir is transformed and generated. Medicinal substances are stored within it.\n\nThe *Qi* states: \"These two apertures follow the same method; the Metal qi also requires them.\" Great cultivators, within the single aperture divided in two, know the method of pursuit and absorption, and thus both apertures become open. Those who do not know this method find both apertures closed. What the Golden Elixir values is the Metal qi. To obtain this Metal qi, one must first understand the method of pursuit and absorption before the workings of creation can be accomplished.\n\nShangyangzi says: External cultivators know only the single entity called the Mysterious Female, also named the Valley Spirit, the Sacred Vessel, the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Gate of All Wonders, or the Wondrous Aperture of Being and Non-Being. Yet all these names are like a deaf man listening to pipes and flutes. They do not realize that the Mysterious Female consists of two entities. Without these two, how could the myriad things be generated?\n\n[Annotation: Quanwei says: The Mysterious Female is not difficult to know; it is its Gate that is difficult to know. The Mysterious Female is the union of male and female. The Mysterious (玄) is the male, internally containing true yin; its trigram corresponds to *li*, aligning with the southern position of *wu*. *Qian* receives *ji* earth. The alchemical classics speak of \"refining the self\" (炼己)—this refers to refining this *ji* earth. The qi of *ji* earth is called yin essence, also known as true mercury. The Female (牝) is the female, internally containing true yang; its trigram corresponds to *kan*, aligning with the northern position of *zi*. *Qian* receives *wu* earth. The internal alchemical classics speak of \"gathering the medicine\" (采药)—this refers to gathering the qi of this *wu* earth. The qi of *wu* earth is called yang essence, also known as true lead. When the qi of these two earths, *wu* and *ji*, combine, it is no longer called *qi* but *qi* (炁). Gathering this *qi* is called the \"knife-point\" (刀圭). The knife-point does not refer to the combination of *wu* and *ji* earths; rather, the knife pertains to Metal, corresponding to *dui*, the Wondrous. These two earths of the knife-point are both born of the Wondrous, constituting the \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial,\" forming the knife-point. Hence, it is called \"wondrous within the wondrous\"—it is not a single wonder that completes the knife-point. However, when the *wu* and *ji* earths within *kan* and *li* combine, they can only be called the \"point\" (圭). The \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial\" refer to what Lü Zu called \"two layers of heaven and earth.\" Within these two layers of heaven and earth lie four yin-yang configurations. If scholars can comprehend this, they will be close to understanding.]\n\nMaiwang says: The Mysterious Female is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate inherent in the human body. How should scholars interpret the phrase \"inherent in the body\"? The \"undifferentiated Great Ultimate\" means yin and yang are each half. \"Within it lies yin and yang\" means that within it, there is again half yin and half yang. The Mysterious (玄) is half yang and half yin; the Female (牝) is half yin and half yang. Because each is half, they must unite; only when united are yin and yang complete, and only then can it be called the Dao. Without union, the Great Ultimate is not formed, and there is no Gate to speak of. The meaning of this Gate has been exhaustively described by Lü Dongbin, yet few understand it. Even Quanwei finds it difficult to explain. Here, I outline its general principles; may scholars investigate further and perhaps grasp its subtle depths.\n\nThere is opening and closing, hence it is called a Gate. Without opening and closing, how could it be called a Gate? To know opening and closing is to know the path of the Gate. The Gate is the Mysterious Pass. To open and close at will, one must refine the Valley Spirit to maturity. The Valley Spirit is the designation for numinous responsiveness, existing within the indistinct and obscure. The Mysterious Pass truly has no form or trace to seek; it can only be apprehended through the union of heart and spirit.\n\nThe alchemical classics say: \"To attain the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass is to achieve longevity and immortality.\" This refers to the ability to open and close it; without this ability, to hope for longevity is futile. The opening and closing of this Pass occur in the indistinct and obscure. The \"indistinct and obscure\" refer to the opening and closing of the Mysterious Pass, the ebb and flow of the Gate. Now, I cite the six lines from the *Marvelous Scripture of the Heart Seal of the Jade Emperor*—\"Indistinct, indistinct; obscure, obscure; preserving non-being while guarding being, accomplished in an instant; returning wind and merging chaos, the work is efficacious in a hundred days\"—to illustrate the opening and closing of the Mysterious Pass, the circulation of essence and qi, and the method of using the Gate’s path. Detailed annotations follow.\n\nThe first two lines correspond to what the Daoist Ancestor called: \"Indistinct, indistinct.\"\n\nWithin it there is something—\ndim and obscure, dim and obscure.\nWithin it there is essence—\n\nThe \"something\" refers to the stirring of the Mysterious Pass, the alternation of indistinct and obscure. This stirring is the passage through which the Valley Spirit moves, the circulation of essence and qi. Hence it is said, \"Within it there is essence.\" This essence, undivided into yin and yang, is true essence. True essence emerges from the dim and obscure, serving as the body’s primordial endowment.\n\nThe middle two lines speak of the crux for cultivators: the so-called \"preserving non-being while guarding being\" means constantly maintaining the thought of the Center’s non-essence, like a cat stalking a mouse, while guarding the qi-movement within the Abyss. When the qi stirs, one’s true mercury is used to welcome the other’s true lead, drawing it into the Mysterious Pass—accomplished in an instant, for the work takes but a moment.\n\nThe final two lines describe the hundred-day refinement through which this Pass may open. Only when it opens is the work deemed efficacious. These hundred days do not refer to the foundation-laying stage. \"Returning wind and merging chaos\" is profound: \"return\" means to turn, and \"wind\" denotes the movement of qi. \"Merging chaos\" signifies essence and qi uniting as one.\n\nThe \"returning wind\" is the wind within the return, or the wind stirring within the return. To grasp this meaning, the student should ponder the characters \"return\" and \"merge\"—thus understanding the path of essence and qi merging, the wind stirring within the return.\n\nThe Pure Yang Patriarch Lü, surnamed with the double-mouthed character, also styled himself \"Return Daoist,\" alluding to the wind returning from within the enclosing mouth. His sobriquet \"Dongbin\" means \"guest within the cavern\"—this \"guest\" echoes the meaning of the Purple Yang Patriarch’s phrase, \"Let him be host while I remain guest.\" The character \"Yan\" (Rock) reflects the meaning of the Three Grades of Upper Medicines, the Three Grades being the nine mouths. This \"nine.\"\n\nThe phrase in the immortal texts referring to \"nine-cycle returning elixir\" thus leads to immortality. The character \"convenient\" (便) here denotes the inherent capacity of the human body—what the Buddha called the \"expedient gate.\" Without this \"convenience,\" one cannot practice the nine-returning work to harmonize the three grades and attain the state of pure yang immortality. The sages of antiquity embedded profound meaning in their characters; scholars must not overlook this. Consider the character *he* (合, \"unite\"): the numeral \"one\" (一) lies within the \"mouth\" (口), and the \"mouth\" resides beneath the \"person\" (人). Ponder this, and you will grasp the marvel of its construction.\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: \"The one-union mark is inexpressible.\" Yet ordinary beings cling to the phenomenon. Reflect: why is it inexpressible? What is this matter to which all ordinary beings cling? Scholars may comprehend this in their hearts. The \"one-union\" refers to essence and qi merging as one. The term \"mark\" (相) is a substitute for the mysterious pass, pointing to the wind within the return. This mark has no form or appearance, hence it is called \"inexpressible.\" Otherwise, no matter what the matter, one could always force an explanation. Yet ordinary beings cling to it, while immortals and buddhas, though not free from such matters, possess no clinging mind. If one has no clinging mind, then within a hundred days, the work will surely take effect, yielding the merging of the returning wind.\n\nThe term \"hundred days\" signifies that within this period, practice must be unceasing to achieve efficacy and open the pass. To penetrate this pass, one must carefully contemplate the character *ling* (灵, \"numinous\"). Its top resembles \"rain\" (雨), its bottom \"shaman\" (巫)—evoking the clouds and rain of Mount Wu. The three mouths within it denote the first grade. The character *wu* (巫) signifies two persons working in unison, merging yin and yang, thereby manifesting the effect of numinous communication. Yet without the work of merging the returning wind, it is not numinous. The application of *ling* is vast indeed.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The Buddha dwells on Spirit Mountain—seek not afar.\nSpirit Mountain lies within your heart.\nEach person possesses a Spirit Mountain pagoda—\nCultivate beneath the Spirit Mountain pagoda.\"*\n\nThe phrase \"each person\" makes clear this is not the work of one alone.\n\nAll, regardless of man or woman, may advance in cultivation. Though people are divided into male and female, yin and yang each possess their half. Thus the *Heart Seal Wondrous Classic* states: \"Each person has essence.\" Since each person has essence, both men and women possess the essence of half-yin and half-yang. When these are united as one, one may become sage or ordinary; when they are not united, neither the Dao of immortality nor the human Dao can be accomplished.\n\nTo achieve the Dao of immortality, one must understand the meaning within the *Heart Seal Classic*: essence unites with spirit, spirit unites with qi, and qi unites with the true body. The phrase \"essence unites with spirit, spirit with qi\" signifies that men and women each possess the Three Treasures—essence, spirit, and qi—and only when these are united can the true be attained. This true is the primordial, undivided true of precelestial origin. When this true is attained, the body may then be called a \"true person,\" capable of uniting with the formless void. Without attaining this true, the Dao can never be realized. Thus the *Heart Seal Classic* further states: \"Without attaining the true, all are but forced names.\" These words \"forced names\" do not refer to the Supreme's saying, \"By a forced name, it is called the Dao,\" but rather point to the heterodox minor methods practiced by those ignorant of true cultivation.\n\nThe essential principle of cultivating the true lies in supporting yang. When yang is pure, one becomes an immortal; when yang is exhausted, one becomes a ghost. The paths of immortals and ghosts are both self-determined. The terms \"immortal\" and \"ghost\" arise from the fact that people possess the endowment of half-yin and half-yang. Immortals are yang; ghosts are yin. Observe the character *ren* (人, \"person\"): its left stroke is light—this is yang; its right stroke is heavy—this is yin. Thus it is said.\n\nHumans are thus designated by the two paths of ghost and immortal. Yet the method of refining yang hinges upon the Gate of Opening and Closing. This gate bears immense significance. Should scholars fail to obtain the complete and true oral instructions, they must not rashly attempt it, for it pertains to matters of life and death. As the immortal scriptures say:\n\n*The gate that gives me life is the door that brings me death,\nHow few are wakeful, how few attain true awakening!\nIn the still of night, the iron-willed man reflects:\nEternal life and deathlessness are forged by one’s own doing.*\n\nThe phrases \"gives me life\" and \"brings me death\" both refer to this very gate. Thus it is said to pertain to matters of life and death. If one seeks eternal life and deathlessness, one can never depart from this gate. What matters most are the words \"reflects for oneself.\" Scholars must examine this with utmost care, for heterodox and external paths abound—one cannot afford not to investigate.\n\nMaster Lü [Dongbin] states:\n*The Mysterious Writ expounds endlessly on yin and yang,\nThese two characters reign as the sovereign of all methods.*\nHe further says:\n*Heaven engenders one thing, transforming it into the Three Powers;\nThrough the intercourse of yin and yang, the sacred embryo is formed.*\n\nThough one may know the two characters yin and yang, one must also comprehend the method of their intercourse to successfully form the sacred embryo and become an immortal. The \"one thing\" refers to the primordial True Unity of qi. The Three Powers all arise from this single qi. When this qi stirs, it transforms into form and substance. First, it divides into Heaven and Earth; then, it further divides into humans and the myriad things. Yet humans, being the most spiritually endowed of all creatures, stand alongside Heaven and Earth as the Three Powers.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humans each possess a Supreme Ultimate. Heaven and Earth together form one Supreme Ultimate, just as man and woman together form one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate contains yin within yang and yang within yin. Because the Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang, there arises the term \"intercourse.\" As the immortal scriptures say:\n\n*If the Mysterious and the Yellow do not unite in intercourse,\nHow could yang ever ascend from beneath the Kan trigram?*\n\nThe Mysterious and the Yellow refer to Heaven (mysterious) and Earth (yellow). The ancient sages said: \"Without Earth, Heaven would not be Heaven; without Heaven, Earth would not be Earth. Before marriage, man and woman are not yet fully human.\" Without intercourse, solitary yin and solitary yang cannot form the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, the intercourse of yin and yang is necessary to form the sacred embryo.\n\nThe intercourse of yin and yang means the union of yin essence and yang qi. Without this union, the great Dao cannot be attained.\n\nMaster Quanyang [Wang Chongyang] said:\n*Heterodox minor methods delude the multitude in myriad ways;\nThose who specialize in a single school often pride themselves on their worth.\nWithout clarifying the principles of the Learning of the Dao,\nHow can one harmonize with the immortal scriptures?*\n\nThis book is composed with the urgent aim of enlightening scholars and makes no claim to self-aggrandizement. Moreover, it cites the classics of immortals and buddhas, all of which have their sources. Everyone may verify and examine them. Tested against the divine, it should incur no shame. Should there be those of shared mystery and lofty understanding, I humbly invite their corrections and enlightening instruction. The great Dao is impartial—it shines like the sun and moon for all to see.",

      "translated_text": "Opening and closing both embody the meaning of unity. If this gate achieves perfect synchrony in its opening and closing, then the refinement of the elixir may be hoped for. Once the root and origin are attained, it is said: *The Great Elixir finds its root here.*\n\nThe term \"Great Elixir\" consists of two characters: \"great\" (大) and \"elixir\" (丹), which together imply that if a person attains the One, they may achieve greatness. The character for \"elixir\" (丹) is composed of a \"sun\" radical (日) at the top, a \"moon\" radical (月) at the bottom, and a horizontal stroke in between—signifying the union of sun and moon. The dot within represents the fusion of essence and qi, symbolizing a single grain of golden elixir.\n\nAs for the \"valley of emptiness and nothingness,\" this gate resides within the void, akin to the form of the character \"valley\" (谷). The meaning of \"emptiness and nothingness\" has been repeatedly expounded earlier and will not be reiterated here. The character \"valley\" (谷) depicts two persons with mouths joined, and this mouth lies beneath them—scholars should grasp this significance. The valley is hollow and empty, yet responsive in its emptiness. This responsiveness is spirit. Laozi called it the \"Valley Spirit.\" Ancestor Ziyang said: *\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\"* He also said: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world.\"* Without the guidance of an enlightened teacher, scholars will find this gate elusive—hence it is said to be \"rarely known.\" In truth, it is like an echo in a valley: it responds when called but cannot be grasped when sought.\n\nThe arrangement of the cauldron and vessel follows a clear hierarchy, standing in stark opposition. The mechanism of their opening and closing is wondrous yet indescribable.\n\n[Commentary: The hierarchy refers to the metaphor of male and female. The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Heaven is noble, earth is base—thus Qian and Kun are established.\"* Opposition signifies yin and yang standing face to face. Opening and closing are the ebb and flow of the gate, while the cauldron and furnace are the instruments of yin and yang.

Let us speak of this aperture, which all people share, yet what is not a gate is called a gate, a truth rarely known to the world.\n\n[All people share this because only when male and female unite does this Gate exist—it cannot belong to one alone. What is not a gate is called a gate because it has no form or trace, not a true gate in itself. Only when yin and yang unite imperceptibly does its image appear. Thus, it is said that no single person can create this Gate, which is why it remains unknown to most. Yet people know only of opening and issuing forth, not of closing and returning. How much less do they understand its simultaneous opening and closing?]\n\nFor heaven and earth constantly unite in the ceaseless coming and going, while spirit and *qi* ever merge in unbroken continuity.\n\n[When it speaks of heaven and earth constantly uniting, it refers to the *Yijing*’s \"male and female commingle their essence.\" The \"ceaseless coming and going\" describes the moment of human union, when people remain unaware of the subtle interplay of lesser departure and greater arrival, of opening and closing. \"Spirit and *qi* merge in unbroken continuity\" refers to the moment when the Gate is about to open or close—when the whole body feels harmonious and at ease, yet one does not perceive the how or why of its opening and closing.]\n\nNow this aperture breaks through the primordial chaos, laying the foundation of True Unity.\n\n[Breaking through the aperture of primordial chaos means the Gate of the Mysterious Female is opened. Laying the foundation of True Unity means that if one can, in due time, gather the prenatal True Unity *qi* within *kan*, then the foundation may be established, and the fruit of earthly immortality attained.

Otherwise, the Mud-Pill Ancestor would not have said, \"If you have not yet met a master, just read the books—within them lies the secret for cultivation.\" Indeed, the true instructions in the alchemical classics are often revealed, yet scholars, with their shallow understanding, fail to grasp them.]\n\nThe Four Cardinals are arrayed here, aligning with *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*; the Two Luminaries revolve here, clustering at the dark moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter.

      "translated_text": "Confusion among the multitude takes many forms. Those who claim exclusive mastery of a school and style themselves as virtuous [Annotation: referring to minor side methods]—alas, they lament for scholars who, though they understand yin and yang, remain ignorant of the principles of the Mysterious Female’s opening and closing. These, too, belong to the side doors. It is not only perverse arts that are called side doors; even those who do not grasp the method of the Mysterious Female’s opening and closing, allowing essence and qi to escape through these side paths, do not walk the Great Dao. These are called external ways. To speak of external ways is to say one does not recognize the true gate’s path—how can such a one discuss the cultivation of truth? The *Canon of Elixirs* states: \"Three thousand six hundred side doors, ninety-six kinds of external ways.\" Though some may seem close to the Great Dao, the difference is as between a hair’s breadth and a thousand miles. How deeply one sighs for those who, thus deluded, fail to congeal the elixir!\n\nThis gate, this method, is understood only by those who inherit the direct transmission of the Dao Ancestor. The *Triple Concordance* speaks of opening and closing as methods of unity. Yet without treading the path with steadfast sincerity, one can scarcely comprehend its application. For this method, since ancient times, the Immortal Ancestors have not set it forth plainly in writing. They merely hint at its great purport in the elixir classics, revealing but a glimpse of its secrets. To know the use of opening and closing is to be of the Dao Ancestor’s true lineage—none who grasp this fail to refine the elixir and ascend.\n\nYet today’s side doors and external ways—how can beginners, who do not yet understand even these, hope to attain the supreme Dao? To speak of minor methods is to say one has not grasped the great. Seeing only small effects, knowing merely the power to ward off illness, they believe the Dao is exhausted in this. Why seek the guidance of the lofty and wise? How can they ever hope to achieve true realization? Thus the Ancestor of Purple Yang mocked them: \"The frog in the well claims there is no dragon’s cave; the sparrow in the hedge disputes the existence of the phoenix’s nest.\"\n\nWithout clarifying the principles of the Dao, how can one harmonize with the immortal scriptures? [Annotation: referring to ignorance of the Mysterious Principle.] To pore over the classics of immortality and elixir texts is like a blind man riding a blind horse—how can one enter the true path without the guidance of an enlightened teacher? To call yin and yang the Mysterious Female is to waste effort in vain imagination; to take the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female is to labor in futile breathwork. [Annotation: The mouth and nose are but the gates of postnatal breathing—how can true mercury or true lead arise from them?] Not recognizing the principles of yin and yang, how can one give birth to immortals or buddhas? The *Awakening to Reality* says: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world; do not mistakenly apply it to the mouth and nose.\" Truly so!\n\nIf one abandons error and returns to the true, gaining knowledge of the path’s essence, then to explore the subtle and enter the wondrous—how could this lie beyond the gate? [Annotation: Exhorting those of the side doors to cast off error early and embrace the true, so they may readily attain the marvelous principles of the true path, explore the subtle, and enter the wondrous.

It is also called the \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial.\" Only by understanding the function of this profound mystery can one enter sagehood and transcend the ordinary. The profound mystery operates differently in pre-celestial and post-celestial practice, hence it is said that the workings of creation, when expounded, are boundless. The Gate of the Mysterious Female—how vast it is! How subtle it is! Those who delve deeply into the Great Dao will find the gateway to entry; how could one not penetrate its depths and explore its subtleties? This rhapsody has already provided brief annotations of personal insights, enabling readers to grasp its implicit meanings and thus find the gateway to the Dao.]\n\nMaiwang says: The Mysterious Female is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate inherent in the human body. Within it lies yin and yang, hence it is called the Mysterious Female. Spirit and qi return to their root here; sun and moon unite as one here. If one can establish their foundation upon this, the Valley Spirit will not die. The Valley Spirit is the designation for the pre-celestial, empty, numinous responsiveness—it is our original nature. It is also said: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the place of ingress and egress, the site of yin-yang union, the root and stem of elixir refinement, the dwelling for the return of true essence, and the locus where the Golden Elixir is transformed and generated. Medicinal substances are stored within it.\n\nThe *Qi* states: \"These two apertures follow the same method; the Metal qi also requires them.\" Great cultivators, within the single aperture divided in two, know the method of pursuit and absorption, and thus both apertures become open. Those who do not know this method find both apertures closed. What the Golden Elixir values is the Metal qi. To obtain this Metal qi, one must first understand the method of pursuit and absorption before the workings of creation can be accomplished.\n\nShangyangzi says: External cultivators know only the single entity called the Mysterious Female, also named the Valley Spirit, the Sacred Vessel, the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the Gate of All Wonders, or the Wondrous Aperture of Being and Non-Being. Yet all these names are like a deaf man listening to pipes and flutes. They do not realize that the Mysterious Female consists of two entities. Without these two, how could the myriad things be generated?\n\n[Annotation: Quanwei says: The Mysterious Female is not difficult to know; it is its Gate that is difficult to know. The Mysterious Female is the union of male and female. The Mysterious (玄) is the male, internally containing true yin; its trigram corresponds to *li*, aligning with the southern position of *wu*. *Qian* receives *ji* earth. The alchemical classics speak of \"refining the self\" (炼己)—this refers to refining this *ji* earth. The qi of *ji* earth is called yin essence, also known as true mercury. The Female (牝) is the female, internally containing true yang; its trigram corresponds to *kan*, aligning with the northern position of *zi*. *Qian* receives *wu* earth. The internal alchemical classics speak of \"gathering the medicine\" (采药)—this refers to gathering the qi of this *wu* earth. The qi of *wu* earth is called yang essence, also known as true lead. When the qi of these two earths, *wu* and *ji*, combine, it is no longer called *qi* but *qi* (炁). Gathering this *qi* is called the \"knife-point\" (刀圭). The knife-point does not refer to the combination of *wu* and *ji* earths; rather, the knife pertains to Metal, corresponding to *dui*, the Wondrous. These two earths of the knife-point are both born of the Wondrous, constituting the \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial,\" forming the knife-point. Hence, it is called \"wondrous within the wondrous\"—it is not a single wonder that completes the knife-point. However, when the *wu* and *ji* earths within *kan* and *li* combine, they can only be called the \"point\" (圭). The \"post-celestial within the pre-celestial\" and the \"pre-celestial within the pre-celestial\" refer to what Lü Zu called \"two layers of heaven and earth.\" Within these two layers of heaven and earth lie four yin-yang configurations. If scholars can comprehend this, they will be close to understanding.]\n\nMaiwang says: The Mysterious Female is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate inherent in the human body. How should scholars interpret the phrase \"inherent in the body\"? The \"undifferentiated Great Ultimate\" means yin and yang are each half. \"Within it lies yin and yang\" means that within it, there is again half yin and half yang. The Mysterious (玄) is half yang and half yin; the Female (牝) is half yin and half yang. Because each is half, they must unite; only when united are yin and yang complete, and only then can it be called the Dao. Without union, the Great Ultimate is not formed, and there is no Gate to speak of. The meaning of this Gate has been exhaustively described by Lü Dongbin, yet few understand it. Even Quanwei finds it difficult to explain. Here, I outline its general principles; may scholars investigate further and perhaps grasp its subtle depths.\n\nThere is opening and closing, hence it is called a Gate. Without opening and closing, how could it be called a Gate? To know opening and closing is to know the path of the Gate. The Gate is the Mysterious Pass. To open and close at will, one must refine the Valley Spirit to maturity. The Valley Spirit is the designation for numinous responsiveness, existing within the indistinct and obscure. The Mysterious Pass truly has no form or trace to seek; it can only be apprehended through the union of heart and spirit.\n\nThe alchemical classics say: \"To attain the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass is to achieve longevity and immortality.\" This refers to the ability to open and close it; without this ability, to hope for longevity is futile. The opening and closing of this Pass occur in the indistinct and obscure. The \"indistinct and obscure\" refer to the opening and closing of the Mysterious Pass, the ebb and flow of the Gate. Now, I cite the six lines from the *Marvelous Scripture of the Heart Seal of the Jade Emperor*—\"Indistinct, indistinct; obscure, obscure; preserving non-being while guarding being, accomplished in an instant; returning wind and merging chaos, the work is efficacious in a hundred days\"—to illustrate the opening and closing of the Mysterious Pass, the circulation of essence and qi, and the method of using the Gate’s path. Detailed annotations follow.\n\nThe first two lines correspond to what the Daoist Ancestor called: \"Indistinct, indistinct.\"",

This stirring is the passage through which the Valley Spirit moves, the circulation of essence and qi. Hence it is said, \"Within it there is essence.\" This essence, undivided into yin and yang, is true essence. True essence emerges from the dim and obscure, serving as the body’s primordial endowment.\n\nThe middle two lines speak of the crux for cultivators: the so-called \"preserving non-being while guarding being\" means constantly maintaining the thought of the Center’s non-essence, like a cat stalking a mouse, while guarding the qi-movement within the Abyss. When the qi stirs, one’s true mercury is used to welcome the other’s true lead, drawing it into the Mysterious Pass—accomplished in an instant, for the work takes but a moment.\n\nThe final two lines describe the hundred-day refinement through which this Pass may open.

      "translated_text": "The phrase in the immortal texts referring to \"nine-cycle returning elixir\" thus leads to immortality. The character \"convenient\" (便) here denotes the inherent capacity of the human body—what the Buddha called the \"expedient gate.\" Without this \"convenience,\" one cannot practice the nine-returning work to harmonize the three grades and attain the state of pure yang immortality. The sages of antiquity embedded profound meaning in their characters; scholars must not overlook this. Consider the character *he* (合, \"unite\"): the numeral \"one\" (一) lies within the \"mouth\" (口), and the \"mouth\" resides beneath the \"person\" (人). Ponder this, and you will grasp the marvel of its construction.\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: \"The one-union mark is inexpressible.\" Yet ordinary beings cling to the phenomenon. Reflect: why is it inexpressible? What is this matter to which all ordinary beings cling? Scholars may comprehend this in their hearts. The \"one-union\" refers to essence and qi merging as one. The term \"mark\" (相) is a substitute for the mysterious pass, pointing to the wind within the return. This mark has no form or appearance, hence it is called \"inexpressible.\" Otherwise, no matter what the matter, one could always force an explanation. Yet ordinary beings cling to it, while immortals and buddhas, though not free from such matters, possess no clinging mind. If one has no clinging mind, then within a hundred days, the work will surely take effect, yielding the merging of the returning wind.\n\nThe term \"hundred days\" signifies that within this period, practice must be unceasing to achieve efficacy and open the pass. To penetrate this pass, one must carefully contemplate the character *ling* (灵, \"numinous\"). Its top resembles \"rain\" (雨), its bottom \"shaman\" (巫)—evoking the clouds and rain of Mount Wu. The three mouths within it denote the first grade. The character *wu* (巫) signifies two persons working in unison, merging yin and yang, thereby manifesting the effect of numinous communication. Yet without the work of merging the returning wind, it is not numinous. The application of *ling* is vast indeed.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The Buddha dwells on Spirit Mountain—seek not afar.\nSpirit Mountain lies within your heart.\nEach person possesses a Spirit Mountain pagoda—\nCultivate beneath the Spirit Mountain pagoda.\"*\n\nThe phrase \"each person\" makes clear this is not the work of one alone.",
      "overlap_context": "within the return.\n\nThe Pure Yang Patriarch Lü, surnamed with the double-mouthed character, also styled himself \"Return Daoist,\" alluding to the wind returning from within the enclosing mouth. His sobriquet \"Dongbin\" means \"guest within the cavern\"—this \"guest\" echoes the meaning of the Purple Yang Patriarch’s phrase, \"Let him be host while I remain guest.\" The character \"Yan\" (Rock) reflects the meaning of the Three Grades of Upper Medicines, the Three Grades being the nine mouths.

      "translated_text": "All, regardless of man or woman, may advance in cultivation. Though people are divided into male and female, yin and yang each possess their half. Thus the *Heart Seal Wondrous Classic* states: \"Each person has essence.\" Since each person has essence, both men and women possess the essence of half-yin and half-yang. When these are united as one, one may become sage or ordinary; when they are not united, neither the Dao of immortality nor the human Dao can be accomplished.\n\nTo achieve the Dao of immortality, one must understand the meaning within the *Heart Seal Classic*: essence unites with spirit, spirit unites with qi, and qi unites with the true body. The phrase \"essence unites with spirit, spirit with qi\" signifies that men and women each possess the Three Treasures—essence, spirit, and qi—and only when these are united can the true be attained. This true is the primordial, undivided true of precelestial origin. When this true is attained, the body may then be called a \"true person,\" capable of uniting with the formless void. Without attaining this true, the Dao can never be realized. Thus the *Heart Seal Classic* further states: \"Without attaining the true, all are but forced names.\" These words \"forced names\" do not refer to the Supreme's saying, \"By a forced name, it is called the Dao,\" but rather point to the heterodox minor methods practiced by those ignorant of true cultivation.\n\nThe essential principle of cultivating the true lies in supporting yang. When yang is pure, one becomes an immortal; when yang is exhausted, one becomes a ghost. The paths of immortals and ghosts are both self-determined. The terms \"immortal\" and \"ghost\" arise from the fact that people possess the endowment of half-yin and half-yang. Immortals are yang; ghosts are yin. Observe the character *ren* (人, \"person\"): its left stroke is light—this is yang; its right stroke is heavy—this is yin. Thus it is said.",

      "translated_text": "Humans are thus designated by the two paths of ghost and immortal. Yet the method of refining yang hinges upon the Gate of Opening and Closing. This gate bears immense significance. Should scholars fail to obtain the complete and true oral instructions, they must not rashly attempt it, for it pertains to matters of life and death. As the immortal scriptures say:\n\n*The gate that gives me life is the door that brings me death,\nHow few are wakeful, how few attain true awakening!\nIn the still of night, the iron-willed man reflects:\nEternal life and deathlessness are forged by one’s own doing.*\n\nThe phrases \"gives me life\" and \"brings me death\" both refer to this very gate. Thus it is said to pertain to matters of life and death. If one seeks eternal life and deathlessness, one can never depart from this gate. What matters most are the words \"reflects for oneself.\" Scholars must examine this with utmost care, for heterodox and external paths abound—one cannot afford not to investigate.\n\nMaster Lü [Dongbin] states:\n*The Mysterious Writ expounds endlessly on yin and yang,\nThese two characters reign as the sovereign of all methods.*\nHe further says:\n*Heaven engenders one thing, transforming it into the Three Powers;\nThrough the intercourse of yin and yang, the sacred embryo is formed.*\n\nThough one may know the two characters yin and yang, one must also comprehend the method of their intercourse to successfully form the sacred embryo and become an immortal. The \"one thing\" refers to the primordial True Unity of qi. The Three Powers all arise from this single qi. When this qi stirs, it transforms into form and substance. First, it divides into Heaven and Earth; then, it further divides into humans and the myriad things. Yet humans, being the most spiritually endowed of all creatures, stand alongside Heaven and Earth as the Three Powers.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humans each possess a Supreme Ultimate. Heaven and Earth together form one Supreme Ultimate, just as man and woman together form one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate contains yin within yang and yang within yin. Because the Supreme Ultimate divides into yin and yang, there arises the term \"intercourse.\" As the immortal scriptures say:\n\n*If the Mysterious and the Yellow do not unite in intercourse,\nHow could yang ever ascend from beneath the Kan trigram?*\n\nThe Mysterious and the Yellow refer to Heaven (mysterious) and Earth (yellow). The ancient sages said: \"Without Earth, Heaven would not be Heaven; without Heaven, Earth would not be Earth. Before marriage, man and woman are not yet fully human.\" Without intercourse, solitary yin and solitary yang cannot form the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, the intercourse of yin and yang is necessary to form the sacred embryo.\n\nThe intercourse of yin and yang means the union of yin essence and yang qi. Without this union, the great Dao cannot be attained.\n\nMaster Quanyang [Wang Chongyang] said:\n*Heterodox minor methods delude the multitude in myriad ways;\nThose who specialize in a single school often pride themselves on their worth.\nWithout clarifying the principles of the Learning of the Dao,\nHow can one harmonize with the immortal scriptures?*\n\nThis book is composed with the urgent aim of enlightening scholars and makes no claim to self-aggrandizement. Moreover, it cites the classics of immortals and buddhas, all of which have their sources. Everyone may verify and examine them. Tested against the divine, it should incur no shame. Should there be those of shared mystery and lofty understanding, I humbly invite their corrections and enlightening instruction. The great Dao is impartial—it shines like the sun and moon for all to see.",
