  "full_translation": "*The Wondrous Sutra of the Divine Incantation of Sweet Dew Ascending to Heaven, Spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*\n\nThus have I heard: At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was seated upon a seven-jeweled lotus throne in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Western Jasper Realm, expounding the supreme true Dao to the divine immortals of heaven, guiding them into the Great Vehicle and the gate of liberation, free from the view of emptiness.\n\nLater, he discoursed to the divine immortals of heaven and earth on the lesser vehicle’s wondrous Dao of the Five Phases’ cyclical transformations, their responsive merits, and the empty realms of the ten directions, leading them into the domain of the Dao.\n\nHe further spoke of the immortals among ghosts. These ghostly immortals, having once performed three thousand yin merits while among humankind, passed through the Great Yin after death without falling into evil destinies. Through transformative practices and powers equal to those of ghosts and spirits, their accumulated merit and power enabled them to become ghostly immortals. Now, he taught them the *Nine Transformations to Refine the Yin and Revive the Corpse*, enabling them to generate yang radiance and ascend to the Nine Heavens.\n\nHe also expounded upon the karmic retributions of good and evil, the causes and conditions, and the fruits of blessings in the Three Wretched Realms and hells beneath the nine lands of the ten directions—nothing was left unaddressed.\n\nAt that time, among the assembly, a youth named Pure Bright Moonlight arose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and, gazing upward, extolled the rare and magnificent great compassion that broadly expounds the characteristics of all dharmas for gods and humans, enabling each to attain liberation. \"This humble one today has been granted the fortune to behold the sacred countenance. I have a doubt I wish to present to the mysterious origin. May the Golden Mouth open and widely spread the clouds of compassion.\n\nJust now, I witnessed the Celestial Worthy speak of the ceaseless suffering of karmic offenses in the Three Wretched Realms and the Five Pains of hell. Now, I see that the beings of the world give rise to the ten evil minds, deluded by the five poisons, boundless and immeasurable, their karma inexhaustible. The evil paths overflow, the fires of karma blaze fiercely, and I hear that when sentient beings die, they enter the long night, widely ensnared by karma, enduring hunger, thirst, bitterness, and torment, their distress and agitation unbearable. Even if they encounter pure ice, it transforms into raging flames. The measure of such suffering in the Three Wretched Realms is beyond reckoning. They must rely on merit and virtue; if they receive the mysterious transformation, they will forever bear the vast grace. I humbly beseech the Celestial Worthy: How may they be rescued and delivered?\"\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy, moved by skillful means, opened the gate of benefit and proclaimed the jade treasury’s regulations, transmitting the sacred instructions of the *Lingbao*. He addressed Pure Bright Moonlight, saying:\n\n\"If there are beings in the Three Realms and the ten directions of the infinite worlds who, after death, fall into evil destinies to receive their karmic retribution, those presently alive should, on their behalf, take a cup of earth from the place of their passing and place it in a pure vessel. Scatter fragrant flowers and food offerings over it. When the ritual is complete, recite the *Incantation of Sweet Dew Opening the Karmic Path to Communicate with the True*:\n\n*Virtue’s golden radiance shines,\nIlluminating the dark and hidden.\nFrom the flower pool flows true fragrance,\nLotus canopies drift upon the clouds.*\"\n\nThe myriad spirits gather in primal harmony,\nEver dwelling in the Twelve Towers.\nHasten to proclaim the sacred *Lingbao* instructions,\nRoaming freely through the celestial paradise.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"When those who have fallen into hell hear this divine incantation, they naturally find joy, partake of sweet dew as sustenance, and awaken the mind of aspiration. Their afflictions and karmic deeds are severed. Then, let all in the Dharma assembly recite the *Incantation of Purifying Fengdu, Shattering Hell, and Ascending to Heaven*:\n\nWithin the boundless Fengdu,\nLayer upon layer of Vajra Mountains stand.\nThe infinite radiance of the *Lingbao* shines,\nIlluminating the fires of the scorching pools.\nThe seven generations of suffering souls,\nTheir bodies rise with fragrant clouds.\nIn samadhi and wisdom, the blue lotus blooms,\nAscending to dwell in eternal peace.\"\n\nAt that moment, when the Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding this Dharma, the divine immortals, dragons, spirits, and others in heaven and earth, together with Pure Bright Moonlight and the assemblies of humans and gods, all at once awakened boundless wisdom. They aroused the mind of non-action, entered the gate of the Great Vehicle, and attained the supreme Dao. They advanced, bowed in reverence, and spoke: \"Excellent! Excellent! We now humbly inquire: for all the departed beings who, by turning toward the sacred Dao, each attain liberation, may the Three Wretched Realms be emptied and the Nine Dark Realms cease their retribution. The great assembly rejoices and praises this, for its principle is beyond compare.\" They paid homage and withdrew, placing their faith in the true Dao.\n\nThus concludes the *Sutra of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning on the Wondrous Incantation of Sweet Dew Ascending to Heaven*.",
