  "full_translation": "*The Precious Transmission of the Dao of Immortality by the Primordial Mysterious Jade Maiden, Supreme Holy Mother*\n\n**Title:** *The Authentic Transmission of the Dao of Immortality by the Primordial Mysterious Jade Maiden, Supreme Holy Mother*. Author unknown. Purportedly a discourse between the Holy Mother and Lord Lao on the methods of external elixirs and the inner alchemical art of guarding the One. The text also appears in *The Sacred Records of the Primordial Unity* by Xie Shoulan of the Southern Song. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Methods* section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n---\n\nThe Holy Mother addressed Lord Lao, saying: \"All beings born within Heaven and Earth possess both purity and turbidity. Those of pure *qi* are wise, bright, compassionate, and kind; those of turbid *qi* are foolish, benighted, cruel, and violent. The enlightened refine themselves to perfect their nature, while the deluded indulge desires to harm their life. Nature is the source of the body, and life is its root. Thus, those who cultivate and study refine their bodies with the Nine Elixirs, untie the knots of the Five Spirits, guide the black [*hei*, primordial essence] back to its origin, and extinguish the root at the Three Passes. After nine refinements and ten transformations, with a hundred joints illumined and the knots of the womb dissolved, they come to know their original truth and ascend as immortals.\n\nIf one does not cultivate and study, demonic influences enter the body, a hundred illnesses arise, and death cuts life short—agonies too bitter to speak of. Immortality arises from the study of the heart-mind; when the heart-mind is sincere, immortality is achieved. The Dao values inner seeking; when the inner is serene, the Dao draws near. If one can attain stillness to study the real, accumulate emptiness to commune with the divine, then immortality draws ever closer. But if the heart-mind competes and the spirit labors, the body grows restless and unfocused, movement and stillness dissipate essence, and the ears and eyes scatter clarity—then, though one accumulates years in search of the Dao, the Dao grows ever more distant.\n\nOur sojourn in Heaven and Earth is but a fleeting moment. If one can gather the black [*hei*] and nurture the spirit, enduring hardship to concentrate the real, then after long practice, one attains the Dao and dwells with Heaven and Earth, abiding in the Great Void. If one can penetrate emptiness and embody non-being, then one becomes invisible to sight and inaudible to hearing—thus merging with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Now, mingling with the dust of the world, one wishes to endure forever and transcend death, guiding others across the ages—is this possible?\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign replied: \"I possess a secret treasure, transmitted only to the worthy. Those who cultivate it may endure forever.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"I wish to hear of its attainment.\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign said: \"The supreme Dao is profound and abstruse, beyond comprehension. It is neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. Invisible to sight, intangible to grasp, it encompasses Heaven and Earth. The perfected person is boundless; though near in all bodies, none can fathom it. To know its principle is called *mysterious virtue*.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Does the Dao also have methods to attain it?\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign said: \"The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and penetration. Methods are the wondrous techniques of transformation. The Dao employs methods to aid humanity; humanity, through cultivation, unites with the Dao—then transformations are inexhaustible.\n\nThe essence of the Dao lies in non-action and spontaneity. The secrecy of methods resides in talismans and the black [*hei*] elixir. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, the true pledge of Heaven. The elixir is the essence and flower of the Five Phases, the refined sap of Earth. The black [*hei*] is the harmonious quintessence of yin and yang, the numinous spirit of the myriad things. Though one may master a single practice, without talismans and elixirs, the Dao remains incomplete. These are my secret treasures. If you can combine them, you may endure forever and guide countless beings.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The body is the vessel of the Dao, and *qi* is the root of life. If the root is severed, life ends; if the vessel decays, the Dao departs. Now, wishing to cultivate it so that life is secure and the Dao flourishes—may I hear of this?\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign said: \"Humans are endowed with the substance of bone and flesh, like clay in a potter’s hands. If unburied and unrefined, it decays swiftly; if the body is uncultivated, life is brief—such is the principle. Even if one’s virtue surpasses the grasses and trees, and one’s spirit communes with the Great Mystery, the body may still succumb to old age and death. Why? Because transformation dictates it; it cannot be otherwise.\n\nOnly the elixir can refine the form, and talismans can summon the spirit. When the spirit returns, the heart-mind is unobstructed and nature is at ease; when the form is firm, *qi* is stabilized and life is preserved. Then, transmuting *qi* into essence, one penetrates formlessness, soaring and traversing the void. Life and death become spontaneous—thus one endures forever. Though the adept may encounter cataclysm, with Heaven and Earth collapsing, calamity cannot reach them. This is why talismans and elixirs are prized.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Those who ingest the divine elixir and attain longevity—is this due to the protection of spirits, or the power of the elixir?\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign said: \"The merit of longevity lies in the elixir. The elixir’s completion depends on the spirit. Thus, before compounding the elixir, one must first rectify the heart-mind, avoiding transgressions. Then the spirit and numen protect it, and the elixir will surely form. When the divine elixir enters the mouth, life becomes boundless.\n\nHeaven and Earth observe clearly: the Dao returns to the benevolent. The teeming masses, like moving corpses, do not believe longevity can be learned, dismissing it as empty fantasy. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in deeds that hasten death—how can Heaven force them to live? Indulging desires to the full, they perish suddenly. Though a thousand gold pieces are spent on burial, what benefit is there?\n\nWhen the divine elixir and the Dao are perfected, not only does one attain longevity, but it may also become a treasure of the world. Those who know this Dao—what need have they for the world or others? Even if a kingdom were offered in exchange for my formula, I would not transmit it to the unworthy.\"\n\nLord Lao bowed deeply and said: \"I wish to hear its essentials.\"\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign then raised her gaze to the heavens and let out a long whistle. Suddenly, a purple cloud like a canopy descended from the sky, within which five-colored vapors radiated light in all directions. The immortal Juanzi attended her. The Primordial Sovereign unfurled sacred charts and precious texts on the methods of transformation, the arts of returning the elixir, subduing water and fire, and the mercury-gold fluid—seventy-two scrolls in all—and bestowed upon Lord Lao the art of the golden fluid.\n\nThe Mysterious Jade Maiden, Supreme Holy Mother, said: \"The Dao of immortals does not lie in sacrifices or prayers to ghosts and spirits, nor in daoyin or bending and stretching, nor in incantations or verbose supplications, nor in intense contemplation or self-imposed austerities. The essence of longevity lies in the divine elixir.\"\n\nKnowing it is most easy, yet practicing it is supremely difficult. If you can enact it, you may endure forever—this Dao, once established, grants transcendence. Though I too have learned it, it is not innate.\n\nThe method of the golden fluid states:\nOne is the Mysterious White that gives birth to Metal Elder,\nThe sun’s flowing pearl enters the Flowery Pond.\nWithin the catty, five taels of patterned fern,\nRed salt and white snow form the male and female.\nFive Talismans and Nine Elixirs—attain these and ascend,\nYet the true Way lies here, unknown to men.\n\nThe Five Talismans are:\nFirst, Mysterious White;\nSecond, Metal Essence;\nThird, Flying Talisman;\nFourth, Golden Florescence;\nFifth, the Three-Five Azure Dragon Essence.\n\nThe Nine Elixirs are:\nFirst, White Snow Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSecond, Male-Female Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nThird, Golden Fluid Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nFourth, White Florescence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nFifth, Elixir Florescence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSixth, Five-Colors Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSeventh, Clay Mercury Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nEighth, Metal Essence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nNinth, Nine Cauldrons Ultimate Radiance Returning Elixir.\n\nOf these nine elixirs, attaining even one grants longevity, not through forced effort. The Way of the divine elixir undergoes three transformations and five turns, culminating at nine—those who ingest it become equal to me. All nine elixirs are paths to ascending to heaven. Yet among them, the golden fluid is supreme. Those who consume the nine elixirs may, after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, sixty days, thirty days, ten days, or three days, be welcomed by immortal officials with clouds and dragons. Only those who ingest the golden fluid, upon taking it, turn their bodies the color of purple gold, instantly grow feathered wings, and ascend to become immortal officials. Yet one must first maintain a long fast and abstain from grains for a year before partaking. Without celestial records or an undying name, one shall never hear of the Way of the Nine Elixirs and golden fluid. Its method follows the prior elixir-compounding: once the gold is formed, it is liquified, and the Way is complete—this is my secret treasure.\n\nLord Lao transmitted the Dao to Yin Xi, saying: \"The great Dao upholds its three grades as principle, takes the One as measure, and rectitude as virtue. If you can know the One, all matters are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the secluded chamber, refine gold and consume the Black—this is foremost. If you can know it, guard it and do not lose it.\"\n\nHe further said: \"The Most Perfect Supreme Thearchs all attained the Dao through the golden elixir, treading the nine depths to enter the boundless dark, ascending and descending through the void and origin, rising together with the divine luminaries.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Way of refining gold and consuming the Black is the essence of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang—it is called the Two Blacks. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the liquid of wood and the essence of metal, when their two qi converge and are refined, form what is called the outer elixir. Containing harmony and refining the hidden, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending into the Muddy Pellet, descending to the Cinnabar Field, circulating without cease, arriving at the Crimson Palace, gathering from the five minerals to nourish the hundred spirits—this is the inner elixir. Those who cultivate the Dao by containing harmony and refining the Black, if they attain the inner elixir, may extend their years. If they attain the outer elixir, they may ascend to heaven. The Three Ones and Nine Contemplations are the essence of inner cultivation. The Nine Elixirs and golden fluid are the pinnacle of the outer elixir. Cultivating both together, the Dao is perfected.\"\n\nThe Oral Formula for Consuming the Black states:\nConsume the Black to secure essence,\nReceive the Mysterious Canon of Illumination.\nThe essential subtleties of the living Way,\nEmerging from darkness, entering the obscure.\nAbove, secure the Cloud Gate;\nBelow, secure the numinous root.\nKnowing it is most easy,\nPracticing it is supremely difficult.\n\nWhen the form moves, virtue scatters;\nWhen qi strays, the Dao rebels.\nEssence dissipates, the hun is harmed,\nThe eyes stir, the po is disordered.\nThus the sage stills the form and secures the Black,\nAccumulates essence and receives vision—\nThen virtue and Dao congeal in emptiness,\nHun and po are firmly guarded,\nForm unites, spirit flourishes,\nAnd the Dao is accomplished.\n\nAlways after midnight,\nLie supine, clench the fists,\nDraw in pure qi through the nose,\nExhale slowly through the mouth.\nAgain guard the Three Ones,\nEnter the chamber and contemplate the Nine.\nWhen spirit is settled and qi is calm,\nThe immortal Way draws near.\n\nHe then transmitted to Xi the *Thirty-Five Chapters of the Jade Calendar Canon*.\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Way of the Three Ones is what immortals esteem. The world has not heard of it—guard it as a secret. Between the brows, one cun inward is the Hall of Light; two cun inward, the Grotto Chamber; three cun inward, the Muddy Pellet—this is the upper Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Red Child, styled Yuanxian, named Imperial Village. The heart is the Crimson Palace, the middle Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Perfected One, styled Zidan, named Radiant Firmness. Three cun inward from the navel is the Gate of Destiny, the lower Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Infant, styled Yuanyang, named Mysterious Valley. All are three cun in height, clad in red silk, red garments, and red shoes—these are the Three Ones. The upper wears purple, the middle red, the lower yellow, all in the form of infants. Below stands a golden bed and jade table, where one constantly stirs the essence with a golden furnace and jade spoon to nourish the upper, middle, and lower Ones—this should be visualized day and night. If you can attain long life, the Three Ones will be illuminated. If you can guard the One, the One will also guard you. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant ascends to become the Perfected One, and then the Red Child—this is the true One.\"\n\nHe further said: \"False ways nourish the form; the true Way nourishes the spirit. When spirit is true and the Dao is open, one can vanish or endure. Spirit can make the form fly or move mountains. Though the form becomes ashes and dust, it may yet be recognized. Ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are your lingering faults. The nose and mouth’s preferences, fragrances and flavors—these are your foes. The body is the root of vexation, pain, itching, cold, and warmth. The mind is the burden of form, sorrow, poison, and care. If you do not swiftly cast these off, your will and qi will daily diminish, your lifespan will not extend—this has been so for a long time. You must first diminish all desires, not let the mind wander. Dwell in quietude, contemplate in a purified chamber. Ten thousand scrolls of elixir texts are not equal to guarding the One. Always take emptiness as your body, nothingness as your heart. The body of nothingness, the heart of nothingness—this may be called guarding the spirit.\"\n\nGuarding the spirit achieves profound communion—this is called unity with the Dao. It is like towering mountains and vast marshes: though they do not desire insects, fish, birds, or beasts, these creatures naturally gather there. If one can embody emptiness and nothingness, though one does not seek the Dao, the Dao will come of itself.\n\nThen he transmitted the method of the Nine Refinements of the Golden Perfected of Great Yang, calling it the Nine Chambers of Visualization. The first is the visualization of no deviant thoughts; the second, the visualization of rectifying the body; the third, the visualization of attaining governance; the fourth, the visualization of great rectitude; the fifth, the visualization of ultimate rectitude; the sixth, the visualization of bodily rectitude; the seventh, the visualization of true rectitude; the eighth, the visualization of penetrating mystery; the ninth, the visualization of great penetration. Entering these nine chambers and practicing these nine visualizations, one unites in form with Great Yang and together ascends to the Dao.\n\nXi rejoiced, bowed deeply, and reverently received the mysterious teaching. Hastening to resign his office, he invited the Venerable Lord to return home, bowed again, and sought further instruction.\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"If you wish to cultivate the body and nurture nature, practice the Dao and discipline form, knit the black into spirit, and attain endless beginning and end, nothing precedes stillness. Thus, heaven is still to establish constancy, spirit is still to effect transformation, and man is still to attain life. When about to enter stillness, turn your hearing inward and observe within; let the heart not entertain reckless thoughts, the mouth not utter reckless words, the body not make reckless movements. The color of no-color becomes visible, the sound of no-sound becomes audible, the flavor of no-flavor becomes sweet, the teaching of no-words becomes instruction. The divine radiance descends, fortune and virtue arrive, and harmonious qi responds.\n\nIf you wish to still the spirit, first bathe and maintain purification for twenty-five days, then refine your body with precision until the hun and po are at peace—only then may you enter the chamber. After entering the chamber, perhaps a cinnabar serpent will come to rest upon your heart, or the Queen Mother of the West will descend, or a Dao-body will manifest—these are but the spirits within your body testing you. Do not be startled or afraid; if questioned, do not answer; if harmed or offended, do not fear. Simply settle the heart and stabilize the mind, and the entity will depart of itself.\n\nAfter twenty-five days, forty-five days, sixty days, eighty-five days, one hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days, one hundred and fifty days, and one hundred and eighty days, spirits will come—all are testing you. Simply settle the heart and do not respond; they cannot harm you. If you feel fear, you will fail the test and lose the Dao. Beware, beware!\n\nAfter one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will brighten of itself, and matters of safety and danger, life and death will all be foreknown; the palaces and courts within the body will each become clearly visible. After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses will be dispelled. After one year, scars and blemishes will vanish. After a thousand days, form and spirit will both attain subtlety, and you will become a Perfected One.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"I wander beyond heaven and earth, play in the spaces of profound darkness. There are the eight pillars of the cosmos, above and below without bound. If you wish to follow me, how could it be possible?\"\n\nXi said: \"I would enter fire, plunge into the abyss, descend into the earth, ascend to heaven, reduce my body to ashes, and forfeit my life—all to follow the Great Immortal.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"Those who attain the Dao can see with penetrating vision, hear with penetrating hearing, and perform transformations beyond measure, now hidden, now manifest—yet even they cannot follow me to distant realms. Though your bone-configuration accords with the Dao and you are destined to achieve perfection, you have received the Dao for but a short time and cannot yet commune with spirits. How could you perform transformations and follow my sacred body?\"\n\nXi bowed again and said: \"May I hear of the Dao of communing with spirits and performing transformations?\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"The black of the living, the forms of the embodied—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang delight in, is called birth when reckoned, death when named. Exhausting numbers and comprehending change, altering form and shifting lineage—this is called transformation, called illusion. The Creator’s craft is wondrous, its work profound, thus difficult to exhaust or end. The works of the embodied are shallow in foundation, thus rise and fade in an instant. Only when you know that the illusory and the created differ not from birth and death can you begin to grasp the Dao of transformation. If you can cultivate this Dao with precision and embody spontaneity, then I may journey with you to transform the myriad states.\"\n\nThereupon, he transmitted the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*. The Venerable Lord further exhorted him to cease distracting thoughts, still the heart, and guard the One. Having spoken, he rose into the void, seated upon a cloud of radiant blossoms. His face emitted the five luminances, his body shone with golden light, illuminating the ten directions. Slowly, he ascended into the heavens and departed.\n\nThe transmission of the immortal Dao by the Primordial Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden, the Most High Sagely Mother, concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "Knowing it is most easy, yet practicing it is supremely difficult. If you can enact it, you may endure forever—this Dao, once established, grants transcendence. Though I too have learned it, it is not innate.\n\nThe method of the golden fluid states:\nOne is the Mysterious White that gives birth to Metal Elder,\nThe sun’s flowing pearl enters the Flowery Pond.\nWithin the catty, five taels of patterned fern,\nRed salt and white snow form the male and female.\nFive Talismans and Nine Elixirs—attain these and ascend,\nYet the true Way lies here, unknown to men.\n\nThe Five Talismans are:\nFirst, Mysterious White;\nSecond, Metal Essence;\nThird, Flying Talisman;\nFourth, Golden Florescence;\nFifth, the Three-Five Azure Dragon Essence.\n\nThe Nine Elixirs are:\nFirst, White Snow Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSecond, Male-Female Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nThird, Golden Fluid Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nFourth, White Florescence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nFifth, Elixir Florescence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSixth, Five-Colors Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nSeventh, Clay Mercury Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nEighth, Metal Essence Nine-Turns Returning Elixir;\nNinth, Nine Cauldrons Ultimate Radiance Returning Elixir.\n\nOf these nine elixirs, attaining even one grants longevity, not through forced effort. The Way of the divine elixir undergoes three transformations and five turns, culminating at nine—those who ingest it become equal to me. All nine elixirs are paths to ascending to heaven. Yet among them, the golden fluid is supreme. Those who consume the nine elixirs may, after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, sixty days, thirty days, ten days, or three days, be welcomed by immortal officials with clouds and dragons. Only those who ingest the golden fluid, upon taking it, turn their bodies the color of purple gold, instantly grow feathered wings, and ascend to become immortal officials. Yet one must first maintain a long fast and abstain from grains for a year before partaking. Without celestial records or an undying name, one shall never hear of the Way of the Nine Elixirs and golden fluid. Its method follows the prior elixir-compounding: once the gold is formed, it is liquified, and the Way is complete—this is my secret treasure.\n\nLord Lao transmitted the Dao to Yin Xi, saying: \"The great Dao upholds its three grades as principle, takes the One as measure, and rectitude as virtue. If you can know the One, all matters are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the secluded chamber, refine gold and consume the Black—this is foremost. If you can know it, guard it and do not lose it.\"\n\nHe further said: \"The Most Perfect Supreme Thearchs all attained the Dao through the golden elixir, treading the nine depths to enter the boundless dark, ascending and descending through the void and origin, rising together with the divine luminaries.\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Way of refining gold and consuming the Black is the essence of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang—it is called the Two Blacks. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the liquid of wood and the essence of metal, when their two qi converge and are refined, form what is called the outer elixir. Containing harmony and refining the hidden, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending into the Muddy Pellet, descending to the Cinnabar Field, circulating without cease, arriving at the Crimson Palace, gathering from the five minerals to nourish the hundred spirits—this is the inner elixir. Those who cultivate the Dao by containing harmony and refining the Black, if they attain the inner elixir, may extend their years. If they attain the outer elixir, they may ascend to heaven. The Three Ones and Nine Contemplations are the essence of inner cultivation. The Nine Elixirs and golden fluid are the pinnacle of the outer elixir. Cultivating both together, the Dao is perfected.\"\n\nThe Oral Formula for Consuming the Black states:\nConsume the Black to secure essence,\nReceive the Mysterious Canon of Illumination.\nThe essential subtleties of the living Way,\nEmerging from darkness, entering the obscure.\nAbove, secure the Cloud Gate;\nBelow, secure the numinous root.\nKnowing it is most easy,\nPracticing it is supremely difficult.\n\nWhen the form moves, virtue scatters;\nWhen qi strays, the Dao rebels.\nEssence dissipates, the hun is harmed,\nThe eyes stir, the po is disordered.\nThus the sage stills the form and secures the Black,\nAccumulates essence and receives vision—\nThen virtue and Dao congeal in emptiness,\nHun and po are firmly guarded,\nForm unites, spirit flourishes,\nAnd the Dao is accomplished.\n\nAlways after midnight,\nLie supine, clench the fists,\nDraw in pure qi through the nose,\nExhale slowly through the mouth.\nAgain guard the Three Ones,\nEnter the chamber and contemplate the Nine.\nWhen spirit is settled and qi is calm,\nThe immortal Way draws near.\n\nHe then transmitted to Xi the *Thirty-Five Chapters of the Jade Calendar Canon*.\n\nLord Lao said: \"The Way of the Three Ones is what immortals esteem. The world has not heard of it—guard it as a secret. Between the brows, one cun inward is the Hall of Light; two cun inward, the Grotto Chamber; three cun inward, the Muddy Pellet—this is the upper Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Red Child, styled Yuanxian, named Imperial Village. The heart is the Crimson Palace, the middle Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Perfected One, styled Zidan, named Radiant Firmness. Three cun inward from the navel is the Gate of Destiny, the lower Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Infant, styled Yuanyang, named Mysterious Valley. All are three cun in height, clad in red silk, red garments, and red shoes—these are the Three Ones. The upper wears purple, the middle red, the lower yellow, all in the form of infants. Below stands a golden bed and jade table, where one constantly stirs the essence with a golden furnace and jade spoon to nourish the upper, middle, and lower Ones—this should be visualized day and night. If you can attain long life, the Three Ones will be illuminated. If you can guard the One, the One will also guard you. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant ascends to become the Perfected One, and then the Red Child—this is the true One.\"\n\nHe further said: \"False ways nourish the form; the true Way nourishes the spirit. When spirit is true and the Dao is open, one can vanish or endure. Spirit can make the form fly or move mountains. Though the form becomes ashes and dust, it may yet be recognized. Ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are your lingering faults. The nose and mouth’s preferences, fragrances and flavors—these are your foes. The body is the root of vexation, pain, itching, cold, and warmth. The mind is the burden of form, sorrow, poison, and care. If you do not swiftly cast these off, your will and qi will daily diminish, your lifespan will not extend—this has been so for a long time. You must first diminish all desires, not let the mind wander. Dwell in quietude, contemplate in a purified chamber. Ten thousand scrolls of elixir texts are not equal to guarding the One. Always take emptiness as your body, nothingness as your heart. The body of nothingness, the heart of nothingness—this may be called guarding the spirit.\"",

The essence of longevity lies in the divine elixir.\"",

      "translated_text": "Guarding the spirit achieves profound communion—this is called unity with the Dao. It is like towering mountains and vast marshes: though they do not desire insects, fish, birds, or beasts, these creatures naturally gather there. If one can embody emptiness and nothingness, though one does not seek the Dao, the Dao will come of itself.\n\nThen he transmitted the method of the Nine Refinements of the Golden Perfected of Great Yang, calling it the Nine Chambers of Visualization. The first is the visualization of no deviant thoughts; the second, the visualization of rectifying the body; the third, the visualization of attaining governance; the fourth, the visualization of great rectitude; the fifth, the visualization of ultimate rectitude; the sixth, the visualization of bodily rectitude; the seventh, the visualization of true rectitude; the eighth, the visualization of penetrating mystery; the ninth, the visualization of great penetration. Entering these nine chambers and practicing these nine visualizations, one unites in form with Great Yang and together ascends to the Dao.\n\nXi rejoiced, bowed deeply, and reverently received the mysterious teaching. Hastening to resign his office, he invited the Venerable Lord to return home, bowed again, and sought further instruction.\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"If you wish to cultivate the body and nurture nature, practice the Dao and discipline form, knit the black into spirit, and attain endless beginning and end, nothing precedes stillness. Thus, heaven is still to establish constancy, spirit is still to effect transformation, and man is still to attain life. When about to enter stillness, turn your hearing inward and observe within; let the heart not entertain reckless thoughts, the mouth not utter reckless words, the body not make reckless movements. The color of no-color becomes visible, the sound of no-sound becomes audible, the flavor of no-flavor becomes sweet, the teaching of no-words becomes instruction. The divine radiance descends, fortune and virtue arrive, and harmonious qi responds.\n\nIf you wish to still the spirit, first bathe and maintain purification for twenty-five days, then refine your body with precision until the hun and po are at peace—only then may you enter the chamber. After entering the chamber, perhaps a cinnabar serpent will come to rest upon your heart, or the Queen Mother of the West will descend, or a Dao-body will manifest—these are but the spirits within your body testing you. Do not be startled or afraid; if questioned, do not answer; if harmed or offended, do not fear. Simply settle the heart and stabilize the mind, and the entity will depart of itself.\n\nAfter twenty-five days, forty-five days, sixty days, eighty-five days, one hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days, one hundred and fifty days, and one hundred and eighty days, spirits will come—all are testing you. Simply settle the heart and do not respond; they cannot harm you. If you feel fear, you will fail the test and lose the Dao. Beware, beware!\n\nAfter one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will brighten of itself, and matters of safety and danger, life and death will all be foreknown; the palaces and courts within the body will each become clearly visible. After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses will be dispelled. After one year, scars and blemishes will vanish. After a thousand days, form and spirit will both attain subtlety, and you will become a Perfected One.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"I wander beyond heaven and earth, play in the spaces of profound darkness. There are the eight pillars of the cosmos, above and below without bound. If you wish to follow me, how could it be possible?\"\n\nXi said: \"I would enter fire, plunge into the abyss, descend into the earth, ascend to heaven, reduce my body to ashes, and forfeit my life—all to follow the Great Immortal.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"Those who attain the Dao can see with penetrating vision, hear with penetrating hearing, and perform transformations beyond measure, now hidden, now manifest—yet even they cannot follow me to distant realms. Though your bone-configuration accords with the Dao and you are destined to achieve perfection, you have received the Dao for but a short time and cannot yet commune with spirits. How could you perform transformations and follow my sacred body?\"\n\nXi bowed again and said: \"May I hear of the Dao of communing with spirits and performing transformations?\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"The black of the living, the forms of the embodied—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang delight in, is called birth when reckoned, death when named. Exhausting numbers and comprehending change, altering form and shifting lineage—this is called transformation, called illusion. The Creator’s craft is wondrous, its work profound, thus difficult to exhaust or end. The works of the embodied are shallow in foundation, thus rise and fade in an instant. Only when you know that the illusory and the created differ not from birth and death can you begin to grasp the Dao of transformation. If you can cultivate this Dao with precision and embody spontaneity, then I may journey with you to transform the myriad states.\"\n\nThereupon, he transmitted the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*. The Venerable Lord further exhorted him to cease distracting thoughts, still the heart, and guard the One. Having spoken, he rose into the void, seated upon a cloud of radiant blossoms. His face emitted the five luminances, his body shone with golden light, illuminating the ten directions. Slowly, he ascended into the heavens and departed.\n\nThe transmission of the immortal Dao by the Primordial Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden, the Most High Sagely Mother, concludes here.",
