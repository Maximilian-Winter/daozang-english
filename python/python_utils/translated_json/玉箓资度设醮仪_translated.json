May the supreme, perfected Dao-qi, the numinous treasure of wisdom’s radiance, descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and all present, that the sincerity of this servant’s entreaty may swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Perfected and Boundless Great Dao of the Three Clarities, the Most High Sagely Ones; the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven; the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Azure Mystery Emperor; the Supreme Lord of the Dao; the Celestial August Emperor of Purple Tenuity; the Celestial August Emperor of the Northern Culmen; the August Earth Spirit of the Rear Land; the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Radiant and Origin-Preserving Emperor; the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions who respond and transform to deliver from suffering; the Divine Emperor Who Gives Birth to the Gods of the Nine Heavens; the Divine Emperors of the Thirty-Two Heavens; the Divine Emperors of the Five Numinous Ones and Five Elders; the Stellar Lords of the Eleven Luminaries of the Upper Clarity and the Twenty-Eight Constellations; the August Emperors of the Three Origins and Three Officials; the Four Sagely Perfected Lords of the Northern Culmen; the Perfected Lords of the Dao of the Nine Palaces of the Northern Culmen; the Perfected Lords of the Three Departments of the Supreme Mystery’s Pivotal Mechanism; the Perfected Lords of the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure; the True Governors of the Heavenly Bureaus of the Nine Heavens and all their Perfected Lords; the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Perfected Who Deliver from Suffering; the Greatly Compassionate, Greatly Merciful, and Greatly Benevolent Perfected; the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct; the Perfected Who Liberate through the Dharma; the Transcendent Officials who govern the Azure Register of the Mysterious Origin’s Yellow Register Court within the Great One’s Mysterious Birth Palace; the Transcendent Spirits of the Nine Offices of the Yellow Register; the Transcendent and Perfected Spirits of Universal Salvation of the Nine Heavens; the True Governors of the Three Origins, Three Officials, and Nine Palaces; the Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts and Five Emperors; the Perfected Masters and Teachers of the Ancestral Mystery; the Sacred Emperors of the Five Heavens; the Perfected of the Lineage’s Scriptures and Registers Who Confer Liberation; the August Emperor of the Northern Darkness and Fengdu; the Divine Spirits who govern the Six Caverns, Ten Palaces, Nine Dark Paths of the Underworld; the Divine Multitudes of the Capital’s City Gods and all temples; and all the Perfected Spirits of the Three Realms who respond to invocation.\n\nThis servant has heard that when the Crimson Clarity unfolded the chart, the primordial qi dispersed the essence of the vast primeval chaos; when the Azure Florescence ascended the throne, the divine radiance bestowed the essence of the undifferentiated.\n\nHolding the azure canopy to receive the pure and subtle, descending upon the yellow chariot to revive the northern gloom. The numinous winds stir and dance, their majestic power pervading the ten directions; the sweet dew suffuses and moistens, their wisdom-force perfectly penetrating the three realms. They congeal the auspicious signs of purple gold, feasting in the jade-green precincts of blessings. The Two Bureaus link like clouds, the Nine Offices array like stars. Responding to voices and hastening to resonance, their compassion unfolds subtleties within the fragrant groves; manifesting transformations and dividing bodies, their virtue and power congeal the mysterious within the soaring trees. Heavenly beings and humans submit in reverence, the hidden and manifest incline their hearts.\n\nWe, your servants, with a single thought cast forth in devotion, our five bodies stilled to emptiness, perform the Daoist rites and observe the fast—already we have received the boundless grace of the vast and primordial. Gazing toward heaven and beholding the sacred, we exhaust the sincerity of ants and crickets. Unable to bind grasses to express our devotion, we humbly gather the floating duckweed as offering.\n\nWe humbly pray that dragon banners and kingfisher plumes may adorn the ethereal void with celestial splendor; that phoenix canopies and pearl standards may embrace the divine radiance within the azure firmament. May the clear processional still the lion-headed chariot, and the yellow pennants solemnize the dust of the leopard-tailed escort. On this day of tenfold brilliance, may the four-horse team arrive upon the winds where clouds merge with light; may the rosy clouds of the three realms draw near, their steeds circling as water and moon intermingle in radiance. Do not forget this private resonance of response, but fully answer the earnestness of our prayers.\n\nWe, your servants, can scarcely contain our fervent longing as we gaze toward heaven and behold the sacred. Together with the assembled Perfected at the ritual, we first perform the invocation. Descend, two ranks of Perfected, together with the assembled Perfected of the ritual—Perfected of the Three Realms, sacred hosts of the ritual altar. We now humbly extend our invitation, trusting you will deign to grace us with your presence. We beseech each to array yourselves in the immortal ranks and together reverently welcome the imperial advent.\n\nDescend, Nine Consorts:\nThe simurgh chariot arrives, the crane carriage approaches the hall. Together with the assembled Perfected of the ritual, proceed with the ceremonial audience.\n\nWhen the audience is complete, we invite you to ascend the ritual throne. The ritual officers present incense, and wine is offered in the first libation.\n\n*Scattering Flowers* is performed.\n\nReverently invoking the sacred ranks:\nWe, your servants, [Name] and the assembled altar officials, with united sincerity, humbly address the Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Perfected Immortals of the Three Realms, and the boundless sacred multitudes.\n\nWe have heard that the cloud-layers array the sacred hosts, where the azure groves congeal the blossoms of primordial qi; that the windy marshes teem with countless beings, where the black ramparts gather the veils of deluded clouds. They encompass the Six Heavens’ hidden bureaus and array the divine realms of the Nine Earths. They govern the offices of yin and yang, wield authority over water and fire. Were it not for their boundless spreading of auspicious clouds, who would dispel the dark mists of ignorance? May they grant the feasting upon jade mushrooms, the eternal transcendence of golden grains. We aspire to the divine works across kalpas, and look up to the power of vows in the central heavens. With the reverence of tigers bowing and the fervor of phoenixes gazing, we are stirred to utmost devotion.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently receive the sacred edicts, uphold the jade registers, and dedicate this rite to [Name]’s spirit, thereby increasing heavenly blessings and enabling the attainment of the Dao’s truth. Without invoking the wondrous and solemn, how could the divine ascend to the celestial heights? We solemnly prepare the mushroom altar for the audience, relying upon the lotus throne to make our offerings. We purify ourselves and confess our transgressions, concentrating our minds to seek blessings. Should we indeed receive the grace of ascending to Perfection, we would especially unfold the merit of verifying ranks. Knowing gratitude, we repay gratitude, and shall exhaust our sincerity in jade offerings; the supremely virtuous do not claim virtue, so how could we presume upon pearl ornaments? We are ashamed of our meager offerings, yet venture to present these humble plants.\n\nWe now present the blue memorial, which we respectfully proclaim.\n\nThe words of the memorial are fully set forth, and the profound intentions are clearly perceived. We humbly pray that you, in your condescension, will not overlook the lowly, but pour forth the red grace of beneficent dew; that in your majestic presence above, you will avert the dark decrees of official judgment like wind and thunder. May the myriad sages partake in due season, and the thousand Perfected daily witness our devotion. Though our prayers are as humble as ants, we sincerely offer our profound gratitude.\n\nWe, your servants, now present the second libation.\n\nWe reverently address the Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Perfected Immortals of the Three Realms, and the boundless sacred multitudes.\n\nWe have heard that the vastness of the Great Canopy congeals the wondrous qi of the ninefold brilliance; that in every mote of dust across the lands, the Dharma-body manifests through the three times. The compassionate clouds spread eastward from the mysterious truth, the sacred sun ascends to honor the Primordial Beginning. The jade rays shine afar, expanding the flowery canopy to embrace the six directions; the golden radiance revolves and flies, descending upon Kunlun to illumine the nine dark realms. They scatter the seeds of empty azure, pour forth the essence of deep jasper. Wondrous is the mysterious mechanism, vast is the supreme transformation. To all who take refuge and make requests, they grant aid without exception.\n\nOn behalf of [Name]’s spirit, we humbly pray that the five spirits may become crystalline as ice, and the myriad qi ripple with clarity. May the mind swiftly awaken before the first brushstroke, and the nature suddenly realize the beginning of the nameless. May the luminous pearl still shine, reflecting the vast sea to embrace emptiness; may the solitary brightness of the jade toad appear in the azure heavens, radiating its splendor. May they stride high upon the green rosy clouds, and dwell in the purple ultimate’s court. May the jade-green talismans receive their countenance, attending the crimson perfection in eternal joy; may the golden mushrooms adorn their steps, congealing the blue mists in the square vessels.\n\nWe further pray that the cosmos may be covered in pure tranquility, its radiance resplendent. May the mountain spirits offer blessings, and the river lords present auspices. May the three agricultural seasons flourish in abundance, with mulberry and hemp nourished by timely rains; may the four borders enjoy profound peace, with elm and willow basking in spring’s leisure. May there be no fear of forests burned or marshes drained, but only the joy of leaping from heaven and diving into the deep. May the three paths and five sufferings all dance in the land of blessings; may the four seas and nine provinces all rejoice in the realm of longevity. May the imperial domain stand forever firm, and the ancestral altars flourish in peace.\n\nWe, your servants, offer our reverence and present the third libation.\n\nFor the ritual proceedings:\nWe reverently address the Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Perfected Immortals of the Three Realms, and the boundless sacred multitudes.\n\nWe have heard that the heavens revolve in color, the celestial abyss congeals, embracing square and round to illuminate all; they draw near to those with virtue, and bestow upon those with the Dao, unfolding the warp and weft to circulate everywhere. We bow low with utmost reverence, and look up to the towering great creation. May the light shine down to aid us, hoping to honor our modest efforts; may your swift joy and sudden pardon forgive the stains of our ascending steps.\n\nNow that we have fully performed the rites and completed the offerings, the orchid incense withdraws the phoenix censer’s splendor, and the lotus torches dim the dragon vat’s embers. Gazing ahead at the kingfisher plumes, they are about to return their light to the jade heavens; looking back at the pearl banners, they have already turned their radiance toward the jeweled ultimate. The moon-drawn teams meander in graceful procession, the cloud-dragons sway and soar on high. The myriad sages return to their ranks, the thousand Perfected resume their positions.\n\nAs the primordial assembly gathers the Dao, the hundred spirits merge within the mud-pill; entering subtlety to congeal the true, the ten thousand qi form a void circle in the mysterious transformation. Our humble hearts below cannot bear the depth of longing and attachment.\n\nWith utmost reverence, we bow our heads to the ground and take leave of the sacred presence.\n\n*Returning Carriage Hymn*\n*Preserving Spirit and Burning Incense*\n\nIncense Official Messenger, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Incense Spirits: may this place where we have set up the jiao rites and performed morning devotions naturally give rise to golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.\n\nMay the hundred numinous Perfected gather here before the incense burner. We pray that the jiao rites be perfectly fulfilled, and that boundless blessings spread far and wide.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid incense, and swiftly convey the sincerity of our supplications to the Most High and Perfect Dao of the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, and the Merciful Lord of the Eastern Ultimate and Azure Mystery before the Dao.\n\n*Precious Flower, Perfectly Fulfilled Heavenly Worthy*\n*Sending Forth the Sages*\n*Transforming Offerings*\n*As Before*\n*Dedication*\n\nThe rites of the jiao for the deliverance of souls through the jade register are now complete.",

With the reverence of tigers bowing and the fervor of phoenixes gazing, we are stirred to utmost devotion.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently receive the sacred edicts, uphold the jade registers, and dedicate this rite to [Name]’s spirit, thereby increasing heavenly blessings and enabling the attainment of the Dao’s truth. Without invoking the wondrous and solemn, how could the divine ascend to the celestial heights? We solemnly prepare the mushroom altar for the audience, relying upon the lotus throne to make our offerings. We purify ourselves and confess our transgressions, concentrating our minds to seek blessings. Should we indeed receive the grace of ascending to Perfection, we would especially unfold the merit of verifying ranks. Knowing gratitude, we repay gratitude, and shall exhaust our sincerity in jade offerings; the supremely virtuous do not claim virtue, so how could we presume upon pearl ornaments? We are ashamed of our meager offerings, yet venture to present these humble plants.\n\nWe now present the blue memorial, which we respectfully proclaim.\n\nThe words of the memorial are fully set forth, and the profound intentions are clearly perceived. We humbly pray that you, in your condescension, will not overlook the lowly, but pour forth the red grace of beneficent dew; that in your majestic presence above, you will avert the dark decrees of official judgment like wind and thunder. May the myriad sages partake in due season, and the thousand Perfected daily witness our devotion. Though our prayers are as humble as ants, we sincerely offer our profound gratitude.\n\nWe, your servants, now present the second libation.\n\nWe reverently address the Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Perfected Immortals of the Three Realms, and the boundless sacred multitudes.\n\nWe have heard that the vastness of the Great Canopy congeals the wondrous qi of the ninefold brilliance; that in every mote of dust across the lands, the Dharma-body manifests through the three times. The compassionate clouds spread eastward from the mysterious truth, the sacred sun ascends to honor the Primordial Beginning. The jade rays shine afar, expanding the flowery canopy to embrace the six directions; the golden radiance revolves and flies, descending upon Kunlun to illumine the nine dark realms. They scatter the seeds of empty azure, pour forth the essence of deep jasper. Wondrous is the mysterious mechanism, vast is the supreme transformation. To all who take refuge and make requests, they grant aid without exception.\n\nOn behalf of [Name]’s spirit, we humbly pray that the five spirits may become crystalline as ice, and the myriad qi ripple with clarity. May the mind swiftly awaken before the first brushstroke, and the nature suddenly realize the beginning of the nameless. May the luminous pearl still shine, reflecting the vast sea to embrace emptiness; may the solitary brightness of the jade toad appear in the azure heavens, radiating its splendor. May they stride high upon the green rosy clouds, and dwell in the purple ultimate’s court. May the jade-green talismans receive their countenance, attending the crimson perfection in eternal joy; may the golden mushrooms adorn their steps, congealing the blue mists in the square vessels.\n\nWe further pray that the cosmos may be covered in pure tranquility, its radiance resplendent. May the mountain spirits offer blessings, and the river lords present auspices. May the three agricultural seasons flourish in abundance, with mulberry and hemp nourished by timely rains; may the four borders enjoy profound peace, with elm and willow basking in spring’s leisure. May there be no fear of forests burned or marshes drained, but only the joy of leaping from heaven and diving into the deep. May the three paths and five sufferings all dance in the land of blessings; may the four seas and nine provinces all rejoice in the realm of longevity. May the imperial domain stand forever firm, and the ancestral altars flourish in peace.\n\nWe, your servants, offer our reverence and present the third libation.\n\nFor the ritual proceedings:\nWe reverently address the Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Perfected Immortals of the Three Realms, and the boundless sacred multitudes.\n\nWe have heard that the heavens revolve in color, the celestial abyss congeals, embracing square and round to illuminate all; they draw near to those with virtue, and bestow upon those with the Dao, unfolding the warp and weft to circulate everywhere. We bow low with utmost reverence, and look up to the towering great creation. May the light shine down to aid us, hoping to honor our modest efforts; may your swift joy and sudden pardon forgive the stains of our ascending steps.\n\nNow that we have fully performed the rites and completed the offerings, the orchid incense withdraws the phoenix censer’s splendor, and the lotus torches dim the dragon vat’s embers. Gazing ahead at the kingfisher plumes, they are about to return their light to the jade heavens; looking back at the pearl banners, they have already turned their radiance toward the jeweled ultimate. The moon-drawn teams meander in graceful procession, the cloud-dragons sway and soar on high. The myriad sages return to their ranks, the thousand Perfected resume their positions.",
