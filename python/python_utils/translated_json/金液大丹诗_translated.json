Section.\n\n---\n\n**Gold Elixir Great Elixir Poem**\n\nOne substance born of Heaven-Earth,\nTwo polarities nurture the medicinal root—\nYin-essence merges with Earth’s spirit,\nYang-qi emanates from Heaven’s soul.\n\nTransformed as a tiger, it treads the Golden Path,\nAs a dragon, it hides within the Wooden Gate.\nSolar essence refines the lunar shadow,\nCounted steps secure it at Kunlun’s peak.\n\nTrue Water submits to True Fire,\nFire’s perfection forges noble gold,\nGold’s perfection fells the Wood and transforms,\nReturning to Earth, it earns reverence.\n\nSun and Moon refine yin and yang,\nWind and Clouds ensnare Dragon and Tiger.\nThree cycles, four and five complete,\nTranscending the world’s rise and fall.\n\nCreation long submerged in flux,\nMust cast off life’s decayed husk—\nRed lead weighs heavy in Heaven’s realm,\nWhite mercury stands apart in Dao’s gate.\n\nInheriting qi, the divine Dragon-Tiger,\nFormed, the Dao’s husband and wife.\nYin-yang’s True Water and Fire,\nRefined, they ascend to the Celestial Capital.\n\nNine transformations govern the three essences,\nTrue-hearted refinement is no hardship—\nThe Tiger’s birth yields fierce divine water,\nThe Dragon’s change produces saintly gold.\n\nGold and Wood’s affinity unites the body,\nHeaven-Earth forge the Great Elixir.\nThe Five Phases’ essence enters the abdomen,\nAscending the Nine-Heaven Altar.\n\nMen know lead’s thousand-day alchemy,\nTrue mercury binds itself—\nThree autumns’ cultivation complete,\nBoiled, it becomes the Tiger’s peak.\n\nDragon’s might subdues the Tiger’s crouch,\nThe Tiger’s ferocity tames the Dragon’s repose—\nLife’s transformation opens the Victorious Gate,\nDivine Elixir emerges in Mysterious Play.\n\nOne substance harmonizes with Heaven’s span,\nNine returns, seven illuminations—\nChase lead, yet it eludes,\nPursue mercury, it vanishes aloft.\n\nTransformed as Tiger, it submerges in the Spring,\nAs Dragon, it hides in Fire’s treasure.\nDivine clarity penetrates the Great Dao,\nRefined, it crowns the King of Medicines.\n\nRecognizing Wood’s vital essence,\nWorthy of planting on the pool’s brink—\nBalanced, it divides the Fire’s flame,\nHarvesting noble gold’s bloom.\n\nThe Tiger’s fierce light is gathered,\nThe Dragon’s lightning flashes—\nAt once, the Saintly Dao is realized,\nA thousand days refine the morning’s glow.\n\nDiscussing lead yet not knowing lead,\nHow can one grasp the profound principle?\nThe Green Dragon does not rise and fall,\nThe White Tiger hides in repose.\n\nDarkly merging with True Qi,\nClearly sensing the High Immortal—\nCultivation’s power is vast,\nCompletion reveals Heaven’s intent.\n\nThe *Ren-Gui* Great Elixir Pool,\n*Bing-Ding* as the True Medicine’s foundation,\n*Geng-Xin* births the Tiger’s might,\n*Jia-Yi* radiates the Dragon’s awe.\n\nSun and Moon enhance their splendor,\nYin and Yang exchange their robes—\nImmortal transmission of Fire’s timing,\n*Wu-Ji* wears the flying man’s crown.\n\nReflecting the Inner Five Phases,\nContracting Earth, harmonizing with Heaven,\nTransforming the Tiger into a Golden Body,\nGiving birth to the Dragon in Wooden Form.\n\nThree Flowers refine by nodes,\nOne substance wraps the boundary script—\nAfter seven returns and nine transformations,\nTranscending the mundane, entering the Saintly Spirit.\n\nClarifying the Great Elixir’s core,\nSeek within the mercury’s depths—\nThe Eastern Dragon meets its fate,\nThe Western Tiger pays homage.\n\nAffinity and nature blend in harmony,\nContaining breath, profound and deep—\nRefined, it becomes the True One Qi,\nTranscending the world, free from rise and fall.\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless in origin,\nThe Soul Elixir reveals its operation—\nHeaven-Earth open the Sacred Thing,\nDragon and Tiger birth the Divine.\n\nWater and Fire’s True Primordial Qi,\nYin and Yang refine the Solar Essence—\nThe Moon’s thirty-six revolutions,\nResplendent, granting eternal life.\n\nOne is True Water,\nThree open the Immortal Path—\nFour bloom the Flower of Days,\nTwo refine the Spirit-Soul.\n\nFive hues manifest the Yang Qi,\nNine returns, the Elixir ascends from dust—\nCirculating the Twelve Seasons’ script,\nLife’s transformation lifts the body aloft.\n\nLead and Mercury’s Great Elixir Lord,\nTrue Persons unite as one—\nHeaven-Earth nurture the numinous Qi,\nDragon and Tiger split the Primordial Purity.\n\nFive hues shine with clarity,\nThree essences’ natures divide—\nAfter nine transformations’ refinement,\nThe dwelling is abandoned, ascending to Azure Clouds.\n\nThe enlightened observe further,\nReturning Elixirs in five forms—\nImmortal hands personally refine,\nMortals transmit with devoted hearts.\n\nSeeking the Tiger from a master’s guidance,\nKnowing the Dragon through Dao’s scrutiny—\nThree winters, the Martial and Civil turn,\nLight illuminates the Nine-Heaven’s chill.\n\nDivine Water irrigates the Flower Pool,\nKnowing the interplay of presence and absence—\nGreen Dragon merges with the Tiger’s body,\nWhite Tiger absorbs the Dragon’s fat.\n\nTwo substances communicate the Sacred,\nThree essences blend in resplendent ritual—\nA thousand days refine the Flower,\nCompleted, it honors Heaven’s timing.\n\nEntering the Dao, one must know its non-duality,\nWith a pure heart, discerning the subtle—\nName and form granted in the Immortal Realm,\nLead and Mercury return to the Sacred.\n\nDragon and Tiger’s Returning Elixir’s root,\nHusband and wife symbolize the medicinal foundation—\nYin and Yang’s division holds the secret key,\nFew awaken to its profound truth.\n\nA substance that ensnares the mind,\nImmortal sages explore its depths—\nThe Fire Dragon sheds its Water shell,\nThe Water Tiger erects its Golden Spleen.\n\nTransformed as Tiger, it becomes the True Groom,\nSummoning the Dragon, it establishes the Saintly Bride—\nTheir union births the Great Dao,\nInviting them to the Nine-Function Chamber.\n\nThe Dao opens, aligning Heaven and Earth,\nNo mortal can glimpse the Immortal Path—\nLead and Mercury clearly

autumn,\nHeaven-Earth’s midst is good for cultivation—\nCompletion yields the world-transcending medicine,\nAfter ingestion, one attains Heaven’s roaming.\n\nYang-refinement gathers the born Soul,\nYin-dissolution scatters the dispersed Spirit—\nDragging the Dragon, devouring the Tiger,\nTwo substances flow in Sacred Communion.\n\nThe Dao is sought before one’s eyes,\nGolden sprouts are not grasped in search—\nThe Golden Mountain opens the Tiger’s Valley,\nWooden Water washes the Dragon’s jaws.\n\nYang-qi, the Dragon’s breath, exhales,\nYin-wind, the Tiger’s inhalation—\nDivine Flame burns the Sacred Water,\nThe Elixir ascends, soaring the Nine-Heavens.\n\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger study,\nLead and Mercury unite as kin—\nMale and female share affinity,\nHusband and wife radiate

sacred power converges—\nTwenty-seven adjustments perfected,\nOne’s name is already inscribed in the Immortal Register.\n\nThough Lead and Mercury are oft-heard of,\nFew grasp their profound mysteries—\nRed Lead emerges from Black Elixir,\nWhite Mercury enters, light as Yellow.\n\nDragon and Tiger generate Golden Marrow,\nRoom (chamber) and Parameter (bedchamber) refine Wooden Essence—\nA

complete,\nThe Purple Wanderer’s light shines upon mortals.\n\nMother’s essence, child’s transformation, is *Wēng*,\nThe Metal’s essence, Wood’s family, is *Róng*—\nIn two years, the hue returns,\nIn one breath, the sun’s red is seized.\n\nDissolving the Yin, the Dao is perfected,\nRefining the *qi*, the Spirit’s passage is achieved—\nThe *Huan* of the True Elixir is named,\nLong life ascends through the Azure void.\n\nThere is a hidden thing, its true name unknown,\nBorn of the Heaven-Earth’s sacred breath—\nThe Sun’s palace transmits *bone-qi*,\nThe Moon’s cavern nurtures the body’s form—\nRefining the Yang soul is correct,\nDispelling the Yin shadow is done.\n\n*Bǐng-Dīng*’s martial and civil are severed,\nOne grain suffices to cross the Three Pure Ones.\n\nThe Great Dao is not

transformation,\nNaming the Dragon with Mercury’s proclamation—\nRefining with Sun and Moon’s full measure,\nOnly then does one enter the Immortal Garden.\n\nWhat is the logic of the Supreme Medicine?\nRefining the Yin to birth the Yang—\nNow dividing the South-North paths,\nThe East-West chambers are made right.\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger lie in breath,\nThe *Fáng Cān* hosts unseen guidance—\nNine returns, seven refineries,\nThe body surges, soaring aloft.\n\nThe spirit-sprout’s water has feeling,\nChanging water earns the name *Qiáng*—\nAutumn harvests the Metal’s marrow,\nSpring stores the Wood’s inner essence.\n\nFrom *Kūn*’s passage, refining Purple,\nEntering the Sage, the Yellow is lightened—\n*Wù-Jǐ* sits in the Central Palace,\nMutual aid ascends to the Upper Pure.\n\nSitting in the world’s elixir’s mystery,\nLife begins from Heaven-Earth’s Lead—\nYin and Yang produce Dragon and Tiger,\nMetal and Wood forge the Elixir Field.\n\nAdvance and retreat in the Three Blooms’ secrecy,\nBalancing the Two *qi*’s rotation—\nFrom the void, refining yields the full,\nChanging bones, the Sage’s path is true.\n\nBlack Mercury births White Mercury,\nFrom *Mēng*

twenty-seven cycles,\nThe Elixir’s power reaches the Spirit’s passage.\n\nThere is a thing of the Supreme Yin’s essence,\nOnly *Kūn*’s dew bears its true name—\nThe Three Refineries align the True Path,\nThe Five Colors grow ever distinct.\n\nThe Tiger lies, the Sage refines,\nThe Dragon is roasted in Sun and Moon’s broth—\nUniting the cycles of the scriptures,\nThe body’s Sage transcends mortal emotion.\n\nLead and Mercury’s names are far-reaching,\nFrom the True, Water-Fire is born—\nThe Yellow is lightened, producing White Mercury,\nWhite Mercury transforms into Yellow’s lightness.\n\nThe Two Essences harmonize as one,\nA single person cannot follow both—\nNine Yangs refine to reveal the True,\nThe Fire’s end, all Immortals welcome.\n\nYellow Lead returns to Black

Section.\n\n---\n\n**Gold Elixir Great Elixir Poem**\n\nOne substance born of Heaven-Earth,\nTwo polarities nurture the medicinal root—\nYin-essence merges with Earth’s spirit,\nYang-qi emanates from Heaven’s soul.\n\nTransformed as a tiger, it treads the Golden Path,\nAs a dragon, it hides within the Wooden Gate.\nSolar essence refines the lunar shadow,\nCounted steps secure it at Kunlun’s peak.\n\nTrue Water submits to True Fire,\nFire’s perfection forges noble gold,\nGold’s perfection fells the Wood and transforms,\nReturning to Earth, it earns reverence.\n\nSun and Moon refine yin and yang,\nWind and Clouds ensnare Dragon and Tiger.\nThree cycles, four and five complete,\nTranscending the world’s rise and fall.\n\nCreation long submerged in flux,\nMust cast off life’s decayed husk—\nRed lead weighs heavy in Heaven’s realm,\nWhite mercury stands apart in Dao’s gate.\n\nInheriting qi, the divine Dragon-Tiger,\nFormed, the Dao’s husband and wife.\nYin-yang’s True Water and Fire,\nRefined, they ascend to the Celestial Capital.\n\nNine transformations govern the three essences,\nTrue-hearted refinement is no hardship—\nThe Tiger’s birth yields fierce divine water,\nThe Dragon’s change produces saintly gold.\n\nGold and Wood’s affinity unites the body,\nHeaven-Earth forge the Great Elixir.\nThe Five Phases’ essence enters the abdomen,\nAscending the Nine-Heaven Altar.\n\nMen know lead’s thousand-day alchemy,\nTrue mercury binds itself—\nThree autumns’ cultivation complete,\nBoiled, it becomes the Tiger’s peak.\n\nDragon’s might subdues the Tiger’s crouch,\nThe Tiger’s ferocity tames the Dragon’s repose—\nLife’s transformation opens the Victorious Gate,\nDivine Elixir emerges in Mysterious Play.\n\nOne substance harmonizes with Heaven’s span,\nNine returns, seven illuminations—\nChase lead, yet it eludes,\nPursue mercury, it vanishes aloft.\n\nTransformed as Tiger, it submerges in the Spring,\nAs Dragon, it hides in Fire’s treasure.\nDivine clarity penetrates the Great Dao,\nRefined, it crowns the King of Medicines.\n\nRecognizing Wood’s vital essence,\nWorthy of planting on the pool’s brink—\nBalanced, it divides the Fire’s flame,\nHarvesting noble gold’s bloom.\n\nThe Tiger’s fierce light is gathered,\nThe Dragon’s lightning flashes—\nAt once, the Saintly Dao is realized,\nA thousand days refine the morning’s glow.\n\nDiscussing lead yet not knowing lead,\nHow can one grasp the profound principle?\nThe Green Dragon does not rise and fall,\nThe White Tiger hides in repose.\n\nDarkly merging with True Qi,\nClearly sensing the High Immortal—\nCultivation’s power is vast,\nCompletion reveals Heaven’s intent.\n\nThe *Ren-Gui* Great Elixir Pool,\n*Bing-Ding* as the True Medicine’s

Spirit.\n\nClarifying the Great Elixir’s core,\nSeek within the mercury’s depths—\nThe Eastern Dragon meets its fate,\nThe Western Tiger pays homage.\n\nAffinity and nature blend in harmony,\nContaining breath, profound and deep—\nRefined, it becomes the True One Qi,\nTranscending the world, free from rise and fall.\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless in origin,\nThe Soul Elixir reveals its operation—\nHeaven-Earth open the Sacred Thing,\nDragon and Tiger birth the Divine.\n\nWater and Fire’s True Primordial Qi,\nYin and Yang refine the Solar Essence—\nThe Moon’s thirty-six

Qi,\nNine returns, the Elixir ascends from dust—\nCirculating the Twelve Seasons’ script,\nLife’s transformation lifts the body aloft.\n\nLead and Mercury’s Great Elixir Lord,\nTrue Persons unite as one—\nHeaven-Earth nurture the numinous Qi,\nDragon and Tiger split the Primordial Purity.\n\nFive hues shine with clarity,\nThree essences’ natures divide—\nAfter nine transformations’ refinement,\nThe dwelling is abandoned, ascending to Azure Clouds.\n\nThe enlightened observe further,\nReturning Elixirs in five forms—\nImmortal hands personally refine,\nMortals transmit with devoted hearts.\n\nSeeking the Tiger from a master’s guidance,\nKnowing the Dragon through Dao’s scrutiny—\nThree winters, the Martial and Civil turn,\nLight illuminates the Nine-Heaven’s chill.\n\nDivine Water irrigates the Flower Pool,\nKnowing the interplay of presence and absence—\nGreen Dragon merges with the Tiger’s body,\nWhite Tiger absorbs the Dragon’s fat.\n\nTwo substances communicate the Sacred,\nThree essences blend in resplendent ritual—\nA thousand days refine the Flower,\nCompleted, it honors Heaven’s timing.\n\nEntering the Dao, one must know its

and wife symbolize the medicinal foundation—\nYin and Yang’s division holds the secret key,\nFew awaken to its profound truth.\n\nA substance that ensnares the mind,\nImmortal sages explore its depths—\nThe Fire Dragon sheds its Water shell,\nThe Water Tiger erects its Golden Spleen.\n\nTransformed as Tiger, it becomes the True Groom,\nSummoning the Dragon, it establishes the Saintly Bride—\nTheir union births the Great Dao,\nInviting them to the Nine-Function Chamber.\n\nThe Dao opens, aligning Heaven and Earth,\nNo mortal can glimpse the Immortal Path—\nLead and Mercury clearly reveal the truth,\nThe Cloud-Carriage’s path is unerring.\n\nThe Abyss defines South and North,\nThunder and Dipper align East and West—\nFour Symbols ignite Dragon and Tiger,\nExtraordinary function, resolve unyielding.\n\nScriptures and precepts discuss unity,\nYin and Yang rise from the North to South—\nThe Boy’s years: four, five, six,\nThe Girl’s years: twelve, thirteen.\n\nSun and Moon’s union in twilight’s embrace,\nHusband and wife’s beauty grows ever more coveted—\nElixir’s transformation follows the Fire’s Dao,\nNine transformations—no idle talk.\n\nThe Soul Elixir reveals the hidden Dao,\nOne Qi circulates in the flames—\nResponding to the Sun and Moon’s union,\nTransforming Tiger and Dragon, salty and pungent.\n\nImmortal sages play with Gold and Wood,\nMorning and evening, they toy with the Black Hare—\nAwakening to the principle of eternal life,\nThrough lead, they reject the old guest’s invitation.\n\nLead and Mercury cycle through spring and autumn,\nHeaven-Earth’s midst is good for cultivation—\nCompletion yields the world-transcending medicine,\nAfter ingestion, one attains Heaven’s roaming.\n\nYang-refinement gathers the born Soul,\nYin-dissolution scatters the dispersed Spirit—\nDragging the Dragon, devouring the Tiger,\nTwo substances flow in Sacred Communion.\n\nThe Dao is sought before one’s eyes,\nGolden sprouts are not grasped in search—\nThe Golden Mountain opens the Tiger’s Valley,\nWooden Water washes the Dragon’s jaws.\n\nYang-qi, the Dragon’s breath, exhales,\nYin-wind, the Tiger’s inhalation—\nDivine Flame burns the Sacred Water,\nThe Elixir ascends, soaring the Nine-Heavens.\n\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger study,\nLead and Mercury unite as kin—\nMale and female share affinity,\nHusband and wife radiate in crimson clouds.\n\nYin and Yang’s singular substance,\nMorning and evening, fierce in the Three Flowers—\nAfter eighteen Heavenly Stems,\nThe Cloud-Piercing Path is unerring.",

complete—\nThe Returned Elixir’s sacred essence is never cast aside.\n\nDragon’s *emotion/qing* is inscribed on the left bank,\nTiger’s *nature/xing* is recorded on the right—\nBeneath the banner, the Primordial Lord rejoices,\nAt the Mystic Gate, feathered disciples knock.\n\nOne substance irrigates the Three *Jins* (refinements),\nThe Five Phases are mastered through profound inquiry—\nWestward gather the Tiger’s roaring halt,\nEastward seize the Dragon’s resonant stillness.\n\nIn the Sacred Land, the Elixir’s form is perfected,\nOnly Heaven’s alignment harmonizes with the Dao/Way-heart—\nRefining Yang through three *jius* (ninefold cycles),\nDivine beings sigh in reverence and awe.\n\nThe Sun-Moon Elixir’s essence is most refined,\nGods and Immortals display their utmost sacredness—\nWhen Yin-Yang’s union is complete,\nDragon and Tiger spontaneously merge and coalesce.\n\nWater and Fire harmonize the *Zhenqi* (True Qi),\nMorning and evening embody the refined form—\nThree cycles of cold and heat’s power,\nSweet and exquisite flavor, its fragrance alone.\n\nHow does one advance in Dao/Way’s path?—no surety,\nClutching the heart like ice, yet firm—\nYellow Lead summons response and resonance,\nBlack Mercury reveals the essence’s condensation.\n\nTwo substances generate radiant brilliance,\nThe Three Flowers bloom with vibrant hues—\nWhen Yin-essence fades, it vanishes utterly,\nYang-power ascends, riding the clouds.\n\nBlack Water purifies the profound depths,\nWhite Lead attains its hidden essence—\nWestward *Jin* (Metal) subdues Eastward Wood,\nEastward Wood originates from Westward *Jin*.\n\nAt their appointed meeting, hands cannot be parted,\nIn perfect harmony, hearts contract—\nAfter three autumns of cultivation,\nA thousand days refine the light and shade.\n\nAll things shed their mortal forms,\nThe Three Talents (Heaven, Earth, Man) are most spiritually sublime—\nKnow the Lead’s refinement and Mercury’s secret,\nClarify the Dao/Way to harmonize with Heaven’s script.\n\nRefining the Tiger’s Elixir-power,\nCapturing the Dragon’s essence to brew—\nOnce cold and heat are exhausted,\nThe True Self enters the Immortal Pavilion.\n\nLead and Mercury’s fame spreads far,\nYet few perceive their hidden Dao/Way—\nObscure and distant, harboring Water and Earth,\nDazzling and illuminating, casting light east and west.\n\n*Qingxing* (emotion-nature) and divine light unite,\nYin-Yang’s sacred power converges—\nTwenty-seven adjustments perfected,\nOne’s name is already inscribed in the Immortal Register.\n\nThough Lead and Mercury are oft-heard of,\nFew grasp their profound mysteries—\nRed Lead emerges from Black Elixir,\nWhite Mercury enters, light as Yellow.\n\nDragon and Tiger generate Golden Marrow,\nRoom (chamber) and Parameter (bedchamber) refine Wooden Essence—\nA thousand days nurture the Three Flowers,\nNine Heavens welcome within the belly.\n\nTrue Mercury rests with the Immortals,\nTrue Lead grounds the Sacred Elixir—\nIn past births, one neared them briefly,\nNow the Dao/Way’s mystery is unveiled.\n\nThree years, the Divine Elixir shines,\nNine returns radiate luminous hues—\nLater practitioners of the Dao/Way,\nSeek the *Zihe* (Purple River) Robe.\n\nThe Dao/Way alone encompasses Heaven-Earth,\nBukan and *Kun* (Heaven-Earth) yield the Elixir’s peak—\nThe Five Phases all respond and transform,\nThe Four Symbols (trigrams) flow through every scripture.\n\nDivine Water is the Primordial Sovereign,\nTrue *Jin* (Metal) enters Wood’s refinement—\nWho knows the Sacred Fire’s truth?\nIt transmutes Earth, ascending Nine Heavens.\n\nWood bears treasures fit for use,\nWater enfolds True *Jin*—\nWithin the Five Phases’ essence is secured,\nThese Three *Bans* (substances) are profound.\n\nRefining Yin-Yang’s Sacred Qi,\nNurturing the Tiger to earn the Dragon’s reverence—\nA thousand days of fire’s culmination,\nThe Elixir’s light shines upon the Divine.\n\nThe Great Elixir returns as Returned Elixir,\nA single grain ascends, piercing Heaven—\nThe Dragon’s might subdues the Tiger’s power,\nThe Tiger’s ferocity captures the Dragon’s breath.\n\nTwo years of shared gestation,\nThree *Bans* (substances) distilled into one—\nTen months of divine penetration,\nEarth is formed, seated upon the Golden Furnace.\n\nTrue Water and Earth must be known—\n*Kun*’s Primordial Victory is the Earthly Root,\n*Zhen*’s hidden essence is the Sacred Wood,\n*Li*’s borrowed fire is the *Jin*’s form.\n\nThe Five Phases must be discerned,\nA thousand days refine the Spirit—\nEssence is gathered, exhausting the Eight Trigrams,\nDragon and Tiger enfold treasures within.\n\nAlas, the floating world is fleeting,\nHard to abandon the Gate of Life and Death—\nSwiftly cultivate the Sacred Elixir,\nOnly then can one rival Heaven-Earth.\n\nDivine Water decocts the Dragon’s *po* (spirit),\nSacred Flame refines the Tiger’s *hun* (soul)—\nAfter three years of labor,\nA single grain faces Heaven’s glory.\n\nStill contemplation transforms sinking and floating,\nClarity of the Dao/Way knows no betrayal—\nDivine beings should awaken to its truth,\nLife and Death sway like withering and flourishing.\n\nThe Great Dao/Way’s root is transformation,\nCultivating the body to revive one’s fate—\nThe Five Phases’ true secrets are revealed,\nLike a crown, pouring nectar as recompense.\n\nYellow Lead triumphs in entering the Mystic,\nBlack Mercury surges from the Spirit’s spring—\nTwo Qi meet and merge,\nThe Three Flowers are secretly wrapped and decocted.\n\nEast and West follow the Sun-Moon’s rhythm,\nSouth and North move with the passing years—\nAfter three years of labor,\nLuminous light ranks the Immortals.\n\nFormless, one hears the Great Dao/Way,\nWith Elixir, the Mystic is concealed—\nTrue Water returns to True Fire,\nRed Lead replaces Black Lead.\n\nThe Five Phases gather Qi fully,\nThe Four Symbols reverse the winds’ rotation—\nFire circulates through Yin-Yang’s embrace,\nThe Sacred Elixir gleams in the Azure Sky.\n\nWhen *Bukan* and *Kun* harmonize in *Tai* (peace),\nSun-Moon nurture the *Hua* (Flower) Pool—\nGreen Wood’s Three Flowers are hidden,\nWhite *Jin*’s Seven Maidens know.\n\nHusband and Wife align as *Jin* and Wood,\nEach birthing Tiger and Dragon offspring—\nNine turns and three cycles complete,\nThe Spirit’s communion leaves no doubt.\n\n*Duì*’s (Lake) brilliance conceals the Golden Tiger,\n*Zhen*’s (Thunder) rumble harbors the Wooden

      "translated_text": "The Lead’s hair, unblackened, is true,\nMercury refined with silver sand’s aid—\nThe Dragon’s fluid, spirit and essence, is sacred,\nThe Metal’s brilliance in the Pool of Divinity.\n\nThe Tiger is born in *Rén-Jǐ*’s embrace,\nThe Dragon rises near *Jiǎ-Yǐ*’s kin—\nHeaven and Earth’s cycles turn complete,\nThe Purple Wanderer’s light shines upon mortals.\n\nMother’s essence, child’s transformation, is *Wēng*,\nThe Metal’s essence, Wood’s family, is *Róng*—\nIn two years, the hue returns,\nIn one breath, the sun’s red is seized.\n\nDissolving the Yin, the Dao is perfected,\nRefining the *qi*, the Spirit’s passage is achieved—\nThe *Huan* of the True Elixir is named,\nLong life ascends through the Azure void.\n\nThere is a hidden thing, its true name unknown,\nBorn of the Heaven-Earth’s sacred breath—\nThe Sun’s palace transmits *bone-qi*,\nThe Moon’s cavern nurtures the body’s form—\nRefining the Yang soul is correct,\nDispelling the Yin shadow is done.\n\n*Bǐng-Dīng*’s martial and civil are severed,\nOne grain suffices to cross the Three Pure Ones.\n\nThe Great Dao is not falsely passed down,\nIt splits open the Heaven-Earth’s origin—\nThe ignorant miss the subtle marvels,\nThe enlightened hear the Sage’s words.\n\nForging the Tiger through Lead’s transformation,\nNaming the Dragon with Mercury’s proclamation—\nRefining with Sun and Moon’s full measure,\nOnly then does one enter the Immortal Garden.\n\nWhat is the logic of the Supreme Medicine?\nRefining the Yin to birth the Yang—\nNow dividing the South-North paths,\nThe East-West chambers are made right.\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger lie in breath,\nThe *Fáng Cān* hosts unseen guidance—\nNine returns, seven refineries,\nThe body surges, soaring aloft.\n\nThe spirit-sprout’s water has feeling,\nChanging water earns the name *Qiáng*—\nAutumn harvests the Metal’s marrow,\nSpring stores the Wood’s inner essence.\n\nFrom *Kūn*’s passage, refining Purple,\nEntering the Sage, the Yellow is lightened—\n*Wù-Jǐ* sits in the Central Palace,\nMutual aid ascends to the Upper Pure.\n\nSitting in the world’s elixir’s mystery,\nLife begins from Heaven-Earth’s Lead—\nYin and Yang produce Dragon and Tiger,\nMetal and Wood forge the Elixir Field.\n\nAdvance and retreat in the Three Blooms’ secrecy,\nBalancing the Two *qi*’s rotation—\nFrom the void, refining yields the full,\nChanging bones, the Sage’s path is true.\n\nBlack Mercury births White Mercury,\nFrom *Mēng* to the Sage’s work is done—\nThe Southern soul grows from the North,\nThe Western shadow gestates in the East.\n\nSun and Moon, Yin and Yang, resonate,\nSpouses match as one—\nIn three autumns, twenty-seven cycles,\nThe Elixir’s power reaches the Spirit’s passage.\n\nThere is a thing of the Supreme Yin’s essence,\nOnly *Kūn*’s dew bears its true name—\nThe Three Refineries align the True Path,\nThe Five Colors grow ever distinct.\n\nThe Tiger lies, the Sage refines,\nThe Dragon is roasted in Sun and Moon’s broth—\nUniting the cycles of the scriptures,\nThe body’s Sage transcends mortal emotion.\n\nLead and Mercury’s names are far-reaching,\nFrom the True, Water-Fire is born—\nThe Yellow is lightened, producing White Mercury,\nWhite Mercury transforms into Yellow’s lightness.\n\nThe Two Essences harmonize as one,\nA single person cannot follow both—\nNine Yangs refine to reveal the True,\nThe Fire’s end, all Immortals welcome.\n\nYellow Lead returns to Black Lead,\nWhite Mercury’s refinement is profound—\nThe Western Pool hosts the male counterpart,\nThe Eastern Palace marvels at the female sage.\n\nUnion follows the Sun and Moon’s rhythm,\nTransformation proves the Sage’s path—\nNine refineries, the Elixir’s light reveals itself,\nLong life knows no count of years.\n\nCreation’s force matches the Heavenly,\nThe Elixir’s text is listed within—\nYin and Yang balance the Five Colors,\nLead and Mercury move the Three Mysteries.\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger’s essence breathes,\nThe *Fáng Cān* hosts unseen alchemy—\nDo not abandon the True Water-Fire,\nRefining invites the Sage’s path.\n\nThe Five Colors, one essence, are born,\nThe Three Elements perform nine transformations—\nThe True Yin-Yang hues are correct,\nThe True Water-Fire is refined to completion.\n\nTrue Mercury stands through Lead’s foundation,\nTrue Dragon transforms as Tiger—\nRefining with Sun and Moon’s light,\nThree Nines display their clarity.\n\nSun and Moon bestow eternal life,\n*Qián-Kūn*’s balance is inherent—\nThe Elixir’s logic is profound,\nThe Great Dao’s essence is boundless.\n\nFour-Five’s Metal Bloom is fair,\nSix-Three’s Wood stands true—\nExternal flames align with inner fire,\nGlory and shame are left to others’ strife.\n\nTrue Water emerges from *Qián*’s origin,\nTrue Metal is born from Wood’s gate—\nThe Spirit Pool collects the Tiger’s shadow,\nThe Sacred Fire subdues the Dragon’s soul.\n\nSun and Moon restrain the soul and shadow,\nYin and Yang refine the children and descendants—\nNine returns to *Wù-Jǐ*,\nThe Crane’s journey pays homage to the Heavenly Sage.\n\nThe Metal’s fluid, the Great Elixir’s poem, is complete.",
