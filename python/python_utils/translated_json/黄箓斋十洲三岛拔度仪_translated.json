  "full_translation": "**Ritual of the Yellow Talisman Fast: Ascension from the Ten Realms and Three Isles**\n*Sutra Title: Ritual of the Yellow Talisman Fast for Ascension from the Ten Realms and Three Isles*\n*One scroll*\n*Source: The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (正统道藏), Dunxuan Section (洞玄部), Rituals of Comportment (威仪类)*\n\n**Ritual of the Yellow Talisman Fast: Ascension from the Ten Realms and Three Isles**\n\n*Step in voidness,*\n*Next, invoke the Three Celestial Worthy Ones.*\n\n**Declaration and Offering:**\nWith incense raised in supplication,\nWe make offerings to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness,\nThe Ten Ultimate High Immortals,\nThe Merciful Supreme One of the Eastern Extremity, Savior of Suffering,\nThe Ten-Directional Savior of Suffering,\nThe Nine-Yin Expiator of Guilt,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Red Mound who Transmits Fate,\nThe Yellow Talisman Officials, the Boundless Sacred Immortals,\nThe Ten Realms and Three Isles—all their mighty and numinous powers.\n\nBy this true incense,\nWe universally make offerings.\n\n*Humbly praying for divine mercy,*\n*That Your enlightened gaze may shine upon us.*\n\n*Humbly reflecting:*\nAs the two *qi* circulate, they wax and wane;\nAs the Five Constants are bestowed, they cannot escape rise and fall.\nThus, we know the causes of birth and death\nAre but the numbers of coming and going.\n\nIf one wishes to prolong life and dwell in the world,\nIt can only be by shedding mortal traces and ascending as an immortal.\n\nTherefore, beyond the dusty world, the Ten Realms are all domains of eternal life;\nWithin the seas, the Three Isles are lands where none age.\nGolden nectar and jade wine fill the vessels without end;\nThe hem of the mist and the sleeves of the clouds arise with every thought.\n\n「The verdant lotus roots and frost-kissed peaches bear fruit in the third winter;\nStrange flowers and fruits flourish in all four seasons.\nThe winds and lights are ever spring-like, unceasing;\nThe sun and moon revolve without night’s end.\nWhen the crimson sky clears its hue,\nThe Palace of Everlasting Joy opens in time;\nWhen the purple mist glows at dawn,\nThe Hall of the Celestial Sovereign spreads afar.\n\nSome ride the Yellow Dragon’s litter,\nOthers mount the Vermilion Phoenix’s carriage.\nA crane’s cry—one sound—\nCrosses the Immortal Peaks in an instant;\nA peng’s leap—nine ten-thousands—\nSurpasses the boundless seas in a breath.\nAll rely on the Void to command the sky,\nAble to forsake the world and transcend the mundane.\nIn ease of dwelling and repose,\nNo worldly cares or schemes intrude.\nThe Valley of Brocade shines cold,\nIts morning light reflecting the *yùyí*’s [1] lush hue;\nThe Cinnabar Mist vying in splendor,\nIts nightly glow purifying the *jiérán*’s [2] brilliance.\n\nThe Jade Maidens bear messages,\nThe Golden Boys present decrees.\nThey attend the Feast of the Celestial Jade Pool,\nTogether ascending to the Golden Gate’s ranks.\nMusic resounds from the *Jūn Tiān*’s [3] heights,\nShaking the crimson osmanthus of the Broad Cold’s [4] realm;\nThe cup holds sweet dew,\nIts fragrance mingling with the Queen Mother’s *pán táo*’s [5] elixir.\n\nAll this stems from mortal traces cast aside,\nAnd a heart content with simplicity’s *dàn bó* [6].\nTo delight the spirit and nurture the nature,\nOne must grasp the method of inhaling fresh and exhaling stale;\nTo refine the essence and cultivate the True,\nOne must awaken to the logic of transcending the mundane and ascending the divine.\n\nThus severed from the dusty world,\nTheir names are inscribed in the immortal ledger.\nThey roam the Three Mountains,\nWander the Ten Extremes.\nFeasting on mist and clad in *qi*,\nThey preserve their immortal lifespan without end;\nDistilling elixirs and burning cinnabar,\nThey guide the worldly toward the Dao’s path.\n\nIf they harbor a resolve to return,\nMay they receive the grace of deliverance.\nI now offer as one who has shed past transgressions,\nTo uphold the *Chōng Kē*’s [7] sacred range,\nAnd to sustain the Immortal’s standard.\n\nLet me unfold the Ten Realms’ sublime landscapes,\nAnd chant the Three Isles’ arcane winds.\nBy these singular causes,\nI present this offering for unseen blessings.\n*Humbly praying for divine mercy,*\n*That Your enlightened gaze may shine upon us.*\n\n*Humbly reflecting:*\nAs the two *qi* circulate, they wax and wane;\nAs the Five Constants are bestowed, they cannot escape rise and fall.\nThus, we know the causes of birth and death\nAre but the numbers of coming and going.\n\nIf one wishes to prolong life and dwell in the world,\nIt can only be by shedding mortal traces and ascending as an immortal.\n\nTherefore, beyond the dusty world, the Ten Realms are all domains of eternal life;\nWithin the seas, the Three Isles are lands where none age.\nGolden nectar and jade wine fill the vessels without end;\nThe hem of the mist and the sleeves of the clouds arise with every thought.\n\n---\n**First Realm: Yíng Zhōu** [8]\nLofty above the boundless sea,\nFacing the *Kuài Jī*’s [9] distant shores.\nIts True Palace is the dwelling of the Two Immortals;\nThe divine herbs there bless all things.\nRefining the iron of *Kūn Wú* [10],\nIt shatters like jade in flight;\nDrinking the nectar of *yùlí* [11],\nOne attains everlasting life.\n\nThe Green Mound hides its borders,\nThe Emerald Waters conceal the immortals.\nI present this sacred offering,\nTo ascend this realm in flight.\n\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I soar the Cloud Path,\nAnd reach the boundless freedom of my true nature;\nReturning thanks to the dusty world,\nAnd awaken from the illusion of mortal life.\nMay the faithful devotees take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nYíng Zhōu’s gates connect to all the heavens,\nIts springtime light beyond measure forgets the years.\nThe Five-hued Phoenix crow of dawn,\nThe Thousand-gold Phoenix inhales the crimson vapors.\nThe Green Mound’s waters and mountains differ from the world,\nThe *Kūn Wú* iron and jade stones are firm and true.\nI pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,\nAnd let them hear the sutras, awakening to the True Meaning.\n\n---\n**Second Realm: Xuán Zhōu** [12]\nSituated in the *Xùn Gōng*’s [13] domain,\nWithin the Northern Sea’s embrace.\nFacing the Celestial Gate,\nIt stands as Earth’s threshold.\n\nThe Fragrant Wind Mountains rise in splendor,\nTheir roots echoing with thunderous harmonies;\nThe Azure Grass spreads its scent,\nStrewing jade blossoms along the path.\n\nIt is the capital of the Supreme Mystic,\nThe true seat of the Immortal Lords.\nIts earth yields golden treasure,\nIts stones encase white jade,\nIts lifespan limitless,\nIts robes and food naturally provided.\n\nI present this sacred offering,\nTo ascend this realm in flight.\n\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay the immortals swiftly guide me,\nAnd in a breath, reveal the blessed lands of hidden heavens;\nMay divine visions be clear,\nAnd my essence transformed into the Immortal’s Way and spirit-bone.\n\nMay the faithful devotees take refuge,\nAnd extol the wondrous range.\n\nThe Mystic Capital dominates the Immortal Domain,\nIts grand halls and splendid chambers host the ranks of sages.\nThe Jade Maidens compose decrees riding crane-litters,\nThe Golden Boys deliver edicts astride whales.\n\nThe Jade Fields produce priceless treasures,\nThe Sacred Dates flourish in embroidered abundance.\nI pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,\nAnd let them learn from the dusty world the art of purity and detachment.\n\n---\n**Third Realm: Cháng Zhōu** [14]\nIts cavernous palace lies concealed within,\nPressing down upon the Southern Sea’s depths.\nSweet nectar flows from its springs,\nCalled the Elixir of Everlasting Life;\nThe Green Mound bears another name,\nTrue Land of Supreme Bliss.\n\nIts five-thousand-*lǐ* landscape is unparalleled,\nIts three-ten-thousand-year lifespan the longest.\nThe Purple Jade Pavilions and Towers\nAre all abodes of the True Women and Daoists;\nThe Yellow Silk Talismans and Scriptures\nAre all the refined methods of the High Saints.\n\nAbove stands the True Capital’s ridge,\nBeside lies the Broad Benefit’s palace.\n\nI present this sacred offering,\nTo ascend this realm in flight.\n\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay the Cinnabar Mist enshroud me,\nAnd I forever wear the treasured sutras;\nAt the Red Water’s mountain peak,\nMay I pay homage to the *Yù Qīng*’s [15] carriage.\n\nMay the faithful devotees take refuge,\nAnd extol the wondrous range.\n\nCháng Zhōu’s scenery is spring in all four seasons,\nPhoenix litters and Dragon towers locked in emerald clouds.\nTwo shores of peaches no mortal reaches,\nOne field of *zhī cǎo* [16] where cranes gather in flocks.\nThe Jade Towers empty, the celestial winds grow cold,\nThe Jade Chessboard’s tides return, the sea sun sets low.\nI pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,\nAnd let them pay reverence to the Purple Void’s palace, honoring the *Yuán Jūn* [17].\n\n---\n**Fourth Realm: Liú Zhōu** [18]\nA boundary of three-thousand *lǐ*,\nA span of ninety-ten-thousand *chéng* [19].\nThe Western Sea is clear,\nNo trace of perilous waves is seen;\nThe Eastern Wind stirs,\nAnd the scent of purple wood is heard at times.\n\nThe Immortals’ processions pass without need of boats,\nThe divine *líng xiāo* [20]’s melody flows without end.\nBefore the Moonlit Stair,\nOne watches the Green Swans dance;\nOn the Flying Mist Mountain,\nOne rides the White Crane at will.\n\nI present this sacred offering,\nTo ascend this realm in flight.\n\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay a single pill of elixir\nBe brought from the *Gōu Lòu*’s [21] depths;\nMay twin breezes of purity\nFollow the Jade River back to me.\nMay the faithful devotees take refuge,\nAnd extol the wondrous range.\n\nOn Liú Zhōu’s mountain, the Flying Mist resounds,\nWhere a hundred thousand immortal guests and poets dwell.\nThe Auspicious Herbs and *líng zhī* [22] are ten-thousand-year elixirs,\nThe Green Lilies and *xiān ní* [23] bloom in four seasons’ splendor.\nThe Cloud-and-Mist curtains leave only the celestial sandals behind,\nAt the Ox-and-Fight constellation’s riverside, no ferryman is needed.»\n\n「I humbly present sacred offerings to transcend that realm,\nWhere peach trees grow and sesame meals return me home.\n\nIn the fifth *Yuánzhōu* [24] of divine abode,\nBeyond the *Cāngmíng* [25] seas to the north,\nThe immortal gardens lie at its heart.\nThere stands the lofty Jade Pavilion,\nWhere feasts are held in the *Zǐxū* [26] halls.\n\nThe sweet spring of *Xuànyàn* [27] is like honey,\nDrink it and one may dwell in this world for long years.\nThe wondrous herbs of *Língfēng* [28] are nameless,\nWear them and one’s form shall be reborn, free from earthly bonds.\n\nThe cave gates never lock,\nAnd immortal guests have leisure aplenty.\nAfter reading the *Huángtíng* [29] scriptures,\nOne sees only clouds rising from the foundations.\nIn awe of the *Qīngmèng* [30] visions,\nOne knows not how the seas have turned to mulberry fields.\n\nThe celestial *Qiànyà* [31] bells and drums resound,\nWhile mortal boats and carriages never reach.\nTime and light grow not old,\nLife’s measure is boundless—\nI present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay my mortal frame be shed like a cicada’s husk,\nAnd leave the empty blossoms of the world behind.\nMay I master the *Sāndòng* [32] scriptures,\nAnd attain the secrets of the true immortals.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the wondrous range.\n\nThe fifth *Yuánzhōu* [24] is a blessed realm where immortals dwell,\nWith crimson hues and vermilion radiance piercing the void.\nThe sweet spring of *Xuànyàn* flows over jade pavements,\nWhile the *Zǐxū* halls are sealed with indigo bolts.\nA hundred-year jade crane returns to the Azure Banner,\nAnd a five-colored celestial dragon draws from the Fire Bell.\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd in haste ascend the Five-Clouded towers.\n\nIn the sixth *Shēngzhōu* [33] of rebirth,\nThe land floats upon the Eastern Sea,\nAnd mountains touch *Pénglái* [34].\nImmortal guests and poets mingle in the emerald mists,\nWhile peerless landscapes loop in sapphire barriers.\nGreen swans take flight, crimson phoenixes gather,\nTrue immortals come and go above the heavens.\nTigers roar, dragons chant,\nGuarding the sacred traces in the mountains.\nFlowers bloom in supreme splendor,\nTrees merge with the *Qiān* [35] forests.\nCave doors are long barred,\nYet one often hears the chime of jade bells.\nCelestial platforms rise high,\nWhere the sound of jade gongs is ever-present.\nWhen pure winds stir, the music shakes the cloudy *Léi* [36],\nAnd as the bright moon ascends, the sea mirrors half its disk.\nSeasonal wonders abound,\nAnd one may leisurely wander for a thousand years.\nI present offerings to the departed,\nTo transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I step forth into the pavilions of the *Xūhuáng* [37],\nAnd burn the finest incense.\nMay I ascend the halls of *Fǎyuè* [38],\nAnd pay homage to the Three Treasures.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nThe sovereign of *Shēngzhōu* is the *Tàiqīng* Lord,\nWho holds the mysteries of the Dao and works its transformations.\nHe plucks and drinks from heaven’s bounty,\nAnd his splendor does not match the mortal world.\nWith the Three Flowers, he attains the *Cháoyuán* [39] path,\nAnd needs no worldly medicine to cure his ailments.\nI pray to ascend with sacred offerings,\nAnd swiftly grasp the *Shùnjīng* [40] steps of the void.\n\nIn the seventh *Zǔzhōu* [41] of ancestral land,\nA realm of ten thousand *lí* [42] in expanse,\nWhere clouds enfold a thousand homes.\nThe *zhī* [43] is called \"Nurturing Spirit\",\nBreathing the jade-like *ruìqì* [44] of the blessed fields.\nThe medicine is named \"Immortal,\"—\nReviving the world’s withered bones.\nNone are sick who do not recover,\nAnd all who have merit shall meet it.\nTest the divine herbs,\nAnd surely the years of *Guǐgǔ* [45] shall be matched.\nSeek the blessed child,\nAnd none shall surpass the *Jūnfáng* [46] carriage.\nThe sacred seedlings rise but a few *cùn* [47],\nYet resemble the immortal gourd.\nDivine waters, but a sip,\nNourish strange and wondrous growths.\nTheir fame surpasses the ten mountains,\nTheir brilliance excels the four seas.\nI present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I dance in feathered robes,\nAnd in a breath fly past the immortal mountains.\nMay I wander through the *Dòngzhāng* [48] scriptures,\nAnd ten thousand times fulfill the Dao of immortality.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nThe ancestral *Zǔzhōu* [41] surpasses mortal scenes,\nWith green waters and blue mountains encircling all.\nIts dwellings rise and float upon the vast sea,\nAnd one returns to gather *zhī* [43] amid the idle clouds.\nWhen hungry, one feasts on *Huángbì* [49] elixirs in golden cauldrons,\nWhen thirsty, one drinks from jade roots through crystal gates.\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd freely roam the *Fānghú* [50] and *Yuánjiǎo* [51] peaks.\n\nIn the eighth *Yánzhōu* [52] of flames,\nThe *qì* [53] divides at the Southern Pole,\nAnd the land is anchored by the *Lígōng* [54] palace.\nTrue fire blazes, stretching ten thousand *zhàng* [55] through the heavens.\nGreat waves surge, rising a thousand *xún* [56] high.\nRefining the *yīnbò* [57] to ascend,\nRiding the *yángguāng* [58] to attain liberation.\nThe *Mòshēng* [59] cloth is named for fire-washing,\nCleansing the dust of life within the fierce flames.\nThe *Fēngshēng* [60] beasts are so called,\nFor they regrow their feathers beneath the piled firewood.\nGreat *Dānyào* [61] flows like fire,\nAnd the palaces of the *Guānyà* [62] are solemn and grand.\nThe High Saints and True Worthies,\nTheir majesty and splendor dazzle all.\nAll are abodes of gods and immortals,\nAnd they communicate with the Central Lands.\nI present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay my jade eyes be refined in essence,\nAnd receive the true seal of life’s decree.\nMay I master the *Jīnyè* [63] alchemy,\nAnd attain the immortal arts of returning the soul.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nThe *Yánzhōu* [52] alone connects with mortal realms,\nWhere a thousand-*lǐ* [64] voyage leads into the Han palaces.\nSteam and flames stretch through the heavens, scaring birds to flight,\nAnd surging waves encircle the shores, where giant turtles reign.\nThe upper realm of *Nánchāng* [65] opens to the flowing fire,\nAnd the *Dōngjǐng* [66] pools meet the *Tàikōng* [67].\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd may my withered bones once more return to the form of a child.\n\nIn the ninth *Fènglínzhōu* [68] of phoenix and unicorn,\nThere lies the *Dānlín* [69] hall of the elixir forests,\nAnd above, the *Qīnghuá* [70] palace connects.\nBelow, it is separated by the *Míng* [71] waves,\nYet distantly communicates with the celestial realms.\nHere, the unicorn is born,\nAnd phoenixes fly in pairs.\nFrom here comes the incense of \"Returning Souls, Cleansing Filth,\"\nAnd the treasure of \"Refining Gold, Extending Threads.\"\nImmortal sages tend the cauldron,\nAnd the medicinal vapors form the elixir.\nThe *Ruòshuǐ* [72] surrounds the isle,\nAnd no bird’s feathers may float upon it.\nThose who arrive here are High Saints and True Immortals,\nAnd those who govern are Celestial Lords and True Worthies.\nI present sacred offerings to ascend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I worship the solemn *Yùyí* [73] scenes,\nAnd perceive the penetrating golden light.\nMay I rush to the *Jiélìng* [74] halls,\nAnd gaze upon the jade-like countenance.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the wondrous range.\n\nThe immortal *Fènglínzhōu* [68] rises high,\nWhere weak waters cannot bear a feather’s weight.\nThe incense of transcendence returns the soul for thousands of *lǐ*,\nAnd the *Jiāqiān* [75] unicorn’s horn refines for countless autumns.\nWhen clouds part, the *Cíyǐ* [76] pavilion is dyed with elixir,\nAnd as the sun ascends, the *Qiān* [35] forests flow with emerald brilliance.\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd freely roam the *Fānghú* [50] and *Yuánjiǎo* [51] peaks.\n\nIn the tenth *Jùkūzhōu* [77] of gathered caves,\nMountains form the immortal grottoes,\nAnd palaces are named *Dòngxuán* [78].\nSacred roots preserve the seeds of death,\nAnd jade cauldrons refine the golden essence.\nTo hear of them is to rise from withered bones,\nTo drink of them is to ascend as an immortal.\nThe customs here are pure and true,\nAnd the people’s ways are simple and unadorned.\nWithin the *Húzhōng* [79] are sun and moon,\nAnd this realm knows no seasons—」\n\n「Within the hollowed realm, heaven and earth abide,\nYet here are sovereigns and ministers, fathers and sons.\nWithout craving or longing, neither departure nor return.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\n\nI humbly wish that with a finger-snap, ten thousand *lǐ* of immortal mountains appear,\nWithout need of the long reeds—\nTo lift my head and see the ninefold celestial gates,\nWhat hindrance is there to my flying sandals?\n\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe tenth *Jùkūzhōu* of gathered caves,\nWhere mountains form the immortal grottoes,\nAnd palaces bear the name *Dòngxuán*.\nSacred roots preserve the seeds of death,\nAnd jade cauldrons refine the golden essence.\nTo hear of them is to rise from withered bones,\nTo drink of them is to ascend as an immortal.\nThe customs here are pure and true,\nAnd the people’s ways are simple and unadorned.\nWithin the *Húzhōu* are sun and moon,\nAnd this realm knows no seasons—\nHere, heaven and earth are enclosed,\nYet sovereigns and subjects, fathers and children, exist.\nNo greed nor desire, neither going nor coming.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\n\nI humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,\nMy body be as light as a single leaf—\nAnd as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe first *Kūnlún* island,\nCircled by weak waters, named *Kūnlún* alone.\nGazing southeast, it meets the *Shípǔ* realm of immortal roaming;\nLooking northwest, it stands as the northern gate of *Dòngtiān*.\nThe well draws from the great *Dàhuó* fountain,\nAnd the path leads into the southern valley of the city.\n\nHere, the true immortals gather,\nAnd the assembled saints come to visit.\nThe *Jīshí* mountains stretch westward,\nRevealing the *Xīmǔ* tortoise platform’s location;\nThe *Yǎnpén* cliffs rise steeply,\nUnlocking the *Mùwáng*’s path to immortality.\n\nThe *Huāzūn* grove bears its name,\nAnd its peak is called *Làngfēng*.\nThe *Tiānyōng* city towers high,\nWith heaped gold weighing ten thousand *yì* [80];\nThe *Fànqì* [81] pavilion stands tall,\nReflecting the ninefold *Gāo* jade’s brilliance.\n\nThe twelve *liújīng* [82] crystal gates,\nDay and night forever sealed;\nThe eight thousand long-life peaches,\nBloom eternally without fading.\n\nAbove, it connects to the *Xuánxī* [83] celestial bureau,\nBelow, it overlooks the *Shùhài* [84] mortal domain.\nHere, the five elements flow harmoniously,\nAnd the six *qì* are balanced in measure.\nTruly a blessed hall’s domain,\nA land of eternal joy indeed.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\nI humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,\nMy body be as light as a single leaf—\nAnd as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe *Kūnlún*’s piled stones touch the southeast,\nThe *Huāzūn* grove and *Tiānyōng* city rise in emerald mists.\nThough separated from *Xiányáng* by earth,\nThe palace links to the Queen Mother’s realm, waters embracing all.\nTo the north, the great *Dàhuó* well flows with elixir,\nTo the west, the golden city gazes upon the *Ànbì* [85] jade pool.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nAnd listen to the Dao’s mysteries upon the *Làngfēng* platform.\n\nThe second *Fāngzhàng* island,\nIts peaks like piled jade, piercing the layered heavens.\nFlowers like liquid gold, clustering beside towering ridges.\nHere, the palaces gather gold, jade, and *lúlí* [86],\nTheir light rivaling stars and constellations;\nAnd the halls of *jiāoqíng* [87] and *lóngshèn* [88] dragons,\nTheir depths swallowed by the boundless sea.\n\nThis is the third heaven’s abode of the *Sīmìng* [89] sovereign,\nAnd the true dwelling of the *Jiǔyuán Zhàngrén* [90].\nHe governs the gods of all earthly waters,\nAnd examines the scrolls of mortals seeking the Dao.\n\nGolden nectar and jade marrow,\nDrink them, and hunger is forgotten for ten thousand *jié* [91];\nAuspicious grasses and *língzhī* [92] mushrooms,\nWear them, and no dust clings at all.\n\nThe stone springs flow with moisture,\nUnceasing for a thousand years;\nThe mulberries and *shānzhēn* [93] berries thrive,\nEvergreen for ten thousand autumns.\nWhen the immortal children ascend to the heavens,\nThey visit the high sages’ platform of scriptures.\n\nThe *Fù* [94] is granted to the *Xuányuán* [95],\nAnd the name is known to the *Tàishàng* [96].\nTheir ranks are honored and exalted,\nTheir stations pure and lofty.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\n\nI humbly wish that the assembly of the immortals upholds me,\nTo ascend the golden gate and enter the jade hall—\nWith a single thought, I soar beyond,\nCarrying the *Tàishān* [97] and crossing the *Běihǎi* [98].\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe *Fāngzhàng* island in the sea gathers the gods,\nIts earthly form towering and distinct from the heavens.\nGolden phoenixes abound in their brooding nests,\nAnd who guides the jade ointment to nourish the *zhītián* [99]?\nThe towers and halls shine with the *Sānqīng* [100] path’s light,\nAnd the flowers and trees float in five-colored mist.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nNo need to turn back and mourn the dusty ties.\n\nThe third *Péngqiū* island,\nCircumscribed by five thousand *lǐ* and more,\nAscending to the thirty-two heavens.\n\nTo the north, it stands apart from the *Zhōngshān* [101],\nAnd in the center, it connects to the vast seas.\nBeyond the *Nèi’ā* [102] gate,\nLies the ninth heaven’s palace of the sovereign lord;\nWithin the *Míngbó* [103] waves,\nRises the three-island realm of cloudy verdure.\n\nFlying immortals come and go,\nAuspicious mists drifting and veiling.\nJingling ornaments and jade pendants,\nArrayed in the celestial court’s order;\nFaint *shēngxiāo* [104] and *zhèngxiāo* [105] music,\nPlaying the songs of the *Diàolè* [106] fishing festival.\n\nChildren from the eight seas scatter flowers,\nAnd attendants of the five clouds hold parasols in reverence.\nThe *Qióngbiē* [107] tortoise and *Yīyī* [108] monster,\nCarry stones to form the mountains;\nThe immortal phoenix lingers and hesitates,\nBeak-laden with blossoms for offerings.\n\nThe sound of *Bùxū* [109] steps resounds,\nAnd the rainbow clouds gather at the *Yáofēng* [110] peak;\nThe *Fànjīng* [111] bell’s tones descend,\nAnd the crimson banners return to the *Zǐfǔ* [112] palace.\n\nOne year in the mountain,\nIs a hundred years in the mortal world.\nFeasting on *rú* [113] and *cāngjīng* [114],\nNo need for the arts of abstaining from food;\nDwelling in spirit and severing desires,\nWhy cling to the hand-holding of the mundane?\n\nNo suffering from cold or heat,\nNo entanglement in wealth or fame.\nFree and unbounded, joy without end.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\nI humbly wish that when the *juéhuā* [115] blooms, I awaken,\nThe winds of the ten islands ever spring;\nAnd when yesterday’s dream fades,\nThe mists of the three islands linger yet.\n\nThe assembly of the Law is devout,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\n*Pénglái* [116] divides the fates and calms the surging waves,\nThe great emperor’s consort and the assembled saints.\nFive-colored snows float upon the jade *liào* [117],\nAnd ninefold *Qīng* [118] stars and moons shine from the golden *áoxiāo* [119].\nThe *Yáotái* [120] platform’s shadow dips into the cold celestial heart,\nAnd the jade gates’ light ascends above the high sea.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nAnd personally accompany the Queen Mother in feasting upon the *Pántáo* [121].\n\nFor though blessed lands and *Dòngtiān* [122] realms\nLie not beyond the dusty world,\nAnd though the gods and saints attain enlightenment,\nThey yet reside within the mundane.\nThose who cultivate feel the response naturally,\nWhile those who neglect are bound by emotional ties.\nOnly the high sages’ compassion,\nReveals the purity of the immortal realm.\nThus, mortals abandon toil and return to the Great Dao,\nFortunate to meet this assembly, guided by the sacred rites.\n\nNow, I rely upon the benevolent power,\nTo be led to the true path.\nForever free from the mortal cage,\nI soar beyond the celestial realm.\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nAlas, the mortal world is but a fleeting horse,\nAnd the bonds of wealth and fame confine us like locks and reins.\nWe fail to grasp that all existence is contingent,\nYet take our labors and sorrows as joy and delight.\nWhat use are honor and riches

*Yuánzhōu* [24] is a blessed realm where immortals dwell,\nWith crimson hues and vermilion radiance piercing the void.\nThe sweet spring of *Xuànyàn* flows over jade pavements,\nWhile the *Zǐxū* halls are sealed with indigo bolts.\nA hundred-year jade crane returns to the Azure Banner,\nAnd a five-colored celestial dragon draws from the Fire Bell.\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd in haste ascend the Five-Clouded towers.\n\nIn the sixth *Shēngzhōu* [33] of rebirth,\nThe land floats upon the Eastern Sea,\nAnd mountains touch *Pénglái* [34].\nImmortal guests and poets mingle in the emerald mists,\nWhile peerless landscapes loop in sapphire barriers.\nGreen swans take flight, crimson phoenixes gather,\nTrue immortals come and go above the heavens.\nTigers roar, dragons chant,\nGuarding the sacred traces in the mountains.\nFlowers bloom in supreme splendor,\nTrees merge with the *Qiān* [35] forests.\nCave doors are long barred,\nYet one often hears the chime of jade bells.\nCelestial platforms rise high,\nWhere the sound of jade gongs is ever-present.\nWhen pure winds stir, the music shakes the cloudy *Léi* [36],\nAnd as the bright moon ascends, the sea mirrors half its disk.\nSeasonal wonders abound,\nAnd one may leisurely wander for a thousand years.\nI present offerings to the departed,\nTo transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I step forth into the pavilions of the *Xūhuáng* [37],\nAnd burn the finest incense.\nMay I ascend the halls of *Fǎyuè* [38],\nAnd pay homage to the Three Treasures.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the

not match the mortal world.\nWith the Three Flowers, he attains the *Cháoyuán* [39] path,\nAnd needs no worldly medicine to cure his ailments.\nI pray to ascend with sacred offerings,\nAnd swiftly grasp the *Shùnjīng* [40] steps of the void.\n\nIn the seventh *Zǔzhōu* [41] of ancestral land,\nA realm of ten thousand *lí* [42] in expanse,\nWhere clouds enfold a thousand homes.\nThe *zhī* [43] is called \"Nurturing Spirit\",\nBreathing the jade-like *ruìqì* [44] of the blessed fields.\nThe medicine is named \"Immortal,\"—\nReviving the world’s withered bones.\nNone are sick who do not recover,\nAnd all who have merit shall meet it.\nTest the divine herbs,\nAnd surely the years of *Guǐgǔ* [45] shall be matched.\nSeek the blessed child,\nAnd none shall surpass the *Jūnfáng* [46] carriage.\nThe sacred seedlings rise but a few *cùn* [47],\nYet resemble the immortal gourd.\nDivine waters, but a sip,\nNourish strange and wondrous growths.\nTheir fame surpasses the ten mountains,\nTheir brilliance excels the four seas.\nI present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay I dance in feathered robes,\nAnd in a breath fly past the immortal mountains.\nMay I wander through the *Dòngzhāng* [48] scriptures,\nAnd ten thousand times fulfill the Dao of immortality.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nThe ancestral *Zǔzhōu*

hungry, one feasts on *Huángbì* [49] elixirs in golden cauldrons,\nWhen thirsty, one drinks from jade roots through crystal gates.\nI pray to transcend with sacred offerings,\nAnd freely roam the *Fānghú* [50] and *Yuánjiǎo* [51] peaks.\n\nIn the eighth *Yánzhōu* [52] of flames,\nThe *qì* [53] divides at the Southern Pole,\nAnd the land is anchored by the *Lígōng* [54] palace.\nTrue fire blazes, stretching ten thousand *zhàng* [55] through the heavens.\nGreat waves surge, rising a thousand *xún* [56] high.\nRefining the *yīnbò* [57] to ascend,\nRiding the *yángguāng* [58] to attain liberation.\nThe *Mòshēng* [59] cloth is named for fire-washing,\nCleansing the dust of life within the fierce flames.\nThe *Fēngshēng* [60] beasts are so called,\nFor they regrow their feathers beneath the piled firewood.\nGreat *Dānyào* [61] flows like fire,\nAnd the palaces of the *Guānyà* [62] are solemn and grand.\nThe High Saints and True Worthies,\nTheir majesty and splendor dazzle all.\nAll are abodes of gods and immortals,\nAnd they communicate with the Central Lands.\nI present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.\n*Humbly praying:*\nMay my jade eyes be refined in essence,\nAnd receive the true seal of life’s decree.\nMay I master the *Jīnyè* [63] alchemy,\nAnd attain the immortal arts of returning the soul.\nThe faithful take refuge,\nAnd extol the virtues.\n\nThe *Yánzhōu* [52] alone connects with mortal realms,\nWhere a thousand-*lǐ* [64] voyage leads into the Han palaces.\nSteam and flames stretch through the heavens, scaring birds to flight,\nAnd surging waves encircle the shores, where giant turtles reign.\nThe upper realm of *Nánchāng* [65] opens to the flowing fire,\nAnd the *Dōngjǐng* [66] pools meet the *Tàikōng* [67].\nI

cauldron,\nAnd the medicinal vapors form the elixir.\nThe *Ruòshuǐ* [72] surrounds the isle,\nAnd no bird’s feathers may float upon it.\nThose who arrive here are High Saints and True Immortals,\nAnd

offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\n\nI humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,\nMy body be as light as a single leaf—\nAnd as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe first *Kūnlún* island,\nCircled by weak waters, named *Kūnlún* alone.\nGazing southeast, it meets the *Shípǔ* realm of immortal roaming;\nLooking northwest, it stands as the northern gate of *Dòngtiān*.\nThe well draws from the great *Dàhuó* fountain,\nAnd the path leads into the southern valley of the city.\n\nHere, the true immortals gather,\nAnd the assembled saints come to visit.\nThe *Jīshí* mountains stretch westward,\nRevealing the *Xīmǔ* tortoise platform’s location;\nThe *Yǎnpén* cliffs rise steeply,\nUnlocking the *Mùwáng*’s path to immortality.\n\nThe *Huāzūn* grove bears its name,\nAnd its peak is called *Làngfēng*.\nThe *Tiānyōng* city towers high,\nWith heaped

sealed;\nThe eight thousand long-life peaches,\nBloom eternally without fading.\n\nAbove, it connects to the *Xuánxī* [83] celestial bureau,\nBelow, it overlooks the *Shùhài* [84] mortal domain.\nHere, the five elements flow harmoniously,\nAnd the six *qì* are balanced in measure.\nTruly a blessed hall’s domain,\nA land of eternal joy indeed.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\nI humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,\nMy body be as light as a single leaf—\nAnd as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.\nThe

separated from *Xiányáng* by earth,\nThe palace links to the Queen Mother’s realm, waters embracing all.\nTo the north, the great *Dàhuó* well flows with elixir,\nTo the west, the golden city gazes upon the *Ànbì* [85] jade pool.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nAnd listen to the Dao’s mysteries upon the *Làngfēng* platform.\n\nThe second *Fāngzhàng* island,\nIts peaks like piled jade, piercing the layered heavens.\nFlowers like liquid gold, clustering beside towering ridges.\nHere, the palaces gather gold, jade, and *lúlí* [86],\nTheir light rivaling stars and constellations;\nAnd the halls of *jiāoqíng* [87] and *lóngshèn* [88] dragons,\nTheir depths swallowed by the boundless sea.\n\nThis is the third heaven’s abode of the *Sīmìng* [89] sovereign,\nAnd the true dwelling of the *Jiǔyuán Zhàngrén* [90].\nHe governs the gods of all earthly waters,\nAnd examines the scrolls of mortals seeking the Dao.\n\nGolden nectar and jade marrow,\nDrink them, and hunger is forgotten for ten thousand *jié* [91];\nAuspicious grasses and *língzhī* [92] mushrooms,\nWear them, and no dust clings at all.\n\nThe stone springs flow with moisture,\nUnceasing for a thousand years;\nThe mulberries and *shānzhēn* [93] berries thrive,\nEvergreen for ten thousand autumns.\nWhen the immortal children ascend to the heavens,\nThey visit the high sages’ platform of scriptures.\n\nThe *Fù* [94] is granted to the *Xuányuán* [95],\nAnd the name is known to the *Tàishàng* [96].\nTheir ranks are honored and exalted,\nTheir stations pure and lofty.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\n\nI humbly wish that the assembly of the immortals upholds me,\nTo ascend the golden gate and enter the jade hall—\nWith a single thought, I soar beyond,\nCarrying the *Tàishān* [97] and crossing the *Běihǎi* [98].\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nThe *Fāngzhàng* island in the sea gathers the gods,\nIts earthly form towering and distinct from the heavens.\nGolden phoenixes abound in their brooding nests,\nAnd who guides the jade ointment to nourish the *zhītián* [99]?\nThe towers and halls shine with the *Sānqīng* [100] path’s light,\nAnd the flowers and trees float in five-colored mist.\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nNo need to turn back and mourn the dusty ties.\n\nThe third *Péngqiū* island,\nCircumscribed by five thousand *lǐ* and more,\nAscending to the thirty-two heavens.\n\nTo the north, it stands apart from the *Zhōngshān* [101],\nAnd in the center, it connects to the vast seas.\nBeyond the *Nèi’ā* [102] gate,\nLies the ninth heaven’s palace of the sovereign lord;\nWithin the *Míngbó* [103] waves,\nRises the three-island realm of cloudy verdure.\n\nFlying immortals come and go,\nAuspicious mists drifting and veiling.\nJingling ornaments and jade pendants,\nArrayed in the celestial court’s order;\nFaint *shēngxiāo* [104] and *zhèngxiāo* [105] music,\nPlaying the songs of the *Diàolè* [106] fishing festival.\n\nChildren from the eight seas scatter flowers,\nAnd attendants of the five clouds hold parasols in reverence.\nThe *Qióngbiē* [107] tortoise and *Yīyī* [108] monster,\nCarry stones to form the mountains;\nThe immortal phoenix lingers and hesitates,\nBeak-laden with blossoms for offerings.\n\nThe sound of *Bùxū* [109] steps resounds,\nAnd the rainbow clouds gather at the *Yáofēng* [110] peak;\nThe *Fànjīng* [111] bell’s tones descend,\nAnd the crimson banners return to the *Zǐfǔ* [112] palace.\n\nOne year in the mountain,\nIs a hundred years in the mortal world.\nFeasting on *rú* [113] and *cāngjīng* [114],\nNo need for the arts of abstaining from food;\nDwelling in spirit and severing desires,\nWhy cling to the hand-holding of the mundane?\n\nNo suffering from cold or heat,\nNo entanglement in wealth or fame.\nFree and unbounded, joy without end.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.\nI humbly wish that when the *juéhuā* [115] blooms, I awaken,\nThe winds of the ten islands ever spring;\nAnd when yesterday’s dream fades,\nThe mists of the three islands linger yet.\n\nThe assembly of the Law is devout,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\n*Pénglái* [116] divides the fates and calms the surging waves,\nThe great emperor’s consort and the assembled saints.\nFive-colored snows float upon the jade *liào* [117],\nAnd ninefold *Qīng* [118] stars and moons shine from the golden *áoxiāo* [119].\nThe *Yáotái* [120] platform’s shadow dips into the cold celestial heart,\nAnd the jade gates’ light ascends above the high sea.\n\nWith sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,\nAnd personally accompany the Queen Mother in feasting upon the *Pántáo* [121].\n\nFor though blessed lands and *Dòngtiān* [122] realms\nLie not beyond the dusty world,\nAnd though the gods and saints attain enlightenment,\nThey yet reside within the mundane.\nThose who cultivate feel the response naturally,\nWhile those who neglect are bound by emotional ties.\nOnly the high sages’ compassion,\nReveals the purity of the immortal realm.\nThus, mortals abandon toil and return to the Great Dao,\nFortunate to meet this assembly, guided by the sacred rites.\n\nNow, I rely upon the benevolent power,\nTo be led to the true path.\nForever free from the mortal cage,\nI soar beyond the celestial realm.\nThe assembly of the Law takes refuge,\nAnd extols the virtues of the sacred.\n\nAlas, the mortal world is but a fleeting horse,\nAnd the bonds of wealth and fame confine us like locks and reins.\nWe fail to grasp that all existence is contingent,\nYet take our labors and sorrows as joy and delight.\nWhat use are honor and riches
