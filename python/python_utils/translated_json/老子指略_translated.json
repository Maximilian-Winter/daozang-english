  "full_translation": "**Wang Bi’s *Exposition on the Meaning of the Laozi***\n\nThat by which things are born and achievements are accomplished must arise from the formless and proceed from the nameless. The formless and nameless are the origin of the myriad things. Neither warm nor cool, neither gong nor shang—hearing it, one cannot grasp its sound; seeing it, one cannot perceive its manifestation; embodying it, one cannot comprehend its nature; tasting it, one cannot savor its flavor. Thus, as a thing, it is undifferentiated; as an image, it is formless; as a sound, it is silent; as a flavor, it is without manifestation. Therefore, it serves as the lord and origin of all things, encompassing heaven and earth, pervading all without exception.\n\nIf it were warm, it could not be cool; if it were gong, it could not be shang. Form must have its distinctions; sound must have its categories. Thus, that which has image and form is not the great image; that which has sound and tone is not the great sound. However, if the four images do not take form, the great image cannot be fully expressed; if the five tones do not produce sound, the great sound cannot fully arrive. When the four images take form yet things have no master, the great image is fully expressed; when the five tones produce sound yet the mind has no attachment, the great sound fully arrives.\n\nThus, grasping the great image, the world comes to it; employing the great sound, customs are transformed. When the formless is fully expressed, though the world comes to it, it comes without being able to let go; when the silent sound fully arrives, though customs are transformed, they are transformed without being discerned.\n\nTherefore, heaven generates the five agents, yet none of them are employed. The sage practices the five teachings, yet does not speak to transform. Hence, “The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.” The mother of the five agents is neither hot nor cold, neither soft nor hard; the mother of the five teachings is neither bright nor dim, neither kind nor harmful. Though ancient and modern differ, times change and customs shift, this does not change—what is called “from ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.”\n\nIf heaven did not act through this, things would not be born; if governance did not proceed from this, achievements would not be accomplished. Thus, ancient and modern are connected, beginning and end are the same. Holding to the ancient can guide the present; verifying the present can reveal the ancient beginning—this is what is called “constant.” Without the appearance of brightness or dimness, warmth or coolness, it is thus “called constant and luminous.” The birth of things and the accomplishment of achievements all proceed from this, hence “by which the multitudes are examined.”\n\nThe swiftness of thunder is not sufficient to traverse all in an instant; the speed of riding the wind is not sufficient to reach in a single breath. True swiftness lies in not hurrying; true arrival lies in not moving. Thus, the utmost of what can be spoken is not sufficient to govern heaven and earth; the extremity of the formed is not sufficient to contain the myriad things. Therefore, those who sigh over it cannot exhaust its beauty; those who chant it cannot express its vastness. Naming it cannot capture it; describing it cannot encompass it. Names must have their distinctions; descriptions must have their origins. With distinctions, there is incompleteness; with origins, there is insufficiency. Incompleteness deviates greatly from the true; insufficiency cannot be named—this can be expounded and made clear.\n\nAs for the “Dao,” it is taken from what the myriad things proceed from; “mysterious” is taken from what emerges from the obscure; “profound” is taken from what is unfathomable in its intricacy; “great” is taken from what pervades and can be reached; “distant” is taken from what stretches far and cannot be reached; “subtle” is taken from what is imperceptibly fine and cannot be discerned.\n\nThus, the terms “Dao,” “mysterious,” “profound,” “great,” “subtle,” and “distant” each have their meanings, yet do not exhaust its extremity. However, that which pervades without limit cannot be called small; that which is subtly wondrous and formless cannot be called great. Therefore, the text says, “It is named ‘Dao,’” “It is called ‘mysterious,’” yet does not name it.\n\nThus, those who speak of it lose its constancy; those who name it depart from its truth; those who act upon it ruin its nature; those who grasp it lose its origin. Therefore, the sage does not take speech as primary and thus does not violate its constancy; does not take names as constant and thus does not depart from its truth; does not take action as affairs and thus does not ruin its nature; does not take grasping as control and thus does not lose its origin.\n\nThus, the text of the *Laozi* seeks to debate and question, yet loses its essence; seeks to name and demand, yet violates its meaning. Its great return lies in discussing the origin of the great beginning to clarify the nature of spontaneity, and expounding the extremity of the obscure to settle the delusions of confusion. Following without violation, diminishing without imposition; esteeming the root to still the branches, guarding the mother to preserve the child; despising clever techniques, acting before things arise; not blaming others, but seeking within oneself—these are its essential points.\n\nYet the Legalists esteem uniformity and have already implemented punishments to restrain. The Logicians esteem defining reality and have already used words to correct. The Confucians esteem complete love and have used praise to advance. The Mohists esteem frugality and have used rectification to establish. The Eclectics esteem various excellences and have used synthesis to practice.\n\nPunishments to restrain things inevitably give rise to craft and deceit; names to define things inevitably lose principle and forgiveness; praise to advance things inevitably gives rise to contention and esteem; rectification to establish things inevitably produces discord and opposition; synthesis to practice things inevitably stirs up filth and chaos. These all employ the child and abandon the mother. Things lose their place and cannot be preserved.\n\nYet though their paths converge, their aims diverge. Though their unions align, their pursuits differ, and scholars are confused about their destinations, lost in their directions. Observing their mysterious unity, they call it Legalism; perceiving their fixed reality, they call it Logicians; examining their pure love, they call it Confucianism...\n\nObserving their restraint and frugality, they call it Mohism; perceiving their lack of attachment, they call it Eclecticism. Following what they observe to rectify names, yielding to their preferences to hold fast to intentions—thus arise tangled, confused, and contradictory discourses, disputes over divergent paths and refined distinctions, all stemming from this.\n\nMoreover, in its composition, it cites the end to verify the beginning, and the beginning to exhaust the end. It opens but does not force conclusions, guides but does not drag. Only after tracing does it fulfill its meaning; only after inference does it exhaust its principle. Skillfully initiating matters to uphold its argument, it clarifies convergence to conclude its text. Thus, those who share its aims and are moved by it cannot but admire the inception of its words and expand upon them; those of differing purposes who compose independently cannot but delight in the signs of its convergence and take them as proof.\n\nThough paths may differ, they must share the same destination; though thoughts may be a hundredfold, they must converge in their aim. By grasping this convergence and aim to elucidate principle, those who reflect upon kindred matters cannot but rejoice in the resonance of their thoughts, taking it as the attainment of meaning.\n\nAll things endure by reverting to their form; achievements succeed by reverting to their name. That which endures does not take endurance as endurance, but by not forgetting its peril; that which is secure does not take security as security, but by not forgetting its danger. Thus, those who preserve their endurance perish, while those who do not forget peril endure; those who secure their position are imperiled, while those who do not forget danger are secure.\n\nTo lift an autumn hair with ease, to hear thunder as a whisper—this is how the Dao inverts form. Security is truly secure, yet it is said to be not the security of security; endurance is truly enduring, yet it is said to be not the endurance of endurance. Lords and kings are truly exalted, yet it is said to be not the exaltation of exaltation; heaven and earth are truly great, yet it is said to be not the greatness of greatness. Sagely works truly exist, yet it is said to be the establishment of abolishing sageliness; virtuous power is truly manifest, yet it is said to be the existence of abandoning virtue. Thus, those who see form but do not reach the Dao cannot but resent its words.\n\nTo determine the root of things, though near, one must begin from afar to verify its origin. To clarify the source of things, though evident, one must begin from the obscure to narrate its foundation. Thus, one draws from beyond heaven and earth to illuminate what lies within the body; one clarifies the meaning of lords and kings as orphaned and solitary, then follows the One of the Dao to proclaim its beginning. Thus, those who examine the near but do not grasp the origin of the flowing unity cannot but dismiss its words as absurd and empty.\n\nHence, these various expositions each advance their own doctrines, and people praise their disorder. Some find its words circuitous, others mock its arguments—now clear, now obscure; now distinct, now confused—all arising from this.\n\nNames serve to define the other; terms follow what is designated. Names arise from the other, terms emerge from the self. Thus, when traversing where no thing is untouched, it is termed the Dao; when seeking where no subtlety is unmanifest, it is called the Mysterious. Subtlety emerges from the Mysterious, the multitude proceeds from the Dao.\n\nThus, \"It gives them life and rears them,\" without obstruction or blockage, penetrating the nature of things—this is called the Dao. \"It gives them life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate\"—possessing virtue yet without mastery—this is the power of the Mysterious. \"Mysterious\" signifies depth; \"Dao\" is the greatest of terms.\n\nNames and designations arise from forms and appearances; terms and appellations emerge from traversal and inquiry. Names and designations do not arise in vain; terms and appellations do not emerge without cause. Thus, names and designations greatly miss the essence, while terms and appellations do not exhaust the ultimate. Hence, to speak of the Mysterious is to say \"mysterious and yet again mysterious\"; to speak of the Dao is to say \"within the realm, there are four great ones.\"\n\nThe *Laozi* can nearly be encapsulated in a single phrase. Alas! It is simply to exalt the root and quiet the branches. Observing its origins, tracing its return, its words do not stray from the source, its affairs do not lose the master. Though its text spans five thousand characters, what unifies it is one; though its meanings are vast and far-reaching, the multitude shares the same kind. To grasp one phrase and encompass it, there is no subtlety unrecognized; to treat each matter with its own intent, though eloquent, one grows only more confused.\n\nLet us attempt to discuss it: Does the rise of perversity stem from the deeds of the perverse? Does the emergence of excess arise from the creations of the excessive? Thus, to guard against perversity lies in preserving admonition, not in scrutinizing goodness; to quell excess lies in removing ornamentation, not in amplifying embellishment; to eradicate theft lies in eliminating desire, not in severe punishments; to end litigation lies in not esteeming, not in skillful adjudication.\n\nThus, do not attack their deeds, but render them without the intent to act; do not harm their desires, but render them without the intent to desire. Plan before signs appear, act before beginnings arise—this suffices. Therefore, exhausting sagely wisdom to govern craft and deceit is not as good as perceiving plainness to quiet the people’s desires; promoting benevolence and righteousness to thicken thin customs is not as good as embracing simplicity to preserve sincerity; multiplying clever advantages to initiate affairs and uses is not as good as reducing self-interest to cease ostentatious competition.\n\nThus, abolish surveillance, conceal acuity, discard incentives, diminish ostentatious praise, abandon clever uses, and devalue treasures. The key lies in preventing the people’s loves and desires from arising, not in attacking their perverse deeds. Thus, perceiving plainness to abolish sagely wisdom, reducing self-interest to discard clever advantages—these are what it means to exalt the root and quiet the branches.\n\nFor the Way of plainness is not manifest, while the allure of desires is not concealed. Though one exhausts sagely brightness to scrutinize it, expends wisdom and thought to attack it, craft grows more refined, deceit more varied—the more intensely one attacks, the more diligently it is evaded. Then the wise and foolish deceive one another, the six relations grow suspicious, simplicity scatters, truth departs, and affairs harbor their treachery. Abandoning the root to attack the branches, even with the utmost sagely wisdom, only deepens this disaster—how much more so for those with lesser methods!\n\nTo govern with plainness is to achieve rectification without action.\n\nTo attack with sagely wisdom is to exhaust the people and multiply their craft. Thus plainness may be embraced, while sagely wisdom may be discarded. When scrutiny is relaxed, evasion diminishes; when one exhausts keen perception, escape becomes equally perceptive. Simplicity brings few harms to plainness, while density deepens craft and deceit. Is the art of probing the hidden and exploring the obscure the sole province of sagely wisdom? The perils it brings—how can they be recounted! A hundredfold profit is not yet considered great.\n\nIf one cannot distinguish names, one cannot speak of principle; if one cannot fix names, one cannot discuss reality. Names arise from forms—there has never been a form born of a name. Thus, where there is this name, there must be this form; where there is this form, there must be its proper place. Benevolence cannot be called sageliness, nor wisdom called benevolence—each has its own reality. To perceive the subtlest is the utmost of clarity; to probe the concealed is the utmost of thought. Can one who exhausts utmost clarity not be called sagely? Can one who exhausts utmost thought not be called wise? By verifying reality and fixing names, one may observe the abandonment of sageliness without confusion.\n\nWhen the virtue of honest plainness is not manifest, while the beauty of names and forms is esteemed, people cultivate what is esteemed in hopes of praise, follow what is advocated in pursuit of profit. Yearning for praise and profit, they labor at their conduct—names grow more beautiful, yet sincerity grows more distant; profits grow heavier, yet hearts grow more competitive. Fathers and sons, brothers, conceal their feelings and lose their integrity; filial piety cannot bear sincerity, nor kindness bear truth—all this is brought about by the pursuit of illustrious names and conduct. To lament the shallowness of customs and exalt benevolence and righteousness only deepens deceit—how much more so for those with baser methods! Thus, to abandon benevolence and discard righteousness in order to restore filial piety and kindness is not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen walls grow high, siege engines arise; when profit flourishes, schemes deepen. If one remains free of desire, even rewards will not incite theft; if private desires prevail, craft and profit grow ever more obscured. Thus, to discard craft and abandon profit, replacing them with few desires, is not yet enough to praise the absence of thieves and bandits.\n\nSagely wisdom is the finest of talents; benevolence and righteousness are the greatest of conduct; craft and profit are the best of applications. If the root is not preserved, yet these three virtues are promoted, harm will still follow—how much more so when methods are employed for profit, thus neglecting plainness! Thus, the ancients sighed: How difficult it is for things to be understood! One knows that the unsagely are not sagely, yet does not know that the sagely are not sagely; one knows that the unbenevolent are not benevolent, yet does not know that benevolence is not benevolence.\n\nOnly by abandoning sageliness is sagely achievement complete; only by discarding benevolence is the virtue of benevolence profound. To detest strength is not to desire weakness—pursuing strength loses strength; to reject benevolence is not to desire unbenevolence—practicing benevolence breeds deceit. To govern may yet bring chaos; to preserve security may yet bring peril. To place oneself last is to be first—being first is not something the first can achieve; to treat oneself as external is to preserve oneself—preservation is not something preservation can effect. Achievement cannot be seized, nor beauty employed. Thus, one must seize only that which gives rise to achievement.\n\nThe text states: \"Having known the child,\" one must \"return to guard the mother.\" Following this principle, where can one not find smooth passage?",

      "translated_text": "**Wang Bi’s *Exposition on the Meaning of the Laozi***\n\nThat by which things are born and achievements are accomplished must arise from the formless and proceed from the nameless.

Following what they observe to rectify names, yielding to their preferences to hold fast to intentions—thus arise tangled, confused, and contradictory discourses, disputes over divergent paths and refined distinctions, all stemming from this.\n\nMoreover, in its composition, it cites the end to verify the beginning, and the beginning to exhaust the end. It opens but does not force conclusions, guides but does not drag. Only after tracing does it fulfill its meaning; only after inference does it exhaust its principle. Skillfully initiating matters to uphold its argument, it clarifies convergence to conclude its text. Thus, those who share its aims and are moved by it cannot but admire the inception of its words and expand upon them; those of differing purposes who compose independently cannot but delight in the signs of its convergence and take them as proof.\n\nThough paths may differ, they must share the same destination; though thoughts may be a hundredfold, they must converge in their aim. By grasping this convergence and aim to elucidate principle, those who reflect upon kindred matters cannot but rejoice in the resonance of their thoughts, taking it as the attainment of meaning.\n\nAll things endure by reverting to their form; achievements succeed by reverting to their name. That which endures does not take endurance as endurance, but by not forgetting its peril; that which is secure does not take security as security, but by not forgetting its danger. Thus, those who preserve their endurance perish, while those who do not forget peril endure; those who secure their position are imperiled, while those who do not forget danger are secure.\n\nTo lift an autumn hair with ease, to hear thunder as a whisper—this is how the Dao inverts form. Security is truly secure, yet it is said to be not the security of security; endurance is truly enduring, yet it is said to be not the endurance of endurance. Lords and kings are truly exalted, yet it is said to be not the exaltation of exaltation; heaven and earth are truly great, yet it is said to be not the greatness of greatness. Sagely works truly exist, yet it is said to be the establishment of abolishing sageliness; virtuous power is truly manifest, yet it is said to be the existence of abandoning virtue. Thus, those who see form but do not reach the Dao cannot but resent its words.\n\nTo determine the root of things, though near, one must begin from afar to verify its origin. To clarify the source of things, though evident, one must begin from the obscure to narrate its foundation. Thus, one draws from beyond heaven and earth to illuminate what lies within the body; one clarifies the meaning of lords and kings as orphaned and solitary, then follows the One of the Dao to proclaim its beginning. Thus, those who examine the near but do not grasp the origin of the flowing unity cannot but dismiss its words as absurd and empty.\n\nHence, these various expositions each advance their own doctrines, and people praise their disorder. Some find its words circuitous, others mock its arguments—now clear, now obscure; now distinct, now confused—all arising from this.\n\nNames serve to define the other; terms follow what is designated. Names arise from the other, terms emerge from the self. Thus, when traversing where no thing is untouched, it is termed the Dao; when seeking where no subtlety is unmanifest, it is called the Mysterious. Subtlety emerges from the Mysterious, the multitude proceeds from the Dao.\n\nThus, \"It gives them life and rears them,\" without obstruction or blockage, penetrating the nature of things—this is called the Dao. \"It gives them life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate\"—possessing virtue yet without mastery—this is the power of the Mysterious. \"Mysterious\" signifies depth; \"Dao\" is the greatest of terms.\n\nNames and designations arise from forms and appearances; terms and appellations emerge from traversal and inquiry. Names and designations do not arise in vain; terms and appellations do not emerge without cause. Thus, names and designations greatly miss the essence, while terms and appellations do not exhaust the ultimate. Hence, to speak of the Mysterious is to say \"mysterious and yet again mysterious\"; to speak of the Dao is to say \"within the realm, there are four great ones.\"\n\nThe *Laozi* can nearly be encapsulated in a single phrase. Alas! It is simply to exalt the root and quiet the branches. Observing its origins, tracing its return, its words do not stray from the source, its affairs do not lose the master. Though its text spans five thousand characters, what unifies it is one; though its meanings are vast and far-reaching, the multitude shares the same kind. To grasp one phrase and encompass it, there is no subtlety unrecognized; to treat each matter with its own intent, though eloquent, one grows only more confused.\n\nLet us attempt to discuss it: Does the rise of perversity stem from the deeds of the perverse? Does the emergence of excess arise from the creations of the excessive? Thus, to guard against perversity lies in preserving admonition, not in scrutinizing goodness; to quell excess lies in removing ornamentation, not in amplifying embellishment; to eradicate theft lies in eliminating desire, not in severe punishments; to end litigation lies in not esteeming, not in skillful adjudication.\n\nThus, do not attack their deeds, but render them without the intent to act; do not harm their desires, but render them without the intent to desire. Plan before signs appear, act before beginnings arise—this suffices. Therefore, exhausting sagely wisdom to govern craft and deceit is not as good as perceiving plainness to quiet the people’s desires; promoting benevolence and righteousness to thicken thin customs is not as good as embracing simplicity to preserve sincerity; multiplying clever advantages to initiate affairs and uses is not as good as reducing self-interest to cease ostentatious competition.\n\nThus, abolish surveillance, conceal acuity, discard incentives, diminish ostentatious praise, abandon clever uses, and devalue treasures. The key lies in preventing the people’s loves and desires from arising, not in attacking their perverse deeds. Thus, perceiving plainness to abolish sagely wisdom, reducing self-interest to discard clever advantages—these are what it means to exalt the root and quiet the branches.\n\nFor the Way of plainness is not manifest, while the allure of desires is not concealed. Though one exhausts sagely brightness to scrutinize it, expends wisdom and thought to attack it, craft grows more refined, deceit more varied—the more intensely one attacks, the more diligently it is evaded. Then the wise and foolish deceive one another, the six relations grow suspicious, simplicity scatters, truth departs, and affairs harbor their treachery. Abandoning the root to attack the branches, even with the utmost sagely wisdom, only deepens this disaster—how much more so for those with lesser methods!\n\nTo govern with plainness is to achieve rectification without action.",

      "translated_text": "To attack with sagely wisdom is to exhaust the people and multiply their craft. Thus plainness may be embraced, while sagely wisdom may be discarded. When scrutiny is relaxed, evasion diminishes; when one exhausts keen perception, escape becomes equally perceptive. Simplicity brings few harms to plainness, while density deepens craft and deceit. Is the art of probing the hidden and exploring the obscure the sole province of sagely wisdom? The perils it brings—how can they be recounted! A hundredfold profit is not yet considered great.\n\nIf one cannot distinguish names, one cannot speak of principle; if one cannot fix names, one cannot discuss reality. Names arise from forms—there has never been a form born of a name. Thus, where there is this name, there must be this form; where there is this form, there must be its proper place. Benevolence cannot be called sageliness, nor wisdom called benevolence—each has its own reality. To perceive the subtlest is the utmost of clarity; to probe the concealed is the utmost of thought. Can one who exhausts utmost clarity not be called sagely? Can one who exhausts utmost thought not be called wise? By verifying reality and fixing names, one may observe the abandonment of sageliness without confusion.\n\nWhen the virtue of honest plainness is not manifest, while the beauty of names and forms is esteemed, people cultivate what is esteemed in hopes of praise, follow what is advocated in pursuit of profit. Yearning for praise and profit, they labor at their conduct—names grow more beautiful, yet sincerity grows more distant; profits grow heavier, yet hearts grow more competitive. Fathers and sons, brothers, conceal their feelings and lose their integrity; filial piety cannot bear sincerity, nor kindness bear truth—all this is brought about by the pursuit of illustrious names and conduct. To lament the shallowness of customs and exalt benevolence and righteousness only deepens deceit—how much more so for those with baser methods! Thus, to abandon benevolence and discard righteousness in order to restore filial piety and kindness is not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen walls grow high, siege engines arise; when profit flourishes, schemes deepen. If one remains free of desire, even rewards will not incite theft; if private desires prevail, craft and profit grow ever more obscured. Thus, to discard craft and abandon profit, replacing them with few desires, is not yet enough to praise the absence of thieves and bandits.\n\nSagely wisdom is the finest of talents; benevolence and righteousness are the greatest of conduct; craft and profit are the best of applications. If the root is not preserved, yet these three virtues are promoted, harm will still follow—how much more so when methods are employed for profit, thus neglecting plainness! Thus, the ancients sighed: How difficult it is for things to be understood! One knows that the unsagely are not sagely, yet does not know that the sagely are not sagely; one knows that the unbenevolent are not benevolent, yet does not know that benevolence is not benevolence.\n\nOnly by abandoning sageliness is sagely achievement complete; only by discarding benevolence is the virtue of benevolence profound. To detest strength is not to desire weakness—pursuing strength loses strength; to reject benevolence is not to desire unbenevolence—practicing benevolence breeds deceit. To govern may yet bring chaos; to preserve security may yet bring peril. To place oneself last is to be first—being first is not something the first can achieve; to treat oneself as external is to preserve oneself—preservation is not something preservation can effect. Achievement cannot be seized, nor beauty employed. Thus, one must seize only that which gives rise to achievement.\n\nThe text states: \"Having known the child,\" one must \"return to guard the mother.\" Following this principle, where can one not find smooth passage?",
