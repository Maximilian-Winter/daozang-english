  "full_translation": "**The Dongyuan Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Dongyuan Collection*\n**Author:** Jin Changquanzi\n**Five fascicles.**\n**Source edition:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Tai Xuan* Section.\n\n---\n\n### *The Dongyuan Collection, Fascicle One*\n**Author:** Guishan Changquanzi\n\n#### **First Chapter: The Supreme Book, Part One**\n\n**Section One: The Double Mystery**\nThe Double Mystery illumines the vast—this is called the Primordial Obscurity. The most wondrous rides the light, and thus is supreme. It flows and spreads before the Great Ultimate, yet abides firmly after the final extinction. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, pervading the four wilds. Following what has never begun, presiding over what has never taken form, the Obscure holds the pivot, the Signified bears the Other. Chaotic and boundless, solemn and radiant—it transforms and gives birth to the ten thousand things, responding to the yearning of drought and famine. Vast and towering, it cannot be named or imaged. Thus, those who attain it dare not adorn it with disputation; those who know it dare not treat it as trivial. They preserve it with integrity and caution, abide in it with serenity and joy, and when the time is right, it flourishes greatly. It pervades the whole as one body, its numinous transformations inexhaustible. Its spirit is unfathomable, yet its essence is utterly refined.\n\n**Section Two: The Pure and Unadorned**\nThe pure and unadorned abide in stillness. They treasure essence and preserve spirit, nurture *qi* in tranquility, and conceal their will in emptiness and vastness. Amidst the boundless expanse between Heaven and Earth, things cannot intrude. Whether leaning or rising, they do not lose their authenticity. They dwell in honor and prominence without delight, in poverty and lowliness without aversion. Water and fire, the four seasons—none can steal their truth. This is called possessing virtue and knowing what Heaven intends. Only then can one know the Great Mystery, the Great Order, the Great Purity, the Great Virtue, the Great Sustainer, the Great Conduct, the Great Uncarved, the Great Wisdom, the Great Tranquility, and the Great Penetration. This is perfection. The Great Mystery is trodden, the Great Order is examined, the Great Purity is inhabited, the Great Virtue is shepherded, the Great Sustainer is broadened, the Great Conduct is enacted, the Great Uncarved is completed, the Great Wisdom is deepened, the Great Tranquility is guarded, and the Great Penetration is esteemed. When these ten matters are thoroughly mastered, purity reaches its utmost. Thus, there is nothing that cannot be done, nothing that is not wondrous. Effaced and thoughtless, serene and non-active—this is its boundary.\n\n**Section Three: Attaining the Dao**\nAttaining the Dao is the accomplishment of Heaven, without limit or boundary. Vast and boundless, it fills the Six Voids, roaming beyond the Four Seas. Now observing, now leaning—like the shadowless tree of Yuzhang. Now circling, now wandering—like the garden of Three Blossoms and eternal life. Reclining at the gate of the Rare and the Utmost Unity, steadfast and at ease. In the vast chambers of the Dark Lord and Dongting, floating and settled, entering and exiting. Free and unfettered in the boundless wilds of the Great Square—its dwelling has no end. Such a person, such a principle—nothing can harm them. Wherever they go, they arrive; yet their end is unknown. Thus it is said: Though ants climb stalks, tiles and excrement, birds and beasts, grasses and trees—none are excluded. That which gives rise to things is itself no-thing. Yet the common people of the world, in their daily frenzy, know nothing of this.\n\n**Section Four: The Great Harmony**\nThe Great Harmony is most wondrous—profound and boundless, its Dao deep as the transformations of water. When its primal state stirs, even divination by tortoise and milfoil cannot foretell its omens. Vast and tranquil in heart, it darkly pervades the ten thousand directions. Undifferentiated yet manifest, it revolves without constancy. Flowing in favorable times, it ripples with self-contentment. Non-active, without near or far, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order. Deceit, artifice, and false emotions—restless and agitated—cannot measure its use.\n\n**Section Five: The Vast and Penetrating**\nThe vast and penetrating accord with the great sequence, spontaneously giving rise to the nature of the ten thousand things. At rest, it is like an empty valley; in motion, like a spring breeze. Its transformations cover all beings. Thus, its will is not reckless, its words have no limit or strangeness. It does not excel in Heaven’s work, nor is it clumsy in human affairs. Once it attains the center of the circle, it responds to the inexhaustible—whether left or right, it suffices.\n\n**Section Six: The Water Mirror**\nThe Water Mirror is bright and clear; its Dao is resplendent, like Heaven’s hanging images. Its responses are like an echo; its reflections, like a spirit. Impartial and without omission, it embraces and fuses with the ten thousand existences. Serene and without attachment, it is limpid, luminous, and adorned. It distinguishes beauty and ugliness, long and short, movement and stillness—all are evident to the ear. Now, the hand’s grasp, the foot’s swiftness, the eye’s clarity, the ear’s acuity, the body’s beauty, the faculties’ mastery, the completion of the many—none can be altered. Disaster strikes suddenly, day by day increasing, yet people treasure it as their own—is this not perilous? Thus it is said: Its return is swift in achievement; its fruition awaits duration. Therefore, the sage governs things and orders the world—his Dao resembles this. Drifting without attachment, how could there be a place for grasping? Forms manifest themselves; it moistens above and nourishes below. Illuminating one use without weariness, things naturally turn away. The Dao has never had boundaries.\n\n**Section Seven: Accordance with the Constant**\nAccordance with the Constant is without delusion. In action and repose, it is fitting and exhausts the Dao. Holding the left tally and proceeding, pure yet accommodating things, worldly entanglements do not disturb the heart. Cultivating thought and preserving truth, though immersed in the clamor of dust, the solitary remains untransformed, entering the vast Heaven. The empty—this is the abyss of the Dao; the still—this is the dwelling of spirit. Without beginning, it first arose in the Primordial Chaos. The Primordial Chaos was divided into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth arrayed the four seasons; the four seasons mysteriously turned the Five Phases; the Five Phases nourished the ten thousand transformations; the ten thousand transformations returned to the Great Beginning; the Great Beginning wondrously united with the Primal Existence. The Primal Existence—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven—this is where the primal emerges, where it enters, where it is born, where it dies. The multitude does not see its form; things return to their nature, merging with the Primordial Obscurity. The sage conceals himself therein. The ancients—their knowledge reached this point.\n\n**Section Nine: The Obscure and Real**\nThe Obscure and Real wander spiritually, far and distant in the vastness of the Great Brightness.\n\n**Section Ten: The Daoist**\n\nViewed through the Dao, there is no distinction of far or near, vast or minute, pure or turbid, noble or base. In this constancy, the primal emerges as yang and withdraws to conceal itself. Act with assurance yet dare not presume, and the primal will naturally prevail. From the real attain the empty, standing in the unfathomable. Pure and utterly transparent, things have no barrier before it; entering the primal’s boundlessness, yet the primal seeks no cause.\n\nThe Dao is the father and mother of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual pivot of the ten thousand things, the guiding principle of yin and yang, the revolving hub of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, the encompassing thread of the worthy and sage, the true dwelling of spirit and illumination, the deep source of mountains and seas, the great handle of the altars of state, the root and stem of the nature and destiny of all that moves and grows. Most revered and most noble, endless through past and present, ever naturally so—how majestic and great it is!\n\nBy this, one offers ritual to all under Heaven: ghosts lose their numinosity, and the sage does not harm the people. Thus, things that attain it live; humans that attain it endure. Dwelling finds fulfillment, affairs find continuity, conduct finds its direction, joy finds its place. Reverent yet not elated, insulted yet not angered, its tone is free of bitterness, harmonizing with Heaven’s harmony as it should. It illumines what cannot be illumined, discerns what cannot be discerned—like the sea binding the rivers, it receives all with clarity yet declines nothing, vast to the utmost.\n\nTherefore, in stillness and silence, embody it; in profound clarity, oversee its abiding.\n\n**Section Eleven: The Music of Heaven**\n\nThe wondrous tones of Heavenly Music arise from the Beginningless, issuing from the Great Void. They are not of metal or stone, silk or bamboo, gourd or clay, reed or pipe; not of the grand *Da Wu* or the *Zheng Wu* dances, nor the *Zhe Yang* or *Huang E* melodies. The *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* cannot be played, the notes of the twelve pitches cannot be known. Thus, strike it with Supreme Harmony, tune it with the Great Clarity, rouse it with the Cavernous Mystery, move it with the Primal Act, strike it with the Primal String. Its sound and radiance are spontaneous, without beginning or end, without constancy or form. Resounding beyond the eight directions, ringing forth before the Emperor of Images—thus the Dao may be borne and journey with it.\n\nIts pure resonance fills the empty sky, and the sage’s work is born. The sun, moon, and stars scatter to follow their patterns; the ten thousand things follow their generation; the Five Powers respond in fullness—vast and unbounded, yet not self-satisfied. When the month of *Luobin* arrives, the River of Stars congeals, descending as white snow. On the night of Yellow Bell, grasses and trees burst into bloom, and the first stirrings of yang spring arise.\n\nWhen the sage performs this music, auspicious clouds gather, sweet springs well forth; when it ceases, the balmy breeze harmonizes, and the Jade Candle shines. Gazing, one cannot see it; striking, one cannot hear it; pondering, one cannot know it; pursuing, one cannot reach it. It spreads and unfurls without trailing, flowing and scattering, shifting and moving through the boundless. The sound without pause pervades the four voids, filling Heaven and Earth; ghosts and spirits withdraw into seclusion, vast and luminous. The transmission of the boundless gives rise to all things in profusion, winding and endless.\n\n**Section Twelve: The Workings of Mechanism**\n\nThe wondrous workings of mechanism move in response—like a divine vessel, it bows and rises, advances and retreats, gauging depth and shallowness, measuring what is fitting. Progress and withdrawal, lightness and weight—nothing misses its proper place. Its activation brings abundance, benefiting things with moisture, matching the timely rain, awakening principle, aligning with spirit and illumination—yet the people do not know it. Why is this so? Those who excel in penetrating the Dao are thus.\n\n**Section Thirteen: Unwrapping the Bundle**\n\nUnwrap the bundle, release the superfluous—vast and empty, it returns to its natural void. Dissolve right and wrong, cast off profit and harm, discard cunning and wit, temper bold resolve. Thus, in night’s sleep, no startling dread; in day’s waking, no resentful cleverness. Loss and sorrow do not churn within; pain, sickness, grief, and joy do not stray from the heart. Riches, rank, and reward bring no delight; punishments, threats, and prohibitions inspire no fear. Discard the branches, probe the root—such was the ancient perfected one, attuned to its harmony.\n\nLet limbs fall away, dull brilliance and keen hearing, feign the illness of health, know the unknowing. Flowing in undivided unity, embodying Heaven’s balance, roaming beyond the body’s fame and disgrace, at the origin of the ten thousand things—what is there to rejoice in? What is there not to rejoice in?\n\n---\n\n**Section Fourteen: The Pearl’s Recompense**\n\nThread the pearl through the abyss of goodness, purify the heart and discipline the form. Nurture spirit in profound silence, issuing forth true wisdom—possessing great beauty yet never speaking of it. Like the sun and moon’s self-luminance, penetrating and boundless, nothing is left behind.\n\nThe supreme Dao requires no cultivation; its virtue matches Heaven and Earth. Self-lofty, self-profound, yet the ten thousand things cannot depart from it, each fulfilling its principle. Sincere and expansive, serene and unobstructed, the six directions are mirrored clearly—no hidden depth remains unilluminated. Beginning in radiant numinosity, it attains and nearly abides.\n\n---\n\n**Section Fifteen: Wondrous Convergence**\n\nWondrous convergence—vast and obscure, emptiness congeals with spirit. Accumulate it, yet it is never enough; possess nothing, yet it overflows. Not grasped by ear or eye, not sought by heart or intellect. The further one traces it, the deeper it becomes; the closer one draws, the more distant it seems. Touch it, yet no shiver arises. Gaze ahead—it is not there; suddenly, it is not behind. Harmonious yet not leading, responding to things without form.\n\nThe ten thousand things cannot obstruct it; likes and dislikes, safety and peril find no lack. Neither advancing nor welcoming, neither speaking nor silent. The deluded stumble over a single thread; the sagely wise see all goodness as one source. Employed, it fills Heaven and Earth—no beginning or end is discerned. Set aside, one cannot tell where it enters—no trace or sign is glimpsed.\n\nStill and silent, the hundred clans use it daily yet never know. Alas! Clods of earth and heaps of dust rush about—how many in the world awaken to it? Ceaselessly turning, fortune and misfortune shift in secret. In the intervals of coming and going, affairs shatter illusions—those drunk in the house of trivial strife, how can they return?\n\n---\n\n**Section Sixteen: Abandoning Strength**\n\nAbandon strength, have no preferences—unaware even of why it is so. Encounter things without partiality—this is called great completion. Thus, sight is not dazzled by crimson and purple, brocade and embroidery; hearing is not ensnared by clanging bells or resonant pipes; scent is not stifled by pepper, orchid, orange, or pomelo; taste is not sated by fine meats, sweet wine, or rich fare; the body is not pampered by soft furs or thick curtains; thought is not disturbed by discriminating cares or anxious plans.\n\nExternally, not enslaved by fame, wealth, or rank; internally, not confused by defensive learning or clever schemes. Sweeping away all filth, entering the realm beyond comparison—thus it is. Thereafter, one embraces luminous wisdom, receives keen insight. Savoring the flavor of the flavorless, words issue forth like metal and stone in loyal integrity, girded in plainness and simplicity.\n\nCast off beyond the eight directions and six qi, wings spread in the whirlwind, spiraling through the numinous cavern—wondrously penetrating the void. Such knowledge has reached its limit—profound, lofty, nothing can surpass it.\n\n---\n\n**Section Seventeen: Heaven’s Concealment**\n\nHeaven’s concealment probes the hidden, high and empty, deep and remote—thus the world cannot discern it. Its Dao is subtle and commonplace; its virtue blankets all life. It does not cling to edges, veils its affairs, rising and falling without falsehood.\n\nDim and obscure, now worn, now broken—like an empty valley, it opposes things. No blame, no praise—none know it: this is called great wholeness.\n\n---\n\n**Section Eighteen: Grief and Joy**\n\nGrief and joy do not enter—this is the perfection of virtue. Taking nothing, giving nothing—this is the stability of nature. Banish thoughts and cares, forget form and intellect. Nurture simplicity, attain emptiness—its virtue is not solitary. Discerning the true from the false without being swayed by things, guarding its origin—thus it nearly abides.\n\n---\n\n**Section Nineteen: Dwelling in the Real**\n\nDwell in the real abode, breathe deeply in the boundless expanse—transcendent, without corners. Lofty, it has no covering; vast, it has no direction. The door and window are formless forms; the beams are useless timbers. Desiring the desireless in purity, grasping the ungraspable as the great net.\n\nPlay with the book of immortality, pivot the tune of non-being. At times, roam the radiant wilderness; at others, dwell in the carefree and unrefined. Sip the fine wine of the spirit flask, play the ancient harmonies. Unrestrained and free, in perfect accord with the Dao—could there be anything more?\n\nYet the common folk, crude and reckless, grind against one another, collide and compete, topple and do not return, rush like fire without looking back. The six senses plunder one another—no heavenly wandering for the heart. Alas!\n\nThus, when a chamber is never empty, mother and daughter-in-law clash—righteousness reaches its limit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Sudden Extinction**\nSuddenly extinguish worldly attitudes, open the heavens and depart from men. An empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides in stillness. The great worthies who illuminate the Dao, the astute historians and eloquent debaters, the wise and skillful artisans—how could they glimpse this mechanism?\n\nNow vanishing, now submerged, silent and plainly passing. Not responding to calculations of affairs, standing at the root source, and penetrating the natural. Existence and annihilation, love and hate, favor and disgrace, right and wrong—how can these be alertly delighted or controlled? The nine orifices and hundred bones, each thing blending and merging, yet unaware of one’s own possession.\n\nForgetting time, forgetting place, forgetting past, forgetting present—profoundly empty, profoundly void—thus deeply entering the Great Mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The World**\nThe world has no rival; the Dao flows unimpeded, knowing its root. It unites the lineage of heaven and earth, exhausts the nature of the myriad things, and emits the light of heaven. Loftily treading the great square of the divine vessel, it transforms alone in the dark and obscure realm. It stirs the long waves of the ocean of virtue, purifies and penetrates the nine abysses. It fans the true wind beyond form, harmonizing the eight directions. Speech and knowledge reach far and vast; a glance or gesture reveals the subtle. Wisdom and virtue are bright and keen, illuminating mechanisms like a mirror.\n\nThus, the true sage knows people and knows heaven, sharing the same work as creation. Whether moving or still, marvelous functions are inexhaustible. Only then does one comprehend the transformations of life and death, roam freely in the great void, act appropriately with things, and bestow benefits upon the myriad ages without decline.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spiritual Encounter**\nSpiritually encountering and wandering, the origin has no passage. Not swift yet fast, not traveling yet arriving, not acting yet accomplishing—marvelously above the myriad things, simply being natural. From near to far, from self to others, without form or boundary, beyond the divisions of numbers, beyond the recitations of fine and coarse. Not to be discussed in words, not to be examined by intent.\n\nRiding the void without falling, touching the solid without obstruction. Drinking wind and sipping dew, vast and boundless without direction. Without fear or dread, without love or pride. Crossing mountains and valleys without alarm, piercing metal and stone as if nothing. Seeing without obstruction, clouds and mist do not veil its clarity. Hearing without confusion, thunder does not startle its acuity.\n\nWithout partiality or faction, without violating nature. The swirling dust of the world cannot disturb its smoothness. There is no generation or transformation—probing again and again. Opposing it yet not angered, following it yet not obeyed. Though pierced by bravery, no wound is seen; though struck by force, no pain is felt.\n\nBeyond form and number, thus able to overcome things without burden. Coming and going, a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—without end. In harmony with heaven and humanity, without sounds of sorrow. Yin and yang follow their measure, averting disasters of entanglement and distress. Sun and moon unite in brightness, without eclipses or alterations. Controlling and guiding the six qi to benefit all living beings. Nurturing in constant times, affairs free from demons and specters. Shamans dare not invoke spirits; the earth has no miasmic sand, no venomous stings.\n\nThus, though the sage resides in the ancestral temple, he takes the hearts of the common people as his own. For the world, he blends his heart, follows their nature, and harmonizes with their transformations. Harmoniously responding to the feelings of things—who would toil and sigh over such attachments? He laments that those who know the Dao are not easily met.\n\nNow, as if seen with one’s own eyes and preserved—words exchanged in passing, content and self-possessed, not seeking the profoundly distant, long attuned to the true wind, awakened from the great dream. How could it not be so?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Solitary Eminence**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Solitary Eminence (continued)**\n\nSolitary and majestic, the Dao stands alone.\nIt moves unseen above the myriad things, its will unwavering.\nNot drowned by breadth, nor obscured by ornament—\nnothing compels it, yet it remains ever natural.\n\nIt wanders beyond the dust and grime, unbound by ties.\nNo end is known, no beginning traced.\nUncarved, unpolished, it returns to simplicity.\nNeither coiled nor stretched, it pervades the four corners in darkness.\nPity those without awareness—how vast is its perfection!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Abandoning Nature**\nAbandon contrivance, and the numinous terrace holds no virtue.\nRespond to the ten thousand changes without resistance—\nthis is called harmony, not aiding heaven with human art.\nSuch a one knows no limit,\nthus merging with the Great Constancy.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Simplicity**\nSerene and at ease, no perverse qi can assail.\nMind tranquil, spirit concentrated—\nlife preserved, essence guarded.\nThe soul does not weary, no sorrow or regret,\nno fear or trembling. Vast and steadfast,\nit delights in itself.\nAdapting to things without constraint,\nno moment is amiss—where could it not pass?\nVirtue fills within, its simplicity complete,\na treasure for the world.\nAdd to it and it does not increase;\ndiminish it and it does not lessen.\nDeep as the sea, its measure boundless.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Steadfast Integrity**\nSteadfast and responsive, virtue reaches spirit-clarity.\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars,\nhearing this, practiced it diligently—how admirable!\nYet customs cling to habit; let us examine them.\nA trickle from a cliff hollows hard stone;\na single thread of silk can sever a sturdy post.\nWater is not a drill for stone, nor rope a saw for wood—\nwhy then? Their work is unbroken, and so it comes to pass.\n\nSeeking pearls in the sea, one fears no waves.\nHunting in the mountains, one dreads no beasts—\nsuch is the forgetting of the heart.\nAlas! Upright gentlemen,\nlifelong they avoid not the snares of fishing and hunting,\nbound to shallow, stubborn vessels,\nentangled in desires, chasing fleeting pleasures—\nvainly they invite ruin.\n\nAs for the spirit-person,\ntaking heaven and earth as a single realm,\ncountless ages as a single breath,\nunaware of before or after, indifferent to past or present,\ngreat and small merged, distinctions dissolved—\nhow much more for those who seek the Dao in earnest,\nholding fast to unwavering sincerity,\nstrengthening their resolve?\nThen the barriers of form may be forgotten,\nand the Dao of perfect equilibrium flows unimpeded.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Profound Stillness**\nProfound stillness, deep and silent,\nentering the boundless void.\nWithin, no concealment; without, no exposure.\nTaking emptiness as its gate, nothingness as its home,\nno lineage, no ancestors, no heirs—\nsilent, independent, unattached,\nunknown and unknowable.\nThus its essence transcends all categories,\nits greatness defies enclosure.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Forgetting Both**\nForgetting both self and other,\nsupreme harmony unchanging,\ndiscarding old attachments,\nstill and unified, unwavering.\nNo words, no intent—only the breath of nature.\nResponsive yet untethered,\ndeep in repose, nothing is forgotten.\nViewing life and death as one,\nnothing can disturb—\nhow much less the distinctions of hard and white, same and different?\nThus nothing is discarded, nothing retained,\nsuddenly enlightened, utterly empty—\nthis is called the pivot of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Removing Obstructions**\nRemove obstructions, forget duality—\npure and unadorned, at ease and unhurried.\nThe seven apertures flow freely, the square inch is empty.\nLike a tree’s hollow core, like settled dust or fleeting foam,\nthough rewards and punishments hold no sway,\nkinship and estrangement elicit no response.\nThe world’s praise or blame—\nunheeded, unaccepted,\nas if entering the deepest valley,\nwandering where the ten thousand things do not stray,\nyet all abide.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: No Attainment**\nNo attainment is attainable—\nthis is called the mysterious pattern.\nTrue joy, pure radiance, vast and empty.\nWithin, unaware of the Great Beginning;\nwithout, ignorant of form and shadow.\nNo action, no home, neither plain nor stained,\nneither existent nor nonexistent.\nFacing brightness, unmoved;\nconfronting darkness, unobstructed.\nEmbracing all changes, yet nothing is done.\nListening, no sound; observing, no form—\nprofound and formless.\nUsed without exhaustion,\nno beginning, no end.\nSelf-rooted, self-originating,\ndeep beyond knowing,\nyet ancient and enduring.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Mirroring the Dao**\nMirroring the Dao’s subtlety,\ntranscending all bounds.\nIt carves and polishes the myriad beings,\nyet no craftsmanship is seen.\nIt reveals the three realms,\nyet its mechanism remains unfathomable.\nIt bears the two forces—\nneither clear nor turbid.\nIt cycles through the four seasons—\nneither flowering nor fruiting.\nNesting birds and beasts\nnever take flight or flee.\nFlowing into rivers and stars,\nits depths are hard to plumb.\nFirst emerging from primordial chaos,\nvast and without origin.\nSpanning past and present,\nno trace is discerned.\n\nGreat, it encompasses all—\nsmooth and unobstructed, without corner or edge.\nSmall, it seals the tip of an autumn hair,\nno speck of dust arises.\nA thousand sages cannot fathom it;\nten thousand dharmas cannot contain it.\nBeyond sound, beyond form,\nunasked, untransmitted.\nThus it is said:\nSilent, serene, vast, and deep,\nempty, wondrous, spiritually connected—\nwithout hindrance, without obstacle.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Merging as One**\nMerging without peril,\ndarkly harmonizing with the boundless.\nObserving the ten thousand things,\nno high or low, no noble or base.\nSeeing Mount Tai and an autumn hair—\nno difference in scale.\nUnderstanding that all share one gate,\nknowing that stench and fragrance, the mundane and marvelous, transform.\nThus it is said: The world is but a single qi.\n\nSuch a one regards wealth and rank as clods of earth,\na thatched hut as superior to carved beams,\nwildflowers as finer than triple sacrifices,\nhempen robes as more precious than fox and sable.\nDwelling in humble lodgings, delighting in simplicity.\nThus forgetting self and other,\nwho is right, who is wrong?\nKnowing that life and transformation are like dream and waking,\ngreat and small share one realm—\nnaturally, the subtle essence abides.\n\nThe common folk are deluded indeed, exhausting themselves in vain—merely following the fleeting moment.\n\n**Waxing and Waning (Chapter Thirty-Three)**\nWaxing and waning alternate, yin and yang push one another, forms shift and change. Yet those who penetrate to the Supreme Mystery know there is no absolute wholeness. Observe the realm of ears and eyes: wisdom, bearing, expression, and countenance—all are flawed. What is seen here is unseen there; what is known as existent is unknown in its origin. This single form is but a vessel borne by the great earth, a congregation of impurities, the five phases borrowing from one another, a fleeting harmony. The four seasons give rise and destroy in turn, coming and going without cease. From infancy to youth, from old age to feebleness—is there ever a moment of pause, a lack of transformation?\n\nAlas! The teeming masses rise and vanish in an instant, succeeding and failing in turn. Clinging to this, grasping at that, they rejoice day and night, taking it for reality. Bending and stretching, bowing and rising, inhaling and exhaling—deeming this the wondrous Dao, they see a pellet and crave roasted quail. How deeply deluded they are! Soon their skin decays, their hair withers, and they accomplish nothing—how can they not grieve?\n\nThus the perfected person outwardly harmonizes with all virtues, inwardly pares the mind to oneness. Viewing the hundred limbs and four limbs as dust and grime, they transcend the realm of common pursuits, roaming freely by heaven’s boundary without private bias. Self and other are wholly preserved.\n\n**Obscurity (Chapter Thirty-Four)**\nObscurity and tangled thoughts, petty thieves within—these are the losses of spirit. Moreover, people of this world, though their years may be in their prime, their conduct is solitary. They squander their affairs, pressing hard against the times, failing when success is near. Sorrows and troubles follow one after another, yet they remain unaware.\n\nThis is the path of the bound and broken. The ancients who excelled as scholars did not act thus: they forgot cares and followed things, acted naturally without constraint, cleansed their filth, and appeared dull as if daubed with mud. They perfected their virtue, embraced their leisure—this is called clarity of knowing and fullness of principle.\n\n**Life and Death (Chapter Thirty-Five)**\nLife and death are the ultimate principles, the greatest affairs of the people—none surpass them. Yet those who covet life and lose virtue, those who invert values and debase customs, roam and play in all directions, ensnared by passions and desires. Year after year they chatter endlessly, forgetting their root.\n\nThe person who embodies the Dao does not act thus. They comprehend the source of all things, fathom the transformations of yin and yang, and realize the profound unity of mind and wisdom. They seal the seven apertures, unifying all states into one. Though their allotted span may end, there is a principle that does not perish. Forgetting self and other, without joy or aversion, they take heaven and earth as a single valley, the great void as their neighbor—how could they be burdened by the form of the body?\n\n**Following the Course (Chapter Thirty-Six)**\nFollowing the course and understanding fate, knowing contentment and avoiding disgrace—this is the way to preserve life and protect form. Take form as the body, virtue as the foundation. Do not chase after the vulgar, do not cling to profit, do not scheme in affairs, do not seek favor from others. Knowing the times but not knowing when to stop—this obstructs the Dao.\n\nDistant yet not troubled, yielding yet not covetous, knowing the past is like the present—life is labor. Responding to change and transformation, beginning and end are not my concern. On level ground, one’s integrity stands firm without effort; things cannot bend it. Even in utter poverty, there is no sorrow. Rejoicing in heaven and knowing fate, one remains free of vulgarity.\n\nSwift as a fleeing hare, inwardly one stretches and relaxes. Dwelling like a corpse, lodging like a guest, one endures without peril throughout life—this is how to last long.\n\n*Dongyuan Collection, Scroll One Concluded*\n*Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Two*\n\n**Guishan Changquanzi’s Writings**\n*Book One, Part Two*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Supreme Virtue**\nSupreme virtue vast and boundless, distant and without end.\nGentle and benevolent, it matches heaven and earth.\nIt bears and nurtures all, shifting with the four seasons,\nsoothing the far and near, its blessings reaching reeds and rushes.\nUnstored, unburdened, it moves by heaven’s course.\nThus it governs all beings, emerging and entering beyond bounds,\nsubtle as the divine.\nTherefore the sage harmonizes with it and responds,\narising naturally and spontaneously.\nTaking the people’s hearts as his own,\nhe acts only when compelled.\nGradually he nourishes, broadly he covers,\nclearly and brightly, abundantly sustaining the ten thousand things—\nnone do not flourish.\nWithout scheming, affairs succeed;\nwithout transformation, governance is achieved.\nPure and tranquil, without contrivance,\nhe rules the world with idle sleeves—\nhow near to perfection!\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Responsive Construction**\nResponsive construction conceals nothing, becoming spring for all things.\nLoving yet not relying on merit,\nit meets and gives life to the times.\nThe heart—its origin is without flaw,\nlevel and simple, unadorned.\nVast as rivers and seas,\nit ferries the hundred streams.\nMajestic as Mount Tai,\nit nourishes the ten thousand things,\nits mirror-like reflection like the sun’s virtue, without partiality.\nThus it is said:\nLet benevolence and righteousness be your ceremonial jades,\nritual and music your sashes,\nwisdom and trust your chariot’s harness.\nDwell in tranquility as your true home,\nstand amid the cosmos,\ngoverning the multitudes—\nonly the sage can do this.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Distant Things**\nDiscern distant things and be free from harm,\nvalue the will and honor authenticity.\nThus the noble person cultivates integrity,\nfinds peace in his lot,\ndoes not bend to petty men,\ndelights in contentment,\nrejoices in the Dao of heaven without sorrow.\nThis is called preserving his integrity,\nfully sated with virtue,\nnot allowing excess or indulgence to obscure harmony.\nOne who knows this\nis called a celestial treasury,\ncomplete and flourishing in beauty—\nyet unaware of its source.\n\n**Chapter Forty: Vulgar Greed**\nCowardly and base, insatiably grasping,\ndesiring gain but never satisfied—\nsuch are those bound by petty skills,\nwearying body and exhausting mind.\nDisaster and misfortune are self-made,\nyet they blame others,\nindulging their passions until the body is ruined.\nPursuing and entangling,\nlosing and failing.\nChasing things and defying heaven’s transformations,\nthey wander dazed within,\nand ghosts and spirits come to dwell in their abode.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: Entangled Thoughts**\nEntangled thoughts and restless ease—\nthe root of great delusion.\nJoy and anger assail one another,\nday and night in ceaseless striving.\nThe myriad emotions fester in the spirit’s chamber,\nfortune’s favors multiply,\ndesires sink deep,\nthe world’s paths are trodden without a backward glance.\nHow could one know that all things are impermanent,\naffairs never fixed?\nThe mayfly and morning mushroom perish in an instant;\neven the sun and moon suffer eclipses—\nhow much more so for man?\nThus the perfected person embraces the cosmos,\nentering without obstruction,\nthe plain heart uniting with qi,\nqi uniting with spirit,\nspirit uniting with emptiness,\nemptiness uniting with the boundless.\nGraceful upon the mountain of the Gourd,\ncarefree in the natural realm—\nits depths are unfathomable, endless.\nSerene as if absent yet present,\neffortless yet spiritually manifest.\nUncontending, it nurtures the multitude,\nforgetting merit while subtly benefiting all.\nThis is called true power,\nthe root of the supreme Dao—\nhow could one not observe heaven thereby?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Dreams and Awakening**\nDreams and waking are equal states,\nwhere form meets and spirit communes.\nWho knows the cause of such transformations?\nAlas! The restless crowd dwells together,\nentangled in the snare of profit,\nracing after dissipation,\nknowing no rest.\nBy day, a thousand cares disturb their will;\nby night, thoughts confuse their nature.\nThey clash with things, grinding away,\nscheming in all directions,\nnever considering return—\nare they not the fools of heaven and earth?\nHow could they know that those who attain the Dao\nseal their mechanisms?\nHidden, dense, tranquil, profound-rooted—\nthey see past and present as one,\nview life and death as a single thread,\nrefusing to drown in waking or dreams,\nguarding the true source.\nThus, soaring among the thistles and reeds,\nwhere could they go?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Pivot**\nThe pivot’s burden is heavy,\nfilled with deceit and cunning as its task,\nsuppressing the heart’s lord,\nthieves and bandits block heaven’s harmony.\nAbove and below deceive one another,\nlosing the true path.\nThe people grow weary,\nchaos replaces constancy,\nthey lack proper nourishment.\nGrasses and trees, birds and beasts cry out in disorder,\nwithering in the mountains and marshes;\nghosts and spirits reject their sacrifices.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they abandon the good Dao,\nseeking fame, law, power, and might,\ndisplaying severity, wisdom, and courage.\n\nThus the sage models what cannot be rigidly fixed,\nfor rigidity breeds primal fault.\nThey serve heaven with substance,\nnot with its blossoms.\nSeeing the outward, they know the inward;\nobserving the past, they know the future;\nhearing the echo, they know the sound;\nglimpsing the shadow, they know the form.\nTherefore it is said:\nBent or straight, they follow the measure;\nheavy or light, they respond without force.\nThe Dao acts in its season,\nuniversally aiding the flourishing of all under heaven,\nsharing prosperity with the ten thousand things.\nAt the great limit, they remain silent,\npreserving utmost tranquility and guarding true simplicity,\nreturning to uncarved simplicity.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Authenticity and Deception**\nAuthenticity and deception arise from different sources,\nyet both occupy their proper place in affairs.\nIt is said: serving heaven is difficult to falsify,\nwhile serving man is easy to falsify.\nLose the gate of true unity,\nand perverse excess assails the numinous palace,\nthrowing things into chaos.\nThe true sovereign, proud of skill and indulging emotion,\nloses the Dao.\nAn ancient saying declares:\nThe great man’s words are a shield and law;\nin governance, he maintains constancy.\nAbiding in substance as if empty,\nharboring knowledge as if foolish—\nboth are attained as if they were nothing.\nReforming toward goodness as if never sufficient.\nOutwardly wounding the inner,\npursuing affairs that ruin the body,\nseeing profit and forgetting the Dao—\nthese are called the three inauspicious signs.\nHolding to these inauspicious signs,\nhow can one avoid blame?\nSuch principle has never been heard.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Power and Fate**\nPower, fate, and schemes—\nhow can fleeting glory and beauty be firmly entrenched?\nLike wax melting and scattering here,\nwho knows the workings of creation’s alternations?\nBoastful deceit and willful emotion\nalign with the vulgar customs of the age.\nYet heaven’s Dao speaks not but responds with goodness,\ndispensing retribution like shadow and echo.\nWho knows its reasons?\nWho can stand in awe of what is yet to come?\nThus the perfected person knows:\npremature death or long life is fate;\npoverty or ease, leisure or toil are timing.\nWhat comes by chance cannot be relied upon;\nwhat has passed cannot be pursued.\nProsperity and adversity, gain and loss,\ndifficulty and ease, success and failure—\nwhy should I trouble my heart with such questions?\nOnly the pine and cypress,\nreceiving their mandate from earth,\nremain verdant through winter and summer.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Timely Occurrence**\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Timely Occurrence (continued)**\n\nNames and realities in their time-bound coincidence—\nthose who embrace the Dao guard against making them their master.\nNow flourishing, now withering,\nmoving with the moment, halting with the pause.\nExalted ease and humble toil,\nhonor and disgrace, joy and sorrow—\nall converge in a single form.\nMeeting fortune or misfortune, good or ill,\nthey neither startle nor rejoice.\nToppling or stumbling,\nwhy fret or grieve?\nThus the sage observes the boundless transformations,\nknows the destined cycles of fullness and emptiness,\nfaces death without fear,\nattains the heights without peril,\ntranscends all to find contentment,\nunmoved by whatever may befall.\nThus, with clarity in all four directions,\nthe six realms harmonize with time’s changes.\nEncountering without grasping,\npassing without regret,\nmeasuring by harmony,\nresembling yet unburdened—\nnothing is not magnified.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Purity and Stillness**\nPurity and stillness are the root;\nthrough them, the world rights itself.\nThus the realm unites in one heart,\nabove and below transformed by influence.\nQi steeps and suffuses,\nwoodcutters’ songs of praise\noverflow the roads,\ndistant lands bring tribute,\nthe people, carrying their children and baskets,\ncome bearing burdens.\nYet those who covet fleeting warmth like swine or lice,\nwho mimic the cries of hens or pheasants,\nwhose measure is but a sparrow’s,\nwhose talent is but a merchant’s—\ngrasping at profit without understanding,\nthey delight in their own conceit.\nThey deem themselves sufficient,\nunaware they have never known\nthe solitary transformation before form and lord,\nthe homeland of primal chaos.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Preservation and Loss**\nPreservation and loss stir no alarm—\nthus one attains the measure of nurturing life.\nHow is this known?\nBy holding fast to sincerity,\ndiscerning the passing of ages,\nweighing emptiness and fullness,\nrecognizing advance and retreat.\nWhat comes is not refused,\nwhat goes is not resisted.\nThus the good person,\nleaving the world behind,\npreserves the spirit whole.\nExternal things do not burden heaven’s mandate,\ntheir course unobstructed—\nhow could they traverse peril?\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: Floating and Sinking**\nFloating and sinking in the great order—\nonly the subtle and refined\nmust not go unexamined.\nObserve heaven and earth’s guiding principles,\nillumine the beginning and end of all transformations.\nHow much more the feelings of the people,\ntheir departures and arrivals, choices and rejections—\nthey do not uphold constancy.\nThus they know honor but not disgrace,\npursue things but not the Dao,\ntake pride in externals while stifling within.\nWhy do they not take heed for what follows?\nThus the true person\ndoes not flaunt rank or wealth,\ndoes not shun lowliness or hardship,\nis not swayed by beauty,\ncannot be deceived by cunning.\nUnchanging in nature,\nunharmed in fate,\ntheir will is single and untiring.\nSerene and without contrivance,\nhow could disaster reach them?\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Drunken Indulgence**\nDrunken excess and heedless indulgence—\nregret and blame, moral flaws,\nperils lurking in the bedchamber—\nthese cannot be ignored.\nTo give rein to dissipation,\nto move toward death’s ground—\nhow profound the folly!\nAlas, in this age of universal clamor,\nnot one in ten thousand is free of it.\nDazzled by illusion,\nhow could they know?\nOnly the perfected remain unentangled,\npreserving heaven’s harmony through few desires and clarity,\nnurturing inner virtue to achieve purity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: Gluttony**\nGluttony and covetousness,\nwild abandon and greed—\nthese are the scourge of the people.\nScheming for rare treasures\nto gratify private desires,\nwithin they harbor restless hearts,\nwithout they fear exposure and blame.\nTheir legs race, their spirits chafe,\nthey do not abide by fate’s allotment,\nspending their lives in toil,\npushing and pulling for profit.\nIn darkness they dread the reproach of ghosts,\nin daylight they dread the censure of men.\nNot a moment’s peace or rest,\nuntil they meet punishment,\nfalling short of their natural span,\ndying midway—\nsuch are the customs of those who defy heaven and betray their nature,\nforgetting what they have received.\nThey dig moats and raise walls,\nplanting brambles and thistles—\nis this not labor in vain?\nMoreover, the people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers consuming too much in taxes.\nThus the sage bestows widely without hoarding favor,\ngoverning the four seas without relying on reserves.\nFor heaven’s Dao benefits without harming,\nearth’s Dao gives life without refusing,\nand does not presume to rule.\nThe Dao of emperors and kings\nextends aid without amassing,\nnurturing and sustaining all,\nwithout desire or contrivance—\nthus the myriad things mature and find sufficiency.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: Fear and Caution**\nFear and caution against peril—\nthis is the way to preserve the body,\nkeep the true intact,\nand fulfill one’s years.\nKeep far from the brink of profit and harm,\nstand in the garden of generosity.\nGoing forth without boasting,\ndwelling without neglect,\nspeaking of matters with principle,\nwithout deception or concealment.\nThus, receiving favor without arrogance,\nfacing want without excess,\nneither excessive nor arrogant—\nsuch virtue shines brightly.\nBut the mediocre, blind and deaf,\ndwell where they should not,\nfail to see what lies before them,\nand though they grasp the fruit,\nthey cast it aside and flee.\nTheir fear of others\nenables them to avoid calamity,\nto distance themselves from harm.\nMoreover, the splendid fox and patterned leopard\ndo not nest in mountain forests or cave dens,\nbut roam the plains, rivers, and marshes—\nthus they meet the snare’s disaster.\nIs this not extreme?\nThus it is said:\nThe great person knows brilliance\nbut guards obscurity,\ndwells nameless as a quail,\neats as a fledgling,\nelevates their aspiration,\nsoaring above floating clouds.\nThus the Son of Heaven cannot make them subjects,\nthe feudal lords cannot make them friends.\nWandering in the ancestor of the myriad things,\nresting in the homeland of Dao and virtue—\nwhat burden could they bear?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Right and Wrong**\nThe principles of right and wrong\nrest on depth as their foundation,\ndiscernment as wisdom,\nsimplicity as their guiding thread.\nWhen many and few contend,\nnothing can be fully settled—\ngrasp but the essentials,\nfor this is the vastness of embodying the Dao.\nAmong the world’s common folk,\nhow few forget form to preserve spirit!\nThe people have been lost for so long—\nwhat does this mean?\nHeaven and earth, water and fire,\nyin and yang, cold and heat—\nnone deviate from their patterns,\nyet who can set them right?\nWhy then this tumult and confusion,\nbewildered by evil desires?\nNobility and baseness, skill and clumsiness,\nlife and death, fragrance and stench,\nsorrow and joy—\nall intermingle.\nThey mistake ignorance for knowledge,\ntake delusion for reality.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three (continued): Being and Nonbeing**\n\nBeing and nonbeing, sound and color—\nall sink and stagnate in cyclical return.\nSelf and other divide,\ngiving rise to contention and dispute.\nEven to grasp the formless and seize the Dark Pearl\nis not yet the ultimate.\nYet in gaining this, one loses that.\nHow much worse for those lost along the way,\nentangled in profit and harm,\nbound by noble and base, close and distant?\nTen thousand cares assail and agitate—\nsuch is the case everywhere,\nwith few exceptions.\nFrom this perspective,\nwho is truly deluded?\nWho is not?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Narrow Paths and Broad Ways**\n\nNarrow paths and cramped dwellings\nobscure vision with partial views.\nThe clarity of a peephole’s light,\nthe boldness of debate, the sharpness of wit—\nthese are not the supreme Dao of all under heaven.\nGazing at the sky through reeds,\nfrogs in a well treading the sea,\nworrying over a lost sheep,\nwandering thoughts through tangled phrases—\nbrilliant hues dazzle the five colors,\nmaking the great image hard to perceive.\nDeafened by the five tones,\nhow can one fathom the music of no strings?\nThose who savor fine meats and citrus as sweetness\nknow nothing of the primal flavor.\nLike fireflies outshining the sun in a cave,\nor a crow perched on a withered branch at noon—\nhow could they know the vastness of the Dark Spirit,\nthe towering pillar that takes heaven as father,\nearth as mother,\nand virtue as its resting place?\nThose who attain this stand firm,\nyet the benighted remain unaware.\nA plodding nag or a sparrow\ncannot comprehend the aspirations of the phoenix’s fledglings,\nthe Green Ears, the Swift Black, or the White Yak—\ngalloping a thousand miles,\nsoaring through the nine heavens.\nThe foolish in their furrows cannot keep pace,\nand those of limited learning—\nhow could they know heaven?\nTurning their backs on the distant,\nrushing toward the near,\ndrunk on fame and reputation,\ncutting short their lives,\nthey graze within the fence of profit and rank,\ngallop through fields of indulgence and excess,\nlosing the Dao and its virtue—\nhow tragic indeed!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: Bonds and Shackles**\n\nBound by sound and color,\nshackled by rank and eminence—\nthese are the topsy-turvy scholars.\nLike dust in the eyes or insects in the ear,\ncarving fine script and engraving patterns to obscure truth—\nis this not difficult?\nStealing gold at midday or in the early dawn—\nis this not punishable?\nYet the rash, greedy, and cruel\nthrong the halls of power,\ndancing to the tune of human titles,\nmocking the vast web of the Dao,\nnever examining themselves.\nLike a toad blocking a chariot’s path,\nor an ant trying to shoulder a mountain,\nclutching at ears and covering eyes—\nis this not pitiful?\nThus, arrogance and contempt fester within,\nwhile sable robes, official sashes,\nleather caps, and silk cords adorn the outside.\nThey believe themselves accomplished,\nyet their lives are bitter toil,\nheedless of what comes after.\nThe tiger and rhinoceros are caged,\nyet they remain unsaved their whole lives—\nwhat a mess!\nWho among them will awaken?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: Emptiness and Delusion**\n\nEmptiness and delusion, chaos and slander—\nwhen things enter the heart,\nthey become thieves to the true sovereign.\nDreaming of deer as one’s own,\ndebating with shifting arguments,\nattacking one another over right and wrong,\nclinging to the myriad things as real—\neven love and affection twist and coil,\nharmonious calls and paired wings,\npiled butter as solid truth,\nbranching separations and reunions,\nall woven into the snares of the world.\nThus sorrow and joy clash,\ntumults arise,\nthe winds of desire and the colors of passion surge.\nThe sea of craving churns waves,\nthe snow of emotion drifts and scatters.\nClouds of confusion veil the sun,\nthe chase through fields and hunts never ceases—\nthe people of the world remain lost in their folly.\nHow could they ever know?\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell here.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Stimulus and Response**\n\nStimulus and response intertwine,\nstrange and wondrous in endless forms.\nThose who do not seek their source\nfall into confusion.\nConsider the great furnace of heaven and earth,\nthe subtle shifts of the four seasons and celestial cycles—\nwho perceives them? Who understands?\nWhen myriad evils startle one another,\nforms and things shrink in fear,\nentangled in immediate affairs,\nrushing day and night,\nsinking into the overgrowth—\nsome die from sorrow or joy,\nothers perish from blows and strikes.\nIndulging in wine and music,\ndesire and thought entangled,\nthey invite misfortune, early death,\nor calamity through transgression,\nrebellion, and error.\nFamine, cold, and exposure\ncast them into ditches,\nrobbing them of their natural lifespan.\nCrime leads to ruin—\nhow could this not be perilous?\nThe Dao has no beginning or end,\nyet forms are born and die.\nIf life is right, why not death?\nIf death is wrong, why life?\nThose who align with right\ntransform stench and decay into the wondrous.\nThose who chase wrong\nturn the wondrous into stench and decay.\nA chaste woman becomes solid stone,\ndeep resentment transforms into the jujube thorn—\nsuch emotional shifts cannot all be recorded.\nIt is said that a spirit with a heart to aid things\nreceives honor and reverence in form.\nA spirit with a heart to harm things\nreceives lowly and despised forms in return.\nCause and effect follow without fail.\nThus it is said:\nThe pure and upright ascend in glory,\nthe greedy and cruel descend in disgrace.\nOnly the heavenly Dao shows no partiality,\never favoring the good.\nThe deluded stumble blindly,\nthe awakened move with ease.\nWhales and sturgeon forget one another in rivers and lakes,\njackals and tigers dominate the mountains and forests—\nall is shaped by the push and pull of shadows and echoes.\nThus, those who attain the Dao\nshare the same source as a thousand sages.\nThose who lose their nature\ndwell in the same realm as the ten thousand dusts—\nis this not perplexing?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Fame and Goodness**\n\nFame and goodness are instruments of misfortune,\nnot the path to full realization.\nCunning and deceit, slippery and tangled—\nhow can one know what is true?\nThose who follow the Dao\noften falter at the brink of success,\ntheir fame eroding virtue,\ngoodness emerging from the ominous.\nEven sages cannot overcome these two—\nhow much less the ordinary?\nThus, they are stained by attachment,\nimmersed in common emotions.\nThe self-deceived see uprightness as flawed,\nthe self-indulgent see fairness as unclear.\nFrom this, great confusion and delusion arise,\nleaving no escape.\nTherefore, the noble person dwells in substance,\nnot in mere appearance.\nWould one harm the master for the sake of the guest?\nTruly, one must not seek what is not,\nnot dwell where one does not belong.\nWith a heart full of compassion,\na spirit at ease,\ngentle, weak, pure, and frugal,\nclothed in the Dao and embracing virtue—\nthen one moves in harmony with heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Likes and Dislikes**\n\nLikes and dislikes cloud the heart,\nfor within, something is concealed.\nWhat aligns with oneself,\nthough flattering and obsequious, brings delight.\nWhat differs from oneself,\nthough loyal, forgiving, and virtuous, is despised.\nThe body and nature are set adrift,\nsubmerged in the myriad things,\nbound by externals, never to return.\nThe spirit soars, yet the celestial virtue is lost.\n\nThe conduct of the great person differs from this.\nWithout selection, without suspicion,\nthings come and one responds,\nfulfilling what is sincere.\nVirtue is shared with others,\nnot wielding worthiness over them.\nBeing the utmost impartiality under heaven,\nonly then does one attain great harmony.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Fragrance and Stench**\n\nOnce fragrance and stench are distinguished,\ndeluded emotions arise in turn.\nVirtue is fragmented,\nand the people lose the ultimate principle.\nYet when manure nourishes the crops,\nspread through the gardens and fields,\nall under heaven partake equally—\nthe true flavor remains.\n\nNow, some employ elaborate traps and snares,\nnets and hooks with bait,\nto capture flying and running creatures—\ninsects, quail, fish, elk, and deer—\nalong with geese, ducks, chickens, and dogs,\nharming others to benefit themselves,\nindulging their desires,\npleasing their palates.\nNo greater fault exists,\nfor do they know true scent from foul?\n\nWhy is this so?\nBoth birds and beasts possess male and female,\nparental love and kinship,\nblood and qi—\nhow far removed are they from human intelligence?\n\nAlas for this shallow and frivolous age,\nfor those who delight in killing and devouring life,\ndestroying nests and crushing eggs,\nensnaring creatures in nets.\nWriggling insects and delicate creatures\nscatter in terror,\nhiding and fleeing\nto escape harm,\nall losing their lives.\n\nViewed through the Dao,\nheaven and earth are born with me,\nthe myriad things are one with me.\nWhat is \"that,\" and what is \"this\"?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Emotions and Skills**\n\nWhen emotions and skills vie for dominance,\npurity and harmony do not arise.\nThe Dao and virtue grow distant,\nconfusion spreads across the land,\nand the people become deceitful.\n\nThus, this world and the Dao mutually perish,\nabandoning heaven,\nopening the human,\nextinguishing life.\nGrasses and trees flourish,\nyet the multitude cannot return to truth.\n\nTherefore, I will bend outwardly while remaining inwardly straight,\nserve the worn while renewing virtue,\nbe level yet not uniform,\nharmonious yet not identical.\nTaking heaven as my companion,\nI strive to unify and eliminate corruption.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: Shackles and Burdens**\n\nReleasing shackles and burdens dissolves doubt,\nabandons habit, and halts delusion.\nWorry and suffering cannot enter,\nthus virtue remains whole.\n\nThe world is filled with those lost in stubbornness and aggression,\nclinging to cunning and self-serving desires.\nYet no greater enemy exists than the mind—\nwhen the mind stirs, a thousand anxieties arise,\ninvading and disrupting heaven’s nature.\nWithout a master within,\none invites calamity upon oneself,\nbringing ruin—\nnothing worthy of praise.\n\nWavering and wandering,\ntraversing the paths of falsity, shallowness, sorrow, and suffering,\ndistorted and distant,\ntreading rough and overbearing ways,\nmistaking dangling growths, jade gates, knotted cords, and piled tiles\nfor one’s true possessions—\nis there no shame?\nWhat is there to rely upon?\n\nAlas!\nToday, the world clamors,\nall following this same path.\n\nThus the perfected person emerges without confusion,\nand upon returning, finds fulfillment in the primordial—\nneither grasping nor discarding,\nabandoning sight and sound,\nabiding in stillness and tranquility,\nvast and empty of all possession—\nthis is called returning to the origin.\n\n**Filial Piety and Compassion, Chapter Sixty-Three**\nFilial piety and compassion are the supreme virtues of human relations,\nthe great root of the Five Constants,\nthe grand guiding principle of all conduct.\nWithin the primordial qi’s undifferentiated chaos,\nthey nurture living beings—\ndistantly, bearing great responsibility toward the myriad things;\nnearby, loving and revering the six relations—\nnever transgressing ritual,\nnever disrupting custom.\n\nWhen Heaven wills to save a people,\nit shields them with compassion:\nin battle, they prevail;\nin defense, they stand unshaken.\nThus it is said: the utmost benevolence knows no partiality;\nthe utmost filial piety is never remiss.\n\nThe Son of Heaven relies upon it,\nand auspicious clouds spread their broad canopy,\ndragons bear the imperial charts.\nThe common people follow it,\nand virtue-stars shine upon their gates,\nforests and marshes flourish in the wilds.\nTherefore the sage governs the world by this essential Way,\ntransforming even grasses and trees,\nhis virtue matching Heaven and Earth.\nThus yin and yang harmonize in mutual support,\ncrops and grains ripen in season,\nthe court is graced with fragrant rushes and fine mats,\nand below, the people enjoy the blessings of peace.\nWhen this is so,\nall under Heaven submit in allegiance,\nauspicious omens gather from the four seas,\ncarriages and scripts unite as one,\nand the multitudes rejoice in reverence—\nwhat cause for concern could remain?\n\n**Gentleness and Frugality, Chapter Sixty-Four**\nGentleness and frugality are the foundation of virtue,\nthe function of the Way—\nyet none in the world can practice them.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they eschew extravagance.\n\nRejecting violence and aggression,\none responds all day yet contends with none,\nacting not upon things—\nthus joyfully upheld without weariness.\n\nPurity within oneself,\nrestraint and moderation in conduct,\nsteadfast through the ages,\nunchanged by external things,\nneither seeking gain nor fearing loss,\none’s wisdom remains unwearied—\nthus preserving the body and avoiding harm.\nTherefore the sage is full yet does not hoard,\nrenowned yet does not stand forth,\nencompassing Heaven and Earth,\nbestowing blessings upon all directions,\nyet none know whose virtue this is.\n\n**Integrity and Shame, Chapter Sixty-Five**\nIntegrity and shame are the pillars of the state,\nthe guiding principles of affairs,\nthe foundation of benevolent conduct.\nThe noble person is vigilant and cautious,\nthus neither careless nor flattering,\nrecognizing shame and detesting evil,\nupholding loyalty and trust,\nmaintaining firmness without daring to offend superiors,\npure and sincere, returning to the joy of nature.\nDiligently embracing these virtues,\ndaily advancing in goodness,\nneither diluted nor scattered,\none remains secure throughout life.\nHow do I know this security?\nBy this alone.\n\n**Accumulation, Chapter Sixty-Six**\nAccumulation without calamity,\nthe ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—\nforesight is called the Way of holding to what comes after.\nVast indeed is its boundlessness!\nWho can reflect upon and revere it,\ndiscerning crooked and straight, true and false,\nfortune and misfortune, long life and early death,\nall residing in the divine clarity—\nnot to be taken lightly, nor left unknown?\nThus the wise rectify their conduct by their shadow,\ngrasp the standard to illuminate the Way,\nknowing the future by observing the past,\nrecognizing the subtle from the manifest.\nHeaven and Earth respond in hidden accord,\nas swiftly as echo follows sound,\nnever erring.\nLike a weighing beam,\nbending and rising at another’s will—\nwhen virtue is vast, one’s conduct spreads;\nwhen substance is good, one’s name is true.\nCan the noble person not be cautious?\nClarity dawns before solitary vision,\nbrilliance shines upon the faint and distant.\nLuminous life emerges from obscurity,\nform arises from the formless.\nTreading on frost, solid ice follows—\nnot from a single night’s cold;\na nine-*ren* mountain is built—\nnot from one basket of earth.\nAll arises gradually.\nFortune and misfortune intertwine—\nwho grasps their ultimate limit?\nAs the ancient saying goes:\n\"Seeing goodness, one fears falling short;\nseeing evil, one recoils as from boiling water.\"\nThus the Heavenly net is vast,\nloose yet never failing—\nrighteousness has its limit.\n\n**Interaction, Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nIn interactions through the ages,\nengaging with others,\none does not allow things to harm the mind.\nWeighing alignment and opposition, rise and fall,\ndiscerning safety and danger—\nsubtle indeed is the balance of the Way,\nyet few attain its mystery.\nThe potter shapes all living things,\neach fulfilling its nature.\nWhether in accord or opposition, sharing aspirations or differing in wisdom,\nthe divine connection unites them.\nHarmonizing and guiding,\nresponding with accord,\nfollowing the natural order of things,\nnot losing their proper place—\nspeech adapts to square and circle,\nmovements are level and easy.\nDaily renewal and change\nalign with the natural.\nLet great and small, long and short,\nbroad and narrow, many and few,\neach find its proper place—\nthen even gulls may be tamed,\nfierce beasts may be reared.\nAbiding in timeliness and accordance,\none may merge with the profound virtue,\npervading and unifying all,\ncirculating without peril.\nIn nurturing the myriad things,\ngoverning all under Heaven—\nwhat else is there but this?\nThis is the principle of constant victory.\nThe Way of the sage—\nis it not nearly perfected?\n\n**Indulgence, Chapter Sixty-Eight**\nIndulgence in idleness and dissipation,\nreckless wandering abroad,\nintoxicated by sound, beauty, and perverse pleasures,\nheedless and unaware—\nthis is the blindness of the common people,\nlosing their proper place.\nGalloping in the hunt,\nfeasting in extravagance and arrogance,\nboasting of wealth and nobility,\nwearing tattered caps and worn robes,\nseeking prominence in the marketplace,\nwearing out the heart and wasting the body,\nsleepless through the night,\nforgetting meals by day,\nentangled in countless troubles—\nlosing one’s will for fame,\nharming oneself for profit,\nexhausting life in trivial pursuits,\nunaware of the great Way—\nhow grievously sad!\nThe six senses entangle one another,\nand virtue is lost.\nChasing illusory realms,\nthings vie to deceive—\nthus the eyes indulge in what they see,\nenchanted by artful smiles and fair forms;\nthe ears indulge in what they hear,\nbewitched by the lewd music of Zheng and Wei;\nthe nose indulges in what it seeks,\nsniffing at rank, pungent, and decaying scents;\nthe mouth indulges in what it utters,\nspeaking groundless words;\nthe body indulges in what it desires,\ndelighting in fine silks and thick furs.\nThe eyes’ indulgence\nleads to wandering in dissolute scenes—\nthus water is used to quench water,\nfire to extinguish fire.\nThe more names one gains,\nthe less a single day of ease,\nthe more myriad forms of fatigue,\nanxiously awaiting death—\nis this not the greatest sorrow?\nThe true nature is harmed,\nthe spiritual root withers,\nturning from the Way and forgetting the source,\nunable to observe its return.\nI alone fear the unseen signs,\nnot allowing what nourishes to harm its own nourishment.\nLet us consider:\nA person’s seven-foot form\nembodies the principles of Heaven and Earth.\nThus the head is round and the feet square,\nmodeled on the two forces;\nthe nose is high and the mouth deep,\nmodeled on mountains and valleys;\nthe limbs and flesh connect like soil,\nthe blood vessels flow like rivers and streams;\nwarmth and vapor resemble blazing fire,\nbreath and qi differ not from wind and clouds.\nWithin, all things are complete—\nnothing is lacking.\nThus the true person casts aside fleeting worldly concerns,\ncontemplates the primal harmony of the Dao and virtue,\nwelcoming the divine and drifting like duckweed,\ncoming lightly, departing silently.\n\n**Inner and Outer, Chapter Sixty-Nine**\nThe subtleties of inner and outer\nlead to confusion and ruin when unchecked.\nAnxious thoughts and restless actions,\nfrivolity and severity,\na multitude of illusions\nalternate day and night before one,\nyet none know their origin.\nOnly the greatly enlightened remain steadfast and joyful in wholeness.\nRank and wealth do not enslave the body,\nsorrow and hardship, poverty and success do not diminish life.\nCalming desires and settling speech,\nunburdened by convention,\nunwearied in mind—\nthus free from resentment, obstinacy, and sorrow.\nTherefore the perfected person controls destiny from within,\nnot seeking fulfillment from without,\nforgetting the liver and gall,\nleaving behind the ears and eyes—\nthen spirit and wisdom become serene,\nthe face and cheeks empty and tranquil.\nWandering at the beginning of creation,\none merges with the profound obscurity.\n\n**Discourse on Discerning Delusion, Chapter Seventy**\n\nDelusion and confusion, myriad and boundless—like one who forgets to return home, such are the people of obscured understanding. Launching a boat on dry land, extinguishing fire in water—these are not acts of madness. Why is this so? Though one amasses wealth and bribes, one cannot devise a way to exhaust their use; though one frets over riches and honor, one cannot enjoy them for all time. Glory and disgrace intertwine, rising and hesitating in turn, yet one’s anxieties never cease; though one prepares grand feasts of the finest meats to nourish the body, one cannot preserve life. Those who attend to form are distant indeed, foolish indeed—how coarse and far removed from wisdom! How can the people of this world be deemed worthy? Is this not extreme?\n\nWhen the spirit and consciousness wander outward, one may labor a lifetime without accomplishing a single work—how lamentable! They mistake gold and jade for mere vessels, regard life and destiny as empty nothingness, cherish the ancestral shrines of others while abandoning their own fields and gardens, bind themselves to the five aggregates, and drift amidst the seven emotions. They obscure the radiant torch of wisdom, plunge into the abyss of filth and disgrace, and wear away the root of their spirit, never once attaining ease.\n\nThus the sage treats the world as a temporary lodging, sees favor and affection as carvings upon bone, and knows that what takes form is not truly form, that what gives life does not truly transform. Therefore, they daily cast aside worldly entanglements. They regard beauty as a blade, cautious and unwilling to act; they see wealth and honor as mere insects and sparrows, enjoying them without pride. Brocade robes and jade chambers are to them like tattered curtains and frayed mats; fine foods and rare delicacies, like coarse grains and plain fare.\n\nIn this way, they cultivate wisdom in tranquility, rest in profound stillness, cleanse themselves of craving for sensory pleasures, and uphold kindness and frugality. Their wisdom and brilliance illuminate the world, their virtue and teachings, their benevolent winds, spread fragrance across the four seas. Then, drifting through the gate of the supremely subtle, deeply serene, and wondrously quiescent, they attain vast emptiness and the ineffable, wandering freely in eternal constancy.\n\n**Compendium of Essentials, Chapter Seventy-One**\n\nThe essentials of the primordial net encompass all mysteries, illuminating ten thousand generations to come with flawless radiance, free from obscurity. They guide the world’s people back to the constant Dao, allowing all things to attain their natural state—luminous and unobstructed, their thoughts alert, awakened to the true source.\n\nThus it is said:\nTransformation without end—this is the perfection of penetration.\nPurity without admixture—this is the subtlety of essence.\nVast and unobstructed—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\nProfound and all-penetrating—this is the depth of the real.\nSurveying the myriad things—this is the clarity of the sage.\nVirtue permeating the animate and inanimate—this is the highest kindness.\nTransforming even the lowly—this is the ability of the worthy.\nLoyalty and forbearance unerring—this is the goodness of the good.\nMind and wisdom ever bright—this is the completeness of wisdom.\nEmptiness, stillness, and indifference—this is the numinosity of spirit.\nSerene unity and ease—this is the nourishment of qi.\nEloquent and expansive speech—this is the keenness of talent.\nSincerity without pretense—this is the steadfastness of will.\nHumility in conduct—this is the greatness of fortune.\n\nThose of ancient times who cultivated the real examined these many virtues, followed them in the world, and thus interfaced with heaven and humanity—the great Dao was fulfilled.\n\nAs for the origin of unity, vast and unbounded, pure and empty, primordial and formless, merged yet unassuming, flowing and expansive, operating without trace, subtly quiescent—it is stabilized by simplicity, nurtures the ten thousand spirits, lush and flourishing, unhurried yet effortless. Spreading throughout the cosmos, its words shine brilliantly, unstained and untainted. Its use is complete in its subtlety, free from affairs and desires, serving as the world’s model.\n\nThe arts of the Dao in ancient times were found in this. Now, Master Changquan heard of its influence and delighted in it. He practiced the learning of non-learning, dwelled where the multitude shunned, solitary and withdrawn, retiring from the world. Awkward and plainspoken, he did not let red and purple disrupt his true hue. Earnest and content, indistinct and formless, he emerged and submerged like waves upon the water, his transformations without constancy.\n\nHe did not precede others, yet followed things afterward; he did not sever or display, his merit equal to all. He pared away excess, harmonizing the courtyard with purity and harmony. He took the worn as new, the weak as strong, the clumsy as skillful, the humble as true. Alone, he matched the four seasons like a horse, took emptiness as his forest, non-accumulation as sufficiency, the one as the many, the root as essence, the old as vast.\n\nHis words, though plain and austere, were not like jade—yet they ascended without peril, stirred without harm. Utterly great, without exterior; utterly small, without interior. His use was vast and expansive, merging with the great unity. Emerging from our lineage, he obscured life and death, blending ancient and present.\n\nHe saw fortune and abundance as turbid and sinking, beyond grasp. Thus, in recitation, song, dance, and leaping steps, he stood above the multitudes, knowing not why he was so, yet so he was.\n\nVague and joyous, yin and yang cannot be reckoned, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its bounds. Its principle is drawn from yet never exhausted, poured into yet never filled—vast as the source of rivers and seas, without end.\n\nNow, the debates of the hundred schools, the arts and skills of various crafts, though established in the central states and promoted in their time, though useful, inevitably vie for profit, encroach upon the people’s nature, and erode morality. Deceit and malice diverge, unable to return to true constancy—how could they be reversed?\n\nThus, the people of disorder and chaff, restless amidst the ten thousand things, weave and leap without cease. If one merely speaks of the square and round, the towering and lofty, and aspires to ascend and traverse them, they stand perilously at the brink.\n\n**Utmost Sayings, Chapter Seventy-Two**\n\nUtmost words are wordless; utmost knowledge is unknowing; utmost joy is joyless; utmost action is actionless. The utmost joy is never without joy; the actionless is never without action. Pure qi surges within, manifesting in outward ease. Suspicion and jealousy dissolve entirely, and things return to their nature.\n\nThus, fish and turtles share the same waters, elk and deer roam the same wilds—even birds and beasts do not shun one another, how much more should humans?\n\nTo illuminate the distant by verifying the near, to know the root by observing the branch—this is why words are forgotten.\n\nYet people speak—though their mouths may utter words, their hearts have never truly spoken. They go against the world, their minds disdaining it, sinking together into oblivion. This is not something the flickering light of a torch or the followers of names and distinctions could comprehend. What does it mean?\n\nChasing the branches of the ten thousand things without returning to the wondrous source invites the suspicion of transgressing principle. The weariness of the pine and cypress arises from venting their qi and entangling their thoughts, enslaving their minds in pursuit of the Dao, seeking truth by pouring into rivers—like gusting winds and sudden rains that arise with the seasons, causing grasses and trees to flourish. Yet the spirit’s palace becomes obstructed, overgrown within, unable to be cleared. How is this different from carelessly using a Sui pearl to shoot a sparrow on a thousand-fathom cliff? How lamentable!\n\nOnly those who comprehend Heaven reach the utmost. The aspirations of the lame turtle, the doctrines of street-corner sophists, the knowledge of those who claim equal wisdom—these are but shallow indeed.\n\n**The End of *Dongyuan Collection*, Scroll Two**\n\n**Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Three**\n\n**Preface and Poems by Changquanzi of Guishan, in Harmony with Langranzi**\n\nI have heard that those who tread the mysterious path of cultivating truth do not follow a single principle, nor do they guard a single gate. Some enter the Dao from the mundane, while others transform the mundane through the Dao—though their affairs and proximities differ, how may one discern the distinction?\n\nI reply: Enlightenment may be sudden or gradual, and learning reveals depths and shallows. What does this mean? Even coarse words may spark profound insight; their patterns, though playful and strange, shine forth with undeniable clarity. Thus, in ancient times, the writings of Zhuangzi, Liezi, Wenzi, and Gengsangzi molded heaven and earth, rode the winds and clouds, mastered the transformations of the six qi, and roamed beyond the eight directions. They harnessed the sun and moon, traversed the cosmos, refined all beings, and extended their blessings even to insects. They expounded the Dao and virtue, aiding the mysterious origin, sweeping through antiquity and the present. Following the course of creation, they silenced the debates of a hundred schools, forged the pivot of ten thousand methods, opened the swift path to transcendence, and unfolded the sublime teachings of the great sages. How vast were these four perfected ones! Were they not those who transformed the mundane through the Dao?\n\nAs for those who enter the Dao from the mundane, their number across kalpas has been vast indeed—too many to record in full. Recently, in leisure, I perused the *Songs of the Dao* by Master Langranzi of the Tang, thirty-one poems in all. Their language is spare, their purport profound, outwardly illuminating the principles of the indistinct and obscure, inwardly penetrating the source of embryonic breathing and the flow of qi. Beholding such true attainment, how could one forget it? Alas, though my nature is no more than wood or earth, how could I fail to see the worthy and aspire to emulate them? Thus, unashamed of my wild and unpolished efforts, I humbly continue the tail of the sable, not daring to hope for later generations’ mending, but simply yielding to the ease of idleness and self-contentment.\n\n**I.**\nDream breaks at golden millet’s prime—youth’s zenith,\nhe turns to forest depths, pillowing on clouded sleep.\nHad he not leapt free from the toil-worn den,\nhow could he fathom the subtle, wondrous power?\nThe sword of wisdom cleaves the path of sages past,\nhis spirit-light pierces the ninefold heavens.\nFrom this, he roams unbound through the mortal sea—\nwho knows this carefree immortal of the earth?\n\n**II.**\nAt times within his gourd he savors endless spring,\nbeholding the primal face in its true guise.\nBeyond the world, he knows the supreme Dao,\nyet in the realm, he meets no man of jade-green hue.\nIdly he plants jade trees in the mystic garden,\nthirst slaked by the radiant nectar of the Flowery Pool.\nThough mulberry fields shift with the sea’s vast change,\nthe immortal’s scene stays ever fresh through all four seasons.\n\n**III.**\nThe Dao entrusts itself to my body in the Great Simplicity,\nmy floating traces care not for east or west.\nThe spirit-terrace, still, harmonizes with heaven and man,\nmy refined bearing scorns the vulgar crowd’s embrace.\nIn jade grottoes, the flute’s song delights a thousand sages,\nin the crimson furnace, snow melts to open a hundred gates.\nA hint of this wondrous use is spoken plain—\nnot the dust-bound world’s severance of form and void.\n\n**IV.**\nCultivation must unravel its tangles,\nblowing away the clouds of ten thousand kalpas from the spirit-terrace.\nA single point of ease forgets craving and desire,\nthe six gates hushed, all sounds and echoes stilled.\nWithin the breast, a wondrous will of spirit stirs,\nin hand, the deep-wrought patterns of the sacred key.\nThe golden body refined, he soars beyond—\nno ghost of yin shall weep at a lonely grave.\n\n**V.**\nNot coveting the world’s wealth, strife, or gain,\nhe awakens to heaven’s truth, cutting all coming and going.\nKindness sprouts green shoots from withered wood,\ncold ashes flare to crimson flame once more.\nHaving grasped the Dao’s wondrous principle of emptiness,\nwhy fear the relentless press of day and night?\nPitiful, those who waste their fleeting lives—\nin secret, their temples whiten with hoarfrost.\n\n**VI.**\nThe cage of the mundane shattered, he rests at last,\ncarefree, untroubled, forgetting the turn of seasons.\nWine, beauty, wrath, and wealth—no true livelihood,\nbut harmony and tranquility are the root of good.\nIf asked of the elixir of long life,\nhe searches the seas for companions beyond the world.\nOnce the golden turtle is hooked and reeled in,\nhe lies at ease, high upon the white clouds’ crest.\n\n**VII.**\nFor decades adrift in the mortal sea,\nheaven-born, he scorns the gates of lords and marquises.\nThe qi-mother, like a tortoise, nurtures endlessly,\nthe heart’s abyss, like a valley, holds depths untold.\nFire blazes in the cinnabar field, golden chrysanthemums bloom,\nlead boils in the crucible, jade nectar warms.\nWho can speak of the celestial mechanism seized?\nHe probes the Three Lights, grateful for the sages’ grace.\n\n**VIII.**\nThe Mystic Pearl secured, his life’s work done,\nits use adapts to every moment, everywhere clear.\nWith both hands, he rends the net of life and death,\nhis whole being leaps free from the pit of profit and fame.\nIf he explores the Gate of Dui to seal its power,\nhe knows the Valley Spirit shall never perish.\nPillowed high in the grotto-heaven beyond the world’s dust,\nhe pities the ants who scramble for fleeting glory.\n\n**IX.**\nNo envy for the highest ranks of golden seals,\nwith cause, he awakens to the Dao—no hardship there.\nQi and spirit in harmony, life is firmly rooted,\npassions and desires unseated, the body finds peace.\nThe shell-gate’s locks of the Three Essentials are struck open,\nin the jade furnace, the elixir of the nine heavens is refined.\nSuch flavors are priceless,\nnot like common herbs at all.\n\n**X.**\nSpeak not of mountains, forests, or market dust—\nwhere is the wild cloud not at ease?\nOn Kunlun, mist gathers where dragons coil in their caves,\nin grotto-palaces, wind stirs where tigers roar on peaks.\nWith resolve, one may feast on the phoenix’s marrow,\nwithout merit, the jade boy’s face cannot be preserved.\nThe Dao of the Mysterious Origin is known to those who awaken—\nin the land of Uncarved Simplicity, they tread homeward in peace.\n\n**XI.**\nTo whom can I transmit these secrets?\nAll bear the marks of the vulgar and mundane.\nThey know only to cherish wife and child,\nwho can deepen the root and secure the stem?\nWithin, the five viscera’s spirit-essence is depleted,\nwithout, the Three Powers’ virtue and grace are betrayed.\nBeholding this, how foolish men seem—\nnot cultivating the immortal realm, they sink into the earth.\n\n**XII.**\nThe jade palace of the immortal path is not far or deep,\nyet learners fail to awaken to their original heart.\nWho has ever known the frost of the Mystic Cassia?\nThe inferior horse and mad ape cannot restrain themselves.\nFeet tread the azure mist to wander the imperial courts,\nthe body rides a white deer through jade forests.\nThe natural Dharma-realm must be made clear—\ndo not follow the deluded, seeking outward.\n\n**XIII.**\nAbiding in ease, at peace in a humble dwelling,\nunentangled in worldly affairs, his ties are few.\nIn the case, the Seven-Star Sword lies idle,\non the shelf, the Three Sages’ books are stored deep.\nA heart of ice and snow scorns wealth and honor,\na bearing of water and clouds disdains the void.\nBy the thatched window, a pillow of pure wind suffices—\nwhy envy those tossed by the red dust’s favor and disgrace?\n\n**XIV.**\nWash away love and desire, swiftly return to purity,\nrecognize the truth that has always been your own.\nDo not cling to the red-powdered charms of the chamber,\nbut follow the crimson-city dwellers beyond the world.\nIn the mystic furnace, the elixir of long life is refined,\nin the treasure vault, the indestructible body is forged.\nIn the moon’s palace and starry towers, ever at ease,\nthe golden countenance grows ever clearer through ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**XV.**\nNeither monk nor layman, nor Confucian scholar,\nhe savors the ease of idleness, his joy unbounded.\nLife and destiny are already understood beyond the world—\nwhy fret over honors and splendor absent in this realm?\nHis heart, like the bright moon, shines high and low,\nhis body, like a lone cloud, rolls and unfurls at will.\nRoaming the cosmos in true delight,\nhe spares his heart from the world’s driving cares.\n\n**XVI.**\nHaving ingested the wondrous pill of emptiness,\nnaturally, his spirit shines with a youthful glow.\nHis radiant wisdom gleams like the noonday sun,\nhis body and mind stand firm as Mount Tai.\nThe magic mushrooms remain fragrant through all four seasons,\nthe celestial light stays serene through ten thousand kalpas.\nIf worldly men could daily practice thus,\nthey would live in joy, soaring through the universe.\n\n**XVII.**\nNot misled by heterodox paths or external dharmas,\nhow many learners awaken to non-action?\nCutting away passions and desires, ever pure and bright,\nno need to torment the flesh with cold and hunger.\nSilently, he perfects the fruit of the untainted,\nendlessly, he gives birth to the child of transformation.\nWith merit complete and affairs settled, he leaves the mortal world,\nriding the crane to court the sages at dawn.\n\n**XVIII.**\nIn learning the Dao, never seek the outer elixir—\nscattered essence and yang cannot return.\nWithin the five thousand characters, heaven’s principle is clear,\nthrough the twelve hours, the jade countenance is preserved.\nDelighting in a simple gourd and plain fare,\nhis nature, like the cloud-crane, loves emptiness and leisure.\nWho in the marketplace knows me, chasing fame and profit?\nI roam at ease, unburdened, through heaven and earth.\n\n**XIX.**\nFollowing causes, he passes through without force,\nday by day, diligently turning inward to cultivate.\n\n**XX.**\nThe flute’s melody in grotto-palaces transcends pitch and tone,\nthe radiance of the gourd-heaven knows no spring or autumn.\nAt the feast of golden nectar and fragrant peaches,\nclouds part to bestow rainbow robes upon the feathered immortals.\nDoes the Great Dao distinguish between poverty and wealth?\nWho in the dusty world would cease their ten thousand pursuits?\n\n**XXI.**\nSeeing through the fleeting years, spring and autumn pass,\nthough others envy me, I deem it no great feat.\nI carve open the Great Dao’s path to Chang’an,\nseeking a true friend to transcend the worldly stream.\nIn pure and simple towers, I leisurely delight,\nin the distant, dim palace halls, I celebrate my return to rest.\nAfter toasting and drinking, I sleep in sweet intoxication,\ndrunk and oblivious to the sorrows of the mortal realm.\n\n**XXII.**\nLaughing at the fly’s head and snail’s horn fame,\na true man, with resolve, awakens to perfection.\nA heart full of wind and moon repays the three joys,\na life amid ten thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds.\nWith discerning eyes and a brocade mind, a guest of heaven,\namid the red dust and fragrant grasses, worldly passions.\nFreely I return to the days of Xuan Du,\nsoaring high like the roc, ninety thousand leagues.\n\n**XXIII.**\nDivine light shines bright, illuminating Penglai’s isles,\nwho knows the three islands hold a different path?\nIn the secluded cloud-chamber, no defilement,\nthe luminous sea of awakening clears itself.\nPrecious blossoms bloom in radiant splendor,\ntrue fire steeps the body in its course.\nWhen this work is accomplished,\nI shall invite the Five Elders to behold the primordial essence.\n\n**XXIV.**\nLet the carriages and caps of wealth be his,\nnone escape the fetters that bind their true nature.\nFleeting gains and floating life arise from delusion,\nthe celestial mechanism’s secret—do not guess at random.\nThe marvels of spiritual power transcend past and present,\nqi congeals into pure yang, scorning calamity.\nWhen merit is complete and the warts of karma dissolved,\nwhere shall I go? Riding a radiant phoenix to gaze upon the jade terrace.\n\n**XXV.**\nThatched huts in secluded fields, white cogon grass entwined,\nmy name inscribed in the registers of the Great Luo Heaven.\nI long to roam the seas and bestow the mysterious treasure,\nyet in the human world, no old friends remain.\nFire-dates and jade nectar cannot be shown,\ngolden hooks and fragrant bait are cast in vain.\nThe dusty world is no place to settle,\nI gather the mist and rosy clouds, returning to the phoenix’s nest.\n\n**XXVI.**\nTending fields and estates, hoping to glorify the family,\nheedless of the frost at the temples and the greying hair.\nTo relieve suffering and aid the poor, no grain is spared,\nwhile the resentful heart commits sins like grains of sand.\nNot cultivating wisdom to wander the immortal isles,\nindulging greed and lust, racing with yakshas.\nTo lose this human form is to meet it never again—\nthe sages in the void sigh in silent sorrow.\n\n**XXVII.**\nDo not be deluded by flowers and wine, enamored of fleeting glory,\nexamine body and mind, walk beyond the material.\nYour present livelihood should remain pure and still,\nall past schemes and cunning must be wholly cast aside.\nHour by hour, refine the cyclical stems,\nday by day, harmonize spirit, qi, and essence.\nDo not say the cultivation of truth bears no fruit—\nthe celestial immortals secretly add your name.\n\n**XXVIII.**\nHaving awakened to the two scrolls of the *Yellow Court*,\nturn inward to behold the wondrous treasure of body and life.\nStanding firm in the void, holding up the pillar of heaven,\nwithin the gourd, the crescent moon furnace shines bright.\nDrunk on flowing rosy clouds, I slumber in the crimson palace,\nidly wielding the torch of wisdom, I play in the numinous void.\nThe swift path to heaven is open to all—\ndoubt not, for it is ignorance that blinds.\n\n**XXIX.**\nProcrastinating the months and years, neglecting cultivation,\nten thousand cares assail the heart, karma’s workings.\nIn the yang realm, one cannot practice perfect virtue,\nin the netherworld’s courts, suffering is beyond doubt.\nDwelling in primordial chaos, free from disaster,\nentering and exiting the realm of clarity, ageless.\nTurning back, the cloud-path to my homeland lies smooth—\nin the Land of Huaxu, I keep my destined tryst.\n\n**XXX.**\nI urge students: cease your aimless seeking,\nrecognize at every turn the wondrous true heart.\nYour own palace is not small,\nthe mountains and rivers of the earth are not deep.\nA belly full of wind and clouds forms auspicious omens,\na gourd of stars and constellations transforms into refined gold.\nPeerless across the four seas, no friends to be found,\nI alone listen to the soundless music of the vast.\n\n**XXXI.**\nClose the earthly gates, open the heavenly doors,\nthe iron tree blooms from a different root.\nWhite snow and yellow sprouts meet at the three junctures,\ngolden crow and jade hare race in flight.\nLet the foolish and impure perish in vain—\nthe Dao abides, ever clear and void.\nPractice compassion and forbearance, widely bestow expedient means,\nreturn to the Purple Palace to repay your master’s grace.\n\n**XXXII.**\nOnce enlightened to the profound mystery,\nmerit complete, I ascend to the grotto-heavens.\nWho has grasped these secret verses?\nA fine name endures through the ages.\nRiding the wind in broad daylight is not the Dao,\nplaying in the moonlit empyrean is not immortality.\nHaving fathomed the formless principle of the subtle and serene,\nI merge into a single strand of good cause.\n\n**After Tao Yuanming’s “Returning Home” Rhyme**\n\nReturning home, ah!\nTo the land of nothingness, I return in solitude.\nAwakened to the subtle and serene, the Dao’s essence,\nI escape reproach and resentment, sparing my heart sorrow.\nGuard each word, let none escape—\neven a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.\nSweep away the tracks of flies and snails,\ncleanse the rights and wrongs of past and present.\nDelight in the quail’s nest and the simurgh’s meal,\nwear hempen clothes and kudzu sandals.\nPrevent misfortune before its signs appear,\ndiscern the subtle before it manifests.\nHeaven and earth turn like a wheel,\nthe four seasons rush in their course.\nI tread the vast expanse,\nenter the wondrous gate in silence.\nSimple as uncarved wood,\nserene, perhaps abiding.\nSated with virtue,\ndrunk on the winecup.\nMoved by ritual, I respond to the moment,\npleased by the Dao, I ease my countenance.\nAbandoning kindness and frugality, what remains?\nOnly tranquility brings peace.\nPreserving breath, I strengthen my heels,\nmastering closure, I need no locks.\nEver at ease with the three joys,\nforever desireless, I observe alone.\nEmbracing the cosmos, I come and go,\nlaughing at the wormwood and weeds as I wander.\nInheriting the elegance of Gu Mountain,\nI linger by the winding Liao River.\nReturning home, ah!\nDo not follow Zang or Gu in cutting ties.\nFollow your true nature, nurture simplicity—\nknow contentment, seek nothing more.\nSigh at the illusions that arise from delusion,\nfind true joy and forget sorrow.\nSeeing through Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream,\nI hold high my resolve, delighting in the fields.\nGathering herbs on emerald slopes,\nfishing by moonlight in a small boat.\nObtaining the dark pearl where images fail,\nmeeting a true friend in Master Hu Qiu.\nSevering the net of doubt with the sword of wisdom,\nwashing the dusty tassel in the clear stream.\nUnderstanding life as fleeting,\nrealizing death as rest.\nSo be it.\nAbiding in harmony, at peace with the times,\neach moment slips away like a crack in the door—hard to retain.\n\nWho can purify and refine to achieve this?\nUpright yet not severe, sincere yet not bound by expectation.\nA single spark of numinous light—natural and unforced,\nten thousand acres of cloud-fields bear no seed.\n\nFilling limbs and body, sitting in forgetfulness,\nmoved by spirits and ghosts to compose poetry.\nUniting the myriad things in one treasury,\nwandering in the great expanse—what doubt remains?\n\nThis staff—\nthis staff is no worldly thing,\nnot some common green bamboo or vine.\nUpright and wondrous, perfectly straight and new,\nits use is clear, without flaw or bend.\n\nIt parts the mist and clouds,\nstrikes the valley of Kun,\npierces the sky to dot the spring verdure.\nDragged or brandished, it displays its numinous might,\nshattering emptiness so gods and ghosts submit.\n\nRoaming mountains and seas,\nit guides phoenixes and cranes,\nflicking forth fragrant mists of sacred fungi.\nIt pries open jade caves where phoenixes dwell in vain,\ndips into the wine of awakening to sober the drunken eye.\n\nWhat branch or root is this?\nA formless tree,\nnurtured by heaven, earth, and stars.\nBorn in the Seven Treasures Grove as the Tree of Enlightenment,\nbathed in the Jade Wave Palace’s radiant springs.\n\nGathered and reaped, it has no flesh or skin,\nits prajñā form too subtle to touch.\nYet its innate elegance is perfectly complete,\nsetting down the pure wind to suffice the Three Realms.\n\nA single slender jade dragon, cold and pale,\na true kin of the immortals beyond the world.\n\nAwakening—\nawakening within awakening, enlightenment within enlightenment,\na single spark of numinous clarity, unobstructed.\nUnleashing a blazing flame to illumine the sahā world,\nthe Dharma realm unfolds in all directions, uniquely revealed.\n\nThese tidings are most subtle,\nthe wooden man points afar—white clouds return.\nThis mysterious pass is hard to speak of,\nyet once grasped before the eyes, all scheming ceases.\n\nNot the tangled vines of an old woman’s chatter,\nbut the true, compassionate, wondrous key.\nA bright moon lifted on the staff’s tip,\na brazier of red flame cradling spring snow.\n\nI am originally a cultivator of the Great Awakening,\nwho suddenly grasped the Chan of the ancestral masters.\nReturning to the snowy valley, none respond,\nemerald bamboo and yellow blossoms embody spontaneity.\n\nIn the painted hall, a single censer emits fine smoke,\nvainly sighing at Mañjuśrī’s inquiry into illness.\nThe moon over Caoxi shines bright, the wind is clear,\ngolden lotuses bloom across the Jetavana’s grounds.\n\nShouldering the tiger staff, I return at once,\nsnow seals the cold mountain path, leaving no way open.\nWho in this moment understands such freedom?\nOnly the few plum branches—true kindred spirits.\n\nSince recognizing the road to Chang’an,\nI no longer cherish idle blossoms or wild grasses.\nDeep in the night, the cuckoo cries from the branch,\nwhile within the gourd, pavilions and terraces bask in spring’s perfection.\n\nArriving home, at ease in effortless joy,\neverywhere the sacred signs manifest.\nWere it not for the thousand hands and eyes of great compassion,\nthe jade being would not lift the ancient mani.\n\nBy what Dharma treasure is this thing revealed?\nIn the profound, the dim, the fleeting and indistinct.\nSentient beings do not recognize this Tathāgata,\nthe lion’s den of buddhas across the three times.\n\nTo whom can one boast of true leisure and true joy?\nAll are but cranes and frogs in a well.\nWhen the song of the empty zither ends,\ngreen mountains remain, locked in mist and clouds.\n\nTrue Emptiness, Wondrous Form—\ntrue emptiness, wondrous form is no mere adornment,\nfrom ancient times to now, none have recognized it.\nA mass of pure radiance, displaying auspicious splendor,\nten thousand rays of clear light—even spirits cannot fathom.\n\nIllumining the Three Realms,\nshining upon the heavens,\nits exquisitely refined body ever fresh.\nResponding to things as they arise, without attachment,\nthe ancestral master who grasps it is called the Golden Immortal.\n\nEver lustrous, ever pristine,\nneither increasing nor diminishing, without birth or extinction.\nSentient beings fail to understand this,\nvainly contorting themselves outside its bounds.\n\nRoaming mountains and rivers in search of sages,\nall are fools—how can they discern?\nSpeak

in the spring wind,\npiling straw raincoat toward evening’s clear sky.\nMolding sand, idly playing,\ntapping tiles, laughing in welcome.\n\nGathering grasses to seek hidden delights,\nriding an ox, weary of walking.\n\nThe barbarian’s head shrivels tight,\nhis demon belly swells, his neck bulges thick.\nSongs rise for five or seven li,\nflutes trill two or three notes.\nBeckoning along narrow

couch, crickets chirp freely.\nAt ease like Bian Xiaoxian,\nwho napped by day and was deemed wise.\nKnowing fate, delighting in the Dao, forgetting poverty’s flattery,\njoy fills the bookshelf, years melt away.\nGreat was the Duke of Zhou’s dream of old,\ndrowning thoughts, the spirit unburdened.\nBody like rotting wood, lost in darkness,\nnature like dead ashes, forgetting odes and hymns.\nOn a rattan bed, a deep slumber—no cares,\nnot hearing the clear stream beside my ears.\nIn a moment, lost in murky stillness,\nmy soul wanders Hua Xu’s spring hues.\nPeople’s endless trivialities—\ndawn and dusk alike in confusion.\nWillows shade pavilions, ice mats cool,\ntender lotus dots the green pond.\nScenery changes, years pass,\nambitions unfulfilled, yellow millet scattered.\nLong sighing

barren fields.\nThe window of Kui—\ndim and near, reeds grow naturally.\nDust fills the empty walls,\nbeans sustain the waning years.\nSleeping on fragrant grass,\npurifying the heart, forsaking the hearth’s smoke.\nOld vines serve as a tiger’s staff,\nbroken branches trail like a chanting whip.\nOnly the three joys of poverty,\nnot a speck of earthly dust.\nBeyond the body, dwelling in a humble lane,\nwashing ears near a clear spring.\nSitting in tears, still knowing this,\nsinging as I walk—how pitiable!\nJi Lun is no true friend,\nYuan Xian is my equal.\nSandals mended with sedge

harm,\ncultivating virtue to illumine ancestral peaches.\nSoaring high, I outpace the qilin,\nwings unfurled, I laugh at cranes and pheasants.\nCutting off learning, I wander the Dark Pot,\nhymns of praise resound for the sagely court.\nWatching geese by the winding pond,\nshading deer with withered plantain leaves.\nSealing the senses, dwelling in substance,\ndeep roots need no hinge or

releases the wooden kite?\nThe stringless zither tunes itself.\nReturning through empty space at day’s end,\nno need to borrow the simurgh’s reins.\n\n*End of Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Three*\n*Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Four*\n\nThe Tortoise Mountain Recluse Longquanzi Writes *Secluded Dwelling*\n\nOn the full moon of the first lunar month in the *xīnmǎo* year of the Zhèngdà era, the Tortoise Mountain Recluse Longquanzi fled the chaos of war to the ancient lands of Táng, taking refuge amid the furrows of Bìyáng. His fence was of brushwood, his door of brambles; he wore a paper hat and a robe of woven hemp, dined on simple grain and wild greens, his complexion rough and hoarse—dull as a fool, incomplete in manner, concealing all his affairs.\n\nAdrift as one with no home, restless yet strangely content. Withered by worldly bonds, he sat motionless as a clod of earth, dim and obscure as a wooden colt behind a lattice. After a long while, he lifted his gaze to the heavens, chanted a song, and sighed: *\"How blissful is secluded dwelling! How blissful is secluded dwelling!\"*\n\nPresently, at his side stood the hermit Kuòránzi Xǔ Ruòhuì of Yǐngchāng, who had shed the world like a cicada’s husk. Rising from his seat, he bowed and asked: *\"What do you mean by this?\"*\n\nLongquanzi replied: *\"Have you not heard the crane cry in the shade, its mate answering in kind? When voices harmonize, when qi seeks its like—those of different Ways cannot counsel one another. Those outside the circle cannot know the language of those beyond the bounds.\"*\n\nKuòránzi’s expression darkened with indignation as he answered: *\"I have heard that the noble-minded ascend, while the petty-minded descend. Yet you, sir, dwell in seclusion—does this not signify the Dao? Is its principle not most subtle? Or is this merely glib deception? Do you not know the joys of riverside hamlets, the elegance of village life, the profound beauty of mountain retreat?\"*\n\nThe Recluse, startled, replied: *\"Ah! Is this so? Why not expound upon it? Do not conceal its essence.\"*\n\nSuddenly, he opened his speech with great animation:\n\n*\"Now, dwelling by the river keeps one far from the dust of the world and dissolves worldly cares. One chants verses in the desolate riverbanks, lodging one’s pride upon the duckweed isles. Silk is twisted into line, hempen thread into hook; bamboo is carved into rod, grains split into bait—thus does one angle for leviathans in the abyss of a hundred fathoms. The wind upon the water is one’s livelihood, gulls and herons one’s companions. At times, one casts the line from a perilous crag; at others, one drifts mid-stream in eddying turns. The fare is simple—rice porridge and minced fish—while the moon shines on the flute and mist gathers on the straw cloak. When the song of gathering water-chestnuts ends, the oars of orchid-wood beat the maple-lined river; returning with the day’s catch, one furls the net and sails home to the blue islets. Adrift upon the waves, one follows nature’s course, carefree and unhurried—escaping the world, one spends the years along the willow-lined shore. Is this not the joy of the fisherman’s life?*\n\n*Next, the elegance of village life: one’s livelihood is drawn from the fields, from mulberry and hemp. In spring, one plows the green shoots; in autumn, one reaps the bound sheaves. Strolling by bamboo-lined streams, calling out in flowered dells, one leads children to the thatched cottage and pastures chickens and dogs at the wicker gate. Beneath pine shade and mossy paths, woodcutters sing their songs; on sunlit slopes of barren earth, one idly sows melons. A pavilion amid wind-tossed bamboo, surrounded by cloud-wreathed mountains—when the rain clears, the sparse woods ring with birdsong, and the fading green slopes are dotted with cattle and sheep. ‘Return, ah, return! Spring is at its finest,’ and before the village feast, one hears the partridge’s cry. Is this not the purity of the field and cottage, the refinement of rustic dwelling?*\n\n*Thus, to spend one’s old age in mountain retreat holds great delight: threading through clouds and winding along streams, one finds stone paths and forest pavilions. Shutting out the world’s dust, forgetting the burdens of things, one harbors no ambition for wealth and rank, finding joy instead in the pleasures of forests and springs. In layered ravines, one nurtures simplicity; in shallow rapids, one washes one’s cap-strings. The wild heart is at ease, untroubled—beyond, one hears the cries of apes and birds; by the pine streams, one smiles to see deer bearing blossoms in their mouths. The mind rests in unadorned simplicity, content in emptiness and leisure. Opening the door, one finds companions in mist and rosy clouds; crossing the bridge, one walks upon beams of wisteria and cypress. At times, one seeks plum blossoms on the highest peaks; at others, one boils tea by the clear stream. The forest ridges rise in bright and graceful peaks; the grottoes harbor scenes of eternal spring. Towering trees pierce the sky, their branches twisting like azure rainbows; stone blossoms adorn the cliffs, their lichen patterns woven like brocade. Here, one whistles in carefree abandon, forgetting all form—how could this compare to the loneliness of secluded dwelling or the stagnation of silent sitting?*\n\nLongquanzi, hearing this, pushed aside his table and, with a slight shrug, smiled and said: *\"The foolish do not yield to the wise, the small do not presume upon the great—this is inauspicious. Without ascending Kunlun, how can one know the height of heaven? Without crossing rivers and seas, how can one know the vastness of water? Alas, the chaff-like masses, the clamorous rabble! They have heard only of Lao Peng’s longevity, yet what do they know of the untimely dead who attain venerable age? They see only that a cartload of firewood is as light as a feather, yet fail to see that the tip of an autumn hair outweighs Mount Tai. The universe is but a finger’s breadth; the ten thousand things are but a single horse. Great and small, much and little, long and short, wide and narrow—all reside within the self. Nobility and baseness, success and failure—what have they to do with external things?\"*\n\nKuòránzi, startled, exclaimed: *\"This deepens my understanding even more! Ah, this harried youth, though lacking the rites of washing and grooming, the decorum of sweeping and tidying, still wishes to receive your teaching—‘to hear it in the morning and die by evening would be enough.’\"* With this, he followed closely, bowing deeply, and prostrated himself twice to request instruction.\n\nThe Recluse said: *\"Return to your seat. I shall instruct you.\"*\n\nThen, stirred to sudden inspiration, he responded in form and word—his voice flowing forth like a clear cough, scattering fragrance as wood shavings fall from the plane, abundant and brimming as the surging waves of a vast, dark sea. From the pure wellspring of truth it welled naturally, the essence of reclusive dwelling.\n\nSuch a one neither chases after wealth and rank nor grieves over poverty and lowliness; neither delights in long life nor mourns an early death. Clad in coarse silk, he knows the warmth of fox-fur and brocade; eating plain beans, he savors the taste of rice, orchids, and citrus. Sheltered in a thatched hut, he enjoys the shade of towering halls; riding a simple carriage, he bears the adornment of a four-horse chariot. He does not hoard the world’s gains as his own private share, nor does he seek glory in ruling all under heaven. Advancing, he does not court the marketplace, laughing at Zhang Yi’s ruin by desire; retreating, he does not flee to the hills, lamenting Shan Bao’s fate at the jaws of a starving tiger.\n\nOnly then may one explore the hidden depths of reclusive dwelling, wander the gates of tranquility, transcend the world’s snares, and cast off human entanglements—coming and going without constraint, acting or resting at will. Now resting in a pine pavilion, now roaming the outskirts; now sipping fine wine to the sound of zither music, now ascending a terrace with a flowering staff. Sweeping moss from the courtyard, planting peach and plum along the garden paths. Strolling across open plains, passing idle days in leisure; lingering by small streams, filling quiet moments with the vastness of heaven and earth.\n\nFreed from the shackles of profit and fame, one faces the wind and moon in carefree ease. The place is secluded, with no visiting guests; the gate stands empty, without rites of welcome or farewell. Clothes and cap worn as one pleases, sleep comes with dreams of a quiet window; books and sword lie neglected, as one turns to gaze at white clouds stretching a thousand miles. Spring excursions and autumn delights, summer coolness and winter warmth—building a snail’s hut in the forest thicket, erecting a bare-walled dwelling in the wilds. Brush and ink gather dust, dissolving ten thousand cares; the wind and the poets’ verses lie scattered, veiled by the mist of the three isles.\n\nAt such a time, one drifts away in pure simplicity, ashamed to be entangled in worldly affairs; standing at the root of being, wisdom shines clear as the heavens. Thus one hides the mountain in the marsh, the boat in the ravine, the world within the world—yet pursues nothing, roaming beyond the ten thousand transformations, in the land of *wuheyou*, the boundless wilds. Let Zhe Yi dare not speak of the joy of knocking on the fisherman’s oar; let Zi Zhen dare not speak of the pleasures of tilling at Valley Mouth; let Hong Jing’s sworn covenant dare not speak of the seclusion of Zhongnan’s Juqu.\n\nThose who draw near to me are Beigong Zi; those who befriend me are Huang Dayuan; those who meet me are Pei Du; those who know me are Yuanming; those who honor me are Wei Qiong; those who summon me are Xu Mian. Facing fine days and beautiful scenes, at ease in a humble abode—unburdened and carefree, staff in hand, sandals on feet—one gazes at fish by the pond, listens to birds in the forest. Seizing a few fleeting moments of joy, content in simplicity, one washes away the dust of the mind, opening and closing the gates of heaven. Neither riding the wind in the gardens of Zheng nor dreaming of butterflies in the gardens of Qi. Pillow high in the southern window, yielding to the earth in self-possession.\n\nBody at ease, untroubled; heart empty, unhurried; mind vacant, unthinking; spirit obscure, unknowing; *qi* joyful, without striving. Serene and still, in harmony beyond measure, soaring above the nine abysses, forgetting all answers to the four questions. Like drifting duckweed, like swaying reeds—unfettered and vast, attaining the great mystery, the supreme perfection, the utmost refinement, the ultimate extremity. Such is the principle of reclusive leisure.\n\nKuòránzi, hearing this, clasped it to his heart with earnest devotion, bowing his head in gratitude, and withdrew in reverent awe. Soaring freely—ah, soaring freely in spirit, he met the profound and obscure, observing the Dao’s equality of all things. Discerning the signs of illusion’s beginning, awakening to the great smelting of yin and yang, exhausting the barriers of creation, penetrating the dense thickets of superiority and inferiority.\n\nThus one may advance when it is time to advance, retreat when it is time to retreat, soar when it is time to soar, alight when it is time to alight. Above, one reaches the heavens; below, one coils upon the earth. Spirit extends in four directions, sighing at the ten thousand beings, roaming boundless and strange realms, flying beyond all boundaries. Grasping wind and clutching moon, lingering in the spring of Guye; lying on grass and swallowing blossoms, circling the wilds of Dongting. Nurturing truth without adornment, dancing with lotus and hibiscus. Drinking the divine mist from the rice steamer, feasting on morning radiance from the round jade. Sustained by the dew of the Milky Way, borne aloft by the whirlwind’s embrace. Crossing the waters of Peach Blossom Spring to arrive, passing the crimson walls of Red City to depart. Soaring high beyond the bounds of the three realms, flapping wings beyond the nine heavens. Rain clears and sun warms—appearing and vanishing with light ease; wind stills and mist fades—moving freely in graceful disarray.\n\nUnbound by decay, too lazy to keep company with crows perched on withered branches—east and west, up and down, drifting with nature’s current. Treading the vast emptiness, one drifts in blissful contentment.\n\nAlas! In this shallow age, the common crowd is dazzled and indolent, like butterflies flitting in confusion, chasing red and seeking green. The fleeting beauty of things—here they lightly flit through willow lanes, play with shadows in flowered streets. The spirit of plum and the soul of orchid—beware lest they sink into infatuation; powdered wings and fragrant feelers—beware the pursuit of attachment. Wandering through scenes of splendor, surveying the sights—grieving at spring’s dawn, lingering in the golden chambers of blossoms; dabbing powder and stealing fragrance, lodging together in silken curtains. Wild hearts scattered and disordered, seduced by vulgar beauty, swaying with the wind beneath the leaves, chasing after the riches of the branches.\n\nDream-souls muddied and overflowing, never escaping the veil of delusion; root-nature like the toad in the navel, ultimately unable to transcend the stench of decay. Yet the perfected one is not so. Suddenly awakening, steadily penetrating—riding the light before the dawn of doubt, fulfilling one’s will at the beginning of the boundless. Commanding the myriad wonders, sweeping away the eight impurities; in motion, not following the transformations of things; in stillness, unaware of the one who governs existence. Embracing the universe, vast and minute alike, wielding the luminous clarity of spirit, relying on purity and simplicity.\n\nTo cease the carving of caskets, weaving through past and present, savoring the vast and tranquil—blood and pulse dissolve into emptiness and nothingness. Such is to know the primal act and its purpose, to grasp the unso and its so. Within the realm of silence and stillness, the chirp of a tiny insect resounds like thunder; in the land of obscurity and boundlessness, the tip of an autumn hair looms like Mount Tai. Deeper still, more profound, more spiritually refined—beyond this, even the most skilled reckoner cannot fathom, let alone the common mind.\n\nConsider those who awaited celestial omens: the Li clan; the dream-weaver of Nanhua; Cui the Wild Moth; Zhou Fang with his unrolled scrolls; Wang Zhuo, who spoke in verse; the most admirable, Master Zhang; Lu Guimeng, who knew the metamorphosis of the orange; and Changquanzi, who mimicked madness in vain imitation. Yet these are but the fringes—exhausted, they come to an end.\n\n**Reclusion**\nReturn, ah return! Bowing to clumsiness, feigning foolishness. No need to open the three paths, nor drift upon the five lakes. Dwelling in a crooked hollow, residing in a chink of the wall. My life has its limits—time slips away, unmeasured. Endless striving, ceaseless toil. Neither do I gather ferns, nor must I wash my ears. Without intent, I emerge from the mountain’s cave to inscribe a bridge; weary of soaring through the clouds, I advance in humble sandals. Now on South Mountain, now by the waters of Pu. Delighting in the return to mugwort and thatch, offering a seat to ants and maggots. Some concealed their traces on Su Gate, some purified themselves in the Wine Spring. Though their forms may fade, their fragrance lingers. Unfit for court and temple, they lightly cast aside tattered crowns. Lofty in resolve and integrity, they whistle and wander amidst clouds and mist. Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade within, they rest on stone by the abyss. Still, they scorn the six seals of the swan’s feather, the thousand goblets of the snail’s horn. Roaming beyond the dust and grime, carefree within heaven and earth. Valleys deep and peaks steadfast, willows by the gate and pines in the courtyard. Seven bowls of fine tea, a mat of pure wind. Stretching and bending beneath the moonlit stream’s misty radiance, exhaling to stir the primordial chaos with the Cloud Lord. Clad in kudzu cap and feather fan, staff adorned with deer-dust and speckled bamboo. Ancient plans among the forests and peaks, profound depths of Dao and virtue. At ease in boundless expanse, leisurely in open heart. Dwelling beyond the world’s edge, gazing upon emptiness and stillness. Forgetting sorrow in the fisherman’s song and woodcutter’s chant, wandering in sandals through mountain hamlets and marshlands. Crane companions and ape friends, pure and clear; solitary in stillness, silent in return. Distant from markets and courts, content and self-sufficient; blocking the brushwood gate, serene and self-possessed. Able to dismiss the four and reflect on the three, never daring to advance an inch or retreat a foot.\n\nThus it is said: Yu Jun, who carved the obscure; Ma Ji, who knew the true sound. Sighing deeply, Liang Xian found no spectacle; whistling long, Ruan Ji rejoiced all the more.\n\nEnough! **Reclusion, reclusion**—hiding the self in secrecy. Veiled and foolish, without expectation, without insistence. Ah! Let the black-haired masses chase the floating clouds—how can they compare to my return, where earth is thick and the lotus blooms?\n\n**Vastness**\nWho recognizes the guest of the great curve’s wholeness, roaming boundless east and west, south and north? A square inch carved open reveals the Five Thousand Characters; a single word encompasses the Three Hundred Poems. Seizing the wind, driving the roc’s wings, the eight wastes and four extremes become mere paths. Fermenting the vastness, stirring limitless brew—stars and constellations fill the flask, yet all remains at ease. The lion’s roar, the flying spring’s sip—with a single sweep, demons vanish and ghosts weep. Last night, wine-sodden, phoenix and simurgh perched upon the terrace; the vastness of the cosmos seemed too narrow for my unbounded heart. Crossing Kunlun’s peaks, traversing with a long flute—lake light and moon drench the white of the stream’s moss. Stone locks green, the crane has not come; wild apes cry in vain at the jade-green lotus peak. Fragrant lingzhi, blossoming jasper—scent drifts, dew heavy, pearls drip. A thousand ages’ heroes are but a cellar of dust; the five-cloud towers and pavilions are the immortals’ abodes.\n\nReturn to Red City, where spring is in full bloom—cease casting the silk line upon the misty waves.\n\n**Entering the Dao**\nTo enter the gate of the Mysterious, one must know its path.\n\nRejecting ostentation, casting aside wife and children,\nWashing clean affection and love, purging perverse attachments.\nEmbracing softness and poverty, forgetting arrogance and extravagance,\nDiscussing yin and yang, encompassing the warp and weft of the cosmos.\nHarmonizing east and west, balancing li and gui,\nEach thread and grain of rice revives a sense of shame.\nThe body like a solitary cloud, the heart like autumn waters,\nSecluded among forests and springs, moving unseen among the dust of the world.\nDelighting in a simple gourd and bowl, ever cautious from beginning to end,\nNeither drawn to wealth nor rank, nor stirred by enmity.\nInwardly embracing emptiness, outwardly severing all that is false,\nSwiftly relinquishing the human realm, fully versed in the Mysterious Principle.\nSilent and vast, pure and unadorned,\nRefining the body and clarifying the spirit, transcending the mundane.\nSurveying the true immortals, they stand apart from this.\nAll things are manifest, yet only the stubborn remain base.\nThe Dao does not exalt humanity—it blends its light with the common.\nWords as firm as metal and stone, virtue fragrant and ever more beautiful.\nGathering from the multitude of scriptures, scraping away flaws and blemishes,\nDiligently studying the myriad methods, the numinous root and jade elixir.\nThe cinnabar gates and jade palaces require no labor to attain.\nAlas, alas! The scholars of this age—\nDonning hempen topknots and Daoist robes, nothing more.\nWhat have they truly studied in the classics? How could they know the Way?\nOne day they leave the household, and deem themselves enlightened;\nA lifetime they wander, yet their nature remains restless and unrefined.\nGrasping at gluttony, harming others for personal gain—\nWith such cultivation of the truth, upon what can they rely?\nThe drifting masses—who among them can be truly discerning?\nHeed these words carefully, lest you stray further.\nBe vigilant in this, and your pure name shall remain unblemished.\n\n**Ascending the Hall to Address the Assembly**\nThe supreme virtue is vast and formless, the wondrous Dao subtle and silent,\nExisting before earth and heaven, unbound by written words.\nRadiant and empty, pervading the ten directions,\nPure, numinous, and unobstructed, circulating through the three realms.\nA thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, governing yin and yang,\nIts essence and function eternally true—boundless and inexhaustible.\nYet how can the common multitude, burdened by heavy obstructions, bear such a burden?\nThey scorn the ancient and exalt the present, vainly generating false views,\nChattering about the Dharma and engaging in meditation, opening side doors and windows.\nThus the primordial simplicity of the Great Ultimate scatters, and teachings branch into three schools.\nAmid the field of discriminating thought, they cannot return to the source.\nBehold these people—how deeply they merit compassion.\nTherefore, the gates of expedient means are flung wide, and the compassionate vessel set afloat,\nUniversally rescuing sentient beings from the苦海, liberating them from the six realms of rebirth.\nGuiding them back to the true path, restoring them to the primal chaos.\nCarving open a tranquil and joyous gateway, roaming the Crimson Towers of the Pure Capital.\nUpon the Five Clouds Terrace, the mysterious pearl of the millet is clearly transmitted;\nBy the Nine Luminaries Pavilion, the luminous treasure sword is raised high.\nUnfettered across the boundless expanse, unconstrained and free,\nMoving and resting without action, merging into pure simplicity.\nThus one may sweep away the neither-dead-nor-alive, the neither-excess-nor-lack,\nDispelling both sage and mortal, embracing emptiness and form alike.\nEven if the clay ox bellows at the moon, the wooden horse neighs at the wind,\nOr the leaking bucket’s mechanism is set in motion—these are but the master’s jest.\nIn the blazing words of the moment, within the silent radiance,\nShatter the golden-maned lion.\nThe five petals gather, the three mysteries are brushed aside,\nThe original hammer of the Primordial is wielded freely.\nManifesting the formless, dwelling idly in the garden of Zheng,\nAlready there are Zhuangzi and Liezi.\nYet how is it that scholars abandon the host to cling to guests,\nNeglecting the profound emptiness, wasting straw sandals in vain pursuit?\nWhat are they seeking? The stone lion’s heart and liver are gouged out,\nThe wild fox’s drool soaks to the bone marrow.\nIf one were to practice in this manner, how could a noble person guide them?\nNow, I casually cast the medicine of the Dharma into the world,\nOffering this brew to nourish the superior ones.\nI raise the fundamental livelihood of our original nature, examining the face before us.\nRevealing a hint of this message, I entrust it to those who understand—\nWhat tune is this family tradition playing?\nA music beyond the standard pitches, a spring beyond the kalpas,\nA zither played without strings, a flute sounding the music of heaven.\nNo need for golden needles and jade threads to embroider the rainbow robes of the phoenix.\nIf one comprehends this, they may return at once,\nAscending the unending towers, joining the refined gathering.\nDrawing water with a bottomless basket, making the rootless iron tree bloom—\nWhat is the model for this transmission?\nBeyond the primordial chaos, no negotiation is permitted;\nBefore the Spirit Treasure Peak, who can set foot?\nOne must be utterly unencumbered, no longer entangled in confusion.\nSuddenly awakening to the Mysterious Wind, roaming the cosmos,\nLong cherishing the company of immortal guests—may you treasure this.\n\n**Tea**\nI have heard that with a single thunderous roar,\nThe finest fragrance is exhaled;\nPhoenix cakes and dragon rounds manifest the rarest of true substances.\nNurtured by yin and yang, suffused with the vapors of heaven and earth,\nEndowed with the vital qi of the four seasons, seizing the purest flavor of the five phases.\nIn the gardens before spring, born as precious jade flakes;\nBefore the auspicious snows of Kunlun, wrought into the numinous sprouts of the elixir.\nGathered by jade maidens, its wondrous use follows the seasons.\nWhen ground in the golden mortar, its fragrant dust delights the nose.\nWhen brewed in the stone cauldron, jade blossoms surge like waves.\nLu Tong’s seven bowls wash away the stupor of the six desires;\nThe three pinches of the venerable elder purge the turbid dreams of all beings.\nThose who love it find their spirits refreshed; those who comprehend it find their hearts purified.\nDo not say this is merely the custom of immortals—it is truly the sustenance of Daoists.\nI offer this single taste to all,\nMay you return content—treasure this well.\n\n**The Golden Lotus Assembly at Changchun Abbey in Tangzhou**\nIt is said that families who accumulate goodness will surely enjoy abundant blessings,\nWhile those who harm living things will inevitably invite deep misfortune.\nDwelling within heaven and earth, one must understand the causes of fortune and calamity.\nThus it is said: Heaven has no favorites, it aids only those with virtue.\nRetribution follows as swiftly as an echo or shadow, never erring.\nDo not dismiss small good deeds as inconsequential, nor belittle minor virtues as unrewarded.\nWhat begins as a trifle, over years, accumulates into mountains.\nWhen disaster strikes, regret comes too late.\nTherefore, the noble person, perceiving the outward, understands the inward;\nObserving the past, they foresee the future.\nDiligent and earnest, humble and compassionate, they pass their days,\nUpholding simplicity while bestowing generously, perpetuating the path of goodness.\nAlas! The common people’s transgressions blot out the sky,\nTurning from enlightenment to embrace the dust, never considering purification.\nLosing themselves in things, forfeiting their nature to worldly customs.\n\nAmidst restless fragmentation and scattered chaos, with myriad anxieties clouding the mind like turbid waters, one drifts helplessly through the labyrinth of delusion, unable to return to the root. Beholding the state of the multitudes, how can one not grieve?\n\nYet our Patriarch Chongyang, the Universally Transforming Perfected One, flung wide the gate of expedient means, broadly expounding the profound principles of the Primordial Origin. He guided the common stream of mortals to wander anew the jadelike path—this is the sacred cause, the joyous assembly of the Golden Lotus.\n\nWhat does this signify? Gold is the foundation of nature; the lotus, the stem of life. Scattered, it becomes ten thousand vessels; gathered, it returns to one gold. Forged in the great crucible, refined a hundred times, it grows ever purer. Though great in constancy and small in variation, it serves the needs of all beings, each according to their desire. The flower unfolds its five petals, exhaling fragrant winds; it stands peerless among blossoms, its fragrance unmatched. Its brocade banners and crimson adornments rival the craft of creation; its green canopy and golden heart deeply grasp the subtleties of yin and yang. Rippling upon the water’s surface, its elegant rhythm endures like a long hairpin; beneath moon and sun, it paints the isles of Penglai with resplendent hues. Those who awaken to it may keep company with sages; those who uphold it are sustained by virtue and power. Resting in the mysterious pass, one remains free from fault throughout life.\n\n**Rhapsody on Leisure and Tranquility**\nIn an age of murky love and defilement, who cherishes clarity? While others entangle themselves in a thousand cares, I alone pass my days in idleness. Breaking free from the shackles of calamity, I dwell ever in peace; escaping the snares of flies and gnats, I fully awaken to luminous clarity. Thus, I have severed worldly fetters and mastered the subtle net of the Dao. Roaming the boundless Great Clarity, I deepen my roots and secure my stem; abiding in tranquil serenity, I delight in long life and enduring vision. Having grasped this principle, the mind becomes as limpid as autumn waters; in all movements, it is as wondrous as the arising of spring winds.\n\nStanding solitary and resolute, profound and still, it is sharp yet not cutting—like a mirror distinguishing beauty from ugliness; radiant yet impartial—like the moon illuminating heaven and earth. Upright in nature, at ease in the six senses, lofty and pure in the wellspring of spirit, its integrity is like the pine and bamboo. Vast and unobstructed in the Dharma realm, it is the pure and simple mysterious gate. Thus, the body soars like a solitary cloud, the heart transcends like a wild crane. In subtlety, it conceals mountains within marshes; in freedom from thought, it hides the boat in the ravine. Clear and penetrating, it roams the boundless expanse. Unburdened by the slightest attachment, the spirit soars in the wanderings of Mount Gushe; self and other forgotten, it treads the vastness of the empty sky.\n\nThis is no privilege of the sage alone but the doing of the practitioner. If one has not relinquished fame and profit, how can one awaken to the subtle and formless? As the *Nanhua* says of the great sage’s leisure, and as Confucius spoke of the petty person’s anxiety—those who preach Chan while mired in desire, who expound wonders while burdened by family, may earn the veneration of fools but cannot escape the ridicule of the wise. One must cultivate merit in purity, turn inward, and reflect in stillness. As Laozi’s teaching holds: attain utmost emptiness and firmly guard tranquility; as Yan Hui’s essential practice: nourish the limbs and abandon cleverness.\n\nThus, when mind and method both dissolve, life and death are both relinquished. Through pure cultivation, the fruit of the Dao is perfected; through awakening to emptiness and leisure, the mysterious heaven is pierced. From this, one abruptly casts off the causes of leakage and desolation pervades the cosmos; deeply resting in the cave of non-action, one whistles freely amidst clouds and mist.\n\nHow lamentable! The ant toils for its meal, the moth sacrifices its life for the flame. Who, adrift in the bitter realms of suffering, would strive to perfect their virtue? Ah, better to heed the call early, delight in leisure, and return to the Mysterious Capital to pay homage to the Supreme Sage.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Mysterious**\nVast is the origin of doubt, wondrous the profound mystery. I briefly express the aspiration for purity and emptiness, momentarily declaring the subtle and marvelous. Carving open the gate of simplicity, the divine mechanism remains unfathomable; bursting forth the luminous essence, its wondrous use is manifest.\n\nOnly when upright is one free from deviation; only when penetrating is there no need for discourse. It does not lie in verbal sparring or hand gestures and oral instructions. The Three Clarities’ mysterious teaching cannot be grasped through clever debate; the single flavor of fermentation does not arise from heroic excellence. For those who awaken, it is inherently present, attained through innate clarity. It does not depend on performing deeds or seated meditation but first requires dispelling desire and forgetting emotion. These subtle workings are scarcely extraordinary.\n\nWithin the pot lies the unending day of heaven—most honored, most noble; beyond the world stretches the everlasting spring—truly refined, truly pure. Yet the ignorant and deluded, scattered and lost, cling to a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises, embracing the One amid the Five Phases and Two Modes. Though they generate knowledge and perception, they remain fundamentally ignorant of the numinous void; though they distinguish sage from mortal, they never reach true stillness. Today, they cling to peripheral details, abandoning the subtle and formless—like rejoicing in dreamt wealth or sating hunger with painted cakes. The wise craftsman smiles in secret; how would the deluded know?\n\nGrasping the wind of profound tranquility, one attains wonder within wonder; responding to the principle of quiescence illuminating form and emptiness, one acts through non-action. Thus, the true immortals recognize the enlightened. Clad in hemp robes and paper jackets, their hearts hold the celestial mechanism and mysterious principle. Simple, unadorned, pure, and immaculate—within them, heaven and earth, virtue and power are fully contained; sages, worthies, and immortals all attain realization through this. Thus, one ascends the ladder beyond the world, transcending the norms of the mundane. Rolled up, it does not fill a fist; unfurled, it deeply pervades the eight directions. Neither dull nor silent, it transcends yin and yang. From this, one abandons learning and forgets speech, the moon shining above the azure sky; attains emptiness and nurtures vastness, clouds idling beside green peaks.\n\nAlas! The solitary deluded ones rush about in worldly affairs, unwilling to return to purity, blind to the obscure and indistinct. How sorrowful! Who knows the profound mechanism of the Great Dao, where every movement is bound to external things?\n\n**Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir**\nThe secret formula of the Great Dao is rarely known to learners. A single grain of the Golden Elixir is most precious; the two silver trees are difficult to sustain. Sever ties with the entanglements of right and wrong, fame and profit—externally, this clarifies gains and losses; abandon the realms of wine, sex, anger, and wealth—internally, this strengthens the root and foundation.\n\nHow could it not be that tranquility and stillness serve as the origin, yin and yang as the ancestors? Gathering the marrow of the myriad dharmas and sages, seizing the wind and rain of the eight directions and the cosmos. Listening as the thunder of *jia-yi* first erupts, fire nurturing the tortoise and serpent; awaiting the tide of *gui-ren*’s Kan-water, the crucible boiling the dragon and tiger. At that moment, the Jade Maiden rides the phoenix, the Golden Elder mounts the ox. Planting the Yellow Sprout, it roars at the earthly gate; spreading the radiant clouds, they coil afar upon the celestial tower. Thus, the four corners fill with mist, the five peaks gather their clouds. Behold the Azure Youth, crowned with spring orchids, planting mushrooms by the pool; rejoice in the Crimson Child, draped in plain silk, locking the wild monkey in the cabinet. It must be when the crow and hare converge in their palaces, the Milky Way revolves. The Vermilion Bird rests quietly in the fragrant chamber, the Dark Warrior drunkenly slumbers in the clouded hall. Jade terraces rise in mist, the chaos in the sea ascends in transformation; the crimson watchtower deepens in spring, the orioles within the willows first trill their songs. Truly, the secret formula is hard to transmit—profound, yet ever more profound. The ice-wheel gleams bright as Chang’e pounds her elixir; the brocade sail sways gracefully as the immortal maidens steer their boat. In the cinnabar clouds of the cave, horses are seized; on Mount Taibai, the flying spring cascades. Among the clouds, the purple cassia blooms, transforming into jade-like herbs; within the furnace, the green pine bears fruit, transmuting into golden coins. The subtle parrot returns to its nest, the mandarin ducks settle their pillows. Auspicious mists drift, adorning cultural splendor; sweet dew descends, ripening the fields of magic mushrooms. Clear notes resound—cranes sing the zither of the nine luminaries; emerald hues shimmer—cocks spar with the brocade of the seven stars. From this, swords and halberds vanish from the groves, the sun soars to the vast cold palace. Refining cinnabar and mercury into numinous treasures, using wood and metal to forge the true altar. Assembling a thousand spirits in the Hall of Three Blossoms, they return together to the Holy Mother; gathering the ten thousand phenomena in the Palace of the Six Dings, all enter the mud-pill. How splendid! Attaining this Golden Elixir, one instantly transcends the mundane world. Riding the green phoenix, one bids farewell to the Middle Kingdom; following the purple decree, one swiftly ascends to the court of the Supreme Emperor. Clothed in jade pendants and rainbow robes, fed with peaches of immortality and cinnamon elixirs. Joyfully roaming forever in the Mystic Capital, one enjoys eternal life and boundless existence.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Eightfold Chan**\nTeaching has sudden and gradual paths, Chan knows no before or after. Those who are deluded remain distant beyond kalpas; those who awaken perceive it here and now. Neither coming nor going, moving through the six supernormal powers with ease; neither arising nor ceasing, transcending the three realms in solitary perfection.\n\n**First: Brushing the Edge**\nFear neither clamor nor disturbance, nor dwell in carefree detachment. Those who divide the gate into five schools forcibly fabricate knowledge and views; those who elevate the One Vehicle still fall into emptiness. Simply reveal constantly, release everything. A thousand paths of cool wind—between the pines, the stone maiden sings; three poles of bright moon—on the ridge, the shepherd boy plucks water chestnuts.\n\n**Second: Dharma’s Function**\nWisdom is innate, spiritual clarity suddenly opens. Responding to circumstances, one must manifest inherent nature; facing conditions, one must still the heart. Harmonizing the four images, penetrating the three talents. Green waters flow endlessly, allowing life and death to arise and cease; green mountains remain unmoved, letting clouds come and go.\n\n**Fourth: True Emptiness**\nEverlasting from ancient times to the present, neither decaying nor perishing. Those who are deluded cling to sounds and forms; those who are enlightened transcend into nothingness. Sweeping away wind and clouds, rubbing the stars and constellations. The zither’s melody is exquisite—the wooden horse in the hall roars; the snow’s tune is rare—the jade dragon in the sea flies and runs.\n\n**Fifth: Universal Illumination**\nDo not seek the Bodhisattva of the southeast, nor search for Amitābha of the northwest. Wherever the eye falls is the dharma-realm—what place is not Chan? Realizing this, one is truly capable. Dwelling in the dust yet beyond it, how could one fall into the illusions of the ten thousand conditions? In desire yet free from desire, one does not sink into the demons of the six thieves.\n\n**Sixth: Receiving Beings**\nEncountering the source from all sides, stillness and illumination return to simplicity. Those who cling to old vines and hags trade bones for a thousand kalpas; those who point directly to the spiritual source utter a single phrase of absolute learning. Freely seizing or releasing, uniquely transcendent. White clouds and green peaks—everywhere is thusness; emerald bamboos and yellow flowers—all things are perfect awakening.\n\n**Seventh: Perfect Completion**\nUtterly without attachment, encompassing the great thousand worlds. Those who hold up a flower to the assembly truly overthink; those who scold the Buddha and revile the ancestors still err. Who understands the step forward? The lotus blooms in the Deer Park. □ □ returns—the moon fills the riverboat. Lifting forth one’s own house style, one instantly transcends the ten grounds; trampling the stubborn emptiness of dreams, one uniquely delights in the heavens.\n\n**Eighth: Dissolving Deceit**\nAll is empty vanity—how dare one contend for worth? Those who compare dregs know not true flavor; those who drill into koans grasp not the wondrous principle. A hair’s breadth of difference leads one a thousand miles astray. The wooden man says: If you wish to know this \"coming from the west,\" you must drink the marrow of the Nirvāṇa Golden Immortal.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Perfected and True**\nThe divine and sagely bestow their decrees, benevolence universally equal.\n\nHaving grandly propagated the Mysterious Teachings, we now reverently uphold the Perfect and True. Who knows that the loftiest immortals of the Ten Poles descend to wander this world? The ancient Way of the Three Sovereigns is broadly expounded, harmoniously transforming all people. Rooted in virtue that pervades all schools, the heart returns to the One Correctness. Those who leave the secular world part from kin and sever love; those who embrace poverty delight in heaven and know destiny. Thus the Perfect and True: study and cultivate nature. Fame, wealth, and sensuality are seen as floating pivots upon water; wisdom and spiritual penetration shine as brightly as the ancient sages of the teachings. Truly, in learning one must not be attached, in seeking the Dharma one must attain great penetration. Broadly accumulating virtuous conduct, one outwardly extends expedient means; deeply engaging in cultivation, one inwardly circulates divine power. Skillfully abiding in non-action and non-duality, one can seek the Way of unity and resonance. Each thing distinct and clear, gleaming like the bright moon in a deep pool; every response manifest, moving like the pure wind over grass. Surely, regardless of high or low, all are uplifted. Those who study have cause and effect; those who attain know neither birth nor extinction. Utmost stillness, utmost harmony, utmost integrity, utmost purity. Uniting all virtues to interact with beings, never forsaking compassion; propagating the Three Teachings to dispel delusion, ever revering the wise and sagely. Generally, begging for food brings no shame, utmost poverty no sorrow. Repaying one’s own kindness to others, one bestows grace upon the orphaned and aged; lofty aspirations and unyielding integrity, one lodges pride in kings and lords. These are called the heroic knights of the Perfect and True, the immortal currents who attain the Dao. Suddenly awakening to the celestial mechanism, loftily spreading the Mysterious Wind and roaming the sacred realms; broadly casting fragrant bait, universally seeking wise companions to journey to Penglai Isle. Thus, seeing things one clarifies the mind, knowing emptiness one awakens to the Dao. Practicing the orthodox Dharma of the Perfect and True, one strictly follows Zhong and Lü; grasping the profound principles of the Great Dao, one solemnly reveres the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. In clarity and tranquility, within the red furnace refine silver threads; in purity and subtlety, within the cinnabar tripod concoct the Great Treasure. Fully expressing renunciation, that false compound, one attains spontaneity. Realizing the wondrous within the wondrous of true appearance, obtaining the perfection within the perfection of true power. Five silver mists of the Dao pierce the Dipper; one wheel of the red sun illuminates the heavens. Crane-drawn chariots bearing golden script ascend to the Nine Yang Palace; peaches of immortality and jade nectar seat one at the banquet of the Ten Thousand Sages. Alas, there are those foolishly deluded, contending over self and others. Those who propagate strange and monstrous things do not comprehend the mysterious and wondrous; those who deceive and bewilder the middling and inferior know not cause and effect. Though they escape the fiery household and the mountain of恩, they enter the shackles of fame and the fetters of profit.\n\nO how lamentable! If one wishes to know the true essence of the Perfect and True, one must suddenly comprehend the emptiness that suffices.\n\nOffice does not surpass immortality.\nPeople have far-sightedness, hearts no near worries.\nThough one may hold office and attain eminence, it does not compare to the carefree wandering of immortals.\nLet them be ranked in the court with golden seals and purple cords—\nhow can this compare to ascending the Gardens of Hearing, the moonlit palaces and starry towers?\nI have heard that the enlightened resign from office, while fools seek official emolument.\nWhen Zhang Liang returned to the mountains, he was utterly free from harm;\nwhen Fan Li took to his boat, he avoided execution.\nKnowing this Dao, why seek the floating fame of office?\nFor what truly benefits the self, nothing compares to the pure blessings of immortality.\nWhen power reaches the highest rank and fame resounds in all directions,\nthose who enrich wives and indulge children merely covet fat salaries;\nthose who deceive the public and oppress subordinates fear no deep calamity.\nOnly deluded by the fiery household, they do not awaken to the immortal realm.\nPalaces crumble, honor fades—having created karma, they ultimately return to the underworld;\ncoarse hemp and humble rags—having realized truth, they hasten to Penglai.\nHow can this compare to golden elixir and immortal peaches, blossoms bright as clouds and brocade?\nSubduing dragons and taming tigers, they dwell in the halls of the Five Elders;\nembracing the moon and sleeping in clouds, their pillows are the Seven Stars.\nWholly devoted to non-action beyond the world, they do not love the highest ranks of the court.\nIn the world, jade hairpins and vermilion shoes are but a dream, floating splendor;\nwithin the gourd, purple cassia and the fields of magic mushrooms flourish for ten thousand years.\nThe palaces of Qin and the gardens of Han are now white poplars and fragrant grasses;\nalas, the old city of Chengdu is but peach blossoms and azaleas.\nWhat use are heaps of money and treasure? What firmness is there in nest-like wives and children?\nEven as a worthy minister, one cannot compare to the ranks of immortals.\nHave you not seen Chan the Minister, who abandoned office, awakened to the utmost truth, and forgot the world?\nOr Prince Siddhartha, who relinquished his kingdom, realized supreme enlightenment, and returned to heaven?\nMoreover, those who gain wealth and honor through injustice—how are they different from floating clouds?\nThose who obtain profit and emolument through disloyalty—are they not like worn-out shoes?\nEven if one attains both ministerial and noble rank, it does not compare to the unique beauty of immortals.\nThus Li Si was defiled and humiliated, meeting the white blade at Yunyang;\nwhile the Yellow Emperor, spiritually penetrating, obtained the Mysterious Pearl at the Red Waters.\nThis fully demonstrates escaping the worldly net and realizing the immortal lineage.\nSweeping mist and rosy clouds from the Dipper’s mouth, suspending sun and moon from the Star Bridge.\nFrom this, abandoning the limited pride and extravagance of the human realm, the feasts and pleasures of the vermilion steps;\nattaining the boundless blessings and benefits of heaven, the carefree wandering of the Purple Palace.\nYet how can one be so deluded by the immortal capital as to covet official rank?\nThose who cling to it all suffer imprisonment; those who cast it off avoid sinking into ditches.\nEven the splendor of Golden Valley cannot compare to the joy of Peach Blossom Spring.\nI urge the people of the world: hear early and learn to be heavenly immortals, return to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and keep the appointment.\n\nThe Bitter Sea—\nVast and bitter sea, surging love river.\nRegardless of worthiness or foolishness, all sink and drown; regardless of nobility or baseness, all waste away.\nFrom ancient times to the present, who suddenly casts off the waves of desire?\nThe most exalted and the noble all perish in the waves of恩.\nRecall the ancient purity of the Yellow Emperor, the clarity and emptiness of Laozi.\nThe Five Constants of Confucius’ utmost virtue, the wondrous principles of Śākyamuni’s Three Vehicles.\nRaising high the mast of the Dharma boat, universally rescuing the virtuous.\nThe Four Sagely Ones of compassion leave behind the mysterious formula to escape the bitter sea;\nthe turbid and overflowing passions of the multitude willingly drown in the foul waters of the deluded ford.\nYet people drift endlessly, entangled without cease.\nSome let their minds wander and float away; some follow the world and sink into the current.\nBogged down in the waves of emotion, mired in the caves of karma, sorrowful.\nComing and going, swift as fish, a hundred years submerged;\nmoving and turning, slow as turtles, ten thousand ages submerged.\n\nAmidst the vast and murky depths, the bends and eddies stretch endlessly.\nThose who cling to them meet with calamity and hardship; those who depart know neither birth nor death.\nThe wise, the benevolent, the noble, the virtuous—once they set their hands to the task, they forget all else;\nthe dull, the foolish, the deluded, the lost—these remain entangled for life.\nConsider the countless beings drowning in the whirlpools of suffering:\nto the deluded, it is called the bitter sea; to the awakened, it is but Penglai and Yingzhou.\nThe boundless expanse of ten thousand acres of surging waves drowns only the benighted;\nthe fathomless thousand-span towering billows cannot defile the luminous and clear.\nIf one dallies thus in idle play, when shall one ever cross to the other shore?\nUnless one reaches the shores of the pure shallows, one can scarcely avoid the dark paths of the Yellow Springs.\n\nBehold the worthy Fan Li, who rode a small boat to ascend to the realm of truth;\nthe enlightened Zhang Qian, who drifted upon the sacred stake and found his encounter.\nI exhort the common folk: turn back, do not wander further.\nEmulate the feathered immortals of Yingzhou; do not become withered skeletons in the bitter sea.\nThus may you gather mist and rosy clouds in your sleeves and recline high in the green mountains and jade grottoes;\nhoist the sun and moon upon your staff and ascend in delight to the sacred isles of the other shore.\n\nAlas! Lightly they rejoice in floating, yet none can escape.\nRound and round the waves churn, vast and boundless the clear and turbid merge as one.\n\"Return! Why not cast off the bitter sea and play in the golden halls and jade chambers of Yaochi?\"\n\nYet the world clings to the fiery household—only fools refuse to leave.\nDay and night, they drown in worldly toil; dawn and dusk, they are shackled by passions and desires.\nThey fret over the hardships of wives and children, the pressing pangs of hunger and cold;\nthus their bodies and minds are thrown into turmoil, driven and harried by vexations.\nFoolish indeed! They harbor triple intentions, devise a hundred schemes.\nThey harm others with venom like serpents and lizards, wound kin with cunning like mosquitoes and dragonflies.\nPoverty and lowliness stem from causes sown in past lives;\nwealth and honor are not the blessings and wisdom of this present existence.\n\nNow, countless heroes vainly bear their names.\nThey employ cunning, flaunt their cleverness, and indulge in arrogance and extravagance, parading their prowess.\nThey think not of the life to come, nor heed the path ahead.\nSeizing profit and contending for fame, they willingly become seeds of the Three Wretched Realms;\ndeceiving heaven and obscuring earth, they gladly join the multitudes of the Six Paths.\n\nIt is said: they yield to confusion, seeking no health or wholeness.\nTheir schemes are laced with a thousand poisons; they harbor not a thread of desire for the Way of goodness.\nUtterly devoid of awakening, they are truly the most witless of creatures;\nmost pitiable, they are all destined for hell.\nBy and large, envy and obstinacy—who can willingly let them go?\nThey flaunt wind and sell rain, scraping and scrounging for money and goods;\nthey grasp at clouds and drown in mist, buying and selling fields and deeds.\nThey cheat neighbors, harm the orphaned and widowed.\nEver harboring perverse and deviant hearts, they mock and slight the worthy and sagely;\ndisbelieving in the retribution of good and ill fortune, they treat parents with contempt.\n\nThus they delight only in seeking wealth, never in avoiding sin.\nThey chant Buddha’s name and recite sutras, feigning goodness with their mouths;\nthey carve stakes and stab coffins, yet seldom mend their hearts.\nTheir frivolous and superficial understanding remains unremoved; their flattery and deceit, their schemes and snares, persist.\nLike beasts caught in nets, they plunge into the pit of delusion;\nlike fish in turbid waters, they drift and sink in the bitter sea.\nOnce the vessel of karma is full, King Yama swiftly summons them.\nBeaten with iron rods and bronze hammers, they endure the slow torment of knife mountains and sword trees.\nForever prisoners of the netherworld, they wail in misery day after day;\neternal ghosts of the dark mountains, they cry out in sorrow night after night.\n\nAlas! Since such terror awaits, one ought to awaken early.\nBreak open the shackles of love and attachment, leap onto the clouded paths of mist and rosy clouds.\n\"Return! Within the gourd, spring runs deep—go and meet in the Peach Blossom Land.\"\n\nYet people say the world has long been corrupt, and many speak of mysteries.\n\nWhen they discourse on the great elixir of golden cinnabar, they speak of firing times and celestial cycles. Before those who cultivate the hidden and feathered, they recklessly expound on teachings; beside reclusive men of virtue, they wildly preach true principles. Fools!—they flaunt their shallow knowledge, parading their sophistry. Those who seek fame and profit—when have they ever been pure and upright? Those who crave wine and lust—how can they truly observe fasts and precepts? Their tongues are sharp as swords, their words sold for gain. They speak of lineages and patriarchs, yet those who listen seem mad at heart; they claim to dwell in the Dao or the Mysterious, but when questioned, they feign deafness. If they mock superiors and inferiors alike, scorning the wise and foolish, then in discussing prominent figures, they twist facts to fit their meter, and in casual conversation, they lace their speech with archaic particles. Having never truly studied the Dao, they merely aim to fill their mouths. Dividing the subtle mysteries of the Three Vehicles, they confuse the vulgar; displaying the antics of ninefold madness, they prove themselves mere fools.\n\nYou claim the Supreme Simplicity and the Great Beginning, the utmost hardness and vastness—yet these lie not within the Void, but first emerge beyond the boundless dark. Hard to express in words, they manifest as the music of heaven. To expound on the wonders of heaven and earth, yin and yang, is already a daunting task; to parse the mechanisms of the turning heavens and creation’s workings is truly beyond grasp. Most know not strength from weakness, how then can they discern right from wrong? Compose a single lyric, and they flaunt it before others; pen a pair of quatrains, and they boast beyond the world. Little do they know that praise given to their faces brings only sorrow when heard anew. Those who pore over ten thousand volumes may yet fail to transcend life and death; the enlightened who grasp the essence of the One Truth soar beyond mist and rosy clouds.\n\nThus we know that relying solely on perception and hearsay leads not to truth. They abandon Yanzi’s joy in a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, instead practicing Yang Zhu’s arts of rouge and powder. With glib tongues, they sway the crowd—yet in the Dao, they are not one. Shameless and unprincipled, their conduct limps like a crippled turtle; swayed by joy and wrath, their arguments dart like a flying dragon. Know this: their words may be heard for a moment, but should not be endured long. To befriend them brings no benefit; to study their principles yields only empty rhetoric. They speak of thousands of things, yet the Dao is not in them even halfway. Everywhere they go, they debate right and wrong. Their actions defy reason, and in every place, they vie for prominence. Unaware of the sovereign heart, how can they possess compassion? Fearless and unafraid, when they speak, they compare my length to your shortness; when they argue, they care not for falsehoods or taboos.\n\nAlas, alas! They know not what those who speak of the Dao truly seek—only to cultivate their qi.\n\n**The Daoist’s Leisurely Wanderings**\n\nA man of great aspiration should set his heart on the True. Since the Dao is his foundation, let him wander the world with a carefree spirit. How grand is the mechanism of the Mysterious! It requires a lofty scholar to grasp it. Observe the carefree wanderer—he moves unseen among the dust of the world. Only by shedding the cage of the mundane can one find joy in the Dao. Some wash their ears and discard their gourds, laughing at the folly of Xu You of old; some ride donkeys through the world, surpassing the carefree Master Guo. They do not seek cloud-wandering for its own sake, but rather to gather the magic herbs. Forsaking fame and profit, they do not merely delight in poverty; cutting ties with love and kin, they diligently cultivate the Heavenly Treasure.\n\nIf one can withdraw from the world, one should refine the body. Some, sated with classical learning, harbor minds like merchants; others, rich in virtue and conduct, shine inwardly like stars. With such resolve, what harm does wandering do to the spirit? Pitiable are the refined gentlemen who, though they embrace the Mysterious Teachings, remain like recluses in the wilderness, striding freely through the fields. They wander green mountains at dusk, roam beside emerald waters, viewing wealth and honor as floating clouds, casting off glory like worn-out shoes. How noble are the worthy who do this—truly, the Daoist can achieve it. Free from glory and disgrace, they remain serene in poverty; whether still or moving, they soar like solitary cranes. In autumn and winter, gazing across the wilds, they observe the rise and fall of all beings; in spring and summer, they wander in delight, admiring the vibrant hues of a hundred flowers. What wealth could compare to the joy of leisure?\n\nThus the Perfected Ones of utmost virtue and emptiness ride the winds beyond the world; the enlightened scholars of pure yang wander the mortal realm like merchants. Some wear tattered robes of coarse cloth, donning straw raincoats and bamboo hats; some dwell in forests and springs to conceal their aspirations, or roam marketplaces to forget their habits. What others cannot discern, the Daoist in leisure fully attains. Having cultivated the resolve of the True Person, they dwell in peace. They ascend beyond the realm of the Jade Emperor, gathering in serene assembly. Their merits and deeds complete, body and mind no longer wander. They obtain the joy of the elixir from the Mysterious Crucible, joining the immortal companions of Penglai. Delighted to shed their mortal shells and ascend, they swiftly depart the dusty world; fortunate to ride the phoenix’s wings and return, they forever roam the Isles of Yingzhou.\n\nYet how varied are people’s natures, how fickle the world’s warmth and cold! Those who stretch out their hands in the streets are called lazy and indolent; those who beg for alms are criticized for their faults. For the most part, they forget both worldly concerns and let right and wrong be. Alas, alas! Who understands that the Daoist’s wanderings are like angling for golden carp—not merely idle leisure?\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the Dongyuan Collection*\n*Scroll Five of the Dongyuan Collection*\n\n**Two Lyrics to the Tune \"Tossing the Ball\"**\n*Composed by Changquanzi of Guishan*\n\n**I.**\nThe Daoist’s heart-seal awakens—\nnaturally clear and free.\nThis wondrous work of the Mysterious Pass,\nthe divine power of Creation,\nno brush of past or present could ever paint.\nBehold the everlasting spring within the gourd,\nwhere brocade rivers and mountains vie in splendor.\nEverywhere, towers of blossoms rise,\nfragrant breezes exhale,\nand lofty peach trellises soar.\nRoaming the Purple Tenuity’s crimson palaces,\nthe Jasper Pool’s jade gardens—\nhow could one envy the world’s\ngardens and wilds?\nStrolling the Phoenix Terrace,\nlistening to the pure, refined strains of *Xiao Shao*,\nits melody so elegant.\nFreely roaming in and out,\nunbound by spirit or void,\nriding jade whips and golden steeds.\nSuddenly standing alone in heaven and earth,\ngazing at the ten thousand forms\narrayed beneath the azure vault.\nIn the Hall of Five Lights,\nthe Assembly of the Mysterious Pearl,\nthe wondrous body sways like mist and maidenhair.\nFermented from magic mushrooms—\nwho would pay a thousand gold for its worth?\nOnly those who meet a true master,\ntheir numinous passage opened,\never respond without deceit.\nReveling in the sages’ profound truths,\npassing days in humility and kindness,\nwith six senses cleansed,\ngoverning by non-action’s transforming breeze.\nThe osmanthus branch of the nature-moon blooms,\nradiating ten thousand rays of light, unwaning.\nGuard the celestial mechanism’s secret,\nnever let it slip away.\nUnfold the root’s subtle Dao—\nhow many deeply know it?\nSince the Great Simplicity first divided,\nsplitting the primal chaos,\nFu Xi, the August Sovereign, drew the eight trigrams.\nDiscerning the hundred herbs,\nShennong’s merit shone;\nsowing the five grains,\nhis virtue spread through Hua and Yi.\nThereafter, the era of the Yellow Emperor dawned,\nhis sagely teachings proclaimed,\nand auspicious mushrooms sprouted in every land.\nFar-flung frontiers rested in peace,\nall nations under heaven at ease.\nThen, wandering in search of the Dao,\nhe sought seventy masters in succession.\nFrom this, the pure wind spread,\nand in later ages, immortals emerged in the world’s turning.\nYet today, failing to awaken,\nthe masses remain deluded,\ntheir legs racing after profit and fame.\nOnly I cast off all fetters,\ncarefree and untrammeled,\nroaming south and north, east and west.\nWithin the gourd’s scene,\nthe true message—\nthe three fires refining Kan and Li.\nIn the profound and indistinct,\nwho believes in the flight of the Pure Yang dragon?\nTurning the jade gate and golden pass,\nauspicious mists and propitious vapors\nveil the Purple Tenuity.\nHearing the snow-melody of the stringless lute,\nthe immortal’s music so fair,\nwitnessing sun and moon conjoined,\nforging the elixir’s measure.\nWhen the Great Elixir’s work is complete,\nbrushing my sleeves, I depart,\nreturning to the path of eternal life.\nDwelling in the celestial palace’s joy,\nthe Jasper Pool of Wuling.\n\n**II.**\n*To the Tune \"Heavenly Fragrance: Plum Blossoms\"*\nAll trees return to their roots,\nyet through three winters, it stands aloof—\nat dawn, the plum’s buds gently unfurl.\nJealous of snow’s spirit,\nits purity outshines the flames of

floating life in the bitter sea,\nchanging heads and swapping shells—\nwhen will it ever end?\nHearing of ancient and modern times,\nthose chasing fame and profit—\nmere fox dens and rabbit tracks.\nThe Six Dynasties and Five Hegemons\nall yielded to the heroes of water and clouds.\nOnly the truly pure make steadfast companions,\nnurturing the vast and bright,\nthe cold integrity of the

pearl,\nyet who glances at them in passing?\nLonging to send word to an old friend,\nbut couriers are rare—\nonly facing their subtle scent, forlorn and mournful.\nWhere now is the Princess of Shouyang?\nThis Jade Maiden of Guye is pure beyond compare.\nTo whom can one speak\nof the pale moon at dusk by the small window?\n\n**A Hundred Years of Light**\n\nA hundred years of light—\nlike whirling winds, fleeting breath,\nthunder’s lightning flash,\nthe swift return of sunlight’s gaze.\nThe fleeting scene cannot be stayed,\nand unawares, the temples turn to snow.\nWhen will the thousand green entanglements end?\nFrom dusk to dawn, the heart’s inch knots in sorrow twist.\nI urge the heroic:\nlet not the cauldron shatter,\nfor once the rope is snapped, it cannot be rejoined.\n\n**One Misstep, Ten Thousand Kalpas Lost**\n\nOne misstep, and the human form is lost for ten thousand kalpas.\nAlas for the clever and astute,\nwho never knew the prison’s chains.\nLonging to scale the mountain of grace,\nto cast aside jade pendants and golden willows—\nwho would dare to hurl them away?\nWhen the great limit arrives at the gate,\nand in an instant, one

The Wild Hall’s Aging Blossoms**\n\nThe wild hall’s blossoms age,\nbeyond the balustrade, their subtle fragrance drifts.\nDeep green shadows, deep and still, reflect the window.\nLet the sun turn toward the western suburbs—\nfor now, idly watch the clouds rise over southern shores.\nSee the distant peaks, faint and blue, meet the sky,\nwhere stone teeth part the spring,\nand pearls scatter like flying rain.\nThe cinnabar mound is but a footstep away—\nhow many turn their gaze?\n\nThe burrowing mole’s tunnels are not worth counting.\nThough one might wander the ornate paths forever,\nhow could it compare to exploring the misty peaks?\nTo pillow one’s head on the clouds and rosy glow of a thousand valleys,\ndelighting in this life—\nthen even the red dust’s touch\ncould not stain the black and white.\n\n**II. Weary of Wandering, Retreating a Footstep**\n\nWeary of wandering, I retreat a footstep,\nto the rustic harbor of Luli’s simple ways.\nMy vast qi soars into the empty sky—\nto whom can it be told?\nDrunk, I toast spring’s brew with three cups,\ndispelling quiet longing with a single leaf’s vast expanse.\nIn wild robes, I wander carefree through the forest groves,\npulling trusted friends along\nto share the bamboo’s wind, the flowers, the moon.\nMy life is pure and still—\nthe subtlest wonders are beyond all questioning.\n\nI scorn the array of embroidered carriages and brocade curtains.\nDelighting in the fields and reeds,\nI whistle and roam my hoary crown,\nplanting pines and chrysanthemums,\ndwelling in pristine integrity.\nThis single taste of true reverence—\nhow many know it?\nThere is the quiet desk, the rush mat,\nthe incense burner’s sinking embers.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Water Dragon**\n\nWhere is my homeland for resting?\nThe sea’s mountains gather mist, the spring wind soft.\n\n**The Flowers Bloom in Lush Profusion**\n\nFlowers bloom in lush profusion, stones glisten with moisture,\nclouds flirt in delicate grace, mist hovers in pale wisps—\nthe very face of heaven flows like water.\nThe fragrance of sacred mushrooms and cassia drifts apart,\nthe wine of tangerines and oranges gleams rich,\nbrocade mats ensnare the verdant hues.\nWith rainbow skirts trailing in ethereal sway,\njade-feathered canopies take flight—\nat the Jasper Pool’s feast,\nthey revel in beauty’s splendor.\nYet gazing down, they laugh at the world’s wealth and rank.\nIn the end—\nall is but a hollow pretense.\nFields of mulberry darken and shift,\nhuman life ages in vain—\nwho can truly find contentment?\nTigers war and dragons clash,\nHan rises and Qin falls—\nwhat profit remains today?\nBehold Penglai’s purple courts,\nthe ever-springing scenes of paradise—\nperfection beyond all compare.\n\n---\n\n**Rain on Flowers**\n\nSwift, swift—time’s voice,\nlike an arrow loosed in darkness, hurries all away.\nPeople, smoke, and grass blur into vast obscurity.\nThe frontier geese lament autumn’s late chill,\nwithered leaves drift in yellowed descent.\nTen thousand miles of passes and mountains lie desolate,\na single sky of wind and rain chills the bones.\nThis life of quiet ease—\nto whom can I confide it,\nto bare my inmost heart?\nFrost’s cold, dew’s clarity,\nchrysanthemums grow gaunt, plane trees wither—\nonce more, the Double Ninth draws near.\nI trust in the light within the gourd,\nthe homeland of clouds and waters.\nGolden halls and jade towers, courtyards,\nbrooks lined with flowers, pools and gardens—\nall the world’s illusions,\nhollow fame and fleeting gain,\nare but shadows tied to the yellow root.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on the Hundred Treasures**\n\n**I.**\nPomegranate blossoms burst in rich fragrance,\ncurtains half-drawn—\nhow long the idle hours of a clear day.\nThe courtyard lies unstirred by dust,\na light rain passes over the pond.\nFrom the secluded pavilion, the breeze\nstirs the bamboo’s song,\nwhile stone pillows and rattan couches await.\nAll else fades—\nwatching cloud peaks rise and fall,\nlost in lofty slumber, carefree,\nI have reached the age of Fuxi.\nEnough, enough—\nthe world’s dust is wholly forgotten.\nIn true constancy’s wondrous work,\nI arrange yellowed scrolls and incense.\nNo need to envy the vulgar throng,\nlike ants drawn to the scent of fat.\nIn purity and plainness, I find joy in poverty,\nthough scorching heat may never breach the hall of Daoist wisdom.\nTo settle the heart is to glimpse the plain and simple family way—\nwithin the grotto lies another realm of immortals.\n\n**II.**\nA single spark of spirit-light,\nspinning through ten thousand kalpas,\nendlessly cycling through womb, egg, moisture, and transformation.\nThe bitter sea knows no shore—\nwhen will birth and death ever cease?\nThe four great elements of the primal root are not enduring—\nwhy cling so stubbornly to this bodily form?\nGrind away the floating dreams of the world,\nwield the sword of wisdom to sever the roots of karma.\nA life of carefree ease beyond the dust,\ncontent with fate, knowing destiny,\nI idle in the company of wind and moon.\nEmbracing and guarding the primal yang,\nspirit and qi naturally merge.\nHeaven and earth invert, Kan and Li reverse—\nthis natural harmony of completion is no forced contrivance.\nSpring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest—\nall things share a single qi, no division between.\n\n---\n\n**Oriole Weaving Through Willows**\n\nSilent accord in the carriage’s ride.\n\nLeave behind weariness and worldly toil,\nreturn to thatched huts and native soil.\nLet others vie with martial might—\ntiger-stratagems and bear-tactics,\nbanners rising in fierce contest.\nWhat use such valorous display?\nOnly to win a face grown prematurely frail.\nA turn of the hand, and all is emptiness—\nfleeting splendor vanishes like dust.\nHow much better to delight in simple joys:\nblossoms in the imperial gardens,\nfish gliding through spring waters,\ncheeks flushed with crimson beauty.\nLet cares dissolve in revelry,\namid the songs and flutes of Green Gate.\nDrunk, lie down in the east wind’s embrace,\nwatch golden willows sway along the dyke.\nCast off the trappings of office,\nlet wild greenery spread in disarray.\n\n*Celestial Fragrance, Two Poems*\n\nSwift as a shadow’s passage, years slip by—\nworldly affairs no more than dust or hair.\nHow few perceive this truth and cease their striving?\n\"Return!\" I say—\nplow the clouds, fish the streams,\nfind tranquil ease beneath the pines.\nWithin the emerald hills’ embrace,\nanother realm of carefree delight.\nA single song of mystery, borne on celestial fragrance—\nah, how fleeting glory’s bloom!\nA half-cottage of white thatch suffices.\nHeart at ease, I chant and drink through all four seasons.\nReflecting on this human life,\nwhat use, in the end, all striving?\nWatching the rise and fall of empty flowers,\nthis perfect harmony’s message outshines all beauty.\nGreat simplicity, pure customs,\nthe wondrous principle of emptiness and clarity.\n\n*On Cultivating the True*\n\nTo speak of cultivating the true:\nthe mysterious pass points straight within—\nall external adornments cast aside from the heart.\nIn stillness, sit cross-legged,\npreserve the spirit, grasp the firm,\nlet go of judgments of right and wrong, high and low.\nLive by fate’s unfolding,\ncontent with warmth and fullness—\nall else forgotten, erased.\nThis pure leisure holds boundless worth,\nyet to the foolish, it cannot be told.\n\nHere lies the wondrous secret of utmost sincerity—\nalas, how few learners ever pause to rest.\nIn silence, in dimness,\njade blossoms bloom fully within the alchemical flask.\nIn the midst of vagueness, forms appear—\nbehold! A luminous pearl\nshines bright as the radiant moon.\nWhen this is realized,\none roams the sacred realms.\n\n*Four Poems of Erlang Shen*\n\nI sigh for this fleeting life,\nday and night in ceaseless toil.\nHow long can a lifetime’s fleeting splendor last?\nLike a cloud’s question, like lightning’s turning palm.\nWhen will the dream’s encroaching illusions awaken?\nEntangled in the fiery court, bound in karmic nets.\nThis human form, once lost,\nmeets not again in ten thousand kalpas—\nwho can turn back?\n\nAwake!\nLeap boldly from the waves of delusion’s sea.\nThe other shore’s scenery is true bliss,\ncompanioned by lone clouds and wild cranes, drifting free.\nThe spirit’s terrace, fully realized, knows no obstruction—\nlike the moon hung in the vast, clear sky.\nFilling the ten directions, the three realms,\ncrystal-bright, perfectly luminous,\none chants in carefree song.\n\nAgain—\nthis life’s joys:\nten thousand acres of clouded mountains, wild scenes.\nBamboo groves, plum villages, a thatched hut’s quiet—\nthis secluded ease the world cannot surpass.\nA stringless melody resounds through the cosmos,\nfacing the sinking incense, the stone stove’s silent listening.\nBeneath the forest’s shade, I linger,\nnurturing indolence,\ncultivating the nature of mist and rosy clouds.\n\nReturning to the mandate,\ndonning coarse hemp, I penetrate the ancient sages’ mystery.\n\nBehold egrets standing, gulls flying o’er sandy shores,\nlaughing at drunken parrots, adrift like jars in midstream.\nA pillow’s *Huaxu* spring dream awakens—\nhow could one envy the ranks of marquises and tripods?\nSoon turning back, returning home,\nmoonlight gilds the pine creek,\nclouds tread the mossy path.\n\nAgain—\nleaving the dust of the vulgar,\nI take stock of the refined joys of groves and springs.\nBamboo staff, straw sandals, green bamboo hat,\ndrifting on misty waves with a supple oar.\nOn moonlit nights, the river and sky’s boundless bliss—\nplaying a short flute, dreaming of *Xiaoxiang*’s isles.\nThis message,\npriceless, unbartered,\nbest shared with fisher and woodcutter.\nGo home.\nFacing evening’s emerald hues, wind rising on the little cove,\nI see through *Nanhua*’s tortoise dragging its tail—\nlet the robed and hatted jackals and tigers have their way.\nWho else like me adds wild water to their cup,\ndrunk beyond the depths of white clouds?\nLet autumn moons and spring blossoms,\nsilently transform mulberry fields,\nbrightly hasten past and present.\n\nAgain—\npouring out my heart,\nfor the great earth, tears shed for all beings.\nDawn to dusk, tormented by greed for livelihood—\nall entangled in the snares of wives and sons.\nScheming ten thousand ruses to chase wealth and rank,\nheedless of the plow’s high yoke.\nI urge the deluded to awaken early,\nlest later lives’ causes and conditions\nbe truly written in vain.\nSecluded and refined,\npurchasing the wondrous and profound—\nno coin required.\nOnly keep the lamp of the heart ever unclouded,\nthat all dharmas’ numinous connections may be subdued.\nAwaiting the day when the elixir is complete and the journey home fulfilled,\nshedding this fourfold illusory mortal frame.\nToward the Peach Blossom Land’s immortal gathering,\njade halls and golden towers,\neternal spring, never night.\n\nAscending the Azure Empyrean—\nAlas, this human life,\nfleeting as lightning, like floating foam.\nWhy trouble oneself with endless craving?\nGlory and decay, gain and loss—\nall fated by past causes, what need for sorrow?\nNow awakened, I nurture Heaven’s harmony,\ndwelling in secluded hills and mounds.\nA basket of food, a gourd of drink,\nthe savor of zither and books—\npassing days in leisure, resting in stillness.\nSerene and expansive, true joy reciprocates.\nFlower mornings, moonlit nights,\nmouths agape, brows unfurled in laughter.\nThe Mystic Pearl gathered, silently I return,\nroaming beyond the mundane.\nMoon over the Sea of Crabapples—\nTimely, the cosmos enacts compassion,\nferrying the suffering sea with a skiff of expedient means.\nThe Dharma realm reveals its majestic light,\npreaching to demon hosts—\nthey hide and flee in disarray.\nTrue immortals manifest,\npossessing wondrous divine arts.\nHeaven entrusts me to open the immortal sanctuary,\nto broadly expound the great Dao’s mystery,\nletting the wind carry its vast proclamation.\nBait fills the *sahā* world,\nhooking golden turtles,\nroaming the Jade Capital for sport.\nAt the jade-and-jewel feast,\nI look down and whistle at the world’s ant-like battles.\n\nA Sprig of Spring—\nAlas for the fleshly puppets,\nstrangely contending in the dusty world.\nDay and night, scorched in the fire of the household,\nburied in flowers and wine,\nkarma’s weight never amended.\nWhen will the bone-trading cease?\nHeads and faces tumbling,\nthe true sovereign of the spirit’s source obscured.\nOnly I now delight in freedom,\nroaming at ease through the vast sea of the world.\nCarefree between heaven and earth,\nlaughing with open heart.\nA taste of pure leisure—\nten thousand taels of gold could not buy it.\nWith ninefold mastery complete,\ntreading the moon, engraving the clouds,\nI steadily ascend the golden lotus immortal assembly.\n\nDrunk, Returning—\nSwift as a shadow’s passage, time presses.\n\nThe human body is but a wind-blown candle.\nWho believes in the unseen divine,\nsecretly repaying mortals with weal or woe?\nBehold the two luminaries like turning wheels—\nday and night, honor and disgrace tumble in flux.\nThe multitude suffers,\nbuzzing and swarming,\nlost in craving and desire.\nOnly I turn my head,\nreturning to seclude in mountain valleys.\nFishing in waters, plowing clouds,\nelegantly planting a few pines and chrysanthemums.\nAt leisure, I sing a tune,\nenvying not the crimson and green of power’s gates.\nCultivating simplicity,\npoor yet carefree,\nmy lifelong wish fulfilled.\n\nTwo Cups Tilted—\n\nGazing back from beyond the world,\nthe River of Love surges,\nvainly toiling—yet for what cause?\nClinging to wife and children,\ncompeting for fame and profit,\nthought after thought following them,\nobscuring true thusness.\nSky-toppling wealth,\ncity-toppling beauty—\nwhere do they all lead?\nAlas for life’s twilight,\nall ultimately reduced to emptiness.\nMourning the right and wrong of past and present.\nA hundred years of joyous feasts—\nhow much in truth?\nDreaming of Southern Branch,\nfate bound to Northern Prefecture,\nstill grasping greedily,\nnot seeking the path of return.\nTrading bones in the wheel of rebirth,\nbody companioned by foxes and wolves.\nHow many times laid waste?\nOnly to reap the ebb and flow,\nthe bitter torrent of desire.\n\nAgain—\n\nEnough, enough—I awaken,\nforsaking the vulgar world.\n\nAmidst the depths of Dongting’s search,\nhow fine the steps I tread.\nThe Great Elixir forged to perfection,\nthe precious pearl secured,\nmelodies played on stringless zithers—\ntheir notes surpassing palace and court modes.\nVastly I propagate the Dao and virtue,\nmy bearing in the mold of Zhong and Lü,\nof Xu You and Chao Fu.\nToward the carefree other shore I turn,\nseeking that minstrel of water and cloud.\nWho can succeed the sagely lineage?\nWisdom veiled as folly,\nthe six passions extinguished,\nthe nine mysteries penetrated in enlightenment.\nSubtle essence, pure emptiness,\nradiant and numinous clarity—\neach and every thing,\nwithout doubt, without care.\nA single truth, lustrous and transparent,\nmeritorious deeds fulfilled,\ninstantly transcending the dusty realm.\nThen I return, at ease and untrammeled,\nbeyond the world, all resolved.\n\nPhoenix towers and paulownia groves—\nescaping summer’s heat, I recline on a rope-strung couch to soothe my mood.\nEmerald shadows dense and deep,\nbeneath the flowers’ shade in several places.\nBy the pond of daylilies, none inquire of me.\nGreen lotuses stealthily catch the fragrant breeze’s message.\nToo weary to wield the frost-tipped fan, I begrudge my strength’s exhaustion.\nPlunging plums in goblets, chilled ice near,\nI demand fine tea and limpid spring water.\nBare-chested, my breast unbound from gloom,\nonce the tally is cast, I possess the share of immortals.\n\n**Two Poems on the Immortals’ Gathering**\n\nPity the people of this world—\neach one hastens to become a seal of office.\n\nThose who refuse to turn back,\nclinging to the fiery pit unto death.\nEnduring a thousand hardships and ten thousand sufferings,\nthey sigh, willingly bearing all.\nThey scheme for their households,\nworry for their wives and sons,\nfearing they cannot manage.\nOnce their karma is fulfilled,\nsee how they, like hares, will flee.\nWhen their eyes fall to the ground,\ntheir faces transform entirely.\nDonning fur and horns,\nthey lament, unable to explain in time.\nAct swiftly,\nstep out of the maze,\nand await the immortals’ selection.\n\nAgain—\nYouth fleets like a loosed arrow,\nstealthily exchanging rosy cheeks for age.\nNow I see through it all,\nstartled as if from a dream.\nShedding the prison of the body,\nI trust in wild songs and absurdities.\nAll men speak,\nyet one careless slip,\nand they become fools.\nI laugh with mouth agape,\nfor worldly customs were ever confining.\nCarefree and unmoored,\nI wander mountains and rivers at will.\nTo the ends of the earth,\nI find companions in leisure.\nOn reflection,\nthese few things\nare the truest ease.\n\n**A Sprig of Plum Blossoms**\nThe body drifts like a white cloud, free to furl or unfurl.\nTo the shores of the sky and sea,\nunfettered and unbound.\nThe vastness of the Great Void is my dwelling,\nno envy for kings or nobles,\ntheir jade disks and carriages.\nIn leisure alone I find abundant joy.\nLet others fuss over livelihoods,\ntheir lives refined and tempered.\nWhen I return, what is the truth of it all?\nThe moon of the heart shines bright,\nits light piercing Penglai’s isles.\n\n**Two Willow Branches**\nSuddenly awakened to true emptiness, I cast off external attachments,\ndelighting in purity and leisure.\nThrough the four seasons, I stoke the inner fire and circulate the celestial cycle,\ncultivating fields of magic mushrooms.\nBefore the sacred altar and mysterious furnace, I partake in creation,\ndrinking from the spirit spring.\nIn the radiant halls of the sun, I dwell eternally,\nattaining the golden heavens.\n\nAgain—\nThe two luminaries rush like whirling marbles,\nracing across the heavens.\nThey drive men to toil like mountains,\nnever resting.\nLike cats enamored of flame, they cannot be dragged away,\nstubborn and foolish.\nSurveying the mortal world, all are thus—\nhow pitiful.\n\n**Treading the Clouds**\nFormless in appearance,\nwith the luminous mind as my hand.\nOn the shores of purity, I plant golden willows.\nCutting away demons and monsters, I ride a crane through the clouds,\nin the silence of the empty mountains, I whistle and roar.\nBeyond the kalpas, I soar,\nwalking the wondrous path.\nIn the boundless realm, I seek kindred spirits.\nAfter drinking, I am at ease, intoxicated by the true wind,\nthe universe vast and clear, utterly without obstruction.\n\n**Powdered Butterflies**\nI long to speak of heaven’s mysteries,\nbut alas, in this dusty world, no one believes.\nOnly because they lack the predestined affinity.\nEnamored of fleeting splendor,\ngreedy for the fiery pit,\ntheir qi and spirit are depleted.\nThey trade their bodies like goods,\nlosing the original seal of the heart-mind.\nOnce awakened and turning back,\nI delight in purity and leisure,\nno need to trouble the heart-mind.\nStrive to seek the wondrous mystery of the mysterious female.\nRefining pure yang,\nstartling the cosmos with a thunderous roar.\nWhen the time comes,\nI shall meet you in the assembly of Penglai.\n\n**Two Jiangshenzi Lyrics**\nWho in the world does not love fleeting glory?\nWealth and fame,\ntwo burdens on the shoulders.\nSeeing through them, I return,\nproudly spending my remaining years in the forest.\nTen thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds are my true companions,\naged apes and cranes,\nwaters and winds clear.\n\nLet the world’s riders gallop in the dust.\nI bar my wicker gate,\nsitting in oblivion.\nIn leisure alone,\nthe slanting sun lights my window.\nI ask—where are my kindred spirits?\nIn the vastness of the Milky Way,\ndistant mountains green.\n\nAgain—\nZhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream—how many awaken?\nPrinciples perfected and bright,\nmy remaining years resolved.\nI plan to age in fields and gardens,\nproudly tilling at the valley’s mouth.\nThe setting sun and western wind blow fallen leaves,\nclouds return to the peaks,\nrain clears.\nA few cries of evening cicadas in the tall willows.\nFaint mist stretches,\nwild springs pour forth.\nA thousand miles of passes and rivers,\nautumn colors fill the mountain city.\nIn this murky world, few have discerning eyes.\nWho remembers me,\nnurturing my distant years?\n\n**Green Jade Case**\nIn a flash, I grasp the path to long life,\nlevel and without coming or going.\nAll dharmas perfectly fused, transcending the six perfections.\nBeyond the kalpas of sound,\nhow many have ever arrived?\nThere is another realm of carefree wandering.\nWithin the realm of luminous clarity, no dawn or dusk.\nWho can recommend this pivotal phrase?\nWooden horses neigh in the wind,\nmud oxen in the void—\ncompassionate clouds spread wide,\nthe thunder of the Dharma roars high,\nsilently showering the heavens of Chan.\n\n**Two Hymns to the Sage’s Advent**\nSpring’s light is radiant,\nyellow orioles leave the valleys,\npurple swallows return to their nests.\nI see immortal peaches blooming, two or three branches,\nasking the emerald bamboo and fragrant thatch.\nZither and books by my high pillow,\nthe wicker gate tightly shut,\nallowing no one to knock.\nLet the pine pavilion bask in the sun for three poles,\nand the butterfly dream linger on the flower branches.\n\nThe Daoist’s secluded charm,\nthe flavor of leisure and ease,\nclouds and mist in the forest.\nAt night, I play the zither in reclusion among the green peaks,\nwatching the moon’s reflection in the cold spring.\nCarefree melodies sung,\nthe palace tunes of returning home,\nsnowy songs without strings.\nHave I gathered this mysterious pearl yet to ascend the origin?\nTo become an immortal dwelling in the world.\n\n**Longing for the Immortals**\nAwakening from drunkenness,\nawakening from dreams,\nthe moon soaks the pine window, the pillow cool as mushrooms.\nWhose house is that, pounding silk?\n\nVoicing true feeling,\ndelighting in true feeling,\nbeyond the bamboo, flowing springs gurgle over stones.\nCloud mountains layer like green screens.\n\n**Two Western Rivers Moons**\nThe heart-mind is like a bright mirror,\nno need to wipe it clean—\nit reflects all things as they are.\nThe Way of the immortals is not far,\nonly those who seek it find it.\nThe elixir field is full,\nthe golden cinnabar mature.\nThe great medicine is complete,\nthe golden crow and jade hare meet in the crucible.\n\nAgain—\nThe world’s affairs are like a play,\nall is empty and false.\nWealth and status are but floating clouds,\nvanishing in an instant.\nThe body is a guest house,\nthe heart-mind the master.\nIf the master is at ease,\nthe guest is content.\nThe Way of the immortals is not distant,\nonly those who cultivate it attain it.\nThe elixir field is full,\nthe golden cinnabar mature.\nThe great medicine is complete,\nthe golden crow and jade hare meet in the crucible.\n\n**Do Not Envy the Golden Chambers**\n\nDo not envy the golden chambers’ schemes,\nnor strive to climb the immortal cassia’s bough.\nOnce awakened, the heart-mirror needs no polish—\nin an instant, the floating illusions of self and things dissolve.\n\nTurn back to illumine the gourd-heaven’s sun and moon,\nspeak no more of the world’s winds and waves.\nDrag your slender jade staff through the boundless void,\nand return beyond the deep mist of brambles and vines.\n\n**Again—**\n\nThough form and things dwell within the world,\nthe dreaming soul ever roams Tai Zhou’s terraces.\nWith whom shall the mountain hall’s true delight be shared?\nBeyond the window, sparse plum and slender bamboo.\n\nMiles of mist and rosy clouds drift softly,\nhalf a curtain of wind and moon sighs cold.\nHeaven grants me this pure seclusion—\nhow could fleeting life ever match it?\n\n---\n\n**Two Songs of Heart’s Longing**\n\n**I**\nNight deepens, the world hushed, the water-clock’s drips fade,\nautumn’s hues fill the riverbank.\nCold mist stretches across the wild pond—\nwho could paint such a scene?\n\nThe wind whispers,\nthe moon arcs thin.\nSitting past midnight’s end,\nthe incense in the censer spent,\nthe Silver River’s stars sparse,\nthe butterfly dream takes flight once more.\n\n**II**\nStraw hat and bamboo staff befriend the Southern Flower,\nplowing and fishing age my livelihood.\nHow could I be tied yet go unfed?\nMy will is no gourd left hanging.\n\nForget the tapping of the ox’s horn,\nrecall the twisting of the homeward rope.\nProud among the fisherfolk,\non ten thousand acres of mist and waves,\nat the head of the Red Lea Shoals,\ndrunk, I lie among the reeds.\n\n---\n\n**Lesser Layered Mountains**\n\nSince ancient times, the lofty ones shun the city’s clamor,\ntranscendent, beyond the dust’s reach, hidden in forests and springs.\nI once heard the Sage’s parting words:\n*“The benevolent and wise—\nin the mountain and water’s cave, they dwell at ease.”*\n\nNo affairs vex the heart.\nApes and cranes become friends,\nthe elixir ripens.\nIn the depths of white clouds, joy in quiet seclusion—\nbeneath the bright moon,\na single tune of *Lesser Layered Mountains*.\n\n---\n\n**Four Songs of the Great Official’s Joy**\n\n**Spring**\n\n**Spring**\nStrolling verdant fields, wanderers delight—\nrivers and mountains gleam in spring’s warm tide.\nFrom the valley, tender orioles call,\nwillow floss scatters like drifting snow.\n\n**Summer**\nPomegranate blooms dip in fragrant sachets’ hue,\ngreen lotus leaves unfurl like canopies.\nTo escape the heat, I ascend the tower—heart clear,\nfrost-like ripples brush the vast moonlit sky.\n\n**Autumn**\nThe Double Ninth: a refined gathering on high.\nChrysanthemums just split beyond the bamboo fence.\nWho believes the chill of mist-laden waves?\nWind taps red leaves—frost-thinned woods grow spare.\n\n**Winter**\nSlanted sparse shadows, soft celestial fragrance,\nin jade chambers, night talks stir distant poetic souls.\nPour the crimson flush of wine again and again—\nlet the six-petaled flakes dance in the wind’s wild play.\n\n---\n\n**Four Songs of the Partridge Sky**\n\n**Spring**\nA rustic retreat, joy in idleness,\ninspired, I chant a *Partridge Sky*.\nPeach blossoms laugh in the sun, unfurling brocade,\ndoorside willows trail threads of emerald mist.\n\nLatch the flowered gate,\nsweep the moss-coins clean.\nWhen weary, on a meditation couch,\npillow books and sleep.\nIf someone asks what I cultivate—\na dream ferried by the moon, a boat of *Huaxu*.\n\n**Summer**\nIdle birds flaunt their tongues toward the lush grove,\nbathing in steam, hair unbound beneath pine shade.\nA cool breeze stirs, bearing the chill of ice-mushrooms—\nI chant my true feelings in carefree verse.\n\nSky like water,\nwillows like gold.\nFire-clouds stack in jade from distant peaks.\nPerched on a high tower, the noble scion’s ease,\nin quiet chambers, the recluse’s heart forgets all schemes.\n\n**Autumn**\nSuddenly, the west wind stirs my kudzu robe,\nrustling autumn hues blanket all lands.\nWhen buckwheat blooms in ordered rows,\nwhen phoenix leaves fall, marked and tallied.\n\nCrows caw at dusk,\na traveler longs for home.\nAcross the fields, millet stands thick.\nCicadas, cease your cries from the high branches—\nlest the wild geese frown in weary flight.\n\n**Winter**\nOne night’s bitter freeze brings cruel cold,\ndawn reveals six-petaled flakes drifting down.\nCrimson clouds dusted with powder, moths in flight,\nwillow fluff follows the wind, butterflies to and fro.\n\nPlum shadows lean,\nbamboo bends low.\nA mound of lake-jade leans on the railing.\nWho will lend me their painter’s skill,\nto capture this scene for the *Huangshan* scroll?\n\n**Narrow Hua Creek**\nNarrow Hua Creek,\nspring winds treat men as guests.\n*Men as guests—*\nadrift north and south, when will rest come?\nBetter to follow the Four Old Men of Shang Mountain,\nwhere stone towers and cloud halls dissolve worldly dust.\n\nOn Danqiu’s leisure,\na thousand-foot pine stands guard.\n\n**Flower’s Heart Moved**\nBeyond kalpas, the primal sound—\nI sigh at this toiling life, so vast, so blind.\nPiercing the wheel of rebirth, shattering empty space,\nI play freely through the six gates, unattached.\n\nAlone in an orchid canopy, the couch secure,\nI watch the iron tree bloom in season.\nWisdom’s light blazes—\nin the Great Brightness Hall,\njade dragons coil upon the tiles.\n\nA single mystic pearl leaps forth,\nadvancing in radiant splendor,\nten thousand spirits tremble with joy.\nReleased and reclaimed, through reversal and flow,\nthe snow-curve suddenly unlocks the plain key.\n\nTrue feelings yearn for expression—yet to whom?\nI see womb and egg, dream and soul entwined.\nAt dawn’s vast expanse,\nI hear the painted horn on Phoenix Tower,\nthe moon’s immortal within.\n\nThrough kalpas pure and congealed,\nthe mirror gleams impartial, flawless—\nwho is fit to bear its mark?\nVoid and vast, boundless,\nit governs the ten thousand spirits’ transformations,\nwatching over all with boundless light.\nSerene, it enfolds the Great Dao,\nits essence unfathomable—fortune and ruin, darkly repaid.\nWho can reach its pristine azure?\nStill and silent, the nine suns,\nidle and still, the depths of mystery.\n\nThe Primordial Qi stands vast in the azure heavens,\nenveloping the three thousand great thousands,\nits divine workings the pivot of all.\nLofty and bright, distant and dim,\nit responds to the four seasons’ life and change,\ninverting the clear and void.\nWisdom’s wind sweeps beyond the empty sky—\nhow could the deluded masses ever comprehend?\nNow I have deeply penetrated it,\nreturning to savor the joy of carefree wandering.\n\n**Two Songs of Achievement**\n\n**First Song**\nIn a flash, dawn breaks—\nI see through this floating life,\na mere charade.\nThe road of gain spurs reckless galloping,\ntime flies swift,\nvainly stirring the passions of aging.\nI sing alone, I laugh alone,\npondering how few have ever reached\nthis fair scene:\nthe garden of home, spring’s hues,\ncrabapple half-open, green willows swaying light.\n\nLet go, let go—all things are done.\nListen, deep in the tangled mountains,\nthe cuckoo’s cry.\nReturn, ah return!\nOn Chang’an’s ancient road,\nfading glow of scattered clouds at dusk.\nDongting lies hushed—\nI sigh as the wind sweeps fallen blossoms\nbeyond my gate.\nSince parting, my old friend,\nthe phoenix’s song in the azure heavens fades away.\n\n**Second Song**\nAwakening to the floating world.\n\nAmid the tumult of ten thousand affairs,\nlet all be forgotten, cast aside.\nA staff of woodbine, a cloud-patterned kerchief,\na hempen belt, a paper-wadded robe—\nthese alone suffice as traveling gear.\nRoaming mountains, wandering waters,\nwherever I go, joy follows my will.\nIn carefree ease, delighting in the moment,\nfree and unbound—who could match such bliss?\n\nPeer at the world’s currents, observe its ways.\nSuch is the news, the very pattern of life.\nTrue joy lies in this alone—\nif you but grasp it,\nwhen man is still and the moon brightens a thousand miles.\nBefore my small study, a few stalks of cold herbs.\nWho knows me here,\nas dawn’s light spills over the western hills,\nhalf the casement steeped in fresh green?\n\n*End of Scroll Five of* The Cavern Abyss Collection",

The most wondrous rides the light, and thus is supreme. It flows and spreads before the Great Ultimate, yet abides firmly after the final extinction. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, pervading the four wilds. Following what has never begun, presiding over what has never taken form, the Obscure holds the pivot, the Signified bears the Other. Chaotic and boundless, solemn and radiant—it transforms and gives birth to the ten thousand things, responding to the yearning of drought and famine. Vast and towering, it cannot be named or imaged. Thus, those who attain it dare not adorn it with disputation; those who know it dare not treat it as trivial. They preserve it with integrity and caution, abide in it with serenity and joy, and when the time is right, it flourishes greatly. It pervades the whole as one body, its numinous transformations inexhaustible. Its spirit is unfathomable, yet its essence is utterly refined.\n\n**Section Two: The Pure and Unadorned**\nThe pure and unadorned abide in stillness. They treasure essence and preserve spirit, nurture *qi* in tranquility, and conceal their will in emptiness and vastness. Amidst the boundless expanse between Heaven and Earth, things cannot intrude. Whether leaning or rising, they do not lose their authenticity. They dwell in honor and prominence without delight, in poverty and lowliness without aversion. Water and fire, the four seasons—none can steal their truth. This is called possessing virtue and knowing what Heaven intends. Only then can one know the Great Mystery, the Great Order, the Great Purity, the Great Virtue, the Great Sustainer, the Great Conduct, the Great Uncarved, the Great Wisdom, the Great Tranquility, and the Great Penetration. This is perfection. The Great Mystery is trodden, the Great Order is examined, the Great Purity is inhabited, the Great Virtue is shepherded, the Great Sustainer is broadened, the Great Conduct is enacted, the Great Uncarved is completed, the Great Wisdom is deepened, the Great Tranquility is guarded, and the Great Penetration is esteemed. When these ten matters are thoroughly mastered, purity reaches its utmost. Thus, there is nothing that cannot be done, nothing that is not wondrous. Effaced and thoughtless, serene and non-active—this is its boundary.\n\n**Section Three: Attaining the Dao**\nAttaining the Dao is the accomplishment of Heaven, without limit or boundary. Vast and boundless, it fills the Six Voids, roaming beyond the Four Seas. Now observing, now leaning—like the shadowless tree of Yuzhang. Now circling, now wandering—like the garden of Three Blossoms and eternal life. Reclining at the gate of the Rare and the Utmost Unity, steadfast and at ease. In the vast chambers of the Dark Lord and Dongting, floating and settled, entering and exiting. Free and unfettered in the boundless wilds of the Great Square—its dwelling has no end. Such a person, such a principle—nothing can harm them. Wherever they go, they arrive; yet their end is unknown. Thus it is said: Though ants climb stalks, tiles and excrement, birds and beasts, grasses and trees—none are excluded. That which gives rise to things is itself no-thing. Yet the common people of the world, in their daily frenzy, know nothing of this.\n\n**Section Four: The Great Harmony**\nThe Great Harmony is most wondrous—profound and boundless, its Dao deep as the transformations of water. When its primal state stirs, even divination by tortoise and milfoil cannot foretell its omens. Vast and tranquil in heart, it darkly pervades the ten thousand directions. Undifferentiated yet manifest, it revolves without constancy. Flowing in favorable times, it ripples with self-contentment. Non-active, without near or far, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order. Deceit, artifice, and false emotions—restless and agitated—cannot measure its use.\n\n**Section Five: The Vast and Penetrating**\nThe vast and penetrating accord with the great sequence, spontaneously giving rise to the nature of the ten thousand things. At rest, it is like an empty valley; in motion, like a spring breeze. Its transformations cover all beings. Thus, its will is not reckless, its words have no limit or strangeness. It does not excel in Heaven’s work, nor is it clumsy in human affairs. Once it attains the center of the circle, it responds to the inexhaustible—whether left or right, it suffices.\n\n**Section Six: The Water Mirror**\nThe Water Mirror is bright and clear; its Dao is resplendent, like Heaven’s hanging images. Its responses are like an echo; its reflections, like a spirit. Impartial and without omission, it embraces and fuses with the ten thousand existences. Serene and without attachment, it is limpid, luminous, and adorned. It distinguishes beauty and ugliness, long and short, movement and stillness—all are evident to the ear. Now, the hand’s grasp, the foot’s swiftness, the eye’s clarity, the ear’s acuity, the body’s beauty, the faculties’ mastery, the completion of the many—none can be altered. Disaster strikes suddenly, day by day increasing, yet people treasure it as their own—is this not perilous? Thus it is said: Its return is swift in achievement; its fruition awaits duration. Therefore, the sage governs things and orders the world—his Dao resembles this. Drifting without attachment, how could there be a place for grasping? Forms manifest themselves; it moistens above and nourishes below. Illuminating one use without weariness, things naturally turn away. The Dao has never had boundaries.\n\n**Section Seven: Accordance with the Constant**\nAccordance with the Constant is without delusion. In action and repose, it is fitting and exhausts the Dao. Holding the left tally and proceeding, pure yet accommodating things, worldly entanglements do not disturb the heart. Cultivating thought and preserving truth, though immersed in the clamor of dust, the solitary remains untransformed, entering the vast Heaven. The empty—this is the abyss of the Dao; the still—this is the dwelling of spirit. Without beginning, it first arose in the Primordial Chaos. The Primordial Chaos was divided into Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth arrayed the four seasons; the four seasons mysteriously turned the Five Phases; the Five Phases nourished the ten thousand transformations; the ten thousand transformations returned to the Great Beginning; the Great Beginning wondrously united with the Primal Existence. The Primal Existence—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven—this is where the primal emerges, where it enters, where it is born, where it dies. The multitude does not see its form; things return to their nature, merging with the Primordial Obscurity. The sage conceals himself therein. The ancients—their knowledge reached this point.\n\n**Section Nine: The Obscure and Real**\nThe Obscure and Real wander spiritually, far and distant in the vastness of the Great Brightness.",

      "translated_text": "**Section Ten: The Daoist**\n\nViewed through the Dao, there is no distinction of far or near, vast or minute, pure or turbid, noble or base. In this constancy, the primal emerges as yang and withdraws to conceal itself. Act with assurance yet dare not presume, and the primal will naturally prevail. From the real attain the empty, standing in the unfathomable. Pure and utterly transparent, things have no barrier before it; entering the primal’s boundlessness, yet the primal seeks no cause.\n\nThe Dao is the father and mother of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual pivot of the ten thousand things, the guiding principle of yin and yang, the revolving hub of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, the encompassing thread of the worthy and sage, the true dwelling of spirit and illumination, the deep source of mountains and seas, the great handle of the altars of state, the root and stem of the nature and destiny of all that moves and grows. Most revered and most noble, endless through past and present, ever naturally so—how majestic and great it is!\n\nBy this, one offers ritual to all under Heaven: ghosts lose their numinosity, and the sage does not harm the people. Thus, things that attain it live; humans that attain it endure. Dwelling finds fulfillment, affairs find continuity, conduct finds its direction, joy finds its place. Reverent yet not elated, insulted yet not angered, its tone is free of bitterness, harmonizing with Heaven’s harmony as it should. It illumines what cannot be illumined, discerns what cannot be discerned—like the sea binding the rivers, it receives all with clarity yet declines nothing, vast to the utmost.\n\nTherefore, in stillness and silence, embody it; in profound clarity, oversee its abiding.\n\n**Section Eleven: The Music of Heaven**\n\nThe wondrous tones of Heavenly Music arise from the Beginningless, issuing from the Great Void. They are not of metal or stone, silk or bamboo, gourd or clay, reed or pipe; not of the grand *Da Wu* or the *Zheng Wu* dances, nor the *Zhe Yang* or *Huang E* melodies. The *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* cannot be played, the notes of the twelve pitches cannot be known. Thus, strike it with Supreme Harmony, tune it with the Great Clarity, rouse it with the Cavernous Mystery, move it with the Primal Act, strike it with the Primal String. Its sound and radiance are spontaneous, without beginning or end, without constancy or form. Resounding beyond the eight directions, ringing forth before the Emperor of Images—thus the Dao may be borne and journey with it.\n\nIts pure resonance fills the empty sky, and the sage’s work is born. The sun, moon, and stars scatter to follow their patterns; the ten thousand things follow their generation; the Five Powers respond in fullness—vast and unbounded, yet not self-satisfied. When the month of *Luobin* arrives, the River of Stars congeals, descending as white snow. On the night of Yellow Bell, grasses and trees burst into bloom, and the first stirrings of yang spring arise.\n\nWhen the sage performs this music, auspicious clouds gather, sweet springs well forth; when it ceases, the balmy breeze harmonizes, and the Jade Candle shines. Gazing, one cannot see it; striking, one cannot hear it; pondering, one cannot know it; pursuing, one cannot reach it. It spreads and unfurls without trailing, flowing and scattering, shifting and moving through the boundless. The sound without pause pervades the four voids, filling Heaven and Earth; ghosts and spirits withdraw into seclusion, vast and luminous. The transmission of the boundless gives rise to all things in profusion, winding and endless.\n\n**Section Twelve: The Workings of Mechanism**\n\nThe wondrous workings of mechanism move in response—like a divine vessel, it bows and rises, advances and retreats, gauging depth and shallowness, measuring what is fitting. Progress and withdrawal, lightness and weight—nothing misses its proper place. Its activation brings abundance, benefiting things with moisture, matching the timely rain, awakening principle, aligning with spirit and illumination—yet the people do not know it. Why is this so? Those who excel in penetrating the Dao are thus.",

      "translated_text": "**Section Thirteen: Unwrapping the Bundle**\n\nUnwrap the bundle, release the superfluous—vast and empty, it returns to its natural void. Dissolve right and wrong, cast off profit and harm, discard cunning and wit, temper bold resolve. Thus, in night’s sleep, no startling dread; in day’s waking, no resentful cleverness. Loss and sorrow do not churn within; pain, sickness, grief, and joy do not stray from the heart. Riches, rank, and reward bring no delight; punishments, threats, and prohibitions inspire no fear. Discard the branches, probe the root—such was the ancient perfected one, attuned to its harmony.\n\nLet limbs fall away, dull brilliance and keen hearing, feign the illness of health, know the unknowing. Flowing in undivided unity, embodying Heaven’s balance, roaming beyond the body’s fame and disgrace, at the origin of the ten thousand things—what is there to rejoice in? What is there not to rejoice in?\n\n---\n\n**Section Fourteen: The Pearl’s Recompense**\n\nThread the pearl through the abyss of goodness, purify the heart and discipline the form. Nurture spirit in profound silence, issuing forth true wisdom—possessing great beauty yet never speaking of it. Like the sun and moon’s self-luminance, penetrating and boundless, nothing is left behind.\n\nThe supreme Dao requires no cultivation; its virtue matches Heaven and Earth. Self-lofty, self-profound, yet the ten thousand things cannot depart from it, each fulfilling its principle. Sincere and expansive, serene and unobstructed, the six directions are mirrored clearly—no hidden depth remains unilluminated. Beginning in radiant numinosity, it attains and nearly abides.\n\n---\n\n**Section Fifteen: Wondrous Convergence**\n\nWondrous convergence—vast and obscure, emptiness congeals with spirit. Accumulate it, yet it is never enough; possess nothing, yet it overflows. Not grasped by ear or eye, not sought by heart or intellect. The further one traces it, the deeper it becomes; the closer one draws, the more distant it seems. Touch it, yet no shiver arises. Gaze ahead—it is not there; suddenly, it is not behind. Harmonious yet not leading, responding to things without form.\n\nThe ten thousand things cannot obstruct it; likes and dislikes, safety and peril find no lack. Neither advancing nor welcoming, neither speaking nor silent. The deluded stumble over a single thread; the sagely wise see all goodness as one source. Employed, it fills Heaven and Earth—no beginning or end is discerned. Set aside, one cannot tell where it enters—no trace or sign is glimpsed.\n\nStill and silent, the hundred clans use it daily yet never know. Alas! Clods of earth and heaps of dust rush about—how many in the world awaken to it? Ceaselessly turning, fortune and misfortune shift in secret. In the intervals of coming and going, affairs shatter illusions—those drunk in the house of trivial strife, how can they return?\n\n---\n\n**Section Sixteen: Abandoning Strength**\n\nAbandon strength, have no preferences—unaware even of why it is so. Encounter things without partiality—this is called great completion. Thus, sight is not dazzled by crimson and purple, brocade and embroidery; hearing is not ensnared by clanging bells or resonant pipes; scent is not stifled by pepper, orchid, orange, or pomelo; taste is not sated by fine meats, sweet wine, or rich fare; the body is not pampered by soft furs or thick curtains; thought is not disturbed by discriminating cares or anxious plans.\n\nExternally, not enslaved by fame, wealth, or rank; internally, not confused by defensive learning or clever schemes. Sweeping away all filth, entering the realm beyond comparison—thus it is. Thereafter, one embraces luminous wisdom, receives keen insight. Savoring the flavor of the flavorless, words issue forth like metal and stone in loyal integrity, girded in plainness and simplicity.\n\nCast off beyond the eight directions and six qi, wings spread in the whirlwind, spiraling through the numinous cavern—wondrously penetrating the void. Such knowledge has reached its limit—profound, lofty, nothing can surpass it.\n\n---\n\n**Section Seventeen: Heaven’s Concealment**\n\nHeaven’s concealment probes the hidden, high and empty, deep and remote—thus the world cannot discern it. Its Dao is subtle and commonplace; its virtue blankets all life. It does not cling to edges, veils its affairs, rising and falling without falsehood.\n\nDim and obscure, now worn, now broken—like an empty valley, it opposes things. No blame, no praise—none know it: this is called great wholeness.\n\n---\n\n**Section Eighteen: Grief and Joy**\n\nGrief and joy do not enter—this is the perfection of virtue. Taking nothing, giving nothing—this is the stability of nature. Banish thoughts and cares, forget form and intellect. Nurture simplicity, attain emptiness—its virtue is not solitary. Discerning the true from the false without being swayed by things, guarding its origin—thus it nearly abides.\n\n---\n\n**Section Nineteen: Dwelling in the Real**\n\nDwell in the real abode, breathe deeply in the boundless expanse—transcendent, without corners. Lofty, it has no covering; vast, it has no direction. The door and window are formless forms; the beams are useless timbers. Desiring the desireless in purity, grasping the ungraspable as the great net.\n\nPlay with the book of immortality, pivot the tune of non-being. At times, roam the radiant wilderness; at others, dwell in the carefree and unrefined. Sip the fine wine of the spirit flask, play the ancient harmonies. Unrestrained and free, in perfect accord with the Dao—could there be anything more?\n\nYet the common folk, crude and reckless, grind against one another, collide and compete, topple and do not return, rush like fire without looking back. The six senses plunder one another—no heavenly wandering for the heart. Alas!",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when a chamber is never empty, mother and daughter-in-law clash—righteousness reaches its limit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Sudden Extinction**\nSuddenly extinguish worldly attitudes, open the heavens and depart from men. An empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides in stillness. The great worthies who illuminate the Dao, the astute historians and eloquent debaters, the wise and skillful artisans—how could they glimpse this mechanism?\n\nNow vanishing, now submerged, silent and plainly passing. Not responding to calculations of affairs, standing at the root source, and penetrating the natural. Existence and annihilation, love and hate, favor and disgrace, right and wrong—how can these be alertly delighted or controlled? The nine orifices and hundred bones, each thing blending and merging, yet unaware of one’s own possession.\n\nForgetting time, forgetting place, forgetting past, forgetting present—profoundly empty, profoundly void—thus deeply entering the Great Mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The World**\nThe world has no rival; the Dao flows unimpeded, knowing its root. It unites the lineage of heaven and earth, exhausts the nature of the myriad things, and emits the light of heaven. Loftily treading the great square of the divine vessel, it transforms alone in the dark and obscure realm. It stirs the long waves of the ocean of virtue, purifies and penetrates the nine abysses. It fans the true wind beyond form, harmonizing the eight directions. Speech and knowledge reach far and vast; a glance or gesture reveals the subtle. Wisdom and virtue are bright and keen, illuminating mechanisms like a mirror.\n\nThus, the true sage knows people and knows heaven, sharing the same work as creation. Whether moving or still, marvelous functions are inexhaustible. Only then does one comprehend the transformations of life and death, roam freely in the great void, act appropriately with things, and bestow benefits upon the myriad ages without decline.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spiritual Encounter**\nSpiritually encountering and wandering, the origin has no passage. Not swift yet fast, not traveling yet arriving, not acting yet accomplishing—marvelously above the myriad things, simply being natural. From near to far, from self to others, without form or boundary, beyond the divisions of numbers, beyond the recitations of fine and coarse. Not to be discussed in words, not to be examined by intent.\n\nRiding the void without falling, touching the solid without obstruction. Drinking wind and sipping dew, vast and boundless without direction. Without fear or dread, without love or pride. Crossing mountains and valleys without alarm, piercing metal and stone as if nothing. Seeing without obstruction, clouds and mist do not veil its clarity. Hearing without confusion, thunder does not startle its acuity.\n\nWithout partiality or faction, without violating nature. The swirling dust of the world cannot disturb its smoothness. There is no generation or transformation—probing again and again. Opposing it yet not angered, following it yet not obeyed. Though pierced by bravery, no wound is seen; though struck by force, no pain is felt.\n\nBeyond form and number, thus able to overcome things without burden. Coming and going, a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—without end. In harmony with heaven and humanity, without sounds of sorrow. Yin and yang follow their measure, averting disasters of entanglement and distress. Sun and moon unite in brightness, without eclipses or alterations. Controlling and guiding the six qi to benefit all living beings. Nurturing in constant times, affairs free from demons and specters. Shamans dare not invoke spirits; the earth has no miasmic sand, no venomous stings.\n\nThus, though the sage resides in the ancestral temple, he takes the hearts of the common people as his own. For the world, he blends his heart, follows their nature, and harmonizes with their transformations. Harmoniously responding to the feelings of things—who would toil and sigh over such attachments? He laments that those who know the Dao are not easily met.\n\nNow, as if seen with one’s own eyes and preserved—words exchanged in passing, content and self-possessed, not seeking the profoundly distant, long attuned to the true wind, awakened from the great dream. How could it not be so?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Solitary Eminence**",

Sip the fine wine of the spirit flask, play the ancient harmonies. Unrestrained and free, in perfect accord with the Dao—could there be anything more?\n\nYet the common folk, crude and reckless, grind against one another, collide and compete, topple and do not return, rush like fire without looking back. The six senses plunder one another—no heavenly wandering for the heart. Alas!",

      "translated_text": "The common folk are deluded indeed, exhausting themselves in vain—merely following the fleeting moment.\n\n**Waxing and Waning (Chapter Thirty-Three)**\nWaxing and waning alternate, yin and yang push one another, forms shift and change. Yet those who penetrate to the Supreme Mystery know there is no absolute wholeness. Observe the realm of ears and eyes: wisdom, bearing, expression, and countenance—all are flawed. What is seen here is unseen there; what is known as existent is unknown in its origin. This single form is but a vessel borne by the great earth, a congregation of impurities, the five phases borrowing from one another, a fleeting harmony. The four seasons give rise and destroy in turn, coming and going without cease. From infancy to youth, from old age to feebleness—is there ever a moment of pause, a lack of transformation?\n\nAlas! The teeming masses rise and vanish in an instant, succeeding and failing in turn. Clinging to this, grasping at that, they rejoice day and night, taking it for reality. Bending and stretching, bowing and rising, inhaling and exhaling—deeming this the wondrous Dao, they see a pellet and crave roasted quail. How deeply deluded they are! Soon their skin decays, their hair withers, and they accomplish nothing—how can they not grieve?\n\nThus the perfected person outwardly harmonizes with all virtues, inwardly pares the mind to oneness. Viewing the hundred limbs and four limbs as dust and grime, they transcend the realm of common pursuits, roaming freely by heaven’s boundary without private bias. Self and other are wholly preserved.\n\n**Obscurity (Chapter Thirty-Four)**\nObscurity and tangled thoughts, petty thieves within—these are the losses of spirit. Moreover, people of this world, though their years may be in their prime, their conduct is solitary. They squander their affairs, pressing hard against the times, failing when success is near. Sorrows and troubles follow one after another, yet they remain unaware.\n\nThis is the path of the bound and broken. The ancients who excelled as scholars did not act thus: they forgot cares and followed things, acted naturally without constraint, cleansed their filth, and appeared dull as if daubed with mud. They perfected their virtue, embraced their leisure—this is called clarity of knowing and fullness of principle.\n\n**Life and Death (Chapter Thirty-Five)**\nLife and death are the ultimate principles, the greatest affairs of the people—none surpass them. Yet those who covet life and lose virtue, those who invert values and debase customs, roam and play in all directions, ensnared by passions and desires. Year after year they chatter endlessly, forgetting their root.\n\nThe person who embodies the Dao does not act thus. They comprehend the source of all things, fathom the transformations of yin and yang, and realize the profound unity of mind and wisdom. They seal the seven apertures, unifying all states into one. Though their allotted span may end, there is a principle that does not perish. Forgetting self and other, without joy or aversion, they take heaven and earth as a single valley, the great void as their neighbor—how could they be burdened by the form of the body?\n\n**Following the Course (Chapter Thirty-Six)**\nFollowing the course and understanding fate, knowing contentment and avoiding disgrace—this is the way to preserve life and protect form. Take form as the body, virtue as the foundation. Do not chase after the vulgar, do not cling to profit, do not scheme in affairs, do not seek favor from others. Knowing the times but not knowing when to stop—this obstructs the Dao.\n\nDistant yet not troubled, yielding yet not covetous, knowing the past is like the present—life is labor. Responding to change and transformation, beginning and end are not my concern. On level ground, one’s integrity stands firm without effort; things cannot bend it. Even in utter poverty, there is no sorrow. Rejoicing in heaven and knowing fate, one remains free of vulgarity.\n\nSwift as a fleeing hare, inwardly one stretches and relaxes. Dwelling like a corpse, lodging like a guest, one endures without peril throughout life—this is how to last long.\n\n*Dongyuan Collection, Scroll One Concluded*\n*Dongyuan Collection, Scroll Two*",

      "translated_text": "**Discourse on Discerning Delusion, Chapter Seventy**\n\nDelusion and confusion, myriad and boundless—like one who forgets to return home, such are the people of obscured understanding. Launching a boat on dry land, extinguishing fire in water—these are not acts of madness. Why is this so? Though one amasses wealth and bribes, one cannot devise a way to exhaust their use; though one frets over riches and honor, one cannot enjoy them for all time. Glory and disgrace intertwine, rising and hesitating in turn, yet one’s anxieties never cease; though one prepares grand feasts of the finest meats to nourish the body, one cannot preserve life. Those who attend to form are distant indeed, foolish indeed—how coarse and far removed from wisdom! How can the people of this world be deemed worthy? Is this not extreme?\n\nWhen the spirit and consciousness wander outward, one may labor a lifetime without accomplishing a single work—how lamentable! They mistake gold and jade for mere vessels, regard life and destiny as empty nothingness, cherish the ancestral shrines of others while abandoning their own fields and gardens, bind themselves to the five aggregates, and drift amidst the seven emotions. They obscure the radiant torch of wisdom, plunge into the abyss of filth and disgrace, and wear away the root of their spirit, never once attaining ease.\n\nThus the sage treats the world as a temporary lodging, sees favor and affection as carvings upon bone, and knows that what takes form is not truly form, that what gives life does not truly transform. Therefore, they daily cast aside worldly entanglements. They regard beauty as a blade, cautious and unwilling to act; they see wealth and honor as mere insects and sparrows, enjoying them without pride. Brocade robes and jade chambers are to them like tattered curtains and frayed mats; fine foods and rare delicacies, like coarse grains and plain fare.\n\nIn this way, they cultivate wisdom in tranquility, rest in profound stillness, cleanse themselves of craving for sensory pleasures, and uphold kindness and frugality. Their wisdom and brilliance illuminate the world, their virtue and teachings, their benevolent winds, spread fragrance across the four seas. Then, drifting through the gate of the supremely subtle, deeply serene, and wondrously quiescent, they attain vast emptiness and the ineffable, wandering freely in eternal constancy.\n\n**Compendium of Essentials, Chapter Seventy-One**\n\nThe essentials of the primordial net encompass all mysteries, illuminating ten thousand generations to come with flawless radiance, free from obscurity. They guide the world’s people back to the constant Dao, allowing all things to attain their natural state—luminous and unobstructed, their thoughts alert, awakened to the true source.\n\nThus it is said:\nTransformation without end—this is the perfection of penetration.\nPurity without admixture—this is the subtlety of essence.\nVast and unobstructed—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\nProfound and all-penetrating—this is the depth of the real.\nSurveying the myriad things—this is the clarity of the sage.\nVirtue permeating the animate and inanimate—this is the highest kindness.\nTransforming even the lowly—this is the ability of the worthy.\nLoyalty and forbearance unerring—this is the goodness of the good.\nMind and wisdom ever bright—this is the completeness of wisdom.\nEmptiness, stillness, and indifference—this is the numinosity of spirit.\nSerene unity and ease—this is the nourishment of qi.\nEloquent and expansive speech—this is the keenness of talent.\nSincerity without pretense—this is the steadfastness of will.\nHumility in conduct—this is the greatness of fortune.\n\nThose of ancient times who cultivated the real examined these many virtues, followed them in the world, and thus interfaced with heaven and humanity—the great Dao was fulfilled.\n\nAs for the origin of unity, vast and unbounded, pure and empty, primordial and formless, merged yet unassuming, flowing and expansive, operating without trace, subtly quiescent—it is stabilized by simplicity, nurtures the ten thousand spirits, lush and flourishing, unhurried yet effortless. Spreading throughout the cosmos, its words shine brilliantly, unstained and untainted. Its use is complete in its subtlety, free from affairs and desires, serving as the world’s model.\n\nThe arts of the Dao in ancient times were found in this. Now, Master Changquan heard of its influence and delighted in it. He practiced the learning of non-learning, dwelled where the multitude shunned, solitary and withdrawn, retiring from the world. Awkward and plainspoken, he did not let red and purple disrupt his true hue. Earnest and content, indistinct and formless, he emerged and submerged like waves upon the water, his transformations without constancy.\n\nHe did not precede others, yet followed things afterward; he did not sever or display, his merit equal to all. He pared away excess, harmonizing the courtyard with purity and harmony. He took the worn as new, the weak as strong, the clumsy as skillful, the humble as true. Alone, he matched the four seasons like a horse, took emptiness as his forest, non-accumulation as sufficiency, the one as the many, the root as essence, the old as vast.\n\nHis words, though plain and austere, were not like jade—yet they ascended without peril, stirred without harm. Utterly great, without exterior; utterly small, without interior. His use was vast and expansive, merging with the great unity. Emerging from our lineage, he obscured life and death, blending ancient and present.\n\nHe saw fortune and abundance as turbid and sinking, beyond grasp. Thus, in recitation, song, dance, and leaping steps, he stood above the multitudes, knowing not why he was so, yet so he was.\n\nVague and joyous, yin and yang cannot be reckoned, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its bounds. Its principle is drawn from yet never exhausted, poured into yet never filled—vast as the source of rivers and seas, without end.\n\nNow, the debates of the hundred schools, the arts and skills of various crafts, though established in the central states and promoted in their time, though useful, inevitably vie for profit, encroach upon the people’s nature, and erode morality. Deceit and malice diverge, unable to return to true constancy—how could they be reversed?\n\nThus, the people of disorder and chaff, restless amidst the ten thousand things, weave and leap without cease. If one merely speaks of the square and round, the towering and lofty, and aspires to ascend and traverse them, they stand perilously at the brink.\n\n**Utmost Sayings, Chapter Seventy-Two**\n\nUtmost words are wordless; utmost knowledge is unknowing; utmost joy is joyless; utmost action is actionless. The utmost joy is never without joy; the actionless is never without action. Pure qi surges within, manifesting in outward ease. Suspicion and jealousy dissolve entirely, and things return to their nature.\n\nThus, fish and turtles share the same waters, elk and deer roam the same wilds—even birds and beasts do not shun one another, how much more should humans?",

      "translated_text": "**Preface and Poems by Changquanzi of Guishan, in Harmony with Langranzi**\n\nI have heard that those who tread the mysterious path of cultivating truth do not follow a single principle, nor do they guard a single gate. Some enter the Dao from the mundane, while others transform the mundane through the Dao—though their affairs and proximities differ, how may one discern the distinction?\n\nI reply: Enlightenment may be sudden or gradual, and learning reveals depths and shallows. What does this mean? Even coarse words may spark profound insight; their patterns, though playful and strange, shine forth with undeniable clarity. Thus, in ancient times, the writings of Zhuangzi, Liezi, Wenzi, and Gengsangzi molded heaven and earth, rode the winds and clouds, mastered the transformations of the six qi, and roamed beyond the eight directions. They harnessed the sun and moon, traversed the cosmos, refined all beings, and extended their blessings even to insects. They expounded the Dao and virtue, aiding the mysterious origin, sweeping through antiquity and the present. Following the course of creation, they silenced the debates of a hundred schools, forged the pivot of ten thousand methods, opened the swift path to transcendence, and unfolded the sublime teachings of the great sages. How vast were these four perfected ones! Were they not those who transformed the mundane through the Dao?\n\nAs for those who enter the Dao from the mundane, their number across kalpas has been vast indeed—too many to record in full. Recently, in leisure, I perused the *Songs of the Dao* by Master Langranzi of the Tang, thirty-one poems in all. Their language is spare, their purport profound, outwardly illuminating the principles of the indistinct and obscure, inwardly penetrating the source of embryonic breathing and the flow of qi. Beholding such true attainment, how could one forget it? Alas, though my nature is no more than wood or earth, how could I fail to see the worthy and aspire to emulate them? Thus, unashamed of my wild and unpolished efforts, I humbly continue the tail of the sable, not daring to hope for later generations’ mending, but simply yielding to the ease of idleness and self-contentment.",

sea—\nwho knows this carefree immortal of the earth?\n\n**II.**\nAt times within his gourd he savors endless spring,\nbeholding the primal face in its true guise.\nBeyond the world, he knows the supreme Dao,\nyet in the realm, he meets no man of jade-green hue.\nIdly he plants jade trees in the mystic garden,\nthirst slaked by the radiant nectar of the Flowery Pool.\nThough mulberry fields shift with the sea’s vast change,\nthe immortal’s scene stays ever fresh through all four seasons.\n\n**III.**\nThe Dao entrusts itself to my body in the Great Simplicity,\nmy floating traces care not for east or west.\nThe spirit-terrace, still, harmonizes with heaven and man,\nmy refined bearing scorns the vulgar crowd’s embrace.\nIn jade grottoes, the flute’s song delights a thousand sages,\nin the crimson furnace, snow melts to open a hundred gates.\nA hint of this wondrous use is spoken plain—\nnot the dust-bound world’s severance of form and void.\n\n**IV.**\nCultivation must unravel its tangles,\nblowing away the clouds of ten thousand kalpas from the spirit-terrace.\nA single point of ease forgets craving and desire,\nthe six gates hushed, all sounds and echoes stilled.\nWithin the breast, a wondrous will of spirit stirs,\nin hand, the deep-wrought patterns of the sacred key.\nThe golden body refined, he soars beyond—\nno ghost of yin shall weep at a lonely grave.\n\n**V.**\nNot coveting the world’s wealth, strife, or gain,\nhe awakens to heaven’s truth, cutting all coming and going.\nKindness sprouts green shoots from withered wood,\ncold ashes flare to crimson flame once more.\nHaving grasped the Dao’s wondrous principle of emptiness,\nwhy fear the relentless press of day and night?\nPitiful, those who waste their fleeting lives—\nin secret, their temples whiten with hoarfrost.\n\n**VI.**\nThe cage of the mundane shattered, he rests at last,\ncarefree, untroubled, forgetting the turn of seasons.\nWine, beauty, wrath, and wealth—no true livelihood,\nbut harmony and tranquility are the root of good.\nIf asked of the elixir of long life,\nhe searches the seas for companions beyond the world.\nOnce the golden turtle is hooked and reeled in,\nhe lies at ease, high upon the white clouds’ crest.\n\n**VII.**\nFor decades adrift in the mortal sea,\nheaven-born, he scorns the gates of lords and marquises.\nThe qi-mother, like a tortoise, nurtures endlessly,\nthe heart’s abyss, like a valley, holds depths untold.\nFire blazes in the cinnabar field, golden chrysanthemums bloom,\nlead boils in the crucible, jade nectar warms.\nWho can speak of the celestial mechanism seized?\nHe probes the Three Lights, grateful for the sages’ grace.\n\n**VIII.**\nThe Mystic Pearl secured, his life’s work done,\nits use adapts to every moment, everywhere clear.\nWith both hands, he rends the net of life and death,\nhis whole being leaps free from the pit of profit and fame.\nIf he explores the Gate of Dui to seal its power,\nhe knows the Valley Spirit shall never perish.\nPillowed high in the grotto-heaven beyond the world’s dust,\nhe pities the ants who scramble for fleeting glory.\n\n**IX.**\nNo envy for the highest ranks of golden seals,\nwith cause, he awakens to the Dao—no hardship there.\nQi and spirit in harmony, life is firmly rooted,\npassions and desires unseated, the body finds peace.\nThe shell-gate’s locks of the Three Essentials are struck open,\nin the jade furnace, the elixir of the nine heavens is refined.\nSuch flavors are priceless,\nnot like common herbs at all.\n\n**X.**\nSpeak not of mountains, forests, or market dust—\nwhere is the wild cloud not at ease?\nOn Kunlun, mist gathers where dragons coil in their caves,\nin grotto-palaces, wind stirs where tigers roar on peaks.\nWith resolve, one may feast on the phoenix’s marrow,\nwithout merit, the jade boy’s face cannot be preserved.\nThe Dao of the Mysterious Origin is known to those who awaken—\nin the land of Uncarved Simplicity, they tread homeward in peace.\n\n**XI.**\nTo whom can I transmit these secrets?\nAll bear the marks of the vulgar and mundane.\nThey know only to cherish wife and child,\nwho can deepen the root and secure the stem?\nWithin, the five viscera’s spirit-essence is depleted,\nwithout, the Three Powers’ virtue and grace are betrayed.\nBeholding this, how foolish men seem—\nnot cultivating the immortal realm, they sink into the earth.\n\n**XII.**\nThe jade palace of the immortal path is not far or deep,\nyet learners fail to awaken to their original heart.\nWho has ever known the frost of the Mystic Cassia?\nThe inferior horse and mad ape cannot restrain themselves.\nFeet tread the azure mist to wander the imperial courts,\nthe body rides a white deer through jade forests.\nThe natural Dharma-realm must be made clear—\ndo not follow the deluded, seeking outward.\n\n**XIII.**\nAbiding in ease, at peace in a humble dwelling,\nunentangled in worldly affairs, his ties are few.\nIn the case, the Seven-Star Sword lies idle,\non the shelf, the Three Sages’ books are stored deep.\nA heart of ice and snow scorns wealth and honor,\na bearing of water and clouds disdains the void.\nBy the thatched window, a pillow of pure wind suffices—\nwhy envy those tossed by the red dust’s favor and disgrace?\n\n**XIV.**\nWash away love and desire, swiftly return to purity,\nrecognize the truth that has always been your own.\nDo not cling to the red-powdered charms of the chamber,\nbut follow the crimson-city dwellers beyond the world.\nIn the mystic furnace, the elixir of long life is refined,\nin the treasure vault, the indestructible body is forged.\nIn the moon’s palace and starry towers, ever at ease,\nthe golden countenance grows ever clearer through ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**XV.**\nNeither monk nor layman, nor Confucian scholar,\nhe savors the ease of idleness, his joy unbounded.\nLife and destiny are already understood beyond the world—\nwhy fret over honors and splendor absent in this realm?\nHis heart, like the bright moon, shines high and low,\nhis body, like a lone cloud, rolls and unfurls at will.\nRoaming the cosmos in true delight,\nhe spares his heart from the world’s driving cares.\n\n**XVI.**\nHaving ingested the wondrous pill of emptiness,\nnaturally, his spirit shines with a youthful glow.\nHis radiant wisdom gleams like the noonday sun,\nhis body and mind stand firm as Mount Tai.\nThe magic mushrooms remain fragrant through all four seasons,\nthe celestial light stays serene through ten thousand kalpas.\nIf worldly men could daily practice thus,\nthey would live in joy, soaring through the universe.\n\n**XVII.**\nNot misled by heterodox paths or external dharmas,\nhow many learners awaken to non-action?\nCutting away passions and desires, ever pure and bright,\nno need to torment the flesh with cold and hunger.\nSilently, he perfects the fruit of the untainted,\nendlessly, he gives birth to the child of transformation.\nWith merit complete and affairs settled, he leaves the mortal world,\nriding the crane to court the sages at dawn.\n\n**XVIII.**\nIn learning the Dao, never seek the outer elixir—\nscattered essence and yang cannot return.\nWithin the five thousand characters, heaven’s principle is clear,\nthrough the twelve hours, the jade countenance is preserved.\nDelighting in a simple gourd and plain fare,\nhis nature, like the cloud-crane, loves emptiness and leisure.\nWho in the marketplace knows me, chasing fame and profit?\nI roam at ease, unburdened, through heaven and earth.\n\n**XIX.**\nFollowing causes, he passes through without force,\nday by day, diligently turning inward to cultivate.",

His fence was of brushwood, his door of brambles; he wore a paper hat and a robe of woven hemp, dined on simple grain and wild greens, his complexion rough and hoarse—dull as a fool, incomplete in manner, concealing all his affairs.\n\nAdrift as one with no home, restless yet strangely content. Withered by worldly bonds, he sat motionless as a clod of earth, dim and obscure as a wooden colt behind a lattice. After a long while, he lifted his gaze to the heavens, chanted a song, and sighed: *\"How blissful is secluded dwelling! How blissful is secluded dwelling!\"*\n\nPresently, at his side stood the hermit Kuòránzi Xǔ Ruòhuì of Yǐngchāng, who had shed the world like a cicada’s husk. Rising from his seat, he bowed and asked: *\"What do you mean by this?\"*\n\nLongquanzi replied: *\"Have you not heard the crane cry in the shade, its mate answering in kind? When voices harmonize, when qi seeks its like—those of different Ways cannot counsel one another. Those outside the circle cannot know the language of those beyond the bounds.\"*\n\nKuòránzi’s expression darkened with indignation as he answered: *\"I have heard that the noble-minded ascend, while the petty-minded descend. Yet you, sir, dwell in seclusion—does this not signify the Dao? Is its principle not most subtle? Or is this merely glib deception? Do you not know the joys of riverside hamlets, the elegance of village life, the profound beauty of mountain retreat?\"*\n\nThe Recluse, startled, replied: *\"Ah! Is this so? Why not expound upon it?

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, he opened his speech with great animation:\n\n*\"Now, dwelling by the river keeps one far from the dust of the world and dissolves worldly cares. One chants verses in the desolate riverbanks, lodging one’s pride upon the duckweed isles. Silk is twisted into line, hempen thread into hook; bamboo is carved into rod, grains split into bait—thus does one angle for leviathans in the abyss of a hundred fathoms. The wind upon the water is one’s livelihood, gulls and herons one’s companions. At times, one casts the line from a perilous crag; at others, one drifts mid-stream in eddying turns. The fare is simple—rice porridge and minced fish—while the moon shines on the flute and mist gathers on the straw cloak. When the song of gathering water-chestnuts ends, the oars of orchid-wood beat the maple-lined river; returning with the day’s catch, one furls the net and sails home to the blue islets. Adrift upon the waves, one follows nature’s course, carefree and unhurried—escaping the world, one spends the years along the willow-lined shore. Is this not the joy of the fisherman’s life?*\n\n*Next, the elegance of village life: one’s livelihood is drawn from the fields, from mulberry and hemp. In spring, one plows the green shoots; in autumn, one reaps the bound sheaves. Strolling by bamboo-lined streams, calling out in flowered dells, one leads children to the thatched cottage and pastures chickens and dogs at the wicker gate. Beneath pine shade and mossy paths, woodcutters sing their songs; on sunlit slopes of barren earth, one idly sows melons. A pavilion amid wind-tossed bamboo, surrounded by cloud-wreathed mountains—when the rain clears, the sparse woods ring with birdsong, and the fading green slopes are dotted with cattle and sheep. ‘Return, ah, return! Spring is at its finest,’ and before the village feast, one hears the partridge’s cry. Is this not the purity of the field and cottage, the refinement of rustic dwelling?*\n\n*Thus, to spend one’s old age in mountain retreat holds great delight: threading through clouds and winding along streams, one finds stone paths and forest pavilions. Shutting out the world’s dust, forgetting the burdens of things, one harbors no ambition for wealth and rank, finding joy instead in the pleasures of forests and springs. In layered ravines, one nurtures simplicity; in shallow rapids, one washes one’s cap-strings. The wild heart is at ease, untroubled—beyond, one hears the cries of apes and birds; by the pine streams, one smiles to see deer bearing blossoms in their mouths. The mind rests in unadorned simplicity, content in emptiness and leisure. Opening the door, one finds companions in mist and rosy clouds; crossing the bridge, one walks upon beams of wisteria and cypress. At times, one seeks plum blossoms on the highest peaks; at others, one boils tea by the clear stream. The forest ridges rise in bright and graceful peaks; the grottoes harbor scenes of eternal spring. Towering trees pierce the sky, their branches twisting like azure rainbows; stone blossoms adorn the cliffs, their lichen patterns woven like brocade. Here, one whistles in carefree abandon, forgetting all form—how could this compare to the loneliness of secluded dwelling or the stagnation of silent sitting?*\n\nLongquanzi, hearing this, pushed aside his table and, with a slight shrug, smiled and said: *\"The foolish do not yield to the wise, the small do not presume upon the great—this is inauspicious. Without ascending Kunlun, how can one know the height of heaven? Without crossing rivers and seas, how can one know the vastness of water? Alas, the chaff-like masses, the clamorous rabble! They have heard only of Lao Peng’s longevity, yet what do they know of the untimely dead who attain venerable age? They see only that a cartload of firewood is as light as a feather, yet fail to see that the tip of an autumn hair outweighs Mount Tai. The universe is but a finger’s breadth; the ten thousand things are but a single horse. Great and small, much and little, long and short, wide and narrow—all reside within the self. Nobility and baseness, success and failure—what have they to do with external things?\"*\n\nKuòránzi, startled, exclaimed: *\"This deepens my understanding even more! Ah, this harried youth, though lacking the rites of washing and grooming, the decorum of sweeping and tidying, still wishes to receive your teaching—‘to hear it in the morning and die by evening would be enough.’\"* With this, he followed closely, bowing deeply, and prostrated himself twice to request instruction.\n\nThe Recluse said: *\"Return to your seat. I shall instruct you.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "\n\nKuòránzi’s expression darkened with indignation as he answered: *\"I have heard that the noble-minded ascend, while the petty-minded descend. Yet you, sir, dwell in seclusion—does this not signify the Dao? Is its principle not most subtle? Or is this merely glib deception? Do you not know the joys of riverside hamlets, the elegance of village life, the profound beauty of mountain retreat?\"*\n\nThe Recluse, startled, replied: *\"Ah! Is this so? Why not expound upon it? Do not conceal its essence.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Then, stirred to sudden inspiration, he responded in form and word—his voice flowing forth like a clear cough, scattering fragrance as wood shavings fall from the plane, abundant and brimming as the surging waves of a vast, dark sea. From the pure wellspring of truth it welled naturally, the essence of reclusive dwelling.\n\nSuch a one neither chases after wealth and rank nor grieves over poverty and lowliness; neither delights in long life nor mourns an early death. Clad in coarse silk, he knows the warmth of fox-fur and brocade; eating plain beans, he savors the taste of rice, orchids, and citrus. Sheltered in a thatched hut, he enjoys the shade of towering halls; riding a simple carriage, he bears the adornment of a four-horse chariot. He does not hoard the world’s gains as his own private share, nor does he seek glory in ruling all under heaven. Advancing, he does not court the marketplace, laughing at Zhang Yi’s ruin by desire; retreating, he does not flee to the hills, lamenting Shan Bao’s fate at the jaws of a starving tiger.\n\nOnly then may one explore the hidden depths of reclusive dwelling, wander the gates of tranquility, transcend the world’s snares, and cast off human entanglements—coming and going without constraint, acting or resting at will. Now resting in a pine pavilion, now roaming the outskirts; now sipping fine wine to the sound of zither music, now ascending a terrace with a flowering staff. Sweeping moss from the courtyard, planting peach and plum along the garden paths. Strolling across open plains, passing idle days in leisure; lingering by small streams, filling quiet moments with the vastness of heaven and earth.\n\nFreed from the shackles of profit and fame, one faces the wind and moon in carefree ease. The place is secluded, with no visiting guests; the gate stands empty, without rites of welcome or farewell. Clothes and cap worn as one pleases, sleep comes with dreams of a quiet window; books and sword lie neglected, as one turns to gaze at white clouds stretching a thousand miles. Spring excursions and autumn delights, summer coolness and winter warmth—building a snail’s hut in the forest thicket, erecting a bare-walled dwelling in the wilds. Brush and ink gather dust, dissolving ten thousand cares; the wind and the poets’ verses lie scattered, veiled by the mist of the three isles.\n\nAt such a time, one drifts away in pure simplicity, ashamed to be entangled in worldly affairs; standing at the root of being, wisdom shines clear as the heavens. Thus one hides the mountain in the marsh, the boat in the ravine, the world within the world—yet pursues nothing, roaming beyond the ten thousand transformations, in the land of *wuheyou*, the boundless wilds. Let Zhe Yi dare not speak of the joy of knocking on the fisherman’s oar; let Zi Zhen dare not speak of the pleasures of tilling at Valley Mouth; let Hong Jing’s sworn covenant dare not speak of the seclusion of Zhongnan’s Juqu.\n\nThose who draw near to me are Beigong Zi; those who befriend me are Huang Dayuan; those who meet me are Pei Du; those who know me are Yuanming; those who honor me are Wei Qiong; those who summon me are Xu Mian. Facing fine days and beautiful scenes, at ease in a humble abode—unburdened and carefree, staff in hand, sandals on feet—one gazes at fish by the pond, listens to birds in the forest. Seizing a few fleeting moments of joy, content in simplicity, one washes away the dust of the mind, opening and closing the gates of heaven. Neither riding the wind in the gardens of Zheng nor dreaming of butterflies in the gardens of Qi. Pillow high in the southern window, yielding to the earth in self-possession.\n\nBody at ease, untroubled; heart empty, unhurried; mind vacant, unthinking; spirit obscure, unknowing; *qi* joyful, without striving. Serene and still, in harmony beyond measure, soaring above the nine abysses, forgetting all answers to the four questions. Like drifting duckweed, like swaying reeds—unfettered and vast, attaining the great mystery, the supreme perfection, the utmost refinement, the ultimate extremity. Such is the principle of reclusive leisure.\n\nKuòránzi, hearing this, clasped it to his heart with earnest devotion, bowing his head in gratitude, and withdrew in reverent awe. Soaring freely—ah, soaring freely in spirit, he met the profound and obscure, observing the Dao’s equality of all things. Discerning the signs of illusion’s beginning, awakening to the great smelting of yin and yang, exhausting the barriers of creation, penetrating the dense thickets of superiority and inferiority.\n\nThus one may advance when it is time to advance, retreat when it is time to retreat, soar when it is time to soar, alight when it is time to alight. Above, one reaches the heavens; below, one coils upon the earth. Spirit extends in four directions, sighing at the ten thousand beings, roaming boundless and strange realms, flying beyond all boundaries. Grasping wind and clutching moon, lingering in the spring of Guye; lying on grass and swallowing blossoms, circling the wilds of Dongting. Nurturing truth without adornment, dancing with lotus and hibiscus. Drinking the divine mist from the rice steamer, feasting on morning radiance from the round jade. Sustained by the dew of the Milky Way, borne aloft by the whirlwind’s embrace. Crossing the waters of Peach Blossom Spring to arrive, passing the crimson walls of Red City to depart. Soaring high beyond the bounds of the three realms, flapping wings beyond the nine heavens. Rain clears and sun warms—appearing and vanishing with light ease; wind stills and mist fades—moving freely in graceful disarray.\n\nUnbound by decay, too lazy to keep company with crows perched on withered branches—east and west, up and down, drifting with nature’s current. Treading the vast emptiness, one drifts in blissful contentment.\n\nAlas! In this shallow age, the common crowd is dazzled and indolent, like butterflies flitting in confusion, chasing red and seeking green. The fleeting beauty of things—here they lightly flit through willow lanes, play with shadows in flowered streets. The spirit of plum and the soul of orchid—beware lest they sink into infatuation; powdered wings and fragrant feelers—beware the pursuit of attachment. Wandering through scenes of splendor, surveying the sights—grieving at spring’s dawn, lingering in the golden chambers of blossoms; dabbing powder and stealing fragrance, lodging together in silken curtains. Wild hearts scattered and disordered, seduced by vulgar beauty, swaying with the wind beneath the leaves, chasing after the riches of the branches.\n\nDream-souls muddied and overflowing, never escaping the veil of delusion; root-nature like the toad in the navel, ultimately unable to transcend the stench of decay. Yet the perfected one is not so. Suddenly awakening, steadily penetrating—riding the light before the dawn of doubt, fulfilling one’s will at the beginning of the boundless. Commanding the myriad wonders, sweeping away the eight impurities; in motion, not following the transformations of things; in stillness, unaware of the one who governs existence. Embracing the universe, vast and minute alike, wielding the luminous clarity of spirit, relying on purity and simplicity.",

      "translated_text": "To cease the carving of caskets, weaving through past and present, savoring the vast and tranquil—blood and pulse dissolve into emptiness and nothingness. Such is to know the primal act and its purpose, to grasp the unso and its so. Within the realm of silence and stillness, the chirp of a tiny insect resounds like thunder; in the land of obscurity and boundlessness, the tip of an autumn hair looms like Mount Tai. Deeper still, more profound, more spiritually refined—beyond this, even the most skilled reckoner cannot fathom, let alone the common mind.\n\nConsider those who awaited celestial omens: the Li clan; the dream-weaver of Nanhua; Cui the Wild Moth; Zhou Fang with his unrolled scrolls; Wang Zhuo, who spoke in verse; the most admirable, Master Zhang; Lu Guimeng, who knew the metamorphosis of the orange; and Changquanzi, who mimicked madness in vain imitation. Yet these are but the fringes—exhausted, they come to an end.\n\n**Reclusion**\nReturn, ah return! Bowing to clumsiness, feigning foolishness. No need to open the three paths, nor drift upon the five lakes. Dwelling in a crooked hollow, residing in a chink of the wall. My life has its limits—time slips away, unmeasured. Endless striving, ceaseless toil. Neither do I gather ferns, nor must I wash my ears. Without intent, I emerge from the mountain’s cave to inscribe a bridge; weary of soaring through the clouds, I advance in humble sandals. Now on South Mountain, now by the waters of Pu. Delighting in the return to mugwort and thatch, offering a seat to ants and maggots. Some concealed their traces on Su Gate, some purified themselves in the Wine Spring. Though their forms may fade, their fragrance lingers. Unfit for court and temple, they lightly cast aside tattered crowns. Lofty in resolve and integrity, they whistle and wander amidst clouds and mist. Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade within, they rest on stone by the abyss. Still, they scorn the six seals of the swan’s feather, the thousand goblets of the snail’s horn. Roaming beyond the dust and grime, carefree within heaven and earth. Valleys deep and peaks steadfast, willows by the gate and pines in the courtyard. Seven bowls of fine tea, a mat of pure wind. Stretching and bending beneath the moonlit stream’s misty radiance, exhaling to stir the primordial chaos with the Cloud Lord. Clad in kudzu cap and feather fan, staff adorned with deer-dust and speckled bamboo. Ancient plans among the forests and peaks, profound depths of Dao and virtue. At ease in boundless expanse, leisurely in open heart. Dwelling beyond the world’s edge, gazing upon emptiness and stillness. Forgetting sorrow in the fisherman’s song and woodcutter’s chant, wandering in sandals through mountain hamlets and marshlands. Crane companions and ape friends, pure and clear; solitary in stillness, silent in return. Distant from markets and courts, content and self-sufficient; blocking the brushwood gate, serene and self-possessed. Able to dismiss the four and reflect on the three, never daring to advance an inch or retreat a foot.\n\nThus it is said: Yu Jun, who carved the obscure; Ma Ji, who knew the true sound. Sighing deeply, Liang Xian found no spectacle; whistling long, Ruan Ji rejoiced all the more.\n\nEnough! **Reclusion, reclusion**—hiding the self in secrecy. Veiled and foolish, without expectation, without insistence. Ah! Let the black-haired masses chase the floating clouds—how can they compare to my return, where earth is thick and the lotus blooms?\n\n**Vastness**\nWho recognizes the guest of the great curve’s wholeness, roaming boundless east and west, south and north? A square inch carved open reveals the Five Thousand Characters; a single word encompasses the Three Hundred Poems. Seizing the wind, driving the roc’s wings, the eight wastes and four extremes become mere paths. Fermenting the vastness, stirring limitless brew—stars and constellations fill the flask, yet all remains at ease. The lion’s roar, the flying spring’s sip—with a single sweep, demons vanish and ghosts weep. Last night, wine-sodden, phoenix and simurgh perched upon the terrace; the vastness of the cosmos seemed too narrow for my unbounded heart. Crossing Kunlun’s peaks, traversing with a long flute—lake light and moon drench the white of the stream’s moss. Stone locks green, the crane has not come; wild apes cry in vain at the jade-green lotus peak. Fragrant lingzhi, blossoming jasper—scent drifts, dew heavy, pearls drip. A thousand ages’ heroes are but a cellar of dust; the five-cloud towers and pavilions are the immortals’ abodes.\n\nReturn to Red City, where spring is in full bloom—cease casting the silk line upon the misty waves.\n\n**Entering the Dao**\nTo enter the gate of the Mysterious, one must know its path.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst restless fragmentation and scattered chaos, with myriad anxieties clouding the mind like turbid waters, one drifts helplessly through the labyrinth of delusion, unable to return to the root. Beholding the state of the multitudes, how can one not grieve?\n\nYet our Patriarch Chongyang, the Universally Transforming Perfected One, flung wide the gate of expedient means, broadly expounding the profound principles of the Primordial Origin. He guided the common stream of mortals to wander anew the jadelike path—this is the sacred cause, the joyous assembly of the Golden Lotus.\n\nWhat does this signify? Gold is the foundation of nature; the lotus, the stem of life. Scattered, it becomes ten thousand vessels; gathered, it returns to one gold. Forged in the great crucible, refined a hundred times, it grows ever purer. Though great in constancy and small in variation, it serves the needs of all beings, each according to their desire. The flower unfolds its five petals, exhaling fragrant winds; it stands peerless among blossoms, its fragrance unmatched. Its brocade banners and crimson adornments rival the craft of creation; its green canopy and golden heart deeply grasp the subtleties of yin and yang. Rippling upon the water’s surface, its elegant rhythm endures like a long hairpin; beneath moon and sun, it paints the isles of Penglai with resplendent hues. Those who awaken to it may keep company with sages; those who uphold it are sustained by virtue and power. Resting in the mysterious pass, one remains free from fault throughout life.\n\n**Rhapsody on Leisure and Tranquility**\nIn an age of murky love and defilement, who cherishes clarity? While others entangle themselves in a thousand cares, I alone pass my days in idleness. Breaking free from the shackles of calamity, I dwell ever in peace; escaping the snares of flies and gnats, I fully awaken to luminous clarity. Thus, I have severed worldly fetters and mastered the subtle net of the Dao. Roaming the boundless Great Clarity, I deepen my roots and secure my stem; abiding in tranquil serenity, I delight in long life and enduring vision. Having grasped this principle, the mind becomes as limpid as autumn waters; in all movements, it is as wondrous as the arising of spring winds.\n\nStanding solitary and resolute, profound and still, it is sharp yet not cutting—like a mirror distinguishing beauty from ugliness; radiant yet impartial—like the moon illuminating heaven and earth. Upright in nature, at ease in the six senses, lofty and pure in the wellspring of spirit, its integrity is like the pine and bamboo. Vast and unobstructed in the Dharma realm, it is the pure and simple mysterious gate. Thus, the body soars like a solitary cloud, the heart transcends like a wild crane. In subtlety, it conceals mountains within marshes; in freedom from thought, it hides the boat in the ravine. Clear and penetrating, it roams the boundless expanse. Unburdened by the slightest attachment, the spirit soars in the wanderings of Mount Gushe; self and other forgotten, it treads the vastness of the empty sky.\n\nThis is no privilege of the sage alone but the doing of the practitioner. If one has not relinquished fame and profit, how can one awaken to the subtle and formless? As the *Nanhua* says of the great sage’s leisure, and as Confucius spoke of the petty person’s anxiety—those who preach Chan while mired in desire, who expound wonders while burdened by family, may earn the veneration of fools but cannot escape the ridicule of the wise. One must cultivate merit in purity, turn inward, and reflect in stillness. As Laozi’s teaching holds: attain utmost emptiness and firmly guard tranquility; as Yan Hui’s essential practice: nourish the limbs and abandon cleverness.\n\nThus, when mind and method both dissolve, life and death are both relinquished. Through pure cultivation, the fruit of the Dao is perfected; through awakening to emptiness and leisure, the mysterious heaven is pierced. From this, one abruptly casts off the causes of leakage and desolation pervades the cosmos; deeply resting in the cave of non-action, one whistles freely amidst clouds and mist.\n\nHow lamentable! The ant toils for its meal, the moth sacrifices its life for the flame. Who, adrift in the bitter realms of suffering, would strive to perfect their virtue? Ah, better to heed the call early, delight in leisure, and return to the Mysterious Capital to pay homage to the Supreme Sage.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Mysterious**\nVast is the origin of doubt, wondrous the profound mystery. I briefly express the aspiration for purity and emptiness, momentarily declaring the subtle and marvelous. Carving open the gate of simplicity, the divine mechanism remains unfathomable; bursting forth the luminous essence, its wondrous use is manifest.\n\nOnly when upright is one free from deviation; only when penetrating is there no need for discourse. It does not lie in verbal sparring or hand gestures and oral instructions. The Three Clarities’ mysterious teaching cannot be grasped through clever debate; the single flavor of fermentation does not arise from heroic excellence. For those who awaken, it is inherently present, attained through innate clarity. It does not depend on performing deeds or seated meditation but first requires dispelling desire and forgetting emotion. These subtle workings are scarcely extraordinary.\n\nWithin the pot lies the unending day of heaven—most honored, most noble; beyond the world stretches the everlasting spring—truly refined, truly pure. Yet the ignorant and deluded, scattered and lost, cling to a thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises, embracing the One amid the Five Phases and Two Modes. Though they generate knowledge and perception, they remain fundamentally ignorant of the numinous void; though they distinguish sage from mortal, they never reach true stillness. Today, they cling to peripheral details, abandoning the subtle and formless—like rejoicing in dreamt wealth or sating hunger with painted cakes. The wise craftsman smiles in secret; how would the deluded know?\n\nGrasping the wind of profound tranquility, one attains wonder within wonder; responding to the principle of quiescence illuminating form and emptiness, one acts through non-action. Thus, the true immortals recognize the enlightened. Clad in hemp robes and paper jackets, their hearts hold the celestial mechanism and mysterious principle. Simple, unadorned, pure, and immaculate—within them, heaven and earth, virtue and power are fully contained; sages, worthies, and immortals all attain realization through this. Thus, one ascends the ladder beyond the world, transcending the norms of the mundane. Rolled up, it does not fill a fist; unfurled, it deeply pervades the eight directions. Neither dull nor silent, it transcends yin and yang. From this, one abandons learning and forgets speech, the moon shining above the azure sky; attains emptiness and nurtures vastness, clouds idling beside green peaks.\n\nAlas! The solitary deluded ones rush about in worldly affairs, unwilling to return to purity, blind to the obscure and indistinct. How sorrowful! Who knows the profound mechanism of the Great Dao, where every movement is bound to external things?\n\n**Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir**\nThe secret formula of the Great Dao is rarely known to learners. A single grain of the Golden Elixir is most precious; the two silver trees are difficult to sustain. Sever ties with the entanglements of right and wrong, fame and profit—externally, this clarifies gains and losses; abandon the realms of wine, sex, anger, and wealth—internally, this strengthens the root and foundation.",

      "translated_text": "How could it not be that tranquility and stillness serve as the origin, yin and yang as the ancestors? Gathering the marrow of the myriad dharmas and sages, seizing the wind and rain of the eight directions and the cosmos. Listening as the thunder of *jia-yi* first erupts, fire nurturing the tortoise and serpent; awaiting the tide of *gui-ren*’s Kan-water, the crucible boiling the dragon and tiger. At that moment, the Jade Maiden rides the phoenix, the Golden Elder mounts the ox. Planting the Yellow Sprout, it roars at the earthly gate; spreading the radiant clouds, they coil afar upon the celestial tower. Thus, the four corners fill with mist, the five peaks gather their clouds. Behold the Azure Youth, crowned with spring orchids, planting mushrooms by the pool; rejoice in the Crimson Child, draped in plain silk, locking the wild monkey in the cabinet. It must be when the crow and hare converge in their palaces, the Milky Way revolves. The Vermilion Bird rests quietly in the fragrant chamber, the Dark Warrior drunkenly slumbers in the clouded hall. Jade terraces rise in mist, the chaos in the sea ascends in transformation; the crimson watchtower deepens in spring, the orioles within the willows first trill their songs. Truly, the secret formula is hard to transmit—profound, yet ever more profound. The ice-wheel gleams bright as Chang’e pounds her elixir; the brocade sail sways gracefully as the immortal maidens steer their boat. In the cinnabar clouds of the cave, horses are seized; on Mount Taibai, the flying spring cascades. Among the clouds, the purple cassia blooms, transforming into jade-like herbs; within the furnace, the green pine bears fruit, transmuting into golden coins. The subtle parrot returns to its nest, the mandarin ducks settle their pillows. Auspicious mists drift, adorning cultural splendor; sweet dew descends, ripening the fields of magic mushrooms. Clear notes resound—cranes sing the zither of the nine luminaries; emerald hues shimmer—cocks spar with the brocade of the seven stars. From this, swords and halberds vanish from the groves, the sun soars to the vast cold palace. Refining cinnabar and mercury into numinous treasures, using wood and metal to forge the true altar. Assembling a thousand spirits in the Hall of Three Blossoms, they return together to the Holy Mother; gathering the ten thousand phenomena in the Palace of the Six Dings, all enter the mud-pill. How splendid! Attaining this Golden Elixir, one instantly transcends the mundane world. Riding the green phoenix, one bids farewell to the Middle Kingdom; following the purple decree, one swiftly ascends to the court of the Supreme Emperor. Clothed in jade pendants and rainbow robes, fed with peaches of immortality and cinnamon elixirs. Joyfully roaming forever in the Mystic Capital, one enjoys eternal life and boundless existence.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Eightfold Chan**\nTeaching has sudden and gradual paths, Chan knows no before or after. Those who are deluded remain distant beyond kalpas; those who awaken perceive it here and now. Neither coming nor going, moving through the six supernormal powers with ease; neither arising nor ceasing, transcending the three realms in solitary perfection.\n\n**First: Brushing the Edge**\nFear neither clamor nor disturbance, nor dwell in carefree detachment. Those who divide the gate into five schools forcibly fabricate knowledge and views; those who elevate the One Vehicle still fall into emptiness. Simply reveal constantly, release everything. A thousand paths of cool wind—between the pines, the stone maiden sings; three poles of bright moon—on the ridge, the shepherd boy plucks water chestnuts.\n\n**Second: Dharma’s Function**\nWisdom is innate, spiritual clarity suddenly opens. Responding to circumstances, one must manifest inherent nature; facing conditions, one must still the heart. Harmonizing the four images, penetrating the three talents. Green waters flow endlessly, allowing life and death to arise and cease; green mountains remain unmoved, letting clouds come and go.\n\n**Fourth: True Emptiness**\nEverlasting from ancient times to the present, neither decaying nor perishing. Those who are deluded cling to sounds and forms; those who are enlightened transcend into nothingness. Sweeping away wind and clouds, rubbing the stars and constellations. The zither’s melody is exquisite—the wooden horse in the hall roars; the snow’s tune is rare—the jade dragon in the sea flies and runs.\n\n**Fifth: Universal Illumination**\nDo not seek the Bodhisattva of the southeast, nor search for Amitābha of the northwest. Wherever the eye falls is the dharma-realm—what place is not Chan? Realizing this, one is truly capable. Dwelling in the dust yet beyond it, how could one fall into the illusions of the ten thousand conditions? In desire yet free from desire, one does not sink into the demons of the six thieves.\n\n**Sixth: Receiving Beings**\nEncountering the source from all sides, stillness and illumination return to simplicity. Those who cling to old vines and hags trade bones for a thousand kalpas; those who point directly to the spiritual source utter a single phrase of absolute learning. Freely seizing or releasing, uniquely transcendent. White clouds and green peaks—everywhere is thusness; emerald bamboos and yellow flowers—all things are perfect awakening.\n\n**Seventh: Perfect Completion**\nUtterly without attachment, encompassing the great thousand worlds. Those who hold up a flower to the assembly truly overthink; those who scold the Buddha and revile the ancestors still err. Who understands the step forward? The lotus blooms in the Deer Park. □ □ returns—the moon fills the riverboat. Lifting forth one’s own house style, one instantly transcends the ten grounds; trampling the stubborn emptiness of dreams, one uniquely delights in the heavens.\n\n**Eighth: Dissolving Deceit**\nAll is empty vanity—how dare one contend for worth? Those who compare dregs know not true flavor; those who drill into koans grasp not the wondrous principle. A hair’s breadth of difference leads one a thousand miles astray. The wooden man says: If you wish to know this \"coming from the west,\" you must drink the marrow of the Nirvāṇa Golden Immortal.\n\n**Rhapsody on the Perfected and True**\nThe divine and sagely bestow their decrees, benevolence universally equal.",

      "translated_text": "Having grandly propagated the Mysterious Teachings, we now reverently uphold the Perfect and True. Who knows that the loftiest immortals of the Ten Poles descend to wander this world? The ancient Way of the Three Sovereigns is broadly expounded, harmoniously transforming all people. Rooted in virtue that pervades all schools, the heart returns to the One Correctness. Those who leave the secular world part from kin and sever love; those who embrace poverty delight in heaven and know destiny. Thus the Perfect and True: study and cultivate nature. Fame, wealth, and sensuality are seen as floating pivots upon water; wisdom and spiritual penetration shine as brightly as the ancient sages of the teachings. Truly, in learning one must not be attached, in seeking the Dharma one must attain great penetration. Broadly accumulating virtuous conduct, one outwardly extends expedient means; deeply engaging in cultivation, one inwardly circulates divine power. Skillfully abiding in non-action and non-duality, one can seek the Way of unity and resonance. Each thing distinct and clear, gleaming like the bright moon in a deep pool; every response manifest, moving like the pure wind over grass. Surely, regardless of high or low, all are uplifted. Those who study have cause and effect; those who attain know neither birth nor extinction. Utmost stillness, utmost harmony, utmost integrity, utmost purity. Uniting all virtues to interact with beings, never forsaking compassion; propagating the Three Teachings to dispel delusion, ever revering the wise and sagely. Generally, begging for food brings no shame, utmost poverty no sorrow. Repaying one’s own kindness to others, one bestows grace upon the orphaned and aged; lofty aspirations and unyielding integrity, one lodges pride in kings and lords. These are called the heroic knights of the Perfect and True, the immortal currents who attain the Dao. Suddenly awakening to the celestial mechanism, loftily spreading the Mysterious Wind and roaming the sacred realms; broadly casting fragrant bait, universally seeking wise companions to journey to Penglai Isle. Thus, seeing things one clarifies the mind, knowing emptiness one awakens to the Dao. Practicing the orthodox Dharma of the Perfect and True, one strictly follows Zhong and Lü; grasping the profound principles of the Great Dao, one solemnly reveres the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. In clarity and tranquility, within the red furnace refine silver threads; in purity and subtlety, within the cinnabar tripod concoct the Great Treasure. Fully expressing renunciation, that false compound, one attains spontaneity. Realizing the wondrous within the wondrous of true appearance, obtaining the perfection within the perfection of true power. Five silver mists of the Dao pierce the Dipper; one wheel of the red sun illuminates the heavens. Crane-drawn chariots bearing golden script ascend to the Nine Yang Palace; peaches of immortality and jade nectar seat one at the banquet of the Ten Thousand Sages. Alas, there are those foolishly deluded, contending over self and others. Those who propagate strange and monstrous things do not comprehend the mysterious and wondrous; those who deceive and bewilder the middling and inferior know not cause and effect. Though they escape the fiery household and the mountain of恩, they enter the shackles of fame and the fetters of profit.\n\nO how lamentable! If one wishes to know the true essence of the Perfect and True, one must suddenly comprehend the emptiness that suffices.\n\nOffice does not surpass immortality.\nPeople have far-sightedness, hearts no near worries.\nThough one may hold office and attain eminence, it does not compare to the carefree wandering of immortals.\nLet them be ranked in the court with golden seals and purple cords—\nhow can this compare to ascending the Gardens of Hearing, the moonlit palaces and starry towers?\nI have heard that the enlightened resign from office, while fools seek official emolument.\nWhen Zhang Liang returned to the mountains, he was utterly free from harm;\nwhen Fan Li took to his boat, he avoided execution.\nKnowing this Dao, why seek the floating fame of office?\nFor what truly benefits the self, nothing compares to the pure blessings of immortality.\nWhen power reaches the highest rank and fame resounds in all directions,\nthose who enrich wives and indulge children merely covet fat salaries;\nthose who deceive the public and oppress subordinates fear no deep calamity.\nOnly deluded by the fiery household, they do not awaken to the immortal realm.\nPalaces crumble, honor fades—having created karma, they ultimately return to the underworld;\ncoarse hemp and humble rags—having realized truth, they hasten to Penglai.\nHow can this compare to golden elixir and immortal peaches, blossoms bright as clouds and brocade?\nSubduing dragons and taming tigers, they dwell in the halls of the Five Elders;\nembracing the moon and sleeping in clouds, their pillows are the Seven Stars.\nWholly devoted to non-action beyond the world, they do not love the highest ranks of the court.\nIn the world, jade hairpins and vermilion shoes are but a dream, floating splendor;\nwithin the gourd, purple cassia and the fields of magic mushrooms flourish for ten thousand years.\nThe palaces of Qin and the gardens of Han are now white poplars and fragrant grasses;\nalas, the old city of Chengdu is but peach blossoms and azaleas.\nWhat use are heaps of money and treasure? What firmness is there in nest-like wives and children?\nEven as a worthy minister, one cannot compare to the ranks of immortals.\nHave you not seen Chan the Minister, who abandoned office, awakened to the utmost truth, and forgot the world?\nOr Prince Siddhartha, who relinquished his kingdom, realized supreme enlightenment, and returned to heaven?\nMoreover, those who gain wealth and honor through injustice—how are they different from floating clouds?\nThose who obtain profit and emolument through disloyalty—are they not like worn-out shoes?\nEven if one attains both ministerial and noble rank, it does not compare to the unique beauty of immortals.\nThus Li Si was defiled and humiliated, meeting the white blade at Yunyang;\nwhile the Yellow Emperor, spiritually penetrating, obtained the Mysterious Pearl at the Red Waters.\nThis fully demonstrates escaping the worldly net and realizing the immortal lineage.\nSweeping mist and rosy clouds from the Dipper’s mouth, suspending sun and moon from the Star Bridge.\nFrom this, abandoning the limited pride and extravagance of the human realm, the feasts and pleasures of the vermilion steps;\nattaining the boundless blessings and benefits of heaven, the carefree wandering of the Purple Palace.\nYet how can one be so deluded by the immortal capital as to covet official rank?\nThose who cling to it all suffer imprisonment; those who cast it off avoid sinking into ditches.\nEven the splendor of Golden Valley cannot compare to the joy of Peach Blossom Spring.\nI urge the people of the world: hear early and learn to be heavenly immortals, return to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and keep the appointment.\n\nThe Bitter Sea—\nVast and bitter sea, surging love river.\nRegardless of worthiness or foolishness, all sink and drown; regardless of nobility or baseness, all waste away.\nFrom ancient times to the present, who suddenly casts off the waves of desire?\nThe most exalted and the noble all perish in the waves of恩.\nRecall the ancient purity of the Yellow Emperor, the clarity and emptiness of Laozi.\nThe Five Constants of Confucius’ utmost virtue, the wondrous principles of Śākyamuni’s Three Vehicles.\nRaising high the mast of the Dharma boat, universally rescuing the virtuous.\nThe Four Sagely Ones of compassion leave behind the mysterious formula to escape the bitter sea;\nthe turbid and overflowing passions of the multitude willingly drown in the foul waters of the deluded ford.\nYet people drift endlessly, entangled without cease.\nSome let their minds wander and float away; some follow the world and sink into the current.\nBogged down in the waves of emotion, mired in the caves of karma, sorrowful.\nComing and going, swift as fish, a hundred years submerged;\nmoving and turning, slow as turtles, ten thousand ages submerged.",

Before those who cultivate the hidden and feathered, they recklessly expound on teachings; beside reclusive men of virtue, they wildly preach true principles. Fools!—they flaunt their shallow knowledge, parading their sophistry. Those who seek fame and profit—when have they ever been pure and upright? Those who crave wine and lust—how can they truly observe fasts and precepts? Their tongues are sharp as swords, their words sold for gain. They speak of lineages and patriarchs, yet those who listen seem mad at heart; they claim to dwell in the Dao or the Mysterious, but when questioned, they feign deafness. If they mock superiors and inferiors alike, scorning the wise and foolish, then in discussing prominent figures, they twist facts to fit their meter, and in casual conversation, they lace their speech with archaic particles. Having never truly studied the Dao, they merely aim to fill their mouths. Dividing the subtle mysteries of the Three Vehicles, they confuse the vulgar; displaying the antics of ninefold madness, they prove themselves mere fools.\n\nYou claim the Supreme Simplicity and the Great Beginning, the utmost hardness and vastness—yet these lie not within the Void, but first emerge beyond the boundless dark. Hard to express in words, they manifest as the music of heaven. To expound on the wonders of heaven and earth, yin and yang, is already a daunting task; to parse the mechanisms of the turning heavens and creation’s workings is truly beyond grasp. Most know not strength from weakness, how then can they discern right from wrong? Compose a single lyric, and they flaunt it before others; pen a pair of quatrains, and they boast beyond the world. Little do they know that praise given to their faces brings only sorrow when heard anew. Those who pore over ten thousand volumes may yet fail to transcend life and death; the enlightened who grasp the essence of the One Truth soar beyond mist and rosy clouds.\n\nThus we know that relying solely on perception and hearsay leads not to truth. They abandon Yanzi’s joy in a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, instead practicing Yang Zhu’s arts of rouge and powder. With glib tongues, they sway the crowd—yet in the Dao, they are not one. Shameless and unprincipled, their conduct limps like a crippled turtle; swayed by joy and wrath, their arguments dart like a flying dragon. Know this: their words may be heard for a moment, but should not be endured long. To befriend them brings no benefit; to study their principles yields only empty rhetoric. They speak of thousands of things, yet the Dao is not in them even halfway. Everywhere they go, they debate right and wrong. Their actions defy reason, and in every place, they vie for prominence. Unaware of the sovereign heart, how can they possess compassion? Fearless and unafraid, when they speak, they compare my length to your shortness; when they argue, they care not for falsehoods or taboos.\n\nAlas, alas! They know not what those who speak of the Dao truly seek—only to cultivate their qi.\n\n**The Daoist’s Leisurely Wanderings**\n\nA man of great aspiration should set his heart on the True. Since the Dao is his foundation, let him wander the world with a carefree spirit. How grand is the mechanism of the Mysterious! It requires a lofty scholar to grasp it. Observe the carefree wanderer—he moves unseen among the dust of the world. Only by shedding the cage of the mundane can one find joy in the Dao. Some wash their ears and discard their gourds, laughing at the folly of Xu You of old; some ride donkeys through the world, surpassing the carefree Master Guo. They do not seek cloud-wandering for its own sake, but rather to gather the magic herbs. Forsaking fame and profit, they do not merely delight in poverty; cutting ties with love and kin, they diligently cultivate the Heavenly Treasure.\n\nIf one can withdraw from the world, one should refine the body. Some, sated with classical learning, harbor minds like merchants; others, rich in virtue and conduct, shine inwardly like stars. With such resolve, what harm does wandering do to the spirit? Pitiable are the refined gentlemen who, though they embrace the Mysterious Teachings, remain like recluses in the wilderness, striding freely through the fields. They wander green mountains at dusk, roam beside emerald waters, viewing wealth and honor as floating clouds, casting off glory like worn-out shoes. How noble are the worthy who do this—truly, the Daoist can achieve it. Free from glory and disgrace, they remain serene in poverty; whether still or moving, they soar like solitary cranes. In autumn and winter, gazing across the wilds, they observe the rise and fall of all beings; in spring and summer, they wander in delight, admiring the vibrant hues of a hundred flowers. What wealth could compare to the joy of leisure?\n\nThus the Perfected Ones of utmost virtue and emptiness ride the winds beyond the world; the enlightened scholars of pure yang wander the mortal realm like merchants. Some wear tattered robes of coarse cloth, donning straw raincoats and bamboo hats; some dwell in forests and springs to conceal their aspirations, or roam marketplaces to forget their habits. What others cannot discern, the Daoist in leisure fully attains. Having cultivated the resolve of the True Person, they dwell in peace. They ascend beyond the realm of the Jade Emperor, gathering in serene assembly. Their merits and deeds complete, body and mind no longer wander. They obtain the joy of the elixir from the Mysterious Crucible, joining the immortal companions of Penglai. Delighted to shed their mortal shells and ascend, they swiftly depart the dusty world; fortunate to ride the phoenix’s wings and return, they forever roam the Isles of Yingzhou.\n\nYet how varied are people’s natures, how fickle the world’s warmth and cold! Those who stretch out their hands in the streets are called lazy and indolent; those who beg for alms are criticized for their faults. For the most part, they forget both worldly concerns and let right and wrong be. Alas, alas! Who understands that the Daoist’s wanderings are like angling for golden carp—not merely idle leisure?\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the Dongyuan Collection*\n*Scroll Five of the Dongyuan Collection*",

work of the Mysterious Pass,\nthe divine power of Creation,\nno brush of past or present could ever paint.\nBehold the everlasting spring within the gourd,\nwhere brocade rivers and mountains vie in splendor.\nEverywhere, towers of blossoms rise,\nfragrant breezes exhale,\nand lofty peach trellises soar.\nRoaming the Purple Tenuity’s crimson palaces,\nthe Jasper Pool’s jade gardens—\nhow could one envy the world’s\ngardens and wilds?\nStrolling the Phoenix Terrace,\nlistening to the pure, refined strains of *Xiao Shao*,\nits melody so elegant.\nFreely roaming in and out,\nunbound by spirit or void,\nriding jade whips and golden steeds.\nSuddenly standing alone in heaven and earth,\ngazing at the ten thousand forms\narrayed beneath the azure vault.\nIn the Hall of Five Lights,\nthe Assembly of the Mysterious Pearl,\nthe wondrous body sways like mist and maidenhair.\nFermented from magic mushrooms—\nwho would pay a thousand gold for its worth?\nOnly those who meet a true master,\ntheir numinous passage opened,\never respond without deceit.\nReveling in the sages’ profound truths,\npassing days in humility and kindness,\nwith six senses cleansed,\ngoverning by non-action’s transforming breeze.\nThe osmanthus branch of the nature-moon blooms,\nradiating ten thousand rays of light, unwaning.\nGuard the celestial mechanism’s secret,\nnever let it slip away.\nUnfold the root’s subtle Dao—\nhow many deeply know it?\nSince the Great Simplicity first divided,\nsplitting the primal chaos,\nFu Xi, the August Sovereign, drew the eight trigrams.\nDiscerning the hundred herbs,\nShennong’s merit shone;\nsowing the five grains,\nhis virtue spread through Hua and Yi.\nThereafter, the era of the Yellow Emperor dawned,\nhis sagely teachings proclaimed,\nand auspicious mushrooms sprouted in every land.\nFar-flung frontiers rested in peace,\nall nations under heaven at ease.\nThen, wandering in search of the Dao,\nhe sought seventy masters in succession.\nFrom this, the pure wind spread,\nand in later ages, immortals emerged in the world’s turning.\nYet today, failing to awaken,\nthe masses remain deluded,\ntheir legs racing after profit and fame.\nOnly I cast off all fetters,\ncarefree and untrammeled,\nroaming south and north, east and west.\nWithin the gourd’s scene,\nthe true message—\nthe three fires refining Kan and Li.\nIn the profound and indistinct,\nwho believes in the flight of the Pure Yang dragon?\nTurning the jade gate and golden pass,\nauspicious mists and propitious vapors\nveil the Purple Tenuity.\nHearing the snow-melody of the stringless lute,\nthe immortal’s music so fair,\nwitnessing sun and moon conjoined,\nforging the elixir’s measure.\nWhen the Great Elixir’s work is complete,\nbrushing my sleeves, I depart,\nreturning to the path of eternal life.\nDwelling in the celestial palace’s joy,\nthe Jasper Pool of Wuling.\n\n**II.**\n*To the Tune \"Heavenly Fragrance: Plum Blossoms\"*\nAll trees return to their roots,\nyet through three winters, it stands aloof—\nat dawn, the plum’s buds gently unfurl.\nJealous of snow’s spirit,\nits purity outshines the flames of mortals,\nforbidding careless plucking.\nBefore a hundred flowers bloom,\nit alone claims the eastern lord’s spring hues.\nSlanting across Yu Ridge,\nits solitary fragrance so refined—\na marvel beyond fathoming.\nBy West Lake, utterly serene,\nsurpassing waxen yellow,\nit deepens the soul’s awakening.\nThe courier of the village ahead leaks the news,\nbearing glad tidings.\nInspiring poets’ elegant verses,\nfacing a single golden bud,\none’s spirit finds delight.\nMoonlight bathes the cold branches,\nheavenly fragrance—how precious!\n\n*To the Tune \"Candlelight Shakes the Red\"*\nChrysanthemums bloom in golden flowers,\nthe moon ascends the azure sky, its light so bright.\nAfter frost and rain, their fragrance peaks,\nilluminating all four seas in perfect

rays—\nthe floating world scarcely understands.\n\n**Two Lyrics to \"Dispelling Sorrow\"**\n\n**I.**\nYears and months rush past,\nhurried as galloping steeds.\nComing and going, they silently hasten this floating world.\nWho awakens from the River of Love?\nAmid waves of desire,\nbitterly contending for fame and profit.\nIn the fiery household, fretting over wife and child,\nnever heeding one’s own collapse.\nYou wait until the great limit arrives,\nthen grieve and regret—\nwhat use is it then?\nA living ghost, trading bones a thousand times,\nlaboring in vain,\ntumultuous as ants in chaos.\nA true man’s heart is fierce and resolute,\nwielding wisdom to cast off a myriad entanglements.\nShattering the mortal cage without hindrance,\nroaming mountains and rivers at will.\nBeneath the forest’s shade,\ndrunk on the true wind,\nlying at ease in lofty repose,\nclaiming the noble leisure of purity.\n\n**II.**\nGazing back at the human world,\nbusy, bustling,\nday and night toiling without rest.\nHow much can one truly do?\nThis hundred-year span—\nlike spring snow.\nAlas, the heavenly truth lost to love and desire,\nlike a puppet pulled by strings.\nSilently lamenting this floating life in the bitter sea,\nchanging heads and swapping shells—\nwhen will it ever end?\nHearing of ancient and modern times,\nthose chasing fame and profit—\nmere fox dens and rabbit tracks.\nThe Six Dynasties and Five Hegemons\nall yielded to the heroes of water and clouds.\nOnly the truly pure make steadfast companions,\nnurturing the vast and bright,\nthe cold integrity of the frost-defying years.\nThis simple, unadorned life—\nwith whom to share its beauty?\nOnly the moon at the pine window.\n\n**Five Lyrics to the Tune \"Court-Filling Fragrance\"**\n\n**I.**\nThe Great
