of the Golden Gate,**\n**Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through Dharma-Fruition at the Kalpa’s End.**\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:\nThe Most Supreme Heaven of the Azure Beginning,\nThe true and wondrous gate of the Pure Capital,\nReceiving the five-colored radiance of penetrating illumination,\nA rare assembly, hearing the profound mechanism of the Nine Heavens’ Prolonged Auspiciousness.\nThe Four True Ones may be relied upon—\nJoyfully encountering the august elder of the Golden Quadrant,\nReopening the karmic causes of the mundane world,\nFortunate that the Primordial Worthy deigned to bestow talismans,\nBefore the assembled saints, entrusting secret incantations anew.\nOpening the convenient path of the great earth’s prayers for blessings,\nManifesting the majestic numen of the Great Mystery’s responsiveness.\nWhat calamity will not be extinguished? What fortune will not be attained?\nAct according to the vow, respond according to sincerity.\nGreat Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—\nIn the assembly of numinous multitudes, among the ranks of calamity-dispelling,\nThe Emperors and Lords of the Ten Directions and Myriad Heavens,\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors,\nThe sun, moon, and all stars,\nThe Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms,\nPerfected Persons and Divine Immortals,\nUtmost True Great Saints,\nThe Heavenly Elders of the Nine Heavens,\nThe ranked saints of the celestial bureaus,\nThe deities of one’s birth date and destiny,\nThe stars governing fate and fortune,\nThe divine youths and powerful warriors of the Four Saints’ retinue,\nThe divine kings and fierce generals,\nThe northern armies,\nThe majestic spirits of the ritual registers,\nThe lords of mountains and marshes,\nThe deities of the sacrificial canon,\nThe witnesses of the sutra assembly—\nAll true numina,\nWe humbly beseech that our earnest sincerity ascend,\nThat the saintly presence deign to descend,\nEradicating disasters and recording good deeds,\nThat all we invoke and follow,\nMay sever poisons and protect living beings,\nWielding authority and bestowing fortune.\nMay all sentient beings, with one heart, bow in reverence and submission.\n\n---\n\n### **Mystic Essence Incantation for Opening the Sutra**\n\nThe true origin of Heaven and Earth takes form,\nIn the human realm, the honored Dao/virtue.\nThe celestial patterns inscribe eight corners,\nThose who awaken uproot the roots of evil.\nWith diligent intent, one reaches the cinnabar gate,\nWith devout heart, one attains the Purple Clarity.\nAuspicious mists pervade the eight extremities,\nAuspicious vapors spread over the immortal capital.\nThe profound principles of the Three Vehicles,\nThe luminous preservation of the One Nature.\nNow we contemplate the supreme Dharma,\nWishing to emerge from the sea of delusion.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Nine Heavens Sutra of Prolonging Auspiciousness and Dispelling Calamities by the Four Saints**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Heaven of the Azure Beginning,\nWithin the Jade Capital, upon the Numinous Terrace,\nEmitting five-colored radiance, each hue distinct,\nIlluminating all within and without, making everything bright and clear.\nAssembling the myriad heavens of the ten directions,\nThe sun, moon, and stellar lodgings,\nThe Three Officials and Four Saints,\nThe Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms,\nPerfected Persons and Divine Immortals,\nUtmost True Great Spirits,\nThe four quarters and above and below,\nThe lords of mountains and marshes,\nAn innumerable host,\nExpounding the wondrous Dao of Non-Action.\nGolden light shot forth like the sun,\nPurple vapors suffused his body,\nDharma rain spread everywhere,\nNuminous winds fanned universally.\nGolden lads held the tablets,\nJade maidens bore the incense,\nPhoenixes and simurghs sang in harmony,\nConsorts and empresses performed music.\nBefore the throne, even the spirits of earth and wood listened in contemplation.\n\nAt that moment, beneath the throne there was a Heavenly Lord named the Western White Emperor of the Seven Qi, who held a tablet and knelt at length, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"Your servant observes that people in the world dwell within cages, each of their circumstances different. Some are clad in brocade and feast on delicacies, dwelling in golden halls and jade chambers, with carved beams and towering eaves. Others beg from dawn to dusk, clad in tattered garments, their bodies exposed to the elements, seeking shelter in spirit temples or hiding where no place offers refuge. Some, though born into the human realm, are hunchbacked or afflicted with sores and leprosy, shunned by all, suffering from cold and hunger, poverty and distress, blind, deaf, mute, or crippled, their bodies incomplete. Others are of lowly status, enduring beatings and hardships, a thousand torments and ten thousand sorrows, with no recourse for complaint. Still others rely on their superiors to oppress their subordinates, using strength to bully the weak. I do not understand why these causes and conditions are thus. Your humble servant remains unenlightened; I humbly beseech the Heavenly Countenance not to abandon me, but to expound the wondrous meaning, illuminating what is not yet understood and resolving what is unknown.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Excellent, White Emperor, that you raise this question. Return to your seat and preserve your true nature; I shall explain it to you. People are born and raised in the dusty world, bearing the heavens above and treading the earth below. From youth to old age, from strength to decline, they delight in the splendor of fame and profit, revel in the abundance of life, ceaselessly pursuing their desires, heedless of danger and ruin. They entrap the worthy and good, allowing the three karmic actions to arise and the six senses to contend, for the six senses, once bound to the nine knots, bring calamity. Thus, to have a body is to have burdens; to have burdens is to have karma; to have karma is to have retribution. Knowing there is retribution, all depends on cultivation and reflection. The fruits of sentient beings—poverty and lowliness—are shaped by past karma, while wealth and honor arise from past accumulations. The paths of good and evil are clearly divided, yet the deluded crowd rushes toward one way. Those who do good shall receive good retribution; those who do evil shall dwell in evil roots. Past lives and the present—such is the principle.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord asked again: \"Some people suffer from grave illnesses, their years and lives afflicted, assailed by misfortunes, malevolent ghosts, and demonic harms. What good and beneficial practices can dispel these?\"\n\nThe reply came: \"People do not realize that their bodies are like wind and candlelight, illusory and fleeting. Moment by moment, they follow old habits—how can this last long? They contend for wealth and treasure, benefiting themselves at others' expense, speaking falsely while harboring deceit, indulging in jealousy and resentment. Thus, demons and harms arise, leaving them with nowhere to turn, resulting in untimely injuries and undeserved suffering. Within my domain, there are Four Generals. If one sincerely and secretly recites their texts, there is nothing they cannot respond to.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: \"Who are these Four Generals? I humbly beseech the Merciful Worthy to clearly record their traces.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"In the north, there are Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Zhenwu, who command heavenly soldiers, dispatching generals and officers. In times of urgent peril, one may invoke them with focused intention, and their divine might will descend, arriving as summoned. Their numinous radiance blazes, their killing aura looms vast; demons and ghosts conceal their forms, evil spirits hide in fear. All calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly extinguished.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings, proclaimed the *Four Saints' Divine Incantations for Heavenly Petition, Blessing, Longevity, and Disaster-Purification*.\n\n**Tianpeng Incantation:**\nTianpeng, Tianpeng, Nine Mysteries Killing Lad.\nFive Ding Governors, Gao Diao, Northern Elder.\nSeven Governances, Eight Numinous Ones, Supreme White Might.\nLong-skulled giant beast, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.\nWhite Owl Three Spirits, sternly driving Kui Dragons.\nMighty Sword Spirit King, slaying evil and erasing traces.\nPurple qi ascends the heavens, cinnabar clouds surge fiercely.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts, standing tall to drink the wind.\nAzure tongue, green teeth, four-eyed Elder.\nHeavenly Ding Warriors, warding off southern ills.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and swift, bearing northern blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers, guarding my ninefold layers.\nSplit corpses for a thousand miles, dispelling misfortune.\nDare any petty ghost approach to witness this?\nHeaven-Splitting Great Axe, severing the five forms of ghosts.\nFiery Emperor’s scorching blood, Northern Dipper burns bones.\nFour Brightnesses shatter remains, Tianyu annihilates kinds.\nOne stroke of the divine blade, and ten thousand ghosts scatter.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\n**Tianyu Incantation:**\nTianyu, Tianyu, ranked among the feudal lords.\nAiding the Northern Emperor above, overseeing the Nine Provinces below.\nFour arms sprouting from his shoulders, three heads growing from his neck.\nClad in golden armor, wielding halberd and spear.\nClouds follow his steps, seas flow with his body.\nCrimson light stretches far, purple qi drifts endlessly.\nMighty winds billow, fierce mists howl.\nTrue qi coils and turns, stars and constellations revolve.\nA thousand spirits pay homage, the Five Peaks make their rounds.\nGolden lads drum and blow, jade maidens sing and chant.\nNamed in the Golden Portal, stationed to guard Fengdu.\nAzure birds and lions, vast seas and jiao dragons.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers, following me on my rounds.\nEncountering demons, they are slain; meeting ghosts, they are captured.\nPeople suffer misfortune, but curses meet no end.\nDescending to bring fortune, sweeping away all worries.\nDare any ignorant petty ghost linger?\nOne glance from my eyes, and they become eternal prisoners of the springs.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\n**Heisha Incantation:**\nNorthern Black Emperor, Six Jia of the Supreme Subtlety.\nFive Emperor Spirit Lords, radiant as sun and moon.\nMight shakes heaven and earth, talismans run and registers are seized.\nSealing the Ghost Gate, divine spirits move and qi is spread.\nCapturing and removing the Five Pestilences, left and right officers and soldiers.\nThree-Five Generals, Thunder Lords and lightning bolts.\nLightning flashes, winds rush, blades and swords fall like rain.\nTroops and banners like clouds, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.\nWearing Kunlun on their heads, traversing the distant world.\nHunting and seizing ghosts and spirits, the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces.\nSoldiers of blood offerings, none dare resist.\nDare any spread scales? The Star of Pacification binds their hands,\nThe Northern Dipper seizes their souls.\nThree Terraces and Seven Stars, wielding swords to sever bodies.\nIf crimes are not severely examined, calamities extend to descendants.\nEvil spirits and demons, their ears shall not hear.\nThose who hear my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,\nCrushed to fine dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"\n\n**True Warrior Divine Incantation**\n\nFrom Qian-Yuan comes the General,\nCrowned with the Three Terraces.\nHair unbound in cosmic round,\nTrue Warrior’s majestic power.\nAiding my great Dao,\nTortoise and Serpent merge as one.\nBody like a mountain,\nFour qi radiant and clear.\nGolden light blazing,\nEyes flashing with brilliance.\nTeeth like sword-trees,\nHand grasping the Seven Stars.\nHeavenly demons and heretics,\nGhosts and malevolent spirits—\nUpon seeing me, they turn to blood,\nTransformed into purple dust.\nThe upright qi of the Big Dipper,\nThis is my true form.\nHeavenly talismans manifest,\nGreatly safeguarding Heaven and Earth.\nThe gods of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji rivers,\nThe Five Peaks’ deities,\nCity gods and Earth Lords,\nAll bow and heed my command.\nI govern the cosmic order—\nDare any defy or delay?\nBy the Emperor’s decree,\nI rescue and protect all beings.\nShould any petty ghost appear,\nSeize and bind them for my inspection.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke again:\nLiving beings dwell in an age of the Three Poisons and Ten Evils,\nConstantly afflicted by all manner of malevolent spirits,\nEvil ghosts and wicked gods,\nVenomous creatures and fierce beasts,\nBlades and warfare, flood and fire,\nShackles and prisons,\nSickness and suffering—\nEach and every one entangles them,\nLeaving them unable to find peace.\nI once revealed a wondrous Dharma,\nUniversally delivering all beings,\nBestowing talismanic charts and divine incantations upon those who study the Dao,\nAnd dispatching the Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens throughout the human realm,\nTo rescue and protect all,\nAllowing them to attain natural harmony.\n\nThose who break fasts, violate precepts,\nDefy Heaven and betray Earth,\nFail to recognize karmic conditions,\nKnow not good from evil,\nShun the sacred teachings,\nDistance themselves from the immortal lineage,\nGradually succumb to deviant winds,\nAnd follow the currents of affliction—\nOpenly or secretly, they commit evil,\nIndulging body and mind,\nHarming living beings.\nThe Dao of Heaven is not distant,\nLike a mirror or still water,\nEvery detail is revealed without error.\nThus, poisonous winds and evil qi,\nThe demon ghosts of the Six Heavens,\nPervade the human world,\nSpreading slaughter and strife,\nCausing injury and death,\nCountless each day and night,\nBeyond measure.\n\nI have sent the Ten Celestial Kings of the Ten Poles\nTo descend into the human realm,\nBroadly delivering and rescuing all beings,\nEnsuring their purity and fortune—\nYet how many truly know this?\n\nFrom this time forth,\nIf people devote themselves to the great Dao,\nReverently uphold the true lineage,\nRepent their transgressions and pray for blessings,\nAvert disasters and extend their lifespan,\nYet find no means of relief—\nOr when building new homes,\nBreaking ground for construction,\nAnd violating taboo directions—\nThey should light seven lamps in the central courtyard,\nPrepare fresh seasonal fruits,\nBurn various fine incense,\nSincerely face north and recite the scripture,\nAnd inscribe the Four Sage Talismans in vermilion,\nPosting them at the four corners of their dwelling.\nThus shall they obtain good fortune,\nAs the Four Heavenly Emperors and Four Sage Marshals descend to protect them.\n\nThis wondrous scripture subdues all that is besought,\nGrants all that is sought,\nConveys all that is presented,\nAnd fulfills all that is petitioned.\n\nThe Four Sage Perfected Lords respond to the title *True Talisman*:\n**First:** The Great Marshal Tianpeng of the Northern Pole,\nProlongs fortune, dispels misfortune,\nPreserves life and destiny.\n**Second:** The Vice Marshal Tianyou of the Northern Pole,\nProlongs fortune, dispels misfortune,\nNurtures life and destiny.\n**Third:** The Perfected Lord of Stored Blessings and Preserved Virtue,\nProlongs fortune, dispels misfortune,\nSafeguards life and destiny.\n**Fourth:** The Perfected Lord of Assisted Sagehood and True Warrior Emperor,\nProlongs fortune, dispels misfortune,\nBrings peace and harmony to life and destiny.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said:\nThe merit of these Four Sage Names and Incantations is immense.\nWhen encountering yearly disasters or monthly misfortunes,\nFace north, burn incense,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nAll shall dissipate.\nIf afflicted by frequent illness,\nUncured by medicine,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, all shall be purified.\nWhen locusts cause harm,\nOr drought and flood bring disaster,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, all shall be pacified.\nWhen misfortunes entangle,\nUnable to be resolved,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, all shall be purified and fortunate.\nWhen evil spirits or malevolent forces\nCause harm and injury,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, all shall be driven away.\nWhen dwellings are unsettled,\nWealth and possessions dissipate,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, all shall be peaceful and prosperous.\nWhen imprisoned,\nSuffering harsh punishments,\nFace north,\nFocus the spirit and calm the mind,\nSincerely pay homage and recite—\nNaturally, the celestial immortals’ soldiers and horses,\nThe Four Sage Generals,\nShall protect their body.\n\nThis scripture is the hidden text of my lineage,\nThe profound canon of the Celestial Emperor.\nOn one’s natal day,\nOr during fast days,\nPurify body and mind,\nWhether for parents,\nSiblings,\nOneself,\nOr kin,\nEither recite it oneself,\nOr invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests—\nThree, five, seven,\nOr up to forty-nine—\nTo sincerely recite it before the sages.\nThen shall spirit youths, divine warriors,\nMighty generals, and the northern legions\nAct according to one’s wishes,\nResponding to sincerity.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the *Four Sage General Incantation*:\n\nIn the North there is a General,\nThe divine honored one of the Emperor.\nHair unbound, wielding a sword,\nMaster of the four directions.\nHeaven above, Earth below,\nAll are made to know his command.\nBlades like rain,\nWeapons radiant with light.\nEncounter demons, slay them;\nSee the good, bid them return.\nWhen facing calamity,\nSincerely recite and uphold.\nFlying spears, hurled fire,\nAscend to the Purple Tenuity.\nIn the palace of life and destiny,\nMisfortune follows—\nSwiftly turn peril to fortune,\nSun and moon aligned.\nRecite now,\nAnd obtain compassion.\nThe Three-Five Generals,\nProtect my body.\nGolden light shimmering,\nThunder crashing.\nThose who oppose me die,\nThose who avoid me live.\nHousehold and kin,\nAll preserved in purity and peace.\nThe Big Dipper and Stars of Merit,\nThree hundred thousand soldiers.\nVenomous dragons and fierce beasts,\nGolden essence of the vast sea.\nGreedy Wolf, Great Gate,\nWealth Star, Literary Curve,\nMartial Curve, Integrity—\nLeft Assistant, Right Supporter,\nSlaying evil, breaking armies.\nTrue light swiftly arrives,\nTen thousand ghosts conceal their forms.\n\nSwiftly gather, swiftly gather—delay not!\nWith all doors blessed and prosperous,\nAscend into the formless.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Primordial August Emperor!*\n\nThe Vermilion Four Saints’ Talisman, inscribed on yellow paper,\nWhen worn, knows no failure in efficacy.\n\nThe Dao declares: The Four Saintly Marshals eternally guard beneath the Jade Emperor,\nCommanding the demonic and wayward of the Three Realms.\nEach year they descend to the mortal world,\nObserving human goodness,\nBestowing prosperity and fortune,\nPreserving the imperial throne,\nSheltering the lost,\nSevering the roots of evil,\nAnd extending life and official rank.\n\nShould mortals devote themselves with reverence,\nPurifying body and mind in ritual recitation—\nOnce recited, the body is refined;\nTwice recited, purity and peace are attained;\nThrice recited, harmony within and without;\nFour times, divine soldiers stand guard;\nFive times, demons and ghosts flee afar;\nSix times, all illness and suffering cease;\nSeven times, the true light is beheld;\nA hundred times, the Three Realms offer protection;\nA thousand times, eternal felicity is witnessed;\nTen thousand times, the body dwells in the celestial palace,\nMerging with the Dao as one.\n\nThis text is the path of cultivation,\nThe ladder to spiritual ascent.\nWithin, it preserves and refines the true self;\nWithout, it dispels karmic hindrances.\nIn stillness, observe stillness—\nMystery within mystery.\n\nThereupon, the immortals and sages of the heavens,\nHearing these wondrous teachings,\nObtained the true scripture,\nLeaping with joy beyond measure.\n\nThe Heavenly Lords advanced, bowed in reverence,\nOffering thanks to the Heavenly Worthy with this hymn of praise:\n*\"The Dao, august and primordial,\nNurtures all heavens.\nOriginally tranquil, originally still—\nThus are sages and immortals born.\nEmbracing yellow, circling purple,\nEmerging from azure, entering the profound.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion,\nReveals the true scripture.\nSubtle principles, beyond sound and form—\nAbove, the Kun; below, the Qian.\nUncarved, unhewn,\nImpartial, unbiased.\nEmbody and enact it,\nAnd the body ascends the great kalpa.\nThe primal qi governs myriad transformations,\nWielding the pivot of destiny.\nUnobstructed, free from hindrance,\nAbiding in perfect clarity.\nNow, receiving this sacred text,\nThe words of the exalted sages—\nThose who awaken to it\nShall endure through endless eons,\nLifespan vast and distant,\nFortune and rank enduring.\nDwelling in purity,\nForever advancing toward the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the immortals of the heavens:\n*\"We vow to disseminate this scripture.\nShould one recite it with sincere devotion,\nDisasters shall vanish, blessings descend,\nEternal protection from the immortals,\nDescendants unbroken,\nGeneration after generation,\nBeholding the Heavenly Worthy and the sages expounding the scriptures.\"*\n\nHaving received the wondrous Dharma,\nThey turned their chariots, mounted cranes,\nPhoenix carriages and cloud-borne palanquins,\nBowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy,\nAnd departed.\n\n*The Marvelous Scripture of the Four Saints of the Nine Heavens for Prolonging Fortune and Dispelling Calamity* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "At that moment, beneath the throne there was a Heavenly Lord named the Western White Emperor of the Seven Qi, who held a tablet and knelt at length, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"Your servant observes that people in the world dwell within cages, each of their circumstances different. Some are clad in brocade and feast on delicacies, dwelling in golden halls and jade chambers, with carved beams and towering eaves. Others beg from dawn to dusk, clad in tattered garments, their bodies exposed to the elements, seeking shelter in spirit temples or hiding where no place offers refuge. Some, though born into the human realm, are hunchbacked or afflicted with sores and leprosy, shunned by all, suffering from cold and hunger, poverty and distress, blind, deaf, mute, or crippled, their bodies incomplete. Others are of lowly status, enduring beatings and hardships, a thousand torments and ten thousand sorrows, with no recourse for complaint. Still others rely on their superiors to oppress their subordinates, using strength to bully the weak. I do not understand why these causes and conditions are thus. Your humble servant remains unenlightened; I humbly beseech the Heavenly Countenance not to abandon me, but to expound the wondrous meaning, illuminating what is not yet understood and resolving what is unknown.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Excellent, White Emperor, that you raise this question. Return to your seat and preserve your true nature; I shall explain it to you. People are born and raised in the dusty world, bearing the heavens above and treading the earth below. From youth to old age, from strength to decline, they delight in the splendor of fame and profit, revel in the abundance of life, ceaselessly pursuing their desires, heedless of danger and ruin. They entrap the worthy and good, allowing the three karmic actions to arise and the six senses to contend, for the six senses, once bound to the nine knots, bring calamity. Thus, to have a body is to have burdens; to have burdens is to have karma; to have karma is to have retribution. Knowing there is retribution, all depends on cultivation and reflection. The fruits of sentient beings—poverty and lowliness—are shaped by past karma, while wealth and honor arise from past accumulations. The paths of good and evil are clearly divided, yet the deluded crowd rushes toward one way. Those who do good shall receive good retribution; those who do evil shall dwell in evil roots. Past lives and the present—such is the principle.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord asked again: \"Some people suffer from grave illnesses, their years and lives afflicted, assailed by misfortunes, malevolent ghosts, and demonic harms. What good and beneficial practices can dispel these?\"\n\nThe reply came: \"People do not realize that their bodies are like wind and candlelight, illusory and fleeting. Moment by moment, they follow old habits—how can this last long? They contend for wealth and treasure, benefiting themselves at others' expense, speaking falsely while harboring deceit, indulging in jealousy and resentment. Thus, demons and harms arise, leaving them with nowhere to turn, resulting in untimely injuries and undeserved suffering. Within my domain, there are Four Generals. If one sincerely and secretly recites their texts, there is nothing they cannot respond to.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: \"Who are these Four Generals? I humbly beseech the Merciful Worthy to clearly record their traces.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"In the north, there are Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Zhenwu, who command heavenly soldiers, dispatching generals and officers. In times of urgent peril, one may invoke them with focused intention, and their divine might will descend, arriving as summoned. Their numinous radiance blazes, their killing aura looms vast; demons and ghosts conceal their forms, evil spirits hide in fear. All calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly extinguished.\"\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings, proclaimed the *Four Saints' Divine Incantations for Heavenly Petition, Blessing, Longevity, and Disaster-Purification*.\n\n**Tianpeng Incantation:**\nTianpeng, Tianpeng, Nine Mysteries Killing Lad.\nFive Ding Governors, Gao Diao, Northern Elder.\nSeven Governances, Eight Numinous Ones, Supreme White Might.\nLong-skulled giant beast, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.\nWhite Owl Three Spirits, sternly driving Kui Dragons.\nMighty Sword Spirit King, slaying evil and erasing traces.\nPurple qi ascends the heavens, cinnabar clouds surge fiercely.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts, standing tall to drink the wind.\nAzure tongue, green teeth, four-eyed Elder.\nHeavenly Ding Warriors, warding off southern ills.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and swift, bearing northern blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers, guarding my ninefold layers.\nSplit corpses for a thousand miles, dispelling misfortune.\nDare any petty ghost approach to witness this?\nHeaven-Splitting Great Axe, severing the five forms of ghosts.\nFiery Emperor’s scorching blood, Northern Dipper burns bones.\nFour Brightnesses shatter remains, Tianyu annihilates kinds.\nOne stroke of the divine blade, and ten thousand ghosts scatter.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\n**Tianyu Incantation:**\nTianyu, Tianyu, ranked among the feudal lords.\nAiding the Northern Emperor above, overseeing the Nine Provinces below.\nFour arms sprouting from his shoulders, three heads growing from his neck.\nClad in golden armor, wielding halberd and spear.\nClouds follow his steps, seas flow with his body.\nCrimson light stretches far, purple qi drifts endlessly.\nMighty winds billow, fierce mists howl.\nTrue qi coils and turns, stars and constellations revolve.\nA thousand spirits pay homage, the Five Peaks make their rounds.\nGolden lads drum and blow, jade maidens sing and chant.\nNamed in the Golden Portal, stationed to guard Fengdu.\nAzure birds and lions, vast seas and jiao dragons.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers, following me on my rounds.\nEncountering demons, they are slain; meeting ghosts, they are captured.\nPeople suffer misfortune, but curses meet no end.\nDescending to bring fortune, sweeping away all worries.\nDare any ignorant petty ghost linger?\nOne glance from my eyes, and they become eternal prisoners of the springs.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\n**Heisha Incantation:**\nNorthern Black Emperor, Six Jia of the Supreme Subtlety.\nFive Emperor Spirit Lords, radiant as sun and moon.\nMight shakes heaven and earth, talismans run and registers are seized.\nSealing the Ghost Gate, divine spirits move and qi is spread.\nCapturing and removing the Five Pestilences, left and right officers and soldiers.\nThree-Five Generals, Thunder Lords and lightning bolts.\nLightning flashes, winds rush, blades and swords fall like rain.\nTroops and banners like clouds, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.\nWearing Kunlun on their heads, traversing the distant world.\nHunting and seizing ghosts and spirits, the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces.\nSoldiers of blood offerings, none dare resist.\nDare any spread scales? The Star of Pacification binds their hands,\nThe Northern Dipper seizes their souls.\nThree Terraces and Seven Stars, wielding swords to sever bodies.\nIf crimes are not severely examined, calamities extend to descendants.\nEvil spirits and demons, their ears shall not hear.\nThose who hear my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,\nCrushed to fine dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"",

of malevolent spirits,\nEvil ghosts and wicked gods,\nVenomous creatures and fierce beasts,\nBlades and warfare, flood and fire,\nShackles and prisons,\nSickness and suffering—\nEach and every one
