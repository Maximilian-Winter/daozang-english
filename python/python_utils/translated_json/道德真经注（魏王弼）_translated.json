  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Part II)**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***\n**Author:** Wang Bi (王弼)\n**Composed:** During the Zhengshi era of the Wei dynasty (魏正始年間)\n**Original Text:** Two volumes (sometimes four)\n**Source Edition:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正統道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category\n**Collated Edition:** Ming-era Zhang Zhixiang’s edition (浙江书局刻明張之象本, hereafter \"Zhang Edition\")\n*The Daozang edition originally lacked chapter divisions; this translation follows the standard segmented version.*\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***\nBy Wang Bi of Shanyang (山陽王弼)\n\n**Chapter 1**\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\nWhat can be spoken of as the Dao and named as the Name\nare but conventional designations—shapes imposed upon things—\nand thus are not the eternal Dao and eternal Name.\nHence, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is the eternal Dao,\nand the Name that cannot be named is the eternal Name.\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nAll things arise from the Nameless—\nthus, in its formless, nameless state, it is the origin of all things.\nWhen it takes form and receives a name,\nit nurtures and sustains them, fosters and protects them—\nthus it is their mother.\nThe Dao, though formless and nameless,\ngives rise to all things and brings them to completion,\nyet its workings remain unfathomable—\nthe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nTherefore, one must remain without desire\nto perceive its subtlety.\nFor subtlety is the extreme of the minute—\nall things begin in the minute and then take form,\nbegin in the void and then come to life.\nThus, by remaining without desire and emptiness,\none may perceive the subtlety of things in their origin.\n\nOne must also cultivate desire\nto perceive their limits.\n\"Limits\" refers to their return to the end.\nAll that exists relies on the nonexistent for its function;\ndesire’s origin lies in aligning with the Dao to achieve fulfillment.\nThus, by cultivating desire,\none may perceive the limits of things in their conclusion.\n\nThese two—origin and mother—\nemerge from the same source yet bear different names.\nThey are called the Mysterious,\nthe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\nThe two—origin and mother—\nshare a single source.\nThey emerge from the same Mysterious,\nyet their applications differ—\nat the beginning, it is called origin;\nat the end, it is called mother.\nThe Mysterious is the obscure,\nthe silent void—\nthe source of origin and mother,\nyet it cannot be named or spoken of.\nIt is called the Mysterious because it cannot be grasped,\nyet to say it is the Mysterious is not to fix it as a single entity—\nfor then the name would fail to encompass it.\nHence, it is the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nAll subtleties arise from this unity,\nthus it is called the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen evil already exists.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsound and voice harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\n\nBeauty is what the heart delights in;\nugliness is what the heart abhors.\nBeauty and ugliness are like joy and anger;\ngoodness and evil are like right and wrong.\nJoy and anger share the same root;\nright and wrong share the same gate—\nthus they cannot be exhaustively categorized.\n\nThese six pairs\nare all manifestations of the self-evident principles of Nature,\nwhich cannot be fully enumerated.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nyet Nature suffices—\naction would only bring ruin.\nHe teaches without words.\nAll things arise from it, yet he does not claim them;\nhe gives life yet does not possess;\nhe acts yet does not rely on his deeds—\nwisdom is inherent, yet to act would be deceit.\nWhen the work is complete, he does not dwell upon it.\nHe follows things in their natural use—\nthe work is accomplished by them, so he does not claim it.\nThus, by not dwelling upon it,\nit cannot be taken from him.\nIf he were to claim the work as his own,\nit could not endure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 3**\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nDo not prize difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become confused.\n\n\"Worthy\" means \"able.\"\n\"Exalt\" is the name given to praise.\n\"Prize\" is the term for elevation.\nIf only ability is entrusted, why praise?\nIf only utility is applied, why elevate?\nTo exalt the worthy is to display their name,\nto honor them beyond their capacity,\nleading to constant competition and rivalry.\nTo prize goods beyond their use\nspurs the greedy to vie for them,\ndriving them to break and enter, to risk life in theft.\nThus, if desirable things are not displayed,\nthe heart will not be disturbed.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance\nempties the mind, fills the belly—\nthe mind holds wisdom, the belly holds food;\nemptiness contains wisdom, fullness lacks knowledge.\nHe weakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nThe bones act without knowledge;\nthe will generates affairs and brings confusion.\nHe constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,\npreserving their true nature,\nso that even the wise dare not act.\n\"The wise\" refers to those who act with knowledge.\nTo act without action is to govern without failure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n「The Dao/Way is vast yet applied, yet sometimes not filled to the brim,\nprofound as though the origin of all things.\nBlunt its sharpness, untangle its confusion,\nharmonize its radiance, align with its dust—\nserene as though eternally preserved.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the Sovereign of Heaven.\nHe who clings to a single household’s measure\ncannot fulfill the household;\nhe who clings to a single kingdom’s measure\ncannot perfect the kingdom;\nexhausting strength to lift the heavy\ncannot serve as true utility.\n\nThus, though a man may know all things are governed,\nif he governs not by the Dao/Way of the two principles (yin-yang),\nhe cannot sustain them.\n\nThe Earth, though vast in form,\nif it does not conform to Heaven,\ncannot maintain its eternal tranquility;\nHeaven, though refined in essence,\nif it does not conform to the Dao/Way,\ncannot preserve its purity.\n\nVast yet applied, its use cannot be exhausted;\nfull yet creating substance, substance comes and overflows.\nThus, vast yet applied, it again does not brim—\nits boundless nature is already consummate.\n\nThough form may be great,\nit cannot burden its substance;\nthough matters may be urgent,\nthey cannot fill its measure.\n\nAll things abandon this to seek a master—\nwhere is this master’s refuge?\n\nIs it not profound as though the origin of all things?\n\nBlunted yet unharmed, untangled yet unwearied,\nharmonized light yet unstained—\nits essence aligned with dust yet unchanging in truth,\nis it not serene as though eternally preserved?\n\nThe Earth upholds its form,\nyet its virtue/power cannot exceed its capacity to sustain;\nHeaven embraces its essence,\nyet its virtue/power cannot exceed its coverage.\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot surpass it—\nis it not like the Sovereign of Heaven’s precursor?\nHeaven’s Sovereign, the celestial ruler.\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\ntreating all things as fodder for sacrifice.\nHeaven and Earth follow Nature,\nacting without contrivance or creation,\nletting all things govern themselves—\nthus, they are not kind.\n\nThe kind must contrive and establish,\nbestowing transformations with favor and action.\nTo contrive and establish, transformations—\nthings lose their true nature;\nto bestow with favor and action—\nthings cannot fully exist;\nthings cannot fully exist,\nand thus cannot suffice to fill their purpose.\n\nThe Earth does not grow fodder for beasts so that beasts eat fodder,\nnor does it breed dogs for men so that men eat dogs.\nIt acts without contrivance toward all things,\nyet all things find their proper use—\nnone are left unsustained.\n\nIf wisdom arises from self-assertion,\nit is insufficient for reliance.\n\nThe Sage is not kind,\ntreating the people as fodder for sacrifice.\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power,\ncomparing the people to fodder for sacrifice.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *huangqiú*?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.\n\n*Huang* is the bellows of *qiú*,\n*Qiú* is the reed of *huang*:\nWithin the hollow of the *huangqiú*,\nthere is no sentiment, no contrivance—\nthus, empty yet not exhausted or bent,\nmoving yet never depleted.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nit resonates with Nature—\nthus, it cannot be exhausted,\nlike the *huangqiú*.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to hold the center.\nThe more one acts,\nthe more one loses.\n\nTo plant evil in things,\nto entangle matters with words—\nis not this the path to ruin?\n\nIf one holds the *huangqiú* and adheres to the center,\nthere is no exhaustion;\nif one abandons self to follow things,\nall will be in harmony.\n\nIf the *huangqiú* intends to produce sound,\nit cannot suffice for the demands of those who blow it.\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\nThe *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit) does not die,\nthis is called the *Xuānmǔ* (Dark Mother).\nThe *Xuānmǔ*’s gate,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEnduring as though it exists,\nits use is tireless.\n\nThe *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit),\nthe center of the valley with no valley—\nformless, shadowless,\nwithout obstruction or resistance,\ndwelling low yet unmoving,\nguarding stillness without decay—\nthe valley is formed by it yet its form is unseen,\nthis is the supreme thing.\n\nDwelling low yet nameless,\nthus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth—\nenduring as though it exists,\nits use is tireless.\n\nThe gate,\nthe means by which the *Xuānmǔ* is accessed—\nrooted in its origin,\nit shares the same essence as the utmost,\nthus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo say it exists is to speak of evil,\nto say it does not exist—\nall things arise from it,\nthus it endures as though it exists.\n\nNothing fails to be formed,\nits use is effortless—\nthus it is said: \"Its use is tireless.\"\n\n**Chapter 7**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists,\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nbecause they do not generate themselves.\nIf they generate themselves,\nthey would contend with things;\nif they do not generate themselves,\nthings return to them.\nThus they can endure eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nhe sets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he can fulfill his selfishness.\n\nThe one without selfishness,\nacts without contrivance toward his body.\nHis body first, his body preserved—\nthus it is said: \"He can fulfill his selfishness.\"\n\n**Chapter 8**\n\nThe highest excellence is like water.\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where people revile—\npeople revile what is low.\nThus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no excellence like water,\nthus it is said: \"approaches.\"\n\nResiding in the finest land,\nthe heart in the most profound depths,\nbeing in harmony with goodness,\nspeaking in trust,\nacting in rectitude,\ndoing in capability,\nmoving in timely fashion—\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\ntherefore it has no grievance.\nThese words all respond to the governance of the Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter 9**\n\nTo grasp and fill—\nit is not as good as letting it be.\n\"To grasp\" means not to lose virtue/power.\nIf one does not lose virtue/power yet fills it,\nthe situation will inevitably become precarious.\n\nThus, it is not as good as letting it be—\nmeaning it is even worse than having no virtue/power or achievement.\n\nTo sharpen and refine—\nit cannot be long preserved.\nIf one already blunts the edge to make it dull,\nyet sharpens it to make it keen,\nthe situation will inevitably become shattered—\nthus it cannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them—\nnot as good as letting them be.\n\nIn prosperity yet arrogant,\none invites ruin upon oneself—\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nWhen success is achieved, withdraw—\nthe Way of Heaven.\nThe four seasons follow their course,\nsuccess achieved, then it moves.\n\n**Chapter 10**\n\nTo sustain the *Yíngpò* (vital breath and corporeal form),\nto embrace the One—\ncan it not remain undivided?\n\"To sustain\" means to dwell.\nThe *Yíngpò* is where man commonly resides.\nThe One is man’s true nature.\n\nSpeaking of one who can dwell in the ordinary abode of man,\nembracing the One with a clear spirit.»\n\n「能常无离乎，则万物自宾也。\nIf one can remain perpetually undivided, then all things will come of their own accord.\n\n专气致柔，能婴儿乎？\nCan one focus the *qi* to achieve supreme softness, like an infant?\n专，任也。\n*Focus* means to follow naturally.\n致，极也。\n*Achieve* means to reach the utmost.\n言任自然之气，致至柔之和。\nSpeaking of one who follows the *qi* of nature, reaching the harmony of supreme softness.\n能若婴儿之无所欲乎，则物全而性得矣。\nIf one can be like an infant with no desires, then all things will be complete and one’s true nature will be attained.\n\n涤除玄览，能无疵乎？\nCan one purify and remove all obstructions to attain *玄览* (mystic vision), without blemish?\n玄，物之极也。\n*玄* (mystic) is the utmost of things.\n言能涤除邪饰，至於极览，能不以物介其明。\nSpeaking of one who can purify and remove all false adornments, reaching the utmost of mystic vision, without letting things obstruct their clarity.\n疵其神#3乎，则终与玄同也。\nIf one does not blemish their spirit#3, then they will ultimately merge with the mystic.\n\n爱民治国，能无知乎？\nCan one govern the people and the state without relying on *知* (knowledge/awareness)?\n任术以求成，运数以求匿者，智也。\nTo employ techniques in pursuit of success, or to manipulate circumstances to achieve concealment, is *智* (cunning/worldly wisdom).\n玄览无疵，犹绝圣也。\nTo attain mystic vision without blemish is akin to *绝圣* (transcending the worldly sage).\n治国无以智，犹弃智也。\nTo govern the state without relying on cunning wisdom is to abandon cunning wisdom.\n能无以智乎，则民不辟而国治之也。\nIf one can abandon cunning wisdom, then the people will not be alienated and the state will be well-ordered.\n\n天门开阖，能为雌乎？\nCan one open and close the *天门* (Heavenly Gate), like a receptive female?\n天门，谓天下之所由从也。\nThe *天门* (Heavenly Gate) is the means through which the affairs of the world proceed.\n开阖，治乱之际也。\nOpening and closing are the junctures of order and chaos.\n或开或阖，经通於天下，故曰天门开阖也。\nSometimes it opens, sometimes it closes, flowing through the world like the *Dao* (Way), hence the saying \"Heavenly Gate opens and closes.\"\n雌应而不昌，因而不为。\nA receptive female responds without dominating, and acts without contriving.\n言天门开阖，能为雌乎，则物自宾而处自安矣。\nSpeaking of one who can open and close the Heavenly Gate like a receptive female, then all things will come of their own accord and one’s dwelling will be secure.\n\n明白四达，能无知乎？\nCan one be clear and all-pervading without relying on *知* (knowledge/awareness)?\n言至明四达，无迷无惑，能无以为乎，则物化矣。\nSpeaking of one who reaches utmost clarity and all-pervasiveness, without confusion or doubt, and acts without contriving, then all things will transform naturally.\n\n所谓道常无为，侯王 若能守，则万物自化。\nThis is the saying: The *Dao* (Way) is ever without action.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it, then all things will transform naturally.\n\n生之，不塞其原也。」\nTo nurture them, without blocking their source.\n\n---\n\n**Nurture them. To restrain not their nature.**\n\nTo give birth without possessing,\nTo act without relying upon,\nTo grow without dominating—\nThis is called *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power).\n\nTo not block their source, then things will generate of themselves—\nWhat labor would there be?\nTo not restrain their nature, then things will prosper on their own—\nWhat need to contrive?\n\nThings grow and mature without my domination,\nWith virtue yet no master—\nHow could this be anything but *Xuan* (Mysterious)?\n\nAll who speak of *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power)\nHave virtue yet do not know its source—\nEmerging from the depths of obscurity.\n\n**Chapter Eleven:**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives the cart its use.\nThe hub’s power to govern the thirty spokes\nLies in its *wu* (emptiness).\nBecause of its *wu*, it can receive all things—\nThus it can truly govern the many.\n\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nYet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives them use.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms,\nYet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives them use.\nThus, having gives profit,\nBut *wu* (emptiness) gives use.\n\nWood and clay walls form these three,\nYet all rely on *wu* (emptiness) for their function.\nSpeaking of *wu* (emptiness),\nIt is the means by which having yields profit,\nAnd all things derive their use.\n\n**Chapter Twelve:**\nFive colors blind the eyes,\nFive tones deafen the ears,\nFive flavors dull the palate,\nExcessive hunting drives the mind to madness.\n*Cuan* (dullness)—this is the loss of taste,\nThus it is called *cuan*.\n\nThe ears, eyes, mouth, and heart all follow their nature—\nYet instead of aligning with *nature*, they harm it,\nHence *blindness, deafness, dullness, madness*.\n\nRare treasures obstruct the path,\nRare treasures block the right way—\nThus they cause obstruction in conduct.\n\nTherefore, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nThus he discards the latter for the former.\nTo nourish the belly is to use things to sustain oneself.\nTo nourish the eyes is to use things to enslave oneself—\nThus the sage does not nourish the eyes.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen:**\nHonor and disgrace—both bring alarm.\nGreat calamity is treated as one’s own body.\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and disgrace bringing alarm*?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it brings alarm,\nTo lose it brings alarm—\nThis is called *honor and disgrace bringing alarm*.\n\nHonor must bring disgrace,\nGlory must bring calamity—\nAlarm at disgrace equals alarm at glory,\nFor honor and calamity are the same.\n\nIf one in low station treats honor, disgrace, glory, and calamity as alarming,\nThen one cannot disrupt the world.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nGreat calamity belongs to the realm of honor and glory.\nThick life leads only to deeper death—\nThus it is called *great calamity*.\n\nPeople are deluded by honor and glory,\nYet return to treating it as their own body—\nThus it is called *great calamity as one’s own body*.\n\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nBecause of having a body,\nWhen I have no body,\nI return to *nature*.\n\nWhat calamity then remains?\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure—\nAs if one could entrust the world to it—\nTo not exchange it for anything—\nThis is called *treasure*.\n\nThus, one can entrust the world to it.\nTo love the body as the world’s treasure—\nAs if one could entrust the world to it—\nWith nothing to diminish it—\nThis is called *love*.\n\nThus, one can entrust the world to it.\nOnly when one does not let honor, disgrace, glory, or calamity\nDiminish or exchange the body,\nCan one then truly entrust the world to it.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen:**\nSeen yet not seen—called *Yi* (Smooth).\nHeard yet not heard—called *Xi* (Subtle).\nGrasped yet not obtained—called *Wei* (Fine).\n\nThese three cannot be pursued or questioned,\nThus they merge into one.\nFormless, shapeless,\nVoiceless, soundless—\nThus they can pervade everywhere,\nGo anywhere.\n\nUnknowable—\nFurther naming it with my ears, eyes, and body as *unknowable*—\nThus it cannot be pursued or questioned,\nAnd merges into one.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower reaches are not dark.\nEndless, nameless—\nReturning to *wu* (nothingness).\n\nThis is called *the form of formlessness*,\n*The image of imagelessness*.\nSpeaking of *wu* (nothingness)—\nYet things arise through it.\nSpeaking of *you* (having)—\nYet no shape is seen.\nThus it is called *the form of formlessness*,\n*The image of imagelessness*.\n\nThis is called *Huo-Huang* (Vague and Indeterminate).\nIt cannot be fixed.\n\nApproach it—you see no head,\nFollow it—you see no tail.\nHold fast to the ancient *Dao* (Way)\nTo govern the present *you* (having).\n*You*—this refers to concrete affairs.\n\nTo know the ancient beginnings—\nThis is called *Dao Ji* (the pattern of the *Dao*).\n\nThe formless, nameless—\nThe origin of all things.\nThough past and present differ,\nTimes change, customs shift—\nYet none fail to follow this,\nTo achieve their governance.\nThus one can hold fast to the ancient *Dao*\nTo govern the present *you* (having).\n\nThough ancient times are distant,\nTheir *Dao* remains—\nThus even in the present,\nOne can know the ancient beginnings.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen:**\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars\nWere subtle, mysterious, and penetrating—\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nBecause they were beyond recognition,\nThey feigned outward appearances:\n*Yu* (reserved)—like winter crossing a river,\nWinter’s crossing—hesitant, as if to cross or not,\nA demeanor impossible to discern.\n\n*You* (solemn)—like fearing surrounding neighbors,\nNeighbors converging in attack,\nThe central lord yet unaware of his direction—\nThe virtuous person’s beginnings and tendencies are unseen,\nTheir inclinations invisible—\nAlso like this.\n\n*Yan* (grave)—as if maintaining decorum,\n*Huan* (dissolving)—like ice about to melt,\n*Dun* (solid)—like uncarved wood,\n*Kuang* (vast)—like a valley,\n*Hun* (mixed)—like muddy water.\n\nAll these *ruo* (as if) descriptions\nSpeak of appearances and forms that cannot be named or shaped.\n\nWho can make muddy water still and gradually clear?\nWho can make settled things move and gradually generate life?\nTo obscure in order to govern things yields clarity,\nTo muddy in order to still things yields purity,\nTo settle in order to move things yields life—\nThis is the *Dao* of *nature*.\n\n*Who can*—speaking of its difficulty.\n*Xu* (gradually)—speaking of careful deliberation.\n\nThose who preserve this *Dao*\nDo not desire fullness.\nFullness must overflow.\nOnly by not being full\nCan one avoid being newly formed.\n\n*Ao* (cover)—to envelop.\n---\n**Chapter Sixteen:**\n\n**Chapter Seventeen:**\n\nAttain the utmost emptiness,\nPreserve stillness with sincerity.\nThis means to bring things to their emptiest state\nAnd steadfastly uphold their truest stillness.\n\nWhen all things arise together,\nMoving and growing in action,\nI observe their return.\nWith emptiness and stillness, I watch their reversals.\n\nAll that arises from emptiness,\nAll motion from stillness—\nThus, though all things move and act in concert,\nThey ultimately return to emptiness and stillness,\nThis is the most sincere nature of things.\n\nThings, myriad and diverse,\nEach return to their root.\nEach revert to their origin.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness—\nThis is called *recovering the vital breath* (*fùmìng*).\nRecovering the vital breath is constancy—\nReturning to the root is stillness, hence *stillness*.\nStillness brings recovery of the vital breath, hence *recovering the vital breath*.\nRecovering the vital breath attains the constancy of life and vitality, hence *constancy*.\n\nKnowing constancy is clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action and disaster.\n\nConstancy, as a principle,\nIs neither partial nor exaggerated,\nLacks the states of bright or dim,\nNor the forms of warmth or cold—\nThus, knowing constancy is clarity.\n\nOnly this return can embrace and harmonize all things,\nWithout exclusion.\nLosing this, evil invades its proper place,\nAnd things stray from their nature—\nThus, not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and disaster.\n\nKnowing constancy is to embrace all,\nWithout exclusion.\nEmbrace is universality—\nTo embrace all without exclusion is to attain boundless fairness.\nFairness is sovereignty—\nBoundless fairness is to encompass all without fail.\nSovereignty is heaven—\nTo encompass all without fail is to align with heaven.\nHeaven is the Dao—\nTo harmonize with heaven in virtue,\nTo embody the Dao in vast unity,\nIs to attain the utmost emptiness.\n\nThe Dao endures—\nTo exhaust emptiness and attain the Dao’s constancy\nIs to reach the boundless.\nThus, one’s life is secure, without peril.\n\nEmptiness, as a state,\nCannot be harmed by fire or water,\nCannot be damaged by metal or stone.\nApplied to the mind,\nTigers and rhinoceroses cannot find purchase for their claws and horns,\nWeapons cannot find room for their blades—\nWhat danger or peril could there be?\n\nThe Supreme Sage\nActs below while knowing existence;\n\nThe Supreme Sage—\nThis refers to the Great Person.\nThe Great Person is above, hence called the Supreme Sage.\nThe Great Person, being above,\nResides in *wuwei* (non-action),\nPractices *buyan* (non-teaching),\nAll things arise yet he does not initiate them—\nThus, those below know of his existence alone.\n\nThe next rank, he is loved and praised—\nUnable to dwell in *wuwei* or teach through *buyan*,\nHe establishes virtuous deeds and benevolent actions,\nSo that those below come to love and praise him.\n\nThe next rank, he is feared—\nUnable to further rely on virtue and kindness,\nHe governs through reliance on authority and power.\n\nThe next rank, he is scorned—\nUnable to govern by law and order,\nThose below know to avoid him,\nHis commands are not obeyed—\nThus, he is scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nThis is spoken from above.\nWhen the body’s nature is lost, sickness arises;\nWhen things are not aided in their true form, flaws and strife emerge.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises—\nThis is the natural way.\nOne’s own inadequacy cannot be remedied by cleverness.\nAh, how precious is speech!\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people all say, *\"It was as if by nature.\"*\nNature’s beginnings are unseen,\nIts intentions imperceptible.\nNo thing can replace his words—\nWords must have response—\nThus, *\"Ah, how precious is speech!\"*\n\nResiding in *wuwei*,\nPracticing *buyan*,\nNot shaping things through form,\nThus, when deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people do not know how it came to be.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises *ren* and *yi* (benevolence and righteousness);\nWhen *wuwei* is lost, cleverness is employed,\nAnd virtuous paths are established to guide things.\nWhen wisdom emerges, great deceit arises;\nWhen methods are applied and clarity used,\nTo detect deceit and falsehood.\nWhen intentions are visible and forms are seen,\nThings know to avoid them.\nThus, when wisdom emerges, great deceit arises.\n\nWhen familial bonds are fractured, there arises filial piety and tenderness;\nWhen the state is in chaos, there arise loyal ministers.\n\n「How wondrous is the name of *beauty*,\nBorn from the Great *Evil*—\nThis is what is meant by *\"beauty and evil share the same gate.\"*\n\nThe Six Kinships: father and son, brothers, husband and wife.\nIf the Six Kinships are naturally harmonious,\nAnd the state naturally governed,\nThen filial piety, tenderness, loyal ministers, and virtuous subjects\nWould not know where to appear.\n\nFish forget each other in the Dao of rivers and lakes,\nAnd thus the *virtue* of mutual moistening arises.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nAbandon the *saints* and discard wisdom,\nAnd the people benefit a hundredfold;\nAbandon *ren* and *yi* (benevolence and righteousness),\nAnd the people return to filial piety and tenderness;\nAbandon cleverness and profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThese three *virtues* are insufficient as mere *cultural refinement*,\nHence, they must be paired with their counterparts.\nSeeing *unadorned simplicity* (素) and embracing *primordial purity* (抱朴),\nMinimize selfishness and reduce desires.\n\nThe *saints* and wisdom—\nThe finest of *talent* (才);\n*Ren* and *yi*—\nThe finest of *humanity* (人);\nCleverness and profit—\nThe finest of *utility* (用).\n\nYet to speak of mere *\"abandonment\"* is too stark a *cultural refinement*,\nSo one must pair them with their counterparts,\nLinking them to *unadorned simplicity*, *primordial purity*, and few desires.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nAbandon learning, and there is no *worry*.」\n\n「Chapter\n　　How far apart are *\"the affirming\"* (唯) and *\"the denying\"* (阿)?\n　　How distant are *virtue* (善) and *evil* (惡)?\n　　What the people fear,\n　　One must not fail to fear.\n\nThe lower portion benefits scholars by daily increase,\nAnd benefits those who follow the *Dao/Way* by daily decrease.\nThus, learning seeks to augment what one can achieve to advance one’s *wisdom* (智).\n\nIf one were to attain contentment through *non-desire* (無欲), why seek further increase?\nTo know without knowing, why seek further advancement?\nThe *luán* (鸾) and *què* (雀) are matched in kind,\nWhile the *jiū* (鸠) and *gē* (鸽) bear enmity.\nInhabitants of cold lands\nNaturally know the warmth of *zhān qiú* (旃裘),\nAnd find it sufficient—yet to add more would bring *worry* (忧).\n\nThus, to extend the *fú* duck’s foot,\nWhat difference is there from amputating the *hè* crane’s shin?\nTo fear reputation and advance,\nWhat difference is there from fearing punishment?\n\n*\"The affirming\"* and *\"the denying\"* (唯阿), *virtue* and *evil* (美恶)—\nHow distant are they?\n\nThus, what the people fear,\nI too fear—\nYet I dare not rely upon it for *utility* (用).\n\nVast and boundless!\nI sigh at how distant this is from the common ways.\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nAs though feasting on the *tài láo* (太牢) sacrificial banquet,\nOr ascending the spring platform.\nThe multitude is deluded by the allure of advancement,\nConfused by fame and gain,\nTheir hearts competing to progress,\nHence their bustling joy, like feasting on the *tài láo* or ascending the spring platform.\n\nI alone stand in dread—\nYet no signs reveal themselves,\nLike an infant before it can speak.\nI say of my boundless formlessness, nameless and unmarked,\nAs an infant before it can utter words.\n\nFrugal and frugal,\nAs though having nowhere to dwell.\nAs though having nowhere to rest.\n\nThe multitude all have excess—\nYet I alone seem abandoned.\nThe multitude all possess ambition and aspiration,\nTheir hearts overflowing with schemes,\nHence I say they all have excess.\n\nI alone stand boundless,\nWithout action or desire,\nAs though lost.\n\nAh, my heart is that of a simpleton!\nSevering the heart of the utterly simple,\nThere is no distinction or analysis,\nNo preference or craving.\n\nYet my true nature remains unseen—\nThus I am utterly undone.\n\nMuddled and indistinct!\nThere is no distinction or analysis,\nAnd it cannot be made clear.\n\nThe common folk are bright and discerning,\nTheir light dazzling.\nI alone seem dim.\n\nThe common folk are keen and discriminating,\nYet I alone am dull and obscure.\nMisty and deep,\nMy nature is unseen.\nSwirling and endless,\nWithout tether or constraint.\n\nThe multitude all have means—\n*Utility* (以) in use—\nAll seek to apply themselves.\nYet I alone seem coarse and base,\nWithout desire to act,\nDull and dim,\nAs though recognizing nothing,\nHence I say coarse and base.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nYet hold *sì mǔ* (食母) dear.\n*Sì mǔ* (食母) is the root of life.\nOthers all abandon the root of life for the people,\nAnd prize the embellishments of superficial adornment,\nHence I say I alone desire to differ from others.\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De

annotations」\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.\n*Kǒng* (孔) means \"emptiness.\"\nOnly by taking emptiness as virtue can one then move and act in accordance with the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is but vague and indistinct—\nVague and indistinct, formless, beyond all attachment.\nFleeting and elusive, yet within it are forms;\nElusive and fleeting, yet within it are things.\nIt begins things with no form,\nCompletes things without attachment,\nAnd all things begin and are completed,\nYet do not know how it is so.\nThus it is said: fleeting and elusive,\nElusive and fleeting, yet within it are forms.\nProfound and dark, yet within it is essence—\nProfound and dark, a sigh of the boundless depths.\nThe depths are unseen, yet all things arise from it.\nWhat can be seen is but its fixed manifestation.\nThus it is said: profound and dark, yet within it is essence.\nIts essence is most true, and within it is authenticity.\nAuthenticity means verifiable truth.\nWhen things return to the profound and dark,\nThe utmost of true essence is attained,\nAnd the nature of all things is fixed.\nThus it is said: its essence is most true, yet within it is authenticity.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nIts name does not fade—\nThe utmost of true essence cannot be named,\nAnd the nameless is its true name.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nNothing exists that does not arise from it.\nThus it is said: from ancient times to today, its name does not fade.\nIt governs all beginnings.\nBeginnings are the origin of things.\nIt explains the origin of all things with the nameless.\nHow do I know the state of all beginnings?\nBy this—\nThis refers to what was said above.\nSpeaking of how I know that the origin of all things lies in the nameless,\nIt is known by this.\n\n**Chapter 22**\nWhat is bent becomes whole;\nNot seeing oneself, its clarity is whole#1.\nWhat is crooked becomes straight;\nNot asserting oneself, its correctness is manifest.\nWhat is hollow becomes full;\nNot boasting, its merit is complete.\nWhat is worn becomes new;\nNot vaunting, its virtue endures.\nFewer desires bring attainment; many bring confusion.\nThe Way of Nature is like a tree—\nThe more branches it has, the farther from its root;\nThe fewer branches, the closer to its origin.\nMany branches lead to confusion from its truth,\nHence it is said: confusion.\nFewer branches bring attainment of its root,\nHence it is said: attainment.\nThus the Sage embraces *yī* (一) as the model for all under Heaven.\n*Yī* (一) is the utmost of fewness.\n*Shì* (式) means \"pattern,\" like \"standard.\"\nNot seeing oneself, so clarity;\nNot asserting oneself, so manifest;\nNot boasting, so merit;\nNot vaunting, so virtue endures.\nOnly by not contending does one ensure no one can contend with them.\nWhat was called \"what is bent becomes whole\" in antiquity—\nWas it empty words?\nTruly whole, and thus it returns.\n\n**Chapter 23**\nSparse speech is natural.\nTo listen and not hear is called sparse.\nThe next chapter speaks of the Dao’s utterance:\n\"Faint and flavorless, unseen, unheard.\"\nYet if speech is flavorless and unheard,\nThen it is the utmost of natural utterance.\nThus the gusting wind does not last a morning,\nAnd the sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nHow much less can mortals?\nSpeaking of violent, swift, and fleeting beauty.\nThus those who follow the Dao—\nThose who follow the Dao align with the Dao.\nFollowing the Dao means acting in accordance with it.\nThe Dao, with its formlessness and non-action,\nCompletes and aids all things,\nSo those who follow the Dao take non-action as their lord,\nSilence as their teaching,\nContinuous as if ever-present.\nThings attain their true nature and align with the Dao,\nThus it is said: they align with the Dao.\nThose who attain virtue align with virtue—\nAttainment means fewness; fewness brings attainment,\nThus it is said: they align with attainment.\nThose who lose align with loss—\nLoss means excess; excess brings loss,\nThus it is said: they align with loss.\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them;\nThose who align with virtue, virtue delights in them;\nThose who align with loss, loss delights in them.\nSpeaking of their actions meeting their kind,\nThus they respond in kind.\nLacking sincerity, there is no sincerity.\n\n**Chapter 24**\nThe overreaching cannot stand—\nThings, when advancing, lose stability, hence it is said: the overreaching cannot stand.\nThe striding cannot move—\nThose who see themselves are not clear,\nThose who assert themselves are not manifest,\nThose who boast have no merit,\nThose who vaunt have no enduring virtue.\nIn the Dao, it is called surplus food and superfluous movement.\nIf discussed in terms of the Dao,\nIt is like rejecting what is essential and indulging in excess.\nEven if the root is beautiful, it may become defiled;\nEven if there is merit, boasting of it makes it a blemish.\nThings may hate it,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\n**Chapter 25**\nThere is a thing, indistinctly formed,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nIndistinctly formed, yet all things arise from it,\nThus it is called indistinctly formed.\nUnknown whose offspring it is,\nThus it is born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and void, standing alone, unchanging—\nSilent and void, without form.\nWithout equal, hence it is said: standing alone.\nReturning to transformation, beginning and end without loss of its constancy,\nThus it is said: unchanging.\nCirculating endlessly without peril,\nIt can be the Mother of all under Heaven.\nCirculating endlessly without failing, it sustains the complete and great form,\nThus it can be the Mother of all under Heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nNames fix forms; the indistinctly formed has no form,\nThus it cannot be fixed, hence it is said: I do not know its name.\nI call it the Dao—\nNames fix forms; words are given to what can be spoken.\nThe Dao is taken from what is without substance yet does not depend on it,\nThus within the indistinctly formed, it is the greatest nameable designation.\nI forcibly name it: the Great.\nThe reason I call it the Dao is that it is the greatest nameable designation.\n\n---\n\nThe source of its named designation is tied to the Great,\nThe Great has ties, hence must have divisions—\nWith divisions, its utmost is lost.\nThus it is said: *I forcibly name it the Great.*\n\nThe Great is called *Passing* (*shì*),\n*Passing* is movement—\nIt does not cling to one great form,\nCirculating endlessly without failing,\nThus it is said: *Passing.*\n\n*Passing* is called *Distant* (*yuǎn*),\n*Distant* is called *Returning* (*fǎn*).\n*Distant* is the utmost—\nCirculating endlessly without limit,\nNot favoring one *Passing*,\nThus it is said: *Distant.*\n\nWithout following what it conforms to,\nIts form stands alone,\nThus it is said: *Returning.*\nHence, the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nAnd the King is also Great.\n\nAmong the natures of Heaven and Earth,\nHumans are most noble,\nAnd the King is the sovereign of humans.\nThough he does not directly wield the Great,\nHe is also Great.\nMatching the three,\nThus it is said: *The King is also Great.*\n\nWithin the realm,\nThere are four Great ones:\nThe four Great ones are the Dao,\nHeaven,\nEarth,\nAnd the King.\n\nAll things have names and designations,\nYet these are not their ultimate essence.\nSpeaking of the Dao gives rise to a source,\nWith a source, then it is called the Dao.\nYet this Great within named designations\nIs not as vast as the Great without names.\nThe Great without names cannot be fixed as a realm,\nFor the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and King all exist within the Great without names,\nThus it is said: *Within the realm, there are four Great ones.*\nAnd the King occupies one among them,\nResiding in the Great of the sovereign of humans.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows Nature.\n\n*Law* means principle—\nHumans do not contravene Earth,\nAnd thus attain full security,\nFollowing Earth.\nEarth does not contravene Heaven,\nAnd thus attains full capacity,\nFollowing Heaven.\nHeaven does not contravene the Dao,\nAnd thus attains full coverage,\nFollowing the Dao.\nThe Dao does not contravene Nature,\nAnd thus attains its essence,\nFollowing Nature.\n\nWhen square, it follows square;\nWhen round, it follows round—\nIn Nature, it contravenes nothing.\n\nNature is the speech of the unnameable,\nThe words of the utmost limits.\nIntellect cannot reach the unknowing,\nYet form and vitality cannot match the subtle essence;\nThe subtle essence cannot match the formless,\nAnd things with ritual cannot match the ritual-less.\nThus, it turns to follow in kind.\n\nThe Dao conforms to Nature,\nHeaven thus receives its form;\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nEarth thus takes its stance;\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHumans thus take their shape.\n\nThe reason the King is one among them\nIs that he is the sovereign.\n---\n**Chapter 26:** Heavy is the root of light, stillness is the master of agitation.\nAll things: light cannot bear heavy, small cannot govern great.\nThe non-moving makes the moving move,\nThe non-agitated restrains the agitated,\nThus heavy must be the root of light,\nAnd stillness must be the master of agitation.\n\nTherefore, the Sage moves all day without leaving his baggage.\nWith heavy as foundation,\nHe does not depart.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nHis dwelling remains serene and detached—\nNot clinging to his heart.\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself against the world?\nLightness means losing his foundation,\nAgitation means losing his mastery.\nLightness cannot govern heaviness,\nLosing his foundation is to ruin his body,\nLosing his mastery is to lose his sovereign position.\n\n---\n**Chapter 27:** Good conduct leaves no traces,\nFollowing Nature in action,\nNot contriving, not initiating,\nThus things attain their end without traces.\n\nGood speech has no flaws,\nFollowing the nature of things,\nNot distinguishing, not analyzing,\nThus there are no flaws—\nOne can gain access to its principle.\n\nGood reckoning does not use counting tools,\nFollowing the numbers of things,\nNot relying on form,\nGood closure requires no bars or gates yet cannot be opened,\nGood binding requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.\nFollowing Nature’s natural course,\nNot contriving, not applying,\nThus no bars, gates, cords, or knots are used,\nYet it cannot be opened or undone.\nThese five principles all speak of\nNot contriving, not applying,\nFollowing the nature of things,\nNot using form to govern things.\n\nThus the Sage always rescues people well,\nAnd so there are none abandoned;\nThe Sage does not establish fixed forms or names\nTo examine things,\nNot contriving distinctions to favor the worthy and abandon the unworthy,\nAssisting the self-so of all things without initiating,\nThus it is said: *There are none abandoned.*\n\nHe does not exalt the virtuous and capable,\nAnd so the people do not vie;\nHe does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nAnd so the people do not steal;\nHe does not display what is desirable,\nAnd so the people’s hearts are not disturbed.\nAlways keeping the people’s hearts free of desire and confusion,\nThus there are none abandoned.\n\nAlways rescuing things well,\nThus there are none abandoned—\nThis is called *Emulating the Bright* (*Xímíng*).\n\nThus good people are\nThe teachers of the not-good;\nUsing the good to teach the not-good,\nThus they are called teachers.\nThe not-good are\nThe resources of the good;\n*Resource* means *to take*—\nThe good use the good to harmonize the not-good,\nAnd to abandon the not-good,\nThus the not-good are what the good take from.\n\nIf one does not honor his teacher,\nOr cherish his resource,\nThough wise, he is greatly confused.\nThough he has wisdom,\nRelying solely on his own wisdom without following things,\nIn his Dao he must falter,\nThus it is said: *Though wise, he is greatly confused.*\nThis is called *Essential Mystery.*\n\n「Knowing the masculine, keeping the feminine,\nIs the Way of the world’s stream.\n\nThe Way of the world’s stream,\nEver holds virtue true,\nReturning to the state of the infant.\n\nThe masculine belongs to the first,\nThe feminine to the last.\nKnowing the first as the Way,\nThe last must follow—\nHence the Sage follows his own body,\nYet his body leads the world.\n\nThe stream does not seek things,\nYet things return to it.\nThe infant does not wield wisdom,\nYet it aligns with the natural wisdom of all.\n\nKnowing the bright, keeping the dark,\nIs the Way of the world’s model.\n\nThe model is the standard of form.\nThe Way of the world’s model,\nEver holds virtue unerring—\nUnerring means no deviation.\nReturning to the state of the Boundless.\n\nThe Boundless cannot be exhausted.\nKnowing the honor, keeping the shame,\nIs the Way of the world’s valley.\n\nThe Way of the world’s valley,\nEver holds virtue complete,\nReturning to the state of the Uncarved.\n\nThese three—\nThe Way reverses to its end,\nThus virtue attains fullness in its dwelling.\n\nThe next chapter says:\n*The reversal is the movement of the Dao;*\nIts work cannot be claimed,\nEver abiding in its origin.\n\nThe Uncarved scatters and becomes vessels;\nThe Sage uses it and becomes ruler.\nThe Uncarved—true essence—\nWhen scattered, gives rise to myriad actions,\nDistinct types emerge, like vessels.\n\nThe Sage follows its natural division,\nThus establishes rulers,\nUsing the good as teachers,\nThe not-good as resources,\nTransforming customs and mores,\nRestoring all to unity.\n\nHence the great standard is not severed.\nThe great standard—\nTaking the world’s heart as one’s own—\nThus there is no severing.\n\n**Chapter 29**\nWhen one would take the world by force,\nI see it as not inevitable.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nDivine means formless and boundless,\nA vessel means a harmonized whole.\nFormless yet harmonized,\nThus it is called a divine vessel.\n\nIt cannot be forced.\nForcing brings ruin,\nGrasping brings loss.\nAll things take their nature as given,\nThus one may follow it but not force it,\nMay guide it but not grasp it.\nIf one creates against its nature,\nIt must bring ruin;\nIf one clings to its coming and going,\nIt must bring loss.\n\nThus things may flourish or wither,\nMay rise or fall,\nMay grow strong or weak,\nMay be chipped or shattered.\nHence the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids dominance.\n\nAll these *or*s—\nSpeak of things and affairs\nInverting, obeying, or returning,\nNot to be forced or severed by action.\n\nThe Sage reaches the utmost of nature,\nUnfolds the emotions of all things,\nThus follows without forcing,\nAligns without imposing,\nRemoves what confuses,\nDiscards what bewilders,\nHence his heart remains undisturbed\nWhile the nature of things finds its own fulfillment.\n\n**Chapter 30**\nTo assist the ruler with the Dao,\nIs to not use force of arms to subdue the world.\nTo assist the ruler with the Dao,\nAlready cannot rely on arms to subdue the world—\nHow much more so if the ruler himself abides by the Dao!\n\nHis affairs delight in returning.\nThose who begin with force\nSeek to establish deeds and create affairs,\nBut those who follow the Dao\nSeek to return and undo all doing—\nHence it is said: *His affairs delight in returning.*\n\nWhere the teacher dwells,\nThorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies,\nThere must be years of calamity.\nThe teacher is a harmful thing,\nBringing no aid, only injury.\nIt plunders the people,\nDevastates the fields,\nHence it is said: *Where the teacher dwells, thorns and brambles grow.*\n\nThe good use the teacher,\nYet do not dare to seize and force.\nSeizing means to aid.\nThe good who use the teacher\nDo so only to relieve difficulties—\nNot to seize the world with arms.\n\nWhen seizing, do not boast,\nWhen seizing, do not vaunt,\nWhen seizing, do not be proud—\nI do not hold the teacher’s Dao as superior,\nUsing it only when there is no alternative—\nWhat boasting or pride could there be?\n\nWhen seizing is inevitable,\nWhen seizing, do not force.\nThough arms are used to achieve victory\nAnd relieve difficulties,\nThe moment is not to be seized\nTo force the world.\n\nThings grow strong, then age—\nThis is called *not the Dao*,\nAnd *not the Dao* soon perishes.\nStrong means violent force arises,\nIllustrating those who use arms to force the world.\nA gusting wind does not last a morning,\nA sudden rain does not last a day—\nHence violent force must not be the Dao,\nAnd *not the Dao* soon perishes.\n\n**Chapter 31**\nFine arms are not auspicious instruments;\nThings are bewildered and hate them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman, when at rest, values the left;\nWhen using arms, values the right.\nArms are not auspicious instruments,\nNot the tools of the gentleman—\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\nCalmness and moderation are supreme.\n\nVictory yet not glorying in it,\nAnd glorying in victory—\nThis is to delight in killing.\nHe who delights in killing\nCannot fulfill his desires in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left;\nInauspicious matters honor the right.\nThe Left General is stationed on the left,\nThe Right General on the right—\nIllustrating the treatment with funeral rites.\nThe multitude of those who kill,\nAre to be mourned with sorrowful tears—\nVictory is treated with funeral rites.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nYet the world cannot subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nAll things will come as guests of their own accord.\n\nThe Dao is formless and does not bind,\nEver nameless—\nTaking the nameless as its constant,\nThus it is said: *The Dao is ever nameless.*\n\nThe Uncarved, as a thing,\nTakes the heart of non-action—\nAlso nameless.\nThus to attain the Dao,\nNothing is better than guarding the Uncarved.\n\nThe wise can subjugate others,\nThe brave can command force,\nThe skillful can be employed in tasks,\nThe strong can be given heavy burdens—\nBut the Uncarved, as a thing,\nIs indignant yet impartial,\nNear to nothingness,\nThus it is said: *None can subjugate it.*\n\nEmbrace the Uncarved as the nameless,\nDo not burden its true nature with things,\nDo not harm its divine essence with desires—\nThen things will come as guests\nAnd the Dao will be attained.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nThe people do not command it,\nYet it is evenly distributed.\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nThen sweet dew descends without seeking;\nI guard its true nature without doing,\nThen the people are evenly nourished without command.\n\nAt first, the standard had a name,\nAnd the name was already given.\nThis also is to know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop\nIs to not begin.»\n\nThe beginning of governance refers to the time when the Uncarved first became rulers.\nWhen rulers first establish governance, they cannot fail to assign names and define ranks to establish hierarchy, hence the saying: *\"The beginning of governance has names.\"*\n\nBeyond this point, men will contend over trifles—\nThus it is said: *\"The names are already given.\"*\nIf one knows when to stop,\nThen one does not begin.\nTo persist in naming and commanding things\nIs to lose the root of governance—\nThus knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.\nRivers and valleys do not seek the sea,\nYet they naturally flow there without being summoned.\nThose who practice the Dao in the world\nDo not command yet all is balanced,\nDo not seek yet all is attained—\nThus it is said: *\"Like rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nHe who knows others is wise,\nBut he who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who knows others is wise—no more.\nBut he who knows himself stands above wisdom.\n\nHe who overcomes others is strong,\nBut he who overcomes himself is powerful.\nHe who overcomes others is strong—no more.\nBut he who overcomes himself loses nothing to diminish his strength.\n\nTo apply one’s wisdom to others\nIs not as good as applying it to oneself;\nTo apply one’s strength to others\nIs not as good as applying it to oneself.\nWhen wisdom is applied to oneself,\nNothing avoids it;\nWhen strength is applied to oneself,\nNothing can alter it.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich,\nFor knowing contentment means nothing is lost—\nThus he is rich.\n\nThe resolute in action have willpower.\nIf one is diligent in action, their will must prevail—\nThus it is said: *\"The resolute in action have willpower.\"*\n\nHe who does not stray from his path endures.\nBy self-awareness and measuring one’s strength,\nNot straying from his path,\nHe must attain enduring longevity.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nThough dead, if the Way of life does not perish,\nThen his life is fully preserved.\nIf the body perishes yet the Dao remains,\nHow much more so if the body lives and the Dao is not cut short?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe Great Dao is vast—\nIt can be turned left or right.\nThe Dao is boundless, adapting everywhere,\nTurning freely above and below, yet its use knows no limits.\n\nAll things rely on it to live yet it does not claim,\nIts work is done yet it does not name itself.\nIt clothes and nourishes all things yet does not lord over them—\nAlways without desire, it may be called *small*.\n\nAll things arise from the Dao yet do not know their source,\nThus the world is always in a state of non-desire,\nAnd all things find their place.\nIf the Dao does not impose itself on things,\nThen it is called *small*.\n\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nIt may be called *great*.\nAll things return to it to live,\nYet its power makes them unaware of their origin—\nThis is not small, hence it may also be called *great*.\nBecause it never seeks to be great,\nThus it achieves greatness.\n\nGreatness lies in the small,\nDifficulty lies in the easy.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nHold fast to the Great Image,\nAnd the world will come to you.\nThe Great Image is the mother of all heavenly forms—\nNeither cold nor warm, neither cool nor hot,\nThus it can embrace and govern all things without harm.\nIf the ruler holds to it,\nThen the world will come to him.\n\nWhen they come, they are not harmed,\nAnd peace and stability endure.\nFormless, unperceived,\nIt does not spread or display itself—\nThus all things come to it without obstruction.\n\nMusic and bait\nCan make passing travelers stop.\nThe Dao, when spoken of,\nIs bland, without taste.\nTo look at it, it is insufficient;\nTo listen to it, it is inaudible;\nTo use it, it is inexhaustible.\nThis speaks to the Dao’s profundity.\n\nWhen people hear the words of the Dao,\nThey prefer music and bait—\nWhat delights the senses in the moment.\nMusic and bait can make passing travelers stop,\nYet the Dao’s words are bland and tasteless.\nTo look at it, it does not satisfy the eyes;\nTo listen to it, it does not please the ears.\nIf it does not strike the senses,\nYet when used, it cannot be exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\nTo contract, one must first expand;\nTo weaken, one must first strengthen;\nTo destroy, one must first establish;\nTo take away, one must first give—\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nTo remove the strong and violent,\nTo eliminate disorder,\nOne must employ these four methods.\nBy following the nature of things,\nLet them destroy themselves—\nNo need for harsh punishment to remove what must be removed,\nThus it is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nIf one fills their expansion to its fullest\nYet still demands more expansion,\nThen all will resist.\nIf one’s expansion is insufficient\nYet one insists on demanding more,\nThe more one seeks, the more one endangers oneself.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nFish cannot be dragged from the depths,\nAnd the sharpest tools of state\nShould not be displayed to the people.\nSharp tools are what benefit the state.\nYet one must rely on the nature of things,\nNot resort to force to govern.\nIf tools are unseen,\nYet all things find their place,\nThen they are the sharpest tools of state.\nTo display them to the people is to rely on punishment.\nPunishment, if used to benefit the state,\nWill fail.\nFish dragged from the depths will surely be lost.\nTo display the sharpest tools of state to the people\nWill also surely fail.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\nThe Dao is ever without action,\n\nThe Way follows nature’s course,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nAll things are governed and perfected through action.\n\nIf lords and kings could preserve this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation stirs to take form,\nI shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity.\nWhen transformation stirs to take form—\nto form and complete itself—\nI shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity,\nNot ruling as a sovereign.\nThe nameless simplicity—\nIt will also have no desires.\nNo desires mean no rivalry.\nWithout rivalry, all will settle in stillness,\nAnd the world will naturally find its order.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven (continued)**\nThe Dao is ever without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nAll things are governed and perfected through its action.\n\nIf lords and kings could preserve this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation stirs to take form,\nI shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity.\nWhen transformation stirs to take form—\nto form and complete itself—\nI shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity,\nNot ruling as a sovereign.\nThe nameless simplicity—\nIt will also have no desires.\nNo desires mean no rivalry.\nWithout rivalry, all will settle in stillness,\nAnd the world will naturally find its order.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\n\nThe virtue of the highest Dao is not virtue,\nAnd thus it has virtue.\nThe virtue of the lowly Dao does not lose virtue,\nAnd thus it has no virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action yet nothing is left undone;\nThe lowly virtue acts and yet has much to do.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone;\nThe highest righteousness acts and yet has much to do.\n\nThe highest propriety acts and none respond,\nSo it forces compliance with raised arms.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreemptive knowledge is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the origin of folly.\n\nThus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nIn reality, not in ornament—\nHence he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\nVirtue is that which is obtained.\nTo always obtain without loss,\nTo benefit without harm—\nThus it is called *virtue*.\n\nHow does one obtain virtue?\nThrough the Dao.\nHow does one exhaust virtue?\nBy acting without action—\nActing without action, nothing is left untransformed.\n\nIf there is no action, nothing is left ungoverned;\nIf there is action, it is insufficient to preserve life.\nThus, though heaven and earth are vast,\nTheir essence is inaction;\nThough sages and kings are great,\nTheir foundation is emptiness.\n\nHence it is said:\nTo return to the origin and observe,\nThe heart of heaven and earth is revealed;\nTo ponder it at its zenith,\nThe profound vision of the ancient kings is attained.\n\nTo extinguish self-interest and abandon the ego,\nThen the four seas will gaze upon you,\nNear and far will come without summoning.\nTo abandon the self while preserving the heart,\nThen not even a single body can remain whole,\nNor can flesh and bone tolerate one another.\n\nThus, the man of highest virtue\nUses only the Dao,\nDoes not cling to virtue,\nHolds nothing fast—\nAnd so, though he has virtue, he does nothing,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nHe seeks nothing yet obtains,\nActs yet achieves—\nAnd so, though he has virtue, he bears no name of virtue.\n\nThe lowly virtue seeks and obtains,\nActs and achieves—\nAnd so establishes goodness to govern things,\nAnd thus bears the name of virtue.\nTo seek and obtain is to invite loss;\nTo act and achieve is to invite ruin.\nGood names arise, and evil follows in response.\nThus, the lowly virtue acts and yet has much to do.\n\nTo act without preference is to act without partiality.\nAll who cannot act without action are of the lowly virtue—\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, and ritual norms.\n\nTo illustrate the hierarchy of virtue,\nThe lowly is contrasted with the highest.\nEven when the lowly reaches the extreme of \"without action,\"\nIt is still beneath the highest benevolence.\nTo act while claiming \"without action\"\nIs to invite the calamity of action itself.\n\nThe root lies in inaction;\nThe mother is in the nameless.\nTo abandon the root and forsake the mother,\nThough achievements may be great,\nThey will not be fulfilled.\nThough names may be fair,\nDeception will inevitably arise.\n\nUnable to achieve without action,\nUnable to govern without exertion—\nThen one must act,\nAnd so there are those who widely bestow benevolent love,\nYet love without partiality.\n\nThus, the highest benevolence acts,\nYet nothing is left undone.\nLove cannot be all-encompassing,\nSo there are those who suppress and oppose,\nWho aid the crooked and attack the straight,\nWho use things and hearts alike.\nThus, the highest righteousness acts,\nAnd yet has much to do.\n\nRighteousness cannot be steadfast,\nSo there are those who adorn themselves with ritual,\nWho value propriety and respect,\nWho scrutinize every exchange—\nAnd so resentment arises where none should be.\nThus, the highest propriety acts,\nAnd none respond,\nSo it forces compliance with raised arms.\n\nThe ultimate is the Dao alone.\nFrom this point onward, what is there to revere?\n\nThus, even if one’s **virtue** is great and achievements vast,\nWealthy with all things in abundance—\nEach still gains its own **virtue**,\nYet cannot fully attain self-sufficiency.\n\nTherefore, Heaven cannot be the **Dao**’s burden,\nEarth cannot be its shelter,\nNor can humanity nurture all things.\n\nThough it is honored for its **non-action**,\nOne cannot abandon **non-action** as its essence.\n\nTo abandon **non-action** as its essence,\nThen one loses its greatness—\nThis is called losing the **Dao** and then having **virtue**.\n\nUsing **non-action** as a method,\n**Virtue** is its mother#1,\nSo one can act without exertion,\nYet nothing remains unattended.\n\nFrom this point onward,\nOne loses the mother of **non-action**.\n\nUnable to value **non-action** yet cherish wide benevolence,\nUnable to cherish wide benevolence yet value uprightness,\nUnable to value uprightness yet cherish ritual and respect—\nThis is called losing **virtue** and then having benevolence,\nLosing benevolence and then having righteousness,\nLosing righteousness and then having propriety.\n\nFor propriety begins with insincere loyalty and trust,\nAnd superficial simplicity without depth.\nIts censure is only on the surface,\nIts subtle intrigues hidden in contention.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness arise from within,\nYet even these are feigned—\nHow much more so when one labors over outward display and expects it to endure?\n\nThus, propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the source of chaos.\n\nThe **foreknowledge** of the past\nIs knowing what others have known.\nIt is the rank of lesser **virtue**,\nExhausting one’s wisdom to foresee,\nAnd straining one’s intellect for trivial affairs.\nThough **virtue** may seem sincere,\nCraft and deceit grow ever more refined;\nThough fame may flourish,\nIt only deepens the loss of true substance.\nLaboring yet governing in confusion,\nStriving yet bringing corruption—\nEven with all the wisdom of the sages,\nThe people suffer more.\n\nTo abandon oneself and follow things,\nThen **non-action** prevails and tranquility is achieved.\nTo cling to simplicity and naturalness,\nThen one defies conventional rules and norms.\nTo take what is gained by others,\nAnd discard what one holds—\nThis is the superficial understanding of the **Dao**,\nAnd the root of all folly.\n\nThus, if one attains the **Dao**’s mother of function,\nAll things act without resistance,\nAll affairs persist without labor.\nIts influence is not seen in form,\nIts control is not named—\nSo benevolence and righteousness may be displayed,\nAnd ritual and respect made manifest.\n\nTo bear all upon the **Dao**,\nAnd steady with the **nameless**,\nThen nothing is held in higher regard,\nNo schemes are pursued—\nEach abides by its true nature,\nAffairs are conducted with sincerity.\nThen benevolence is thick with **virtue**,\nRighteousness is upright,\nAnd ritual and respect are clear.\n\nTo abandon what bears them,\nTo forsake their origin—\nTo use their completed forms,\nTo strain one’s brilliance—\nThen benevolence is merely sincere,\nRighteousness is but contention,\nAnd propriety is mere rivalry.\n\nThus, the depth of benevolence\nIs not achieved by using benevolence alone.\nThe uprightness of righteousness\nIs not accomplished by using righteousness alone.\nThe clarity of ritual and respect\nIs not attained by using propriety alone.\n\nTo bear all upon the **Dao**,\nAnd unite with its mother—\nThen what is displayed is without higher regard,\nWhat is made manifest is without contention.\nTo use the **nameless**,\nThus names are firmly established.\nTo use the **formless**,\nThus forms are fully realized.\nTo keep the mother and preserve its child,\nTo exalt the root and lift its branches—\nThen form and name are both complete,\nAnd perversity does not arise.\nGreat beauty aligns with Heaven,\nAnd superficiality is not formed.\n\nThus, the mother must not be abandoned,\nThe root must not be lost.\nBenevolence and righteousness,\nAre born from the mother—\nYet they cannot be the mother themselves;\nForm and tools,\nAre crafted by the artisan—\nYet they cannot be the artisan themselves.\nTo abandon the mother and use its child,\nTo forsake the root and follow its branches—\nNames then have divisions,\nForms then have limits.\nThough great in extent,\nThere will be gaps;\nThough abundant in beauty,\nThere will be hidden woes.\nThe **function** lies in action itself—\nHow could it rest in mere names?\n\n**Chapter 39:** The ancient masters who attained **Oneness**—\n*Ancient*, the beginning;\n**Oneness**, the first number and the limit of things.\nEach recognizes **Oneness** in its own thing,\nThe principle by which it rules.\nAll things gain this **Oneness** to complete,\nOnce complete, they merge to dwell within.\nTo dwell within is to lose their mother.\n\nThus, they all split, decay, exhaust, and perish.\n\nHeaven gains **Oneness** and becomes clear,\nEarth gains **Oneness** and becomes settled,\nThe **spirit** gains **Oneness** and becomes agile,\nThe **grains** gain **Oneness** and become full,\nAll things gain **Oneness** and come to life,\nAnd the **sovereigns** gain **Oneness** to rule the world with sincerity.\n\nTheir attainment—\nEach gains **Oneness** to achieve clarity, settlement, agility, life, and sincerity.\n\nHeaven cannot maintain clarity without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear splitting—\n*Clarity is achieved through **Oneness**, not by using clarity to achieve clarity.*\nTo hold **Oneness** is to never lose clarity,\nTo use clarity is to fear splitting.\nThus, **Oneness** is the mother of **function**,\nAnd must not be abandoned.\n\nTherefore, all avoid using their **function**,\nFor fear of losing their root.\n\nEarth cannot maintain settlement without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear decay,\nThe **spirit** cannot maintain agility without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear exhaustion,\nThe **grains** cannot maintain fullness without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear depletion,\nAll things cannot maintain life without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear destruction,\nAnd the **sovereigns** cannot maintain noble elevation without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear decline—\nThus, nobility lies in humility as its root,\nAnd elevation lies in lowliness as its foundation.\n\nTherefore, the **sovereigns** call themselves lone and humble,\nWithout the abundance of grains—\nIs this not humility as their root?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, though fame may be attained,\nIt is without true praise—\nNot desiring to shine like jade,\nOr be rough like stone.\nClarity cannot be valued for its clarity alone,\nFullness cannot be multiplied alone—\nNobility lies in its mother,\nYet the mother has no noble form.\nNobility is achieved by humility as its root,\nElevation by lowliness as its foundation—\nThus, though fame may be attained,\nIt is without true praise.\n\nJade and stone shine and are rough,\nTheir substance exhausted in form—\nThus, they are not desired.\n\n**Chapter 40:** The **Dao**’s movement is in return—\n\nThe foundation of elevation lies in lowliness as its root,\nNobility in humility as its source,\nUse in emptiness as its substance—\nThis is its reversal.\n\nWhen movement knows its emptiness,\nThen all things are harmonized.\n\nThus it is said: *Reversal is the Dao’s movement.*\nWeakness is the Dao’s function.\n\nThe soft and the weak are universally harmonized,\nBeyond exhaustive measure.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of being,\nYet being is born of non-being.\n\nAll things under heaven take being as their life,\nYet the origin of being lies in non-being.\n\nTo preserve being fully,\nOne must return to non-being.\n\n**Chapter 41:**\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it—\nThis is resolve.\nThe middle person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly,\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThus it is said:\n*Establish* (as in *upright*) speech with being—\n*Establish* means *to set upright*.\nClarify the Dao as if in darkness,\nShine without dazzling.\nAdvance the Dao as if retreating,\nPut yourself last and yet lead,\nPut yourself outside and yet endure.\nLevel the Dao as if uneven—\n*Uneven*, like the soil within.\nThe great leveling of the Dao follows things’ nature,\nNot forcing uniformity to carve them—\nIts leveling is unseen,\nThus it returns as if uneven, like soil within.\n\nThe highest virtue is like a valley—\nNot cherishing its virtue,\nHolding nothing in reserve.\nThe greatest brightness is like a stain—\nKnowing its brightness,\nYet guarding its darkness,\nOnly then attaining true brightness.\nAmple virtue seems insufficient—\nAmple virtue is not full,\nBoundless and formless,\nUnfillable.\n\nEstablish virtue as if lazy—\n*Lazy*, like a match.\nTo establish virtue is to follow things’ natural course,\nNeither forcing nor applying,\nThus it seems lazy and unmatched.\nTrue substance seems false—\nTrue substance does not flaunt its truth,\nThus it seems false.\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nSquare yet not rigid,\nThus it has no corners.\nGreat vessels take long to form—\nGreat vessels formed,\nThe world does not hold them complete.\nThus they must take long to form.\n\nGreat music is rare in sound—\nHearing it, one does not hear—\nCalled *rare*, a sound one cannot hear.\nSound implies division,\nDivision implies it is not *gong* but *shang*—\nDivision cannot govern all,\nThus sound is not great music.\nGreat forms are shapeless—\nForm implies division,\nDivision means not temperate but extreme,\nNot extreme but cold,\nThus forms with shape are not great forms.\n\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\nIs good at lending and completing.\nAll these virtues\nAre what the Dao completes.\nIn form, it becomes great form,\nYet great form is shapeless.\nIn sound, it becomes great sound,\nYet great sound is rare in hearing.\nThings are completed by it,\nYet their completion is unseen,\nThus it is hidden and nameless.\n\n*Lending* is not merely supplying what is lacking—\nA single loan suffices to perpetuate its virtue,\nThus it is called *good at lending*.\n*Completing* does not require the artificer’s craft—\nWithout things, it yet fulfills their form,\nThus it is called *good at completing*.\n\n**Chapter 42:**\nThe Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\n\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAnd through their harmonizing *qi* achieve balance.\nWhat people detest\nAre the lonely, humble, and unfilled—\nYet kings and dukes take them as their titles.\n\nThus some things are diminished to benefit,\nOthers are benefited to diminish.\nAll things, myriad forms,\nYet their return is to One.\nHow does one attain this One?\nIt arises from non-being.\n\nFrom non-being comes One,\nAnd One may be called non-being.\nAlready calling it One,\nHow could one avoid speaking of it?\nSpeaking of it as One,\nHow could it not be Two?\nHaving One and Two,\nThen Three is born.\nFrom non-being’s being,\nNumbers end here—\nBeyond this lies no Dao’s flow.\n\nThus I know the master of all things’ birth,\nThough myriad forms they bear,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* is One.\nThe common people have hearts,\nDiverse lands, varied customs—\nYet those who attain One\nAre the kings and dukes.\nTaking One as master,\nHow could One be abandoned?\nThe more one adds, the farther one strays,\nDiminishing brings it near,\nDiminishing to exhaustion,\nOnly then attaining its extreme.\n\nAlready calling it One,\nYet still reaching Three—\nHow much more so if its origin is not One,\nAnd the Dao could be approached?\n\nDiminishing to benefit—\nThis is no empty saying.\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach—\nNot forcing others to follow me,\nYet using natural principle,\nUpholding its highest truth:\nConforming brings fortune,\nDefying brings calamity.\nThus when people teach,\nDefying brings their own calamity—\nJust as I teach people not to defy.\n\nThe forceful and rigid do not meet a good end.\nI will take this as my teacher.\nThe forceful and rigid\nWill not meet a good end.\nIf people teach as forceful and rigid,\nThen it is as I teach people not to be forceful and rigid.\nShall I raise the forceful and rigid’s failure to teach?\nIf it is said that conforming to my teaching brings fortune,\nThen those who defy my teaching\nAre precisely those who can serve as my teacher.\n\n**Chapter 43:**\nThe softest under heaven\nOvercomes the hardest under heaven—\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 44:**\nQi permeates everywhere without obstruction,\nWater flows through everything without hindrance—\nThis is the Dao of the *jing* (經).\nWithout obstruction, there is no gap—\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (無為).\n\nThe emptiness of *wu* (虚),\nThe weakness of *ruo* (柔弱),\nYet nothing they cannot traverse.\nThere is nothing they cannot exhaust—\nThe most yielding cannot be bent.\nBy this, I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew under heaven can attain it.\n\n**Chapter 45:**\nThe greatest completion seems incomplete,\nYet its use never fails;\nIt shapes itself with things,\nYet does not conform to a single form—\nThus it seems incomplete.\n\nThe greatest fullness seems void,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nWhen fullness is complete,\nIt rises and falls with things,\nAnd cherishes nothing—\nThus it seems void.\n\nThe greatest straightness seems crooked,\nYet it follows things to be straight—\nStraightness is not confined to one thing—\nThus it seems crooked.\n\nThe greatest skill seems clumsy,\nYet the greatest skill shapes tools through natural principle,\nWithout contriving artificiality—\nThus it seems clumsy.\n\nThe greatest eloquence seems stammering.\nYet the greatest eloquence arises from things,\nWithout personal fabrication—\nThus it seems stammering.\n\nAgitation conquers cold,\nStillness conquers heat—\nYet tranquility is the fundamental standard of the world.\n\nAgitation, after its excess,\nThen conquers cold;\nStillness, through *wuwei*,\nConquers heat—\nBy this, I know tranquility is the fundamental standard of the world.\n\nTranquility preserves the true nature of all things,\nAgitation violates the nature of things—\nThus only through tranquility can one attain the above greatness.\n\n**Chapter 46:**\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven,\nWarhorses are turned into dung for the fields;\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven,\nPeople know sufficiency, know cessation,\nAnd seek nothing from beyond—\nEach cultivates their own inner self—\nThus warhorses are turned into dung for the fields.\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail under heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nGreed is insatiable,\nThey do not cultivate their inner selves,\nEach seeks from beyond—\nThus warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than desiring more—\nThus, sufficiency in sufficiency,\nIs always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 47:**\nWithout stepping outside the door,\nOne knows the affairs of the world;\nWithout peering through the window,\nOne sees the Dao of things.\n\nAffairs have their roots, things have their masters—\nThough paths differ, they share the same return;\nThough thoughts are myriad, their intent is singular.\n\nThe Dao has its great constancy,\nPrinciple has its great conclusion—\nClinging to ancient Dao,\nOne can govern the present.\n\nThough dwelling in the present,\nOne can know the ancient origins—\nThus one need not step outside the door or peer through the window to know.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nDo not fixate on one thing,\nYet seek in the multitude.\n\nThe Dao cannot be seen,\nCannot be heard,\nCannot be grasped—\nIf one knows it,\nThere is no need to step outside the door.\n\nIf one does not know it,\nThe farther one goes, the more confused one becomes.\n\nThus the Sage does not act yet knows,\nDoes not see yet names—\nAttaining the conclusion of things,\nThus though not acting, one’s thoughts can be known.\n\nDiscerning the root of things,\nThus though not seeing, one can obtain the logic of right and wrong to name.\n\nCompletion without action.\nUnderstanding the nature of things,\nFollowing them—\nThus though not acting, one can make them complete.\n\n**Chapter 48:**\nTo study learning is to daily increase,\nAlways striving to advance one’s abilities,\nTo increase one’s practice.\n\nTo study the Dao is to daily decrease,\nAlways striving to return to emptiness.\n\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*—\n*Wuwei* is yet to do nothing,\nYet nothing it cannot do.\n\nAction leads to loss—\nThus *wuwei* is to lose nothing.\n\nTo take the world is to always do so without interference,\nMovement is always in accordance with nature.\n\nWhen interference arises,\nIt is self-made.\nThis is insufficient to take the world—\nIt is to lose the root of governance.\n\n**Chapter 49:**\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nMovement is always in accordance with nature.\n\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous,\nThe non-virtuous, I also treat as virtuous—\nVirtue is thus not lost.\nThe trustworthy, I trust,\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nTrust is thus established.\n\nThe Sage, amidst the world,\nUnifies the hearts of the people—\nAll fixate their ears and eyes,\nEach using their own cleverness.\n\nThe Sage treats them all as children,\nMaking them harmonious and without desire,\nLike newborn infants.\n\nThe heavens and earth set their positions,\nThe Sage completes their abilities—\nHuman schemes, ghostly schemes,\nAll are the abilities of the people.\n\nAbilities are given to them,\nResources are taken by them—\nAbilities are great, they become great;\nResources are noble, they become noble—\nThings have their roots, affairs have their masters.\n\nThus one can wear the crown and sash,\nFill their eyes with ornaments,\nYet not fear deceit;\nStuff their ears with coarse cloth,\nYet not grieve from insult—\nWhy labor one’s own cleverness\nTo discern the emotions of the people?\n\nIf one uses cleverness to discern things,\nThings will also vie with their cleverness in response.\nIf one uses distrust to discern things,\nThings will also vie with their distrust in response.\n\nThe hearts of the world are not necessarily the same,\nYet if their responses dare not differ,\nNone will dare to use their own cleverness.\n\nGreat indeed is the harm of cleverness—\nNone greater than using one’s cleverness.\n\nIf one’s cleverness does not surpass others,\nYet stands in the realm of contention—\nIt will reach its limits;\nIf one’s strength does not surpass others,\nYet stands in the realm of struggle—\nIt will be in peril.\n\nNone can make others refrain from using their cleverness or strength against you—\nThus you confront one with your own,\nWhile others confront you with thousands and ten-thousands.\n\nIf one multiplies laws and penalties,\nBlocks paths and attacks hidden dwellings,\nThen all things lose their natural course,\nAnd the people abandon their hands and feet.\n\nThe birds are in chaos above,\nThe fish are in chaos below—\nThus the Sage, regarding the world,\n**shēsè** *[1]* his heart, with no fixed master.\nHe acts with a **húnxīn** *[2]* for the world,\nHis intent nowhere directed, his will nowhere attached.\n\nHe discerns nothing—\nWhy should the people avoid him?\nHe demands nothing—\nWhy should the people obey him?\nWith no avoidance and no compliance,\nNone dare fail to use their own **qíng** *[3]*.\n\nWhen people act without constraint,\nThey abandon what they can do to do what they cannot,\nThey abandon what they excel at to do what they lack.\n\nThus, those who speak say what they know,\nThose who act do what they are able—\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes upon their own affairs,\nAnd I simply nurture them like children.\n\n**Chapter Fifty:**\nLife emerges from death,\nThe realm of life, the realm of death.\nThose who cling to life alone—thirteen in ten *[4]*\nThose who cling to death alone—thirteen in ten,\nAnd those who live yet are drawn into the realm of death—thirteen in ten.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the excess of life’s vitality.\n\nIt is said: One who masters life well,\nWalks on land yet meets no **rìhú** *[5]* (rhinoceros and tigers),\nEnters battle yet is not struck by weapons or blades.\nThe **rì** *[6]* has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe **hú** has no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons have no place to lodge their edges.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no realm of death.\n\n---\n\n「十有三，犹云十分有三分。\nTaking thirteen in ten,\nIt is as if saying ten parts with three fractions.\n\n取其生道，全生之极，十分有三耳。\nTaking the Dao of life,\nPreserving life to its utmost—\nTen parts with three fractions.\n\n取死之道，全死之极，十分亦有三耳。\nTaking the Dao of death,\nPreserving death to its utmost—\nTen parts with three fractions as well.\n\n而民生生之厚，更之无生之地焉。\nYet the people’s excess of life’s vitality\nDrives them to the realm where life ceases.\n\n善摄生者，无以生为生，故无死地也。\nThose who master life well,\nDo not cling to life for life—\nThus, there is no realm of death.\n\n器之害者，莫甚乎戈兵。\nThe greatest harm of weapons\nIs none more severe than spears and blades.\n\n兽之害者，莫甚乎兕虎。\nThe greatest harm of beasts\nIs none more severe than rhinoceros and tigers.\n\n而令兵戈无所容其锋刃，虎兕无所措其爪角，\nYet when spears and blades have no place to lodge their edges,\nAnd rhinoceros and tigers no place to strike with claws and horns,\n\n斯诚不以欲累其身者也，何死地之有乎？\nThis is truly one who does not burden himself with desires—\nHow could there be a realm of death?\n\n夫蚖蟺以渊为浅，而凿穴其中；\nThe *yǎnwù* (salamander and tortoise) *[7]*\nTreat the depths as shallow,\nAnd dig their holes within.\n\n鹰鹯以山为卑，而增巢其上。\nThe *yīngdiāo* (eagle and falcon) *[8]*\nTreat the mountains as low,\nAnd build their nests upon them.\n\n矰缴不能及，网罟不能到，\nTheir snares cannot reach,\nTheir nets cannot ensnare—\n\n可谓处於无死地矣。\nOne may say they dwell in the realm of no death.\n\n然而卒以甘饵，乃入於无生之地，\nYet in the end, with sweet bait,\nThey enter the realm where life ceases—\n\n岂非生生之厚乎？\nIs this not the excess of life’s vitality?\n\n故物苟不以求离其本，不以欲渝其真，\nThus, if things do not seek to depart from their root,\nNor do they corrupt their true nature through desire,\n\n虽入军而不害，陆行而不可犯也。\nEven in battle, they are unharmed,\nAnd walking on land, they cannot be assailed.\n\n赤子之可则而贵，信矣。」\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One:**\nThe Dao gives birth to life,\nVirtue nurtures and sustains it,\nThings take their form from it,\nAnd circumstances bring them to

paths.*\n*The **Dao/Way** is vast and unobstructed,*\n*Yet the people cling to shortcuts and evils—*\n*How much more so when one imposes bestowal,*\n*To block the **Dao/Way**’s true course?*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*The **Dao/Way** is exceedingly smooth and even,*\n*Yet the people prefer narrow paths.*\n\n*The court is exceedingly pristine,*\n*The palace halls are spotless.*\n*The fields are overgrown with weeds,*\n*The granaries are empty.*\n*When the court is exceedingly pristine,*\n*The fields grow wild,*\n*The granaries stand void.*\n*Thus, one’s actions bring harm to the multitude.*\n\n*Wearing ornate attire,*\n*Bearing sharp blades,*\n*Feasting on delicacies,*\n*Hoarding wealth beyond need—*\n*This is called **dào kuā** *(盗夸, \"robbery and ostentation\")*,*\n*Not the **Dao/Way** indeed.*\n\n*All things, if gained not through their proper **Dao/Way**,*\n*Are but crookedness—*\n*Crookedness is robbery.*\n*Ostentation, if not gained through their proper **Dao/Way**,*\n*Is usurpation.*\n*Thus, to enumerate what is not the **Dao/Way***\n*Is to clarify robbery and ostentation.*\n\nChapter 54: *The well-built does not topple,*\n*For it grounds its roots before nurturing its branches,*\n*Thus it does not topple.*\n*The well-embracing does not slip,*\n*Not greedy for excess,*\n*Balancing what it can sustain,*\n*Thus it does not slip.*\n*One’s descendants continue the rites of sacrifice,*\n*If they pass down this **Dao/Way** to perform sacrifices,*\n*Then the rites will not cease.*\n\n*Cultivating it in oneself,*\n*Its **virtue/power** *(德)* becomes true;*\n*Cultivating it in the family,*\n*Its **virtue/power** overflows;*\n*Thus, it extends from oneself to others.*\n*Cultivate it in the body, and it is true;*\n*Cultivate it in the home, and it abounds.*\n*If cultivation does not falter,*\n*The bestowal grows ever greater.*\n*Cultivating it in the village,*\n*Its **virtue/power** becomes enduring;*\n*Cultivating it in the state,*\n*Its **virtue/power** becomes abundant;*\n*Cultivating it throughout the world,*\n*Its **virtue/power** becomes universal.*\n*Thus, to observe oneself through oneself,*\n*To observe the family through the family,*\n*To observe the village through the village,*\n*To observe the state through the state—*\n*All these follow the same principle.*\n*To observe the world through the world,*\n*With the hearts of the world’s people,*\n*To discern the **Dao/Way** of the world.*\n*The **Dao/Way** of the world—*\n*Its fortune and calamity,*\n*Its joy and sorrow—*\n*All follow the **Dao/Way** of humanity.*\n\n*How do I know the world’s constancy?*\n*By this.*\n*This refers to the teachings above.*\n*If one asks how I know the world,*\n*It is by examining oneself,*\n*Not by seeking knowledge from without.*\n*This is what is meant by*\n*\"Knowing the world without leaving one’s door.\"*\n\nChapter 55: *The depth of **virtue/power** *(德)* is like that of a newborn babe,*\n*Where bees, wasps, centipedes, and snakes do not sting,*\n*Where fierce beasts do not seize,*\n*Where birds of prey do not clutch.*\n*The newborn babe has no desires, no cravings,*\n*And does not offend against all things,*\n*Thus venomous creatures do not harm it.*\n*Those with deep **virtue/power***\n*Do not offend against things,*\n*Thus nothing can harm their completeness.*\n\n*Though bones are frail and sinews soft,*\n*Yet its grasp is firm.*\n*Because of its softness and frailty,*\n*Its hold is all the more unyielding.*\n*Though it knows not the union of male and female,*\n*Yet it grows fully.*\n*Fully—meaning long in life.*\n*Nothing harms its body,*\n*Thus it grows fully and long.*\n\n*Those with deep **virtue/power***\n*Are not harmed by things,*\n*Nor does their truth falter,*\n*For softness and frailty do not contend,*\n*Yet are never crushed or broken.*\n*This is the utmost **harmony** *(和).*\n\n*Crying all day without hoarseness,*\n*It has no contentious or desiring heart,*\n*Thus it cries all day without hoarseness.*\n\n*Perfect **harmony** is perfect constancy,*\n*For all things find constancy in **harmony**,*\n*Thus knowing **harmony** brings constancy.*\n*Knowing constancy is clarity,*\n*Neither dim nor bright,*\n*Neither warm nor cold—*\n*This is constancy.*\n*That which has no form yet cannot be seen is called clarity.*\n\n*Excessive nurturing brings misfortune,*\n*Nurturing cannot benefit life—*\n*To nurture is to hasten its decline.*\n*The heart that directs **qi** is called strength.*\n*The heart should have no interference,*\n*Yet to direct **qi** is to force strength.*\n*When things are over-nurtured, they age prematurely,*\n*This is called unnatural—*\n*Unnatural brings early decay.*\n\nChapter 56: *The wise do not speak,*\n*For they follow nature.*\n*Those who speak are not wise,*\n*For they create the origins of affairs.*\n\n*To block its **fuì** *(兑, \"radiance/response\"),*\n*To close its **mén** *(门, \"gate/opening\"),*\n*To blunt its sharpness,*\n*Is to hoard and guard its essence.*\n\n*To dissolve its divisions,*\n*Is to remove the roots of contention.*\n*To harmonize its **guāng** *(光, radiance/splendor),*\n*To display nothing in particular,*\n*Then things will have no partial strife.*\n*To blend with its dust,*\n*To hold no particular lowliness,*\n*Then things will have no partial shame.*\n\n*This is called **Xuán Tóng** *(玄同, \"mysterious unity\").*\n*Thus, it cannot be grasped as near,*\n*Nor can it be grasped as distant;*\n*If it can be grasped as near,*\n*Then it can be grasped as distant.*\n*It cannot be grasped for gain,*\n*Nor can it be grasped for harm;*\n*If it can be grasped for gain,*\n*Then it can be grasped for harm.*\n*It cannot be grasped as noble,*\n*Nor can it be grasped as base;*\n*If it can be grasped as noble,*\n*Then it can be grasped as base.*\n\n*Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.*\n*Nothing can be added to it.*\n\nChapter 57: *To govern the state with uprightness,*\n*To employ the **qí** *(奇, \"unconventional/strategic\")* in warfare,*\n*To take the world with non-action.*\n\n*To govern the state with the **Dao/Way** is to exalt its foundation,*\n*Thus the people rest—*\n*To govern with uprightness,*\n*Then the **qí** and the **zhèng** *(正, \"upright\")* arise,*\n*And to take the world with non-action*\n*Is indeed possible.*\n*The previous chapter states:*\n*\"Those who take the world*\n*Always act with non-action.\"*\n*When they have affairs,*\n*Yet still lack the means to take the world,*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"To govern the state with uprightness,*\n*Then one cannot take the world,*\n*Yet one must employ the **qí** in warfare.\"*\n\n*To govern the state with the **Dao/Way***\n*Exalts the foundation to restrain excess,*\n*Yet to govern with uprightness*\n*Establishes distinctions to attack what is extraneous.*\n*If the foundation is not exalted,*\n*And the excess is shallow,*\n*The people have nothing to reach,*\n*Thus one must resort to employing the **qí** in warfare.*\n\n*How do I know this to be so?*\n*By this.»\n\nThe world abounds in **taboos and prohibitions** *(忌讳, \"avoidances and restrictions\")*, yet the people grow ever poorer;\nThe people possess many **sharp implements** *(利器, \"tools of advantage\")*, yet the state grows ever more **corrupt and decadent** *(滋昏, \"increasingly chaotic\")*.\nSharp implements are all those tools by which one profits oneself.\nWhen the people grow strong, the state grows weak.\n\nWhen men are numerous in **crafts and cunning** *(技巧, \"skills and stratagems\")*, strange things proliferate;\nWhen the people abound in **wisdom and insight** *(智慧)*, **deceit and artifice** *(巧伪, \"clever falsity\")* arise,\nAnd when deceit and artifice arise, **wicked deeds** *(邪事, \"deviant matters\")* follow.\nWhen laws and decrees grow **ostentatious and explicit** *(滋彰)*, thieves and robbers multiply.\n\nTo establish uprightness and **restrain the wicked** *(息邪, \"halt the deviant\")*, yet strange warfare is employed.\nTo abound in taboos and prohibitions, desiring to **shame poverty** *(耻贫, \"disgrace impoverishment\")*, yet the people grow ever poorer.\nTo possess sharp implements, desiring to **strengthen the state** *(强国, \"fortify the realm\")*, yet the state grows ever more chaotic.\nAll these seek to **discard the root to govern the branches** *(舍本以治末, \"abandon the foundation to manage the extremities\")*,\nThus leading to these consequences.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** *(圣人)* says:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people become upright;\nI have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\nWhat the ruler desires, the people hasten to follow.\nWhat I desire, is only **non-desire** *(无欲, \"lack of desire\")*,\nYet the people also lack desire and naturally return to simplicity.\n\nThese four principles are to **exalt the foundation and restrain the extremities** *(崇本以息末)*,\nTo **revert without assault** *(不攻而使复之, \"return without confrontation\")*.\n\nIts governance is **obscure and unassuming** *(闷闷, \"dim and dim\")*, its people are **pure and unadulterated** *(淳淳, \"simple and simple\")*.\nThe **skilled ruler** *(善治政者)* holds no form, no name,\nNo affairs, no uprightness to be cited—\nDim and dim, yet ultimately reaching **great harmony** *(大治, \"grand order\")*,\nThus it is said: *\"Its governance is dim and dim.\"*\n\nIts people have nothing to **contend or vie** *(争竞, \"strive and compete\")*,\nWide and generous, simple and unadulterated—\nThus it is said: *\"Its people are simple and simple.\"*\n\nIts governance is **scrutinous and meticulous** *(察察, \"examining and examining\")*,\nIts people are **deficient and lacking** *(缺缺, \"wanting and wanting\")*.\nTo **establish legal punishments and names** *(立刑名, \"set punishments and titles\")*,\nTo **clarify rewards and punishments** *(明赏罚, \"illuminate rewards and penalties\")*,\nTo **restrain deceit and artifice** *(检奸伪, \"inspect deceit and falsity\")*—\nThus it is said: *\"Its governance is examining and examining.\"*\n\nDistinctions are **partitioned and analyzed** *(殊类分析, \"differences classified and dissected\")*,\nThe people grow deceitful and vie—\nThus it is said: *\"Its people are wanting and wanting.\"*\n\n**Calamity** *(祸)*, ah! It leans upon **fortune** *(福)*;\n**Fortune**, ah! It harbors **calamity** *(祸)*.\nWho knows their **limit** *(极, \"extreme\")*?\nIt is **non-action** *(无正, \"lack of uprightness\")*.\n\nWho knows the **extreme of good governance** *(善治之极)*?\nOnly that which cannot be cited as uprightness,\nCannot be named as form—\nDim and dim, yet the world naturally transforms—\nThis is its extreme.\n\n**Uprightness** *(正)* again becomes **strange** *(奇)*;\nTo govern with uprightness, one must then employ strange warfare—\nThus it is said: *\"Uprightness again becomes strange.\"*\n\n**Goodness** *(善)* again becomes **evil** *(妖)*;\nTo establish goodness and **harmonize all things** *(和万物, \"conciliate myriad beings\")*,\nYet then **evil** *(妖)* arises as a **calamity** *(患)*.\n\nThe **delusion of men** *(人之迷)* is indeed long.\nWho knows the **extreme of good governance** *(善治之极)*?\nOnly that which cannot be cited as uprightness,\nCannot be named as form—\nDim and dim, yet the world naturally transforms—\nThis is its extreme.\n\n**The Sage** *(圣人)* is **square yet does not cut** *(方而不割)*,\nGuiding things with **rectitude** *(方, \"squareness\")*,\nDiscarding their **deviance** *(邪, \"deviant\")*.\nNot cutting things with **rectitude**—\nThis is called: *\"The great rectitude has no corners.\"*\n\n**Moderate yet not harsh** *(廉而不剧)*,\nComfortable, **clear and moderate** *(清康, \"pure and tranquil\")*.\nHarsh, **injury** *(剧, \"excessive\")*—\nTo **cleanse and moderate** *(清康)* the people,\nTo **purify and moderate** *(清民, \"clarify the populace\")*,\nTo **remove their deviance** *(去其邪)*,\nTo **remove their filth** *(去其污)*—\nYet not to **severely harm** *(刿伤, \"maim and injure\")* with cleansing and moderation.\n\n**Straightforward yet not domineering** *(直而不肆)*,\nGuiding things with **straightness** *(直, \"directness\")*,\nTo **remove their eccentricity** *(去其僻, \"eliminate their crookedness\")*,\nYet not to **provoke unrest** *(激沸, \"agitate and boil\")* with straightness—\nThis is called: *\"Directness is like bending.\"*\n\n**Bright yet not intimidating** *(光而不惧)*,\nIlluminating their **delusion** *(迷, \"bewilderment\")* with **radiance** *(光, \"luminosity\")*,\nYet not to **expose their hidden faults** *(求其隐匿, \"demand their concealments\")* with brightness—\nThis is called: *\"Clarifying the Dao/Way is like obscurity.\"*\n\nAll these are to **exalt the foundation and restrain the extremities** *(崇本以息末)*,\nTo **revert without assault** *(不攻而使复之)*.\n**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic** *(道德真经, \"The Classic of the Dao and Virtue\")* **commentary** *(注)* **volume three** *(卷之三)* **ends** *(竟).*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality**\n\nFrugality *(啬, \"frugality\")* is the greatest.\nNothing exceeds *(#1莫若, \"nothing surpasses\")*—\nThat is, frugality *(啬, \"frugality\")* is the farmer *(农夫, \"husbandman\")*.\nThe farmer’s cultivation of the fields *(治田, \"governing the fields\")* seeks to eliminate their **diversity** *(殊类, \"varied types\")* and return them to **uniformity** *(齐一, \"harmonized unity\")*.\nTo preserve their **natural state** *(自然, \"spontaneity\")* without **forcing their growth** *(急其荒病, \"urging their barrenness\")*,\nTo remove the causes of their **barrenness** *(荒病, \"withering ailments\")*—\nThis is to **align above with Heaven’s mandate** *(上承天命, \"upwardly honor Heaven’s decree\")* and **soothe below the people** *(下绥百姓, \"downwardly pacify the populace\")*,\nNothing surpasses this.\n\nOnly frugality *(啬, \"frugality\")* is called **early service** *(早服, \"early governance\")*.\n**Early service** *(早服, \"early governance\")*—\nThat is, **constancy** *(常, \"permanent principle\")*.\n**Early service** *(早服, \"early governance\")* is called **heavily accumulating virtue** *(重积德, \"profoundly amassing virtue\")*.\nOnly through **profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, \"profoundly amassing virtue\")*—\nNot seeking **sharp and swift results** *(不欲锐速, \"not desiring sharp speed\")*—\nThen one can **make constancy endure** *(乃能使早服其常, \"thus enable early governance to persist\")*,\nHence it is said: *Only through profoundly amassing virtue can one achieve early service.*\n\n**Profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, \"profoundly amassing virtue\")* means **nothing is unconquerable** *(无不克, \"no resistance remains\")*,\n**Nothing is unconquerable** *(无不克, \"no resistance remains\")*—\nThen **none know its limits** *(莫知其极, \"none fathom its extent\")*.\nThe **Dao/Way** *(道, \"Dao\")* is **boundless** *(无穷, \"endless\")*.\n**None know its limits** *(莫知其极, \"none fathom its extent\")*—\nThis is how one **may possess a state** *(可以有国, \"can attain a realm\")*.\nIf one **possesses a state** *(有国, \"attains a realm\")* with **limited virtue** *(有穷, \"bounded virtue\")*,\nIt is **not truly able to possess a state** *(非能有国也, \"not indeed capable of attaining a realm\")*.\nThe **foundation of possessing a state** *(有国之母, \"root of attaining a realm\")*—\nThis is how one **may endure long** *(可以长久, \"can persist long-term\")*.\nThe **reason a state is stable** *(国之所以安, \"how a realm stands firm\")*—\nIs called its **foundation** *(谓之母, \"its root\")*.\n**Profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, \"profoundly amassing virtue\")*—\nThis is to **seek only its roots** *(是唯图其根, \"merely cultivate its foundation\")*,\nThen **tend to its extremities** *(然后营末, \"afterward nurture its branches\")*,\nOnly then does one **achieve its end** *(乃得其终也, \"thus attain its fulfillment\")*.\nThis is called: *The **Dao/Way of deep roots and firm foundations** *(深根固柢, \"deep-rooted and firmly established\")*, **long life and enduring vision** *(长生久视, \"longevity and lasting insight\").*\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State, Like Cooking a Small Fish**\n\nGoverning a great state *(治大国, \"governing a great realm\")*—\nIs like cooking a small fish *(若烹小鲜, \"as if stewing a tiny fish\")*.\n**Not to disturb** *(不扰也, \"not to agitate\")*.\n**Agitation** *(躁, \"restlessness\")* brings **many calamities** *(多害, \"abundant harm\")*,\n**Calmness** *(静, \"tranquility\")* preserves **truth** *(全真, \"whole integrity\")*.\nThus, the greater the state *(其国弥大, \"the more expansive the realm\")*,\nThe more tranquil its ruler *(而其主弥静, \"the more serene its sovereign\")*,\nOnly then can one **broadly win the hearts of the people** *(然后乃能广得众心矣, \"thus widely secure the people’s loyalty\")*.\n\nIf one **rules the world with the Dao/Way** *(以道莅天下, \"governs the world through the Dao\")*,\nIts **spirits** *(其鬼, \"its numinous forces\")* are **not numinous** *(不神, \"not revered\")*.\nTo govern a great state like cooking a small fish *(治大国则若烹小鲜, \"governing a great realm as if stewing a tiny fish\")*—\nIf one **rules the world with the Dao/Way** *(以道莅天下, \"governs the world through the Dao\")*,\nThen its **spirits** *(其鬼, \"its numinous forces\")* are **not numinous** *(不神, \"not revered\")*.\nNot that its **spirits** *(其鬼, \"its numinous forces\")* are **not numinous** *(不神, \"not revered\")*—\nBut that their **numinosity** *(其神, \"their reverence\")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, \"not injure mortals\")*.\n**Numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* does **not harm spontaneity** *(不害自然也, \"not violate spontaneity\")*.\nThings **abide by spontaneity** *(物守自然, \"creatures adhere to spontaneity\")*,\nThen **numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* has **nothing to add** *(无所加, \"no place to impose\")*.\n**Numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* has **nothing to add** *(无所加, \"no place to impose\")*—\nThen **none know numinosity as numinous** *(则不知神之为神也, \"none recognize reverence as reverence\")*.\nNot that its **numinosity** *(其神, \"their reverence\")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, \"not injure mortals\")*—\nThe **Sage** *(圣人, \"Sage\")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, \"also does not injure mortals\")*.\nWhen the **Dao/Way is harmonized** *(道洽, \"the Dao is complete\")*,\nThen **numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, \"not injure mortals\")*—\nThen **none know numinosity as numinous** *(则不知神之为神也, \"none recognize reverence as reverence\")*.\nWhen the **Dao/Way is harmonized** *(道洽, \"the Dao is complete\")*—\nThe **Sage** *(圣人, \"Sage\")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, \"also does not injure mortals\")*—\nThen **none know the Sage as Sage** *(则亦不知圣人之为圣也, \"none recognize the Sage as Sage\")*.\nIt is said: *Not only do they not know numinosity as numinous,\nThey also do not know the Sage as Sage.*\n\nThose who **rely on the net of coercion** *(恃威网, \"lean on the web of authority\")* to **command things** *(以使物者, \"direct creatures\")*—\nThis is the **decline of governance** *(治之衰也, \"waning of rule\")*.\nTo **make them unaware of numinosity and sainthood** *(使不知神圣之为神圣, \"cause them to not recognize reverence and sainthood as such\")*—\nThis is the **ultimate of the Dao/Way** *(道之极也, \"apex of the Dao\")*.\nThe **two** *(两, \"the two\")*—\n**Numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* and **the Sage** *(圣人, \"Sage\")*—\n**Do not harm each other** *(不相伤, \"do not injure one another\")*,\nThus their **virtue** *(德, \"virtue\")* **returns in harmony** *(交归焉, \"intermingles and returns\")*.\n**Numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, \"not injure mortals\")*—\nThe **Sage** *(圣人, \"Sage\")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, \"also does not injure mortals\")*.\nThe **Sage** *(圣人, \"Sage\")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, \"not injure mortals\")*—\n**Numinosity** *(神, \"reverence\")* also does **not harm people** *(神亦不伤人, \"reverence also does not injure mortals\")*.\nHence it is said: *The two do not harm each other*—\n**Numinosity** and **sainthood** *(神圣, \"reverence and sainthood\")* **unify with the Dao/Way** *(合道, \"converge with the Dao\")*,\nTheir **virtue** *(交归, \"intermingling return\")* **harmonizes** *(之也, \"thus\").*\n\n**Chapter 61: Great States Are the Lowlands**\n\n「People also do not injure mortals, the Sage does not injure mortals—\nThen they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.\nIt is as though they say not only do they not know Numinosity’s way of being Numinosity,\nBut they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.\nHe who relies on the net of coercion to govern others,\nIs the decline of governance.\nHe who makes others unaware of Numinosity and sainthood as Numinosity and sainthood,\nHas reached the Dao’s ultimate expression.\n　　Thus it is said: The two do not harm each other,\nHence their virtue intermingles and returns.\nNuminosity does not harm people, the Sage also does not harm people—\nThe Sage does not harm people, Numinosity also does not harm people.\nHence it is said: The two do not harm each other,\nNuminosity and sainthood converge with the Dao,\nThus their virtue intermingles and returns.\n\n**Chapter 61: Great States Are the Lowlands**\nThe great rivers and seas dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,\nAnd thus all the streams flow toward them.\nGreat states dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,\nAnd thus all under Heaven flows toward them—\nHence it is said: *Great states are the lowlands.*\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven,\nIs where all under Heaven gathers and meets.\nThe receptive of all under Heaven,\nIs tranquil yet does not seek—\nAnd thus all things return to it.\nThe receptive always overcomes the assertive through its tranquility,\nAnd the receptive is the lowly.\nBecause of its tranquility, it can be the lowly.\nThe receptive is the female—\nThe assertive is restless, turbulent, and greedy,\nThe female is always tranquil—\nThus it overcomes the assertive.\nBecause of its tranquility, it can also be the lowly,\nHence all things return to it.\nTherefore, great states humble themselves to the lesser states—\nGreat states humble themselves, as though they say: *With the great state’s lowliness, the lesser state is taken.*\nThen the lesser state attaches to it;\nThe lesser state humbles itself to the great state,\nThen it takes the great state.\nThe great state receives it—\nThus some humble to take, some humble yet are taken.\nIt means that only through cultivating humility and lowliness\nCan one then attain what each should have.\nGreat states do not seek to encompass all under Heaven,\nLesser states do not seek to serve the great state.\nIf both attain what they desire,\nThen the greater should humble itself.\nLesser states cultivate lowliness,\nAnd thus they are preserved—\nBut they cannot make all under Heaven return to them.\nGreat states cultivate lowliness,\nAnd thus all under Heaven returns to them.\nHence it is said: *If each attains what they desire,*\n*Then the greater should humble itself.*\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\nThe Dao is the mystery of all things—\nMystery, like warmth, can shelter and shade.\nThe good person’s treasure—\nTreasure is used.\nThe unworthy person’s refuge—\nRefuge is for preservation.\nFine words can be sold,\nVenerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nIt means the Dao precedes all things,\nAnd nothing is more precious than this.\nThough there be rare treasures and jade discs with fine horses,\nNothing can match it.\nFine words can seize the market price of all goods,\nHence it is said: *Fine words can be sold.*\nVenerable conduct can respond even from a thousand miles away,\nHence it is said: *Venerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.*\nWhat of the unworthy—\nWhy should they be abandoned?\nThe unworthy should preserve the Dao to avoid being cast aside.\nHence, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,\nAnd appoints the Three Exalted Ministers—\nIt means to honor the Dao’s conduct.\nThough there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,\nThey are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\nThis is the Dao spoken of above.\nIt means that the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,\nAnd appoints the Three Exalted Ministers,\nHonors their rank, and esteems their worth—\nThis is how the Dao is preserved.\nNothing is more precious than this,\nHence though there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,\nThey are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\nThe ancients valued those who aligned with the Dao—\nWhy not say that they sought it daily,\nAnd were freed from blame?\nHence they are honored by all under Heaven.\nTo seek is to obtain,\nTo avoid blame is to be free—\nThe Dao applies everywhere,\nHence they are honored by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**\nTo act without acting,\nTo govern without governing,\nTo savor without savoring—\nTo reside in non-action,\nTo teach through silence,\nTo find flavor in serenity and simplicity,\nIs the ultimate of governance.\nGreat or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nSmall resentment is not enough to repay,\nGreat resentment is what all under Heaven would wish to punish—\nFollowing what all under Heaven agree upon,\nIs virtue.\n\nPlotting difficulty from ease,\nAnd greatness from smallness—\nAll under Heaven’s difficult tasks must arise from ease,\nAll under Heaven’s great tasks must arise from smallness.\nHence the Sage never acts in greatness,\nAnd thus can achieve greatness.\nLight promises must be few in trust,\nMany easy things must bring many difficulties—\nThus the Sage says: *Even this is difficult,*\nFor the Sage’s talent still finds difficulty in small and easy matters,\nHow much more so for those who are not the Sage’s talent,\nYet wish to neglect this?\nHence it is said: *Even this is difficult.*\nThus there will never be difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: The Art of Preserving the End**\nIts stability is easily maintained,\nIts beginnings are easily planned—\nBecause of its stability, one does not forget peril,\nMaintaining it does not forget ruin,\nPlanning it without effort or strain,\nHence it is said: *easily.*\nIts frailty is easily floated upon,\nIts subtlety is easily dispersed—\nThough it may be lost, no one will take it,\nBecause of its frailty and subtlety,\nIt is not sufficient to accomplish great deeds,\nHence it is said: *easily.*\nThese four sayings all discuss guarding the end.\nOne cannot neglect what is without maintaining it,\nCannot neglect what is subtle because it will disperse.\nWithout maintaining what is not, it will generate what is;\nWithout dispersing what is subtle, it will generate what is great.\nHence, consider the end’s calamity like the beginning’s ruin,\nAnd there will be no failed undertakings.\nAct before there is what to act upon—\nIt means its stability and unseen beginnings.\nGovern before there is disorder—\nIt means its frailty and subtlety.\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper brings loss.\nOne should guard the end to eliminate frailty,\nGuard frailty to eliminate disorder,\nAnd thus apply non-action as governance,\nAnd non-grasping as non-loss.\nThis reverses the origin of undertakings,\nAnd cleverly creates what should not be—\nHence ruin and loss.\nThus the Sage acts without acting,\nAnd thus there is no ruin;\nDoes not grasp,\nAnd thus there is no loss.\nThe people’s undertakings,\nOften fail just as they are about to succeed—\nBecause they do not guard the end.\nGuarding the end like the beginning,\nWealth will not bring ruin.\nThus the Sage desires what he does not desire,\nDoes not prize what is hard to obtain—\nLoves what is easy, though slight,\nAnd strives for what is worth contesting.\nWhat is hard to obtain, though small,\nWill give rise to thieves—\nLearning without learning,\nAgainst the errors of the multitude—\nThose who are learned yet do not learn,\nAre naturally so.\nIt is like those who do not learn#2—\nErrors.\nHence learning without learning,\nTo correct the errors of the multitude,\nTo assist the self-so of all things\nYet not daring to act.»\n\nThe cunning and deceitful are many—\nThus the people are hard to govern.\nTo rule the realm with cleverness,\nIs the realm’s ruin—\nFor cleverness is but governance itself.\nWhen one rules with cleverness,\nIt is called ruin—\nThus it is called cleverness.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their cleverness is excessive.\nThe proper course is to block the senses,\nClose the gates,\nAnd let them be without knowledge,\nWithout desire—\nYet stir their wicked hearts with clever schemes.\nOnce stirred, then use subtle arts\nTo guard against their deceit.\nWhen the people know these arts,\nThey evade and avoid them,\nPlotting in secret, their deceit grows ever more.\nThus it is said:\nTo rule with cleverness is the realm’s ruin.\n\nNot to rule with cleverness—\nThis is the realm’s blessing.\nTo know these two is to grasp the standard.\nEver knowing the standard,\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\nThe Mysterious Virtue is profound and vast—\nThe standard, the same—\nWhat is shared by past and present must not be abandoned.\nTo know the standard is to grasp the Mysterious Virtue,\nProfound and vast—\nReturning to its origin,\nRestoring its truth—\nThen attaining the Great Harmony.\n\nThe rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys because they excel in humbling themselves, thus they are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys. Therefore, the Sage who wishes to lead the people must speak to them in humility; who wishes to go before the people must place himself behind them. Thus, the Sage, though in high station, is not burdensome to the people; though he leads, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in promoting him without tiring. Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.\n\nAll under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems ineffectual. Precisely because it is great, it seems ineffectual. If it were ineffectual, it would have long since been diminished. If it were diminished, it would have long been diminished. To be ineffectual is to lose what makes it great—thus it is said: if it were ineffectual, it would have long since been diminished.\n\nI possess three treasures; guard them and preserve them:\nFirst, compassion;\nSecond, frugality;\nThird, not daring to be first under heaven.\n\nThrough compassion, one can be courageous.\nCompassion, when deployed, conquers;\nWhen held firm, it is steadfast—\nThus one can be courageous.\n\nThrough frugality, one can be expansive.\nBy moderating and conserving, one does not exhaust the world—\nThus one can be expansive.\n\nNot daring to be first under heaven,\nOne can become the vessel and the leader.\nOnly by placing oneself last externally\nDoes one become the refuge for all things,\nThen one can truly establish oneself as the vessel,\nFor the benefit of all things,\nAs their leader.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion and yet seek courage—\nThis is to take.\nTo abandon frugality and yet seek expansiveness,\nTo abandon humility and yet seek to be first—\nThis is death.\n\nCompassion, when wielded in war, conquers.\nIt presses forward without shirking difficulty,\nThus it is upright.\nWhen held firm, it is steadfast.\nHeaven, intending to aid it, guards it with compassion.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force.\nThe warrior is the leader of the soldiers.\nForce is to exalt oneself and trample others.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage.\nHe follows without leading,\nResponds without initiating—\nThus he does not rely on rage.\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend.\nHe does not contend with others.\nThe skilled user of men places himself beneath them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of using men.\nIf one uses men yet does not place himself beneath them,\nTheir strength cannot be employed.\nThis is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient norm.\n\nWhen using arms, there is a saying:\nI dare not be the attacker but only the defender,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\nThis is called having no formation,\nYet they pursue relentlessly.\nTo repel without arms,\nTo seize without hands,\nTo grasp without weapons,\nTo cast without enemies—\nThis is to say that none can oppose it.\nTo repel without arms,\nTo grasp without weapons.\n\nNo greater calamity than to treat enemies lightly,\nLightly treating enemies nearly causes the loss of my treasures.\nIt is said: my compassion, humility, and non-contention\nAre not meant to seek invincibility under heaven.\nIf forced to the point of invincibility,\nThen this is the source of my greatest calamity.\nTreasure refers to the three treasures—\nThus it is said: nearly losing my treasures.\n\nWhen armies clash, the compassionate prevail.\n*Anting* means to raise,\n*Jia* means to confront.\nThe compassionate must cherish each other and not pursue gain or avoid harm—\nThus they must prevail.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\nOne can know them without leaving one’s door or peering through the window—\nThus it is said: very easy to know.\nWithout action, yet accomplished—\nThus it is said: very easy to practice.\nSome are agitated by desires—\nThus it is said: none can know them.\nOthers are bewildered by honor and profit—\nThus it is said: none can practice them.\n\nWords have their root,\nAffairs have their master.\nThe root is the root of all things.\nThe master is the master of all things.\nOnly those without knowledge fail to know me.\nBecause their words have a root and their affairs have a master,\nThose with knowledge cannot fail to know me.\n\nFew know me—\nThus I am precious.\nOnly because I am profound,\nAre those who know me few.\nThe fewer who know me,\nThe more unmatched I am—\nThus it is said: few know me, thus I am precious.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade.\nWearing coarse cloth means blending with the dust.\nCherishing jade means treasuring the true.\nThe Sage’s difficulty in being known lies in blending with the dust yet not differing,\nCherishing jade yet not changing—\nThus he is difficult to know and yet precious.\n\nThe unknown knows—this is sickness.\nThe unknown knows its own insufficiency—this is sickness.\nOnly by recognizing sickness as sickness\nDoes one avoid sickness.\nThe Sage does not fall ill,\nFor he recognizes sickness as sickness—\nThus he does not fall ill.\n\nWhen the people do not fear great authority,\nThen great authority arrives.\nDo not trifle with what sustains you,\nDo not exhaust what nourishes you.\nTo dwell in stillness and non-action—this is *residence*.\nTo yield humbly without excess—this is *nourishment*.\nAbandoning stillness and non-action,\nPursuing restless desires,\nDiscarding humility and yielding to authority—\nThen things grow chaotic and the people stray.\nAuthority loses its power to govern,\nThe people cannot endure its rule,\nAnd thus the upper and lower ranks collapse.\nHeaven’s retribution is imminent—\nHence it is said: *When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives.*\n\nDo not trifle with what sustains you,\nDo not exhaust what nourishes you—\nThis means authority cannot be wielded recklessly.\nOnly by not exhausting,\nDoes one not exhaust oneself.\nNot exhausting oneself,\nThus none under Heaven will exhaust you.\nTherefore, the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nDoes not flaunt what he knows,\nLest his brilliance and authority be misused.\nHe cherishes himself without arrogance,\nFor arrogance invites contempt and exhaustion of what sustains.\nThus he discards that and embraces this.\n\n「When one is bold yet daring, he will be slain,\nYet he cannot be said to die justly.\nWhen one is bold yet does not dare, he will live—\nHis fate is aligned with the Dao.\nThese two paths—one brings gain, the other harm.\nBoth are bold, yet their application differs,\nAnd so their outcomes diverge—hence it is said: *some bring gain, others harm.*\nWhat Heaven abhors—who understands its reason?\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\nWho, indeed?—who can fathom Heaven’s abhorred intent?\nOnly the Sage.\nThe Sage’s wisdom still struggles with daring boldness,\nMuch less those without the Sage’s wisdom who would attempt it—\nHence it is said: *he finds it difficult.*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven does not contend yet prevails,\nThough Heaven does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with it.\nIt does not speak yet responds well,\nFavor brings fortune, opposition brings misfortune—\nThus it does not speak yet responds well.\nIt does not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nAnd when it dwells below, all things return to it.\nModest yet skilled in planning,\nIt observes omens and discerns fortune and misfortune,\nPrepares sincerity before events unfold,\nAnd remains secure without forgetting peril.\nIt plans even before being summoned—\nHence it is said: *modest yet skilled in planning.*\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it never fails to ensnare.\n**Chapter 74**\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you threaten them with death?\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely are deemed odd,\nThen I can seize and kill them—who would dare?\nStrange, deceitful, and disruptive actions that unsettle the masses are called *odd*.\nThose who habitually execute killings do so.\nThe executors of death,\nAre those who act as substitutes for the great carpenter’s axe.\nSubstitutes for the great carpenter’s axe,\nRarely fail to injure their own hands.\nThey are the objects of hatred for those who oppose or comply—\nHence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*\nThe unvirtuous,\nAre what people detest—\nHence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*\n**Chapter 75**\n\nThe people’s hunger,\nArises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed,\nArises from their rulers’ excessive actions.\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s disregard for death,\nArises from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life.\nThus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not use life as a means,\nAre wiser than those who value life.\nIt is said that the people’s depravity and the chaos in governance,\nAll stem from the rulers, not from the ruled.\nThe people follow their rulers.\n**Chapter 76**\n\nHumans, when born, are soft and weak,\nBut when they die, they become hard and strong.\nAll things, grass and wood, when born, are soft and brittle,\nBut when they die, they wither and decay—\nThus, the hard and strong belong to death,\nAnd the soft and weak belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies cannot conquer,\nFor those who rely on strength to oppress the world,\nAre what all things abhor—\nThus they cannot prevail.\nTrees become rigid when they are strong,\nFor they are subjected to external forces.\nStrength rooted in humility is the foundation,\nAnd weakness rooted in arrogance is the branch.\n**Chapter 77**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven—is it like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe abundant are diminished, the scarce are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to nourish the scarce,\nBut human ways are not so—\nOnly by aligning with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nCan one encompass all things.\nIf one follows the Dao of Heaven,\nAnd measures themselves by human standards,\nThen each will have their own place,\nAnd none can equal the others.\nIf one is only without self and without private interest,\nAnd returns to the natural—\nThen alone can they align with Heaven and Earth in virtue.\nDiminish the scarce to nourish the abundant—\nWho can have abundance to nourish all under Heaven?\nOnly those who possess the Dao.\nThus the Sage acts yet does not rely on it,\nAchieves yet does not dwell in it—\nHe does not wish to display his virtue to equalize the world.\nIt is said that only those who can fully embrace excess and deplete what is lacking,\nSupplement what is present to fill what is absent,\nBlending their light with dust and harmonizing with the world,\nCan truly equalize all things—\nThis is the Dao alone.\nThus the Sage does not wish to show his virtue to equalize the world.\n**Chapter 78**\n\nNone under Heaven are as soft and weak as water,\nYet none can conquer what is hard and strong.\nIts softness cannot be replaced.\n*Water’s softness*, it is said,\nIs such that no thing can replace it.\nThe weak overcoming the strong,\nThe soft overcoming the rigid—\nNone under Heaven do not know,\nYet none can practice it.\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state,\nIs to be the true guardian of its altars and grains.\"*\n*\"To bear the state’s misfortunes,\nIs to be the true ruler of all under Heaven.\"*\nCorrect words as if they were reversed.\n**Chapter 79**\n\nTo reconcile great grudges, there must remain lingering resentment—\nFor when the principle is not clarified at their root,\nAnd virtue is used to reconcile them once they have arisen,\nThe harm is not undone,\nAnd so lingering resentment remains.\nHow then can this be called good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nFor the left contract guards against where resentment arises.\nYet he does not blame others.\n\nThe virtuous oversee the contract,\nFor the virtuous in mind ponder its terms,\nPreventing resentment before blaming others.\n\nThe unvirtuous oversee the punishment,\nFor punishment is the reckoning of others’ faults.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites,\nYet it always sides with the good.\n**Chapter 80**\n\nIn small states with few people,\nThough the state is small and the people few,\nThey may yet return to the ancient ways—\nHow much more so in great states with many?\nThus, the Sage speaks of small states.\n\nLet them possess tenfold or hundredfold tools,\nYet not use them—\nFor though the people have tenfold or hundredfold tools,\nIf they have no need for them,\nWhat cause is there for want?\n\nLet them value death and not wander far.\nLet them be without use—\nTreasure their bodies alone,\nUncovetous of wealth and bribes,\nThus each remains content in their place,\nValuing death and not wandering far.\n\nThough they have chariots and boats,\nThey have no need to ride them;\nThough they have armor and arms,\nThey have no need to array them.\n\n**Chapter 81**\n\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\nLet them find their food sweet,\nTheir garments fine,\nTheir dwellings secure,\nTheir customs joyous.\nNeighboring states gaze upon one another,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them,\nYet the people live out their days to old age\nWithout visiting one another.\nThey seek nothing.\n\n**Chapter 81**\n\nFaithful words lack beauty,\nFor truth lies in simplicity.\nBeautiful words lack faith,\nFor their root is in artifice.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nFor those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned,\nFor their essence lies in singularity.\nThe learned do not know.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard,\nFor without selfishness, virtue suffices.\nThey give only to the good,\nTrusting in the Way and doing nothing more.\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess.\nThings return to them naturally.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nFor its motion ever brings forth and completes.\nThe Sage’s Way acts without contention,\nFollowing Heaven’s benefit and causing no injury.\n\n---\n*The Dao De Jing (Laozi) Annotated, Volume Four, ends here.*\n\n---\n**Annotations (as per original text):**\n#1 *\"Mo ruo\"* – Original reads *\"Mo ru\"* (\"not as\"), corrected to *\"Mo ruo\"* (\"nothing surpasses\") per Zhang’s text.\n#2 *\"Yu yu bu xue zhe\"* – *\"Bu\"* (not) may be a redundant character.\n#3 *\"Li\"* – Original reads *\"Sui\"* (\"though\"), corrected to *\"Li\"* (\"separate\") per Zhang’s text.\n#4 *\"Shi dai da jiang si\"* – *\"Dai\"* (replace) was originally omitted, added from Zhang’s text.\n#5 *\"Wei ni shun zhe zhi suo wu fen ye\"* – Likely a misplaced phrase; should read: *\"For the perverse are what the compliant despise.\"*\n\nThe origins of this work are akin to the tradition of Yan Junping’s *Zhǐguī*, for it holds that benevolence and righteousness, along with ritual propriety, cannot be fully realized without the Way. Heaven and all things derive from the One—how much more so does this apply to the *Dao De Jing*? Indeed, all scholars ought to recognize this truth.\n\nFrom this, I came to understand that Wang Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing* was profound, while his engagement with the *Yijing* was superficial. His interpretations of the *Yijing* often drew upon the principles of the *Dao De Jing*, yet the *Dao De Jing* required no such support from the *Yijing*. The traces of excess and deficiency are plainly evident.\n\nAlas, how arduous is the pursuit of learning! Bi knew that fine arms are ominous instruments, yet when it came to victory in war, he treated it with funeral rites—this was not the teaching of Laozi, but rather the words of the Yellow River Master, who said: *\"One who is always good at saving people thus abandons none; one who is always good at saving things thus discards none.\"* This passage does not appear in the ancient text, yet thanks to Fu Yi’s discernment, it was clarified.\n\nStill, Bi titled this work the *Dao De Jing*, without distinguishing between *Dao* and *De* in their order, which remains close to the ancient tradition. Yet his text contains many errors and contradictions, some passages nearly unreadable—truly lamentable.\n\nI have often said that Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing*, Zhang Huan’s of the *Liezi*, Guo Xiang’s of the *Zhuangzi*, Du Yu’s of the *Zuozhuan*, Fan Ning’s of the *Guliang*, Mao Qeng’s of the *Shijing*, and Guo Pu’s of the *ErYa*—each perfected a singular school of thought. Though later scholars have followed, none have surpassed them.\n\nHaving transcribed Bi’s commentary and recorded these observations, I note this in the *Zhenghe* year of *Yiwu* (1115), the tenth month, on the *Dingchou* day, at Songshan, by the humble Zhào Shuò, then in exile at Fu Prefecture.\n\nI, Xiong Ke, have also reverently recited the words of the *Xianping* era: *\"The Dao De Jing is the essential guide for governing the world. Though Emperor Ming’s interpretations are brilliant and worthy of admiration, Wang Bi’s annotations are concise yet profound, truly capturing Laozi’s essence of purity and tranquility.\"* Since then, I have diligently sought Bi’s commentary, which is now rare in the present age. It was long before I obtained it, and in my former post as prefectural scholar of Jianning, I had it published.\n\nLater, I acquired the annotated edition by Master Zhào Yǐdào, which does not separate *Dao* and *De* but arranges them as a continuous text, without chapter divisions. Delighted by its antiquity, I transcribed and preserved it. In the *Gēnyín* year of *Qiánshì* (1160), when I was assigned to teach in Jingkou, I had it engraved on wooden blocks for wider transmission.\n\nAs for the textual errors, earlier scholars could not verify them, so how dare I alter them? I leave this to those who truly understand. Recorded on the twenty-fourth day of the third month by Xiong Ke, Left Assistant Official and Professor of Jingzhou Prefecture.",

dynasty (魏正始年間)\n**Original Text:** Two volumes (sometimes four)\n**Source Edition:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正統道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category\n**Collated Edition:** Ming-era Zhang Zhixiang’s edition (浙江书局刻明張之象本, hereafter \"Zhang Edition\")\n*The Daozang edition originally lacked chapter divisions; this translation follows the standard segmented version.*\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***\nBy Wang Bi of Shanyang (山陽王弼)\n\n**Chapter 1**\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\nWhat can be spoken of as the Dao and named as the Name\nare but conventional designations—shapes imposed upon things—\nand thus are not the eternal Dao and eternal Name.\nHence, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is the eternal Dao,\nand the Name that cannot be named is the eternal Name.\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nAll things arise from the Nameless—\nthus, in its formless, nameless state, it is the origin of all things.\nWhen it takes form and receives a name,\nit nurtures and sustains them, fosters and protects them—\nthus it is their mother.\nThe Dao, though formless and nameless,\ngives rise to all things and brings them to completion,\nyet its workings remain unfathomable—\nthe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nTherefore, one must remain without desire\nto perceive its subtlety.\nFor subtlety is the extreme of the minute—\nall things begin in the minute and then take form,\nbegin in the void and then come to life.\nThus, by remaining without desire and emptiness,\none may perceive the subtlety of things in their origin.\n\nOne must also cultivate desire\nto perceive their limits.\n\"Limits\" refers to their return to the end.\nAll that exists relies on the nonexistent for its function;\ndesire’s origin lies in aligning with the Dao to achieve fulfillment.\nThus, by cultivating desire,\none may perceive the limits of things in their conclusion.\n\nThese two—origin and mother—\nemerge from the same source yet bear different names.\nThey are called the Mysterious,\nthe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\nThe two—origin and mother—\nshare a single source.\nThey emerge from the same Mysterious,\nyet their applications differ—\nat the beginning, it is called origin;\nat the end, it is called mother.\nThe Mysterious is the obscure,\nthe silent void—\nthe source of origin and mother,\nyet it cannot be named or spoken of.\nIt is called the Mysterious because it cannot be grasped,\nyet to say it is the Mysterious is not to fix it as a single entity—\nfor then the name would fail to encompass it.\nHence, it is the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.\nAll subtleties arise from this unity,\nthus it is called the gateway to all subtleties.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen evil already exists.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsound and voice harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\n\nBeauty is what the heart delights in;\nugliness is what the heart abhors.\nBeauty and ugliness are like joy and anger;\ngoodness and evil are like right and wrong.\nJoy and anger share the same root;\nright and wrong share the same gate—\nthus they cannot be exhaustively categorized.\n\nThese six pairs\nare all manifestations of the self-evident principles of Nature,\nwhich cannot be fully enumerated.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nyet Nature suffices—\naction would only bring ruin.\nHe teaches without words.\nAll things arise from it, yet he does not claim them;\nhe gives life yet does not possess;\nhe acts yet does not rely on his deeds—\nwisdom is inherent, yet to act would be deceit.\nWhen the work is complete, he does not dwell upon it.\nHe follows things in their natural use—\nthe work is accomplished by them, so he does not claim it.\nThus, by not dwelling upon it,\nit cannot be taken from him.\nIf he were to claim the work as his own,\nit could not endure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 3**\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nDo not prize difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become confused.\n\n\"Worthy\" means \"able.\"\n\"Exalt\" is the name given to praise.\n\"Prize\" is the term for elevation.\nIf only ability is entrusted, why praise?\nIf only utility is applied, why elevate?\nTo exalt the worthy is to display their name,\nto honor them beyond their capacity,\nleading to constant competition and rivalry.\nTo prize goods beyond their use\nspurs the greedy to vie for them,\ndriving them to break and enter, to risk life in theft.\nThus, if desirable things are not displayed,\nthe heart will not be disturbed.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance\nempties the mind, fills the belly—\nthe mind holds wisdom, the belly holds food;\nemptiness contains wisdom, fullness lacks knowledge.\nHe weakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nThe bones act without knowledge;\nthe will generates affairs and brings confusion.\nHe constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,\npreserving their true nature,\nso that even the wise dare not act.\n\"The wise\" refers to those who act with knowledge.\nTo act without action is to govern without failure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 4**",

kind,\ntreating all things as fodder for sacrifice.\nHeaven and Earth follow Nature,\nacting without contrivance or creation,\nletting all things govern themselves—\nthus, they are not kind.\n\nThe kind must contrive and establish,\nbestowing transformations with favor and action.\nTo contrive and establish, transformations—\nthings lose their true nature;\nto bestow with favor and action—\nthings cannot fully exist;\nthings cannot fully exist,\nand thus cannot suffice to fill their purpose.\n\nThe Earth does not grow fodder for beasts so that beasts eat fodder,\nnor does it breed dogs for men so that men eat dogs.\nIt acts without contrivance toward all things,\nyet all things find their proper use—\nnone are left unsustained.\n\nIf wisdom arises from self-assertion,\nit

sacrifice.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *huangqiú*?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.\n\n*Huang* is the bellows of *qiú*,\n*Qiú* is the reed of *huang*:\nWithin the hollow of the *huangqiú*,\nthere is no sentiment, no contrivance—\nthus, empty yet not exhausted or bent,\nmoving yet never depleted.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nit resonates with Nature—\nthus, it cannot be exhausted,\nlike the *huangqiú*.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to hold the center.\nThe more one acts,\nthe more one loses.\n\nTo plant evil in things,\nto entangle matters with words—\nis not this the path to ruin?\n\nIf one holds the *huangqiú* and adheres to the center,\nthere is no exhaustion;\nif one abandons self to follow things,\nall will be in harmony.\n\nIf the *huangqiú* intends to produce sound,\nit cannot suffice for the demands of those who blow it.\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\nThe *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit) does not die,\nthis is called the *Xuānmǔ* (Dark Mother).\nThe *Xuānmǔ*’s gate,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEnduring as though it exists,\nits use is tireless.\n\nThe *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit),\nthe center of the valley with no valley—\nformless, shadowless,\nwithout obstruction or resistance,\ndwelling low yet unmoving,\nguarding stillness without decay—\nthe valley is formed by it yet its form is unseen,\nthis is the supreme thing.\n\nDwelling low yet nameless,\nthus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth—\nenduring as though it exists,\nits use is tireless.\n\nThe gate,\nthe means by which the *Xuānmǔ* is accessed—\nrooted in its origin,\nit shares the same essence as the utmost,\nthus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo say it exists is to speak of evil,\nto say it does not exist—\nall things arise from it,\nthus it endures as though it exists.\n\nNothing fails to be formed,\nits use is effortless—\nthus it is said: \"Its use is tireless.\"\n\n**Chapter 7**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists,\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nbecause they do not generate themselves.\nIf they generate themselves,\nthey would contend with things;\nif they do not generate themselves,\nthings return to them.\nThus they can endure eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nhe sets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he can fulfill his selfishness.\n\nThe one without selfishness,\nacts without contrivance toward his body.\nHis body first, his body preserved—\nthus it is said: \"He can fulfill his selfishness.\"\n\n**Chapter 8**\n\nThe highest excellence is like water.\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where people revile—\npeople revile what is low.\nThus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no excellence like water,\nthus it is said: \"approaches.\"\n\nResiding in the finest land,\nthe heart in the most profound depths,\nbeing in harmony with goodness,\nspeaking in trust,\nacting in rectitude,\ndoing in capability,\nmoving in timely fashion—\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\ntherefore it has no grievance.\nThese words all respond to the governance of the Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter 9**\n\nTo grasp and fill—\nit is not as good as letting it be.\n\"To grasp\" means not to lose virtue/power.\nIf one does not lose virtue/power

alarm—\nThis is called *honor and disgrace bringing alarm*.\n\nHonor must bring disgrace,\nGlory must bring calamity—\nAlarm at disgrace equals alarm at glory,\nFor honor and calamity are the same.\n\nIf one in low station treats honor, disgrace, glory, and calamity as alarming,\nThen one cannot disrupt the world.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nGreat

aid.\nThe good who use the teacher\nDo so only to relieve difficulties—\nNot to seize the world with arms.\n\nWhen seizing, do not boast,\nWhen seizing, do not vaunt,\nWhen seizing, do not be proud—\nI do not hold the teacher’s Dao as superior,\nUsing it only when there is no alternative—\nWhat boasting or pride could there be?\n\nWhen seizing is inevitable,\nWhen seizing, do not force.\nThough arms are used to achieve victory\nAnd relieve difficulties,\nThe moment is not to be seized\nTo force the world.\n\nThings grow strong, then age—\nThis is called *not the Dao*,\nAnd *not the Dao* soon perishes.\nStrong means violent force arises,\nIllustrating those who use arms to force the world.\nA gusting wind does not last a morning,\nA sudden rain does not last a day—\nHence violent force must not be the Dao,\nAnd *not the Dao* soon perishes.\n\n**Chapter 31**\nFine arms are not auspicious instruments;\nThings are bewildered and hate them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman, when at rest, values the left;\nWhen using arms, values the right.\nArms are not auspicious instruments,\nNot the tools of the gentleman—\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\nCalmness and moderation are supreme.\n\nVictory yet not glorying in it,\nAnd glorying in victory—\nThis is to delight in killing.\nHe who delights in killing\nCannot fulfill his desires in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left;\nInauspicious matters honor the right.\nThe Left General is stationed on the left,\nThe Right General on the right—\nIllustrating the treatment with funeral rites.\nThe multitude of those who kill,\nAre to be mourned with sorrowful tears—\nVictory is treated with funeral rites.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nYet the world cannot subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nAll things will come as guests of their own accord.\n\nThe Dao is formless and does not bind,\nEver nameless—\nTaking the nameless as its constant,\nThus it is said: *The Dao is ever nameless.*\n\nThe Uncarved, as a thing,\nTakes the heart of non-action—\nAlso nameless.\nThus to attain the Dao,\nNothing is better than guarding the Uncarved.\n\nThe wise can subjugate others,\nThe brave can command force,\nThe skillful can be employed in tasks,\nThe strong can be given heavy burdens—\nBut the Uncarved, as a thing,\nIs indignant yet impartial,\nNear to nothingness,\nThus it is said: *None can subjugate it.*\n\nEmbrace the Uncarved as the nameless,\nDo not burden its true nature with things,\nDo not harm its divine essence with desires—\nThen things will come as guests\nAnd the Dao will be attained.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nThe people do not command it,\nYet it is evenly distributed.\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nThen sweet dew descends without seeking;\nI guard its true nature without doing,\nThen the people are evenly nourished without

      "translated_text": "Thus, even if one’s **virtue** is great and achievements vast,\nWealthy with all things in abundance—\nEach still gains its own **virtue**,\nYet cannot fully attain self-sufficiency.\n\nTherefore, Heaven cannot be the **Dao**’s burden,\nEarth cannot be its shelter,\nNor can humanity nurture all things.\n\nThough it is honored for its **non-action**,\nOne cannot abandon **non-action** as its essence.\n\nTo abandon **non-action** as its essence,\nThen one loses its greatness—\nThis is called losing the **Dao** and then having **virtue**.\n\nUsing **non-action** as a method,\n**Virtue** is its mother#1,\nSo one can act without exertion,\nYet nothing remains unattended.\n\nFrom this point onward,\nOne loses the mother of **non-action**.\n\nUnable to value **non-action** yet cherish wide benevolence,\nUnable to cherish wide benevolence yet value uprightness,\nUnable to value uprightness yet cherish ritual and respect—\nThis is called losing **virtue** and then having benevolence,\nLosing benevolence and then having righteousness,\nLosing righteousness and then having propriety.\n\nFor propriety begins with insincere loyalty and trust,\nAnd superficial simplicity without depth.\nIts censure is only on the surface,\nIts subtle intrigues hidden in contention.\n\nBenevolence and righteousness arise from within,\nYet even these are feigned—\nHow much more so when one labors over outward display and expects it to endure?\n\nThus, propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the source of chaos.\n\nThe **foreknowledge** of the past\nIs knowing what others have known.\nIt is the rank of lesser **virtue**,\nExhausting one’s wisdom to foresee,\nAnd straining one’s intellect for trivial affairs.\nThough **virtue** may seem sincere,\nCraft and deceit grow ever more refined;\nThough fame may flourish,\nIt only deepens the loss of true substance.\nLaboring yet governing in confusion,\nStriving yet bringing corruption—\nEven with all the wisdom of the sages,\nThe people suffer more.\n\nTo abandon oneself and follow things,\nThen **non-action** prevails and tranquility is achieved.\nTo cling to simplicity and naturalness,\nThen one defies conventional rules and norms.\nTo take what is gained by others,\nAnd discard what one holds—\nThis is the superficial understanding of the **Dao**,\nAnd the root of all folly.\n\nThus, if one attains the **Dao**’s mother of function,\nAll things act without resistance,\nAll affairs persist without labor.\nIts influence is not seen in form,\nIts control is not named—\nSo benevolence and righteousness may be displayed,\nAnd ritual and respect made manifest.\n\nTo bear all upon the **Dao**,\nAnd steady with the **nameless**,\nThen nothing is held in higher regard,\nNo schemes are pursued—\nEach abides by its true nature,\nAffairs are conducted with sincerity.\nThen benevolence is thick with **virtue**,\nRighteousness is upright,\nAnd ritual and respect are clear.\n\nTo abandon what bears them,\nTo forsake their origin—\nTo use their completed forms,\nTo strain one’s brilliance—\nThen benevolence is merely sincere,\nRighteousness is but contention,\nAnd propriety is mere rivalry.\n\nThus, the depth of benevolence\nIs not achieved by using benevolence alone.\nThe uprightness of righteousness\nIs not accomplished by using righteousness alone.\nThe clarity of ritual and respect\nIs not attained by using propriety alone.\n\nTo bear all upon the **Dao**,\nAnd unite with its mother—\nThen what is displayed is without higher regard,\nWhat is made manifest is without contention.\nTo use the **nameless**,\nThus names are firmly established.\nTo use the **formless**,\nThus forms are fully realized.\nTo keep the mother and preserve its child,\nTo exalt the root and lift its branches—\nThen form and name are both complete,\nAnd perversity does not arise.\nGreat beauty aligns with Heaven,\nAnd superficiality is not formed.\n\nThus, the mother must not be abandoned,\nThe root must not be lost.\nBenevolence and righteousness,\nAre born from the mother—\nYet they cannot be the mother themselves;\nForm and tools,\nAre crafted by the artisan—\nYet they cannot be the artisan themselves.\nTo abandon the mother and use its child,\nTo forsake the root and follow its branches—\nNames then have divisions,\nForms then have limits.\nThough great in extent,\nThere will be gaps;\nThough abundant in beauty,\nThere will be hidden woes.\nThe **function** lies in action itself—\nHow could it rest in mere names?\n\n**Chapter 39:** The ancient masters who attained **Oneness**—\n*Ancient*, the beginning;\n**Oneness**, the first number and the limit of things.\nEach recognizes **Oneness** in its own thing,\nThe principle by which it rules.\nAll things gain this **Oneness** to complete,\nOnce complete, they merge to dwell within.\nTo dwell within is to lose their mother.\n\nThus, they all split, decay, exhaust, and perish.\n\nHeaven gains **Oneness** and becomes clear,\nEarth gains **Oneness** and becomes settled,\nThe **spirit** gains **Oneness** and becomes agile,\nThe **grains** gain **Oneness** and become full,\nAll things gain **Oneness** and come to life,\nAnd the **sovereigns** gain **Oneness** to rule the world with sincerity.\n\nTheir attainment—\nEach gains **Oneness** to achieve clarity, settlement, agility, life, and sincerity.\n\nHeaven cannot maintain clarity without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear splitting—\n*Clarity is achieved through **Oneness**, not by using clarity to achieve clarity.*\nTo hold **Oneness** is to never lose clarity,\nTo use clarity is to fear splitting.\nThus, **Oneness** is the mother of **function**,\nAnd must not be abandoned.\n\nTherefore, all avoid using their **function**,\nFor fear of losing their root.\n\nEarth cannot maintain settlement without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear decay,\nThe **spirit** cannot maintain agility without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear exhaustion,\nThe **grains** cannot maintain fullness without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear depletion,\nAll things cannot maintain life without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear destruction,\nAnd the **sovereigns** cannot maintain noble elevation without **Oneness**,\nOr it would fear decline—\nThus, nobility lies in humility as its root,\nAnd elevation lies in lowliness as its foundation.\n\nTherefore, the **sovereigns** call themselves lone and humble,\nWithout the abundance of grains—\nIs this not humility as their root?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, though fame may be attained,\nIt is without true praise—\nNot desiring to shine like jade,\nOr be rough like stone.\nClarity cannot be valued for its clarity alone,\nFullness cannot be multiplied alone—\nNobility lies in its mother,\nYet the mother has no noble form.\nNobility is achieved by humility as its root,\nElevation by lowliness as its foundation—\nThus, though fame may be attained,\nIt is without true praise.\n\nJade and stone shine and are rough,\nTheir substance exhausted in form—\nThus, they are not desired.\n\n**Chapter 40:**

knows.\nDo not fixate on one thing,\nYet seek in the multitude.\n\nThe Dao cannot be seen,\nCannot be heard,\nCannot be grasped—\nIf one knows it,\nThere is no need to step outside the door.\n\nIf one does not know it,\nThe farther one goes, the more confused one becomes.\n\nThus the Sage does not act yet knows,\nDoes not see yet names—\nAttaining the conclusion of things,\nThus though not acting, one’s thoughts can be known.\n\nDiscerning the root of things,\nThus though not seeing, one can obtain the logic of right and wrong to name.\n\nCompletion without action.\nUnderstanding the nature of things,\nFollowing them—\nThus though not acting, one can make them complete.\n\n**Chapter 48:**\nTo study learning is to daily increase,\nAlways striving to advance one’s abilities,\nTo increase one’s practice.\n\nTo study the Dao is to daily decrease,\nAlways striving to return to emptiness.\n\nDecrease again and again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*—\n*Wuwei* is yet to do nothing,\nYet nothing it cannot do.\n\nAction leads to loss—\nThus *wuwei* is to lose nothing.\n\nTo take the world is to always do so without interference,\nMovement is always in accordance with nature.\n\nWhen interference arises,\nIt is self-made.\nThis is insufficient to take the world—\nIt is to lose the root of governance.\n\n**Chapter 49:**\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nMovement is always in accordance with nature.\n\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous,\nThe non-virtuous, I also treat as virtuous—\nVirtue is thus not lost.\nThe trustworthy, I trust,\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nTrust is thus established.\n\nThe Sage, amidst the world,\nUnifies the hearts of the people—\nAll fixate their ears and eyes,\nEach using their own cleverness.\n\nThe Sage treats them all as children,\nMaking them harmonious and without desire,\nLike newborn infants.\n\nThe heavens and earth set their positions,\nThe Sage completes their abilities—\nHuman schemes, ghostly schemes,\nAll are the abilities of the people.\n\nAbilities are given to them,\nResources are taken by them—\nAbilities are great, they become great;\nResources are noble, they become noble—\nThings have their roots, affairs have their masters.\n\nThus one can wear the crown and sash,\nFill their eyes with ornaments,\nYet not fear deceit;\nStuff their ears with coarse cloth,\nYet not grieve from insult—\nWhy labor one’s own cleverness\nTo discern the emotions of the people?\n\nIf one uses cleverness to discern things,\nThings will also vie with their cleverness in response.\nIf one uses distrust to discern things,\nThings will also vie with their distrust in response.\n\nThe hearts of the world are not necessarily the same,\nYet if their responses dare not differ,\nNone will dare to use their own cleverness.\n\nGreat indeed is the harm of cleverness—\nNone greater than using one’s cleverness.\n\nIf one’s cleverness does not surpass others,\nYet stands in the realm of contention—\nIt will reach its limits;\nIf one’s strength does not surpass others,\nYet stands in the realm of struggle—\nIt will be in peril.\n\nNone can make others refrain from using their cleverness or strength against you—\nThus you confront one with your own,\nWhile others confront you with thousands and ten-thousands.\n\nIf one multiplies laws and penalties,\nBlocks paths and attacks hidden dwellings,\nThen all things lose their natural course,\nAnd the people abandon their hands and feet.",

      "translated_text": "「People also do not injure mortals, the Sage does not injure mortals—\nThen they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.\nIt is as though they say not only do they not know Numinosity’s way of being Numinosity,\nBut they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.\nHe who relies on the net of coercion to govern others,\nIs the decline of governance.\nHe who makes others unaware of Numinosity and sainthood as Numinosity and sainthood,\nHas reached the Dao’s ultimate expression.\n　　Thus it is said: The two do not harm each other,\nHence their virtue intermingles and returns.\nNuminosity does not harm people, the Sage also does not harm people—\nThe Sage does not harm people, Numinosity also does not harm people.\nHence it is said: The two do not harm each other,\nNuminosity and sainthood converge with the Dao,\nThus their virtue intermingles and returns.\n\n**Chapter 61: Great States Are the Lowlands**\nThe great rivers and seas dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,\nAnd thus all the streams flow toward them.\nGreat states dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,\nAnd thus all under Heaven flows toward them—\nHence it is said: *Great states are the lowlands.*\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven,\nIs where all under Heaven gathers and meets.\nThe receptive of all under Heaven,\nIs tranquil yet does not seek—\nAnd thus all things return to it.\nThe receptive always overcomes the assertive through its tranquility,\nAnd the receptive is the lowly.\nBecause of its tranquility, it can be the lowly.\nThe receptive is the female—\nThe assertive is restless, turbulent, and greedy,\nThe female is always tranquil—\nThus it overcomes the assertive.\nBecause of its tranquility, it can also be the lowly,\nHence all things return to it.\nTherefore, great states humble themselves to the lesser states—\nGreat states humble themselves, as though they say: *With the great state’s lowliness, the lesser state is taken.*\nThen the lesser state attaches to it;\nThe lesser state humbles itself to the great state,\nThen it takes the great state.\nThe great state receives it—\nThus some humble to take, some humble yet are taken.\nIt means that only through cultivating humility and lowliness\nCan one then attain what each should have.\nGreat states do not seek to encompass all under Heaven,\nLesser states do not seek to serve the great state.\nIf both attain what they desire,\nThen the greater should humble itself.\nLesser states cultivate lowliness,\nAnd thus they are preserved—\nBut they cannot make all under Heaven return to them.\nGreat states cultivate lowliness,\nAnd thus all under Heaven returns to them.\nHence it is said: *If each attains what they desire,*\n*Then the greater should humble itself.*\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**\nThe Dao is the mystery of all things—\nMystery, like warmth, can shelter and shade.\nThe good person’s treasure—\nTreasure is used.\nThe unworthy person’s refuge—\nRefuge is for preservation.\nFine words can be sold,\nVenerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nIt means the Dao precedes all things,\nAnd nothing is more precious than this.\nThough there be rare treasures and jade discs with fine horses,\nNothing can match it.\nFine words can seize the market price of all goods,\nHence it is said: *Fine words can be sold.*\nVenerable conduct can respond even from a thousand miles away,\nHence it is said: *Venerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.*\nWhat of the unworthy—\nWhy should they be abandoned?\nThe unworthy should preserve the Dao to avoid being cast aside.\nHence, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,\nAnd appoints the Three Exalted Ministers—\nIt means to honor the Dao’s conduct.\nThough there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,\nThey are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\nThis is the Dao spoken of above.\nIt means that the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,\nAnd appoints the Three Exalted Ministers,\nHonors their rank, and esteems their worth—\nThis is how the Dao is preserved.\nNothing is more precious than this,\nHence though there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,\nThey are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\nThe ancients valued those who aligned with the Dao—\nWhy not say that they sought it daily,\nAnd were freed from blame?\nHence they are honored by all under Heaven.\nTo seek is to obtain,\nTo avoid blame is to be free—\nThe Dao applies everywhere,\nHence they are honored by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**\nTo act without acting,\nTo govern without governing,\nTo savor without savoring—\nTo reside in non-action,\nTo teach through silence,\nTo find flavor in serenity and simplicity,\nIs the ultimate of governance.\nGreat or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nSmall resentment is not enough to repay,\nGreat resentment is what all under Heaven would wish to punish—\nFollowing what all under Heaven agree upon,\nIs virtue.\n\nPlotting difficulty from ease,\nAnd greatness from smallness—\nAll under Heaven’s difficult tasks must arise from ease,\nAll under Heaven’s great tasks must arise from smallness.\nHence the Sage never acts in greatness,\nAnd thus can achieve greatness.\nLight promises must be few in trust,\nMany easy things must bring many difficulties—\nThus the Sage says: *Even this is difficult,*\nFor the Sage’s talent still finds difficulty in small and easy matters,\nHow much more so for those who are not the Sage’s talent,\nYet wish to neglect this?\nHence it is said: *Even this is difficult.*\nThus there will never be difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: The Art of Preserving the End**\nIts stability is easily maintained,\nIts beginnings are easily planned—\nBecause of its stability, one does not forget peril,\nMaintaining it does not forget ruin,\nPlanning it without effort or strain,\nHence it is said: *easily.*\nIts frailty is easily floated upon,\nIts subtlety is easily dispersed—\nThough it may be lost, no one will take it,\nBecause of its frailty and subtlety,\nIt is not sufficient to accomplish great deeds,\nHence it is said: *easily.*\nThese four sayings all discuss guarding the end.\nOne cannot neglect what is without maintaining it,\nCannot neglect what is subtle because it will disperse.\nWithout maintaining what is not, it will generate what is;\nWithout dispersing what is subtle, it will generate what is great.\nHence, consider the end’s calamity like the beginning’s ruin,\nAnd there will be no failed undertakings.\nAct before there is what to act upon—\nIt means its stability and unseen beginnings.\nGovern before there is disorder—\nIt means its frailty and subtlety.\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\nThe doer brings ruin,\nThe grasper brings loss.\nOne should guard the end to eliminate frailty,\nGuard frailty to eliminate disorder,\nAnd thus apply non-action as governance,\nAnd non-grasping as non-loss.\nThis reverses the origin of undertakings,\nAnd cleverly creates what should not be—\nHence ruin and loss.\nThus the Sage acts without acting,\nAnd thus there is no ruin;\nDoes not grasp,\nAnd thus there is no loss.\nThe people’s undertakings,\nOften fail just as they are about to succeed—\nBecause they do not guard the end.\nGuarding the end like the beginning,\nWealth will not bring ruin.\nThus the Sage desires what he does not desire,\nDoes not prize what is hard to obtain—\nLoves what is easy, though slight,\nAnd strives for what is worth contesting.\nWhat is hard to obtain, though small,\nWill give rise to thieves—\nLearning without learning,\nAgainst the errors of the multitude—\nThose who are learned yet do not learn,\nAre naturally so.\nIt is like those who do not learn#2—\nErrors.\nHence learning without learning,\nTo correct the errors of the multitude,\nTo assist the self-so of all things\nYet not daring to act.»",

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to lead the people must speak to them in humility; who wishes to go before the people must place himself behind them. Thus, the Sage, though in high station, is not burdensome to the people; though he leads, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in promoting him without tiring.

      "translated_text": "「When one is bold yet daring, he will be slain,\nYet he cannot be said to die justly.\nWhen one is bold yet does not dare, he will live—\nHis fate is aligned with the Dao.\nThese two paths—one brings gain, the other harm.\nBoth are bold, yet their application differs,\nAnd so their outcomes diverge—hence it is said: *some bring gain, others harm.*\nWhat Heaven abhors—who understands its reason?\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\nWho, indeed?—who can fathom Heaven’s abhorred intent?\nOnly the Sage.\nThe Sage’s wisdom still struggles with daring boldness,\nMuch less those without the Sage’s wisdom who would attempt it—\nHence it is said: *he finds it difficult.*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven does not contend yet prevails,\nThough Heaven does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with it.\nIt does not speak yet responds well,\nFavor brings fortune, opposition brings misfortune—\nThus it does not speak yet responds well.\nIt does not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nAnd when it dwells below, all things return to it.\nModest yet skilled in planning,\nIt observes omens and discerns fortune and misfortune,\nPrepares sincerity before events unfold,\nAnd remains secure without forgetting peril.\nIt plans even before being summoned—\nHence it is said: *modest yet skilled in planning.*\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it never fails to ensnare.\n**Chapter 74**\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you threaten them with death?\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely are deemed odd,\nThen I can seize and kill them—who would dare?\nStrange, deceitful, and disruptive actions that unsettle the masses are called *odd*.\nThose who habitually execute killings do so.\nThe executors of death,\nAre those who act as substitutes for the great carpenter’s axe.\nSubstitutes for the great carpenter’s axe,\nRarely fail to injure their own hands.\nThey are the objects of hatred for those who oppose or comply—\nHence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*\nThe unvirtuous,\nAre what people detest—\nHence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*\n**Chapter 75**\n\nThe people’s hunger,\nArises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed,\nArises from their rulers’ excessive actions.\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s disregard for death,\nArises from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life.\nThus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not use life as a means,\nAre wiser than those who value life.\nIt is said that the people’s depravity and the chaos in governance,\nAll stem from the rulers, not from the ruled.\nThe people follow their rulers.\n**Chapter 76**\n\nHumans, when born, are soft and weak,\nBut when they die, they become hard and strong.\nAll things, grass and wood, when born, are soft and brittle,\nBut when they die, they wither and decay—\nThus, the hard and strong belong to death,\nAnd the soft and weak belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies cannot conquer,\nFor those who rely on strength to oppress the world,\nAre what all things abhor—\nThus they cannot prevail.\nTrees become rigid when they are strong,\nFor they are subjected to external forces.\nStrength rooted in humility is the foundation,\nAnd weakness rooted in arrogance is the branch.\n**Chapter 77**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven—is it like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe abundant are diminished, the scarce are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to nourish the scarce,\nBut human ways are not so—\nOnly by aligning with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nCan one encompass all things.\nIf one follows the Dao of Heaven,\nAnd measures themselves by human standards,\nThen each will have their own place,\nAnd none can equal the others.\nIf one is only without self and without private interest,\nAnd returns to the natural—\nThen alone can they align with Heaven and Earth in virtue.\nDiminish the scarce to nourish the abundant—\nWho can have abundance to nourish all under Heaven?\nOnly those who possess the Dao.\nThus the Sage acts yet does not rely on it,\nAchieves yet does not dwell in it—\nHe does not wish to display his virtue to equalize the world.\nIt is said that only those who can fully embrace excess and deplete what is lacking,\nSupplement what is present to fill what is absent,\nBlending their light with dust and harmonizing with the world,\nCan truly equalize all things—\nThis is the Dao alone.\nThus the Sage does not wish to show his virtue to equalize the world.\n**Chapter 78**\n\nNone under Heaven are as soft and weak as water,\nYet none can conquer what is hard and strong.\nIts softness cannot be replaced.\n*Water’s softness*, it is said,\nIs such that no thing can replace it.\nThe weak overcoming the strong,\nThe soft overcoming the rigid—\nNone under Heaven do not know,\nYet none can practice it.\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state,\nIs to be the true guardian of its altars and grains.\"*\n*\"To bear the state’s misfortunes,\nIs to be the true ruler of all under Heaven.\"*\nCorrect words as if they were reversed.\n**Chapter 79**",

      "translated_text": "The origins of this work are akin to the tradition of Yan Junping’s *Zhǐguī*, for it holds that benevolence and righteousness, along with ritual propriety, cannot be fully realized without the Way. Heaven and all things derive from the One—how much more so does this apply to the *Dao De Jing*? Indeed, all scholars ought to recognize this truth.\n\nFrom this, I came to understand that Wang Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing* was profound, while his engagement with the *Yijing* was superficial. His interpretations of the *Yijing* often drew upon the principles of the *Dao De Jing*, yet the *Dao De Jing* required no such support from the *Yijing*. The traces of excess and deficiency are plainly evident.\n\nAlas, how arduous is the pursuit of learning! Bi knew that fine arms are ominous instruments, yet when it came to victory in war, he treated it with funeral rites—this was not the teaching of Laozi, but rather the words of the Yellow River Master, who said: *\"One who is always good at saving people thus abandons none; one who is always good at saving things thus discards none.\"* This passage does not appear in the ancient text, yet thanks to Fu Yi’s discernment, it was clarified.\n\nStill, Bi titled this work the *Dao De Jing*, without distinguishing between *Dao* and *De* in their order, which remains close to the ancient tradition. Yet his text contains many errors and contradictions, some passages nearly unreadable—truly lamentable.\n\nI have often said that Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing*, Zhang Huan’s of the *Liezi*, Guo Xiang’s of the *Zhuangzi*, Du Yu’s of the *Zuozhuan*, Fan Ning’s of the *Guliang*, Mao Qeng’s of the *Shijing*, and Guo Pu’s of the *ErYa*—each perfected a singular school of thought. Though later scholars have followed, none have surpassed them.\n\nHaving transcribed Bi’s commentary and recorded these observations, I note this in the *Zhenghe* year of *Yiwu* (1115), the tenth month, on the *Dingchou* day, at Songshan, by the humble Zhào Shuò, then in exile at Fu Prefecture.\n\nI, Xiong Ke, have also reverently recited the words of the *Xianping* era: *\"The Dao De Jing is the essential guide for governing the world. Though Emperor Ming’s interpretations are brilliant and worthy of admiration, Wang Bi’s annotations are concise yet profound, truly capturing Laozi’s essence of purity and tranquility.\"* Since then, I have diligently sought Bi’s commentary, which is now rare in the present age. It was long before I obtained it, and in my former post as prefectural scholar of Jianning, I had it published.\n\nLater, I acquired the annotated edition by Master Zhào Yǐdào, which does not separate *Dao* and *De* but arranges them as a continuous text, without chapter divisions. Delighted by its antiquity, I transcribed and preserved it. In the *Gēnyín* year of *Qiánshì* (1160), when I was assigned to teach in Jingkou, I had it engraved on wooden blocks for wider transmission.\n\nAs for the textual errors, earlier scholars could not verify them, so how dare I alter them? I leave this to those who truly understand. Recorded on the twenty-fourth day of the third month by Xiong Ke, Left Assistant Official and Professor of Jingzhou Prefecture.",
