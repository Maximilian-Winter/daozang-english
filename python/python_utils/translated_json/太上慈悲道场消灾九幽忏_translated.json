Ten fascicles. Originally compiled by Ge Xuan of the Han, as transmitted and collected. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* section, *Weiyi* category.\n\n**Preface to *The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms***\nComposed by Li Hanguang, Master of the Three Caverns and Master of Mystic Stillness\n\nIn the beginning, when the Crimson Clarity first dawned, cloud-script took form at the celestial pole. After the rise of the Flame Emperor’s Han, sacred texts gradually spread among humankind. In the western lands of Shu, the golden palaces bequeathed their teachings; in the eastern realm of Wu, the Great Ultimate transmitted its doctrine. Thus, secret scrolls of the Great Existence and jade chapters of the Cavern Realms emerged—Zhang and Xu revealed them in earlier times, while Tao and Lu disseminated them later. Master and disciple followed in succession, and generations produced such figures.\n\n*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms* originated with the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan, during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Later Han. Dwelling in reclusion on Mount Yushan of Tiantai, he cultivated the Dao in seclusion. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, descended into the Immortal’s chamber and bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Celestial Writ*, the *Jade Script of Cavern Reality*, the *Cavern Mystery*, the *Cavern Spirit*, and the thirty-six divisions of precious scriptures. The Immortal, abiding in the mountains, refined his thoughts and stilled his mind. Over decades, he communed with spirits and moved the sacred. Mountain spirits and tree ghosts guarded and bowed in reverence.\n\nThe wandering souls and lost spirits all attain transcendence and rebirth. This was deemed the profound essence of the Great Vehicle, capable of enlightening sentient beings and rescuing those drowning in suffering. Thus, from within the Three Caverns, the Immortal distilled their essential teachings, compiling repentance texts to ensure that all beings of the present age might hear and witness them. For future generations of scholars, these would be easily understood and practiced, extending even to the boundless.\n\nIn the icy nights of Fengdu’s Avīci Hell, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties and Nine Dark Realms—where tormented souls languish in confinement—none would remain trapped. Whether living, past, or yet to come, all who have committed fresh transgressions or carried ancestral sins, whose karmic entanglements and calamities have bound them, would receive the moistening grace of the Dharma, assembling in the realm of true perfection. Thus, this teaching spread.\n\nThereafter, those drawn to evil causes numbered barely two or three in a hundred, while those awakening to virtuous conditions reached eight or nine in ten. Hence, the ranks of immortals were fully established, and the work of transformation and guidance was complete. This text is therefore set at the beginning of the scroll.\n\n---\n\n*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, Scroll One\nCompiled by the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan\n\nThe Primordial and the Jade Emperor, supreme sages, respond to beings by manifesting forms and establishing teachings according to circumstance. Without the treasure of scriptures, the dust of delusion cannot be dispelled. From their mouths flow jade texts, expounding these sacred mysteries, returning to purity and simplicity—this depends on the heart. For those who seek learning, the method is here revealed.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states: In the Dragon Han kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Reality* scriptures:\n1. *Supreme*\n2. *Wondrous Grove*\n3. *Great Clarity*\n4. *Penetrating Vision*\n5. *Highest Clarity*\n6. *Transformation and Enlightenment*\n7. *Primordial Yang*\n8. *Wondrous Perfection*\n9. *Opening the Mountain*\n10. *Ten Immortals*\n11. *Jade Grove*\n12. *Yellow and Lao*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Jade Clarity Realm.\n\nIn the Crimson Brightness kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Mystery* scriptures were expounded:\n1. *Spiritual Harmony*\n2. *Numinous Treasure*\n3. *Communion with Spirits*\n4. *Immeasurable*\n5. *Assembly of Immortals*\n6. *Inner Secrets*\n7. *Utmost Perfection*\n8. *Gathering Virtue*\n9. *Refining Essence*\n10. *Life and Death*\n11. *Palace Diagrams*\n12. *Dispelling Demons*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Highest Clarity Realm.\n\nIn the Kaihuang kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Spirit* scriptures were expounded:\n1. *Great Perfection*\n2. *Utmost Virtue*\n3. *Yellow Court*\n4. *Refining Qi*\n5. *Dao and Virtue*\n6. *Primordial Spirit*\n7. *Great Kalpa*\n8. *Inner Simplicity*\n9. *Divine Invocations*\n10. *Three Sovereigns*\n11. *Subduing Demons*\n12. *Lesser Kalpa*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Great Clarity Realm.\n\nThus, the thirty-six divisions of the Three Cavern scriptures are arrayed upon golden tablets, with the Seven Sages setting forth the model, illuminating the royal canon. Once in ten thousand kalpas, the Dharma emerges in accordance with humanity.\n\nThe Three Caverns may be summarized as the One Vehicle. Therefore, the *Orthodox Unity* states: Though the Three Caverns are three, when encompassed together, they form the Dao of the One Vehicle. The *Great Mystery* is the Great Vehicle, the *Great Peace* the Middle Vehicle, and the *Great Clarity* the Small Vehicle. *Orthodox Unity* permeates all three.\n\nIn terms of rank and illumination, the Three Caverns correspond to the Three Clarities. The *Great Mystery* governs the three palaces above, the *Great Peace* the three palaces in the middle, and the *Great Clarity* the three palaces below.\n\nThese Three Cavern scriptures fully elucidate the profound canon, teaching and transforming according to circumstance, delivering humans and devas, and guiding all beings. In the human world, conduct varies in elevation, and the Dharma varies in depth, yet they enable the Six Paths to return to truth and the Three Vehicles to awaken to realization.\n\nNow, contemplating the ages to come, I see those ascending and descending through the Six Paths, the four kinds of birth in the dark and manifest realms, the icy nights of the Nine Dark Realms, the Fengdu and Five Sufferings, the languishing souls and spirits—all enduring karmic retribution, suffering in life, unable to escape the demons of grievance. Therefore, from the Three Cavern scriptures, I have compiled and expounded the *Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, a work of ten scrolls, establishing its principles and completing its chapters.\n\nBy investigating the profound and abstruse meanings, whether living or deceased, those who revere the sages and repent their transgressions will immediately depart the Three Evil Paths, ascend to the Nine Clarity Realms, awaken to non-action, and return to the Great Dao.\n\nThe *Great Mystery Scripture* states: Formerly, the Lord of the Azure Youth declared, \"To practice the Dao is苦, and not to practice the Dao is also 苦.\" Consider how, from birth to old age, from illness to death, the suffering of protecting the body is boundless, and the accumulation of vexations and sins only ceases at death. Many prayers fail to prolong life.\n\nAs for the苦 of practicing the Dao: maintaining purity and preserving truth, guarding the mysterious and contemplating the numinous, seeking teachers and upholding the Dharma, diligently cultivating the heart without laziness, and resolutely applying the will—this too is a 苦 endeavor. Regard the ranks of feudal lords as passing guests; regard gold and silk as mere pebbles...\n\nRegard the esteem for plain silk as coarse cloth. This may be called the ability to inquire into the Dao.\n\nThe Lord of Western Citadel declared: \"After death, to fall into the Three Evil Realms is easy; to obtain a human rebirth is difficult. Having obtained a human rebirth, to depart from the female form and become male is difficult. Having become male, to possess a complete and sound body is difficult. Having attained a complete body, to be born in the Central Kingdom is difficult. Having been born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter sagely rulers and parents is difficult. Having encountered sagely rulers and parents, to be born in an age where one may study the Dao and cultivate a heart of benevolence and kindness is difficult. Having cultivated a heart of benevolence and kindness, to believe in the virtue of the Dao and the attainment of long life is difficult.\"\n\nNow, the Three Evil Realms are hell, the realm of hungry ghosts, and the realm of beasts—difficult to escape and be reborn as a human, instead becoming birds, beasts, insects, or livestock. If one seeks to avoid these, by what virtuous power may it be done?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"If one seeks to avoid the Three Evil Realms, one must first broadly vow before my manifested images of true sages, then eliminate the Three Actions and Six Roots, and afterward take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereafter, dedicate the merit, confess one’s transgressions, and inquire into repentance—thus attaining the divine within the human and joining the Dao of celestial immortals.\"\n\n**Chapter One: Broadly Vowing Aspirations**\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life, we have obtained human form, dwell in the floating world, and have encountered the true teaching. Gazing upon the sacred countenance, we bow our heads in reverence and take refuge, vowing great aspirations:\n\nFirst, we vow that from this day forward, we and all in this assembly shall establish myriad virtuous practices, transforming the six destinies and four births, that all may equally attain liberation and forever depart from the defiled and chaotic realms of the world.\n\nSecond, we vow that life after life, we shall leave the household, forsake worldly attachments and affections, follow conditions to beg alms, broadly cultivate fields of merit, constantly practice compassion and forbearance, and forever transcend the distinctions of self and other.\n\nThird, we vow to constantly encounter noble friends who guide and instruct us.\n\nFourth, we vow to meet enlightened masters and receive the supreme Dao.\n\nFifth, we vow to hear the true Dharma and practice it as taught.\n\nSixth, we vow to behold the Heavenly Worthy and personally receive the sacred decree.\n\nSeventh, we vow to deliver all beings, placing others before ourselves.\n\nEighth, we vow to widely proclaim the Dharma to the ignorant and benighted.\n\nNinth, we vow that all sentient beings shall awaken the intention for the Dao, believe in and venerate the scriptures and images, construct numinous temples, and offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles according to their means.\n\nTenth, we vow that our hearts shall remain steadfast and unwavering. By this virtuous power, may demonic forces be subdued, and the realm attain peace and tranquility. May those who have not heard hear, and those who have not seen see. May those who delight in the Lesser Vehicle not doubt the Middle Vehicle; may those who have entered the Middle Vehicle not doubt the Great Vehicle; and may those who have entered the Great Vehicle wish all sentient beings to hear the wisdom of enlightenment. May those who have not yet awakened awaken; may those who have awakened grow further; and may those who have grown become eyes and ears for others, Dao guides, parents, elder brothers, and friends—gathering in the Dao altar, joining as companions in the Dharma.\n\nWe further vow that all sentient beings, before the scriptures and the venerable, in their own bodies and others’, in all inner and outer Dharma, shall not generate minds of transgression, arrogance, anger, jealousy, or stinginess.\n\nWe further vow that all the merit we cultivate shall not be for ourselves alone but shall universally extend to all. Upon seeing the orphaned, solitary, imprisoned, or ailing, may we arise with minds of rescue, salvation, the Dao, and sincerity.\n\nWe further vow that the hidden and manifest true sages shall together bestow their protection and deliverance. May the repentant patron so-and-so and all of us in this assembly fulfill our broad vows, our hearts aligning with the true sages. May the power of our vows extend to our parents of past, present, and future lives, our six relations, and all living kin—may they all attain peace and happiness. May those who have passed not be reborn in evil realms, and may those yet to come not accumulate grave transgressions. May all equally realize the fruition of the vows we make today.\n\n**One bow**\n\n**Chapter Two: Eliminating the Three Actions and Six Roots**\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life and past lives, we have not heard the true Dharma, often arising perverse thoughts, our discerning natures lost in confusion, failing to seek the ultimate principle.\n\nThe *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* states: \"All that has form is transient and illusory. Thought after thought perishes, never pausing for even a moment. Suffering and affliction revolve endlessly; unawakened and unenlightened, we traverse the Three Ways, enduring myriad kalpas of bitterness. Receiving one body after another, we are bound by the fetters of affliction—all due to the Three Actions.\"\n\nFor there are Six Roots: the eye root, ear root, nose root, tongue root, body root, and mind root. These roots give rise to all actions, hence the Six Roots are like grasses and trees, producing myriad flowers and fruits, endlessly generating one another. Thus arise the Six Passions, Six Desires, Six Defilements, Six Entrances, Six Thieves, Six Dusts, and Six Consciousnesses. Yet form, sound, fragrance, flavor, touch, and dharmas are fundamentally empty and tranquil, neither moving the body nor disturbing the mind. It is sentient beings who cling and grasp, vainly harboring preferences and aversions, thought after thought racing in competition, afflictions binding the body. By these causes and conditions, we drift and wander through birth and death.\n\nIf one can purify wisdom and carefully reflect, awakening to these Six Roots before my image, then all roots shall be exhausted.\n\nThe Three Actions are: bodily action, mental action, and verbal action. We in this assembly, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have indulged the Three Actions and Six Roots for countless kalpas, never once awakening. Today, before the image of the true sages, we arouse the mind of wisdom, generate the intention to awaken, and pledge to eliminate them.\n\nFirst, we repent the sins of bodily action: from birth, we have killed, stolen, and indulged in lust, greedily seeking fine and smooth things. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not commit killing or stealing, nor crave fine and smooth things, nor indulge in lust, seeking liberation from the fetters of desire. May we encounter the scriptures and, before the images, bathe in fragrant waters, purifying body and spirit, contemplating the Dao and reflecting on truth. Striking the Dharma drum, we visualize the Three Treasures, repenting for all sentient beings, forever seeking the fruit of purity.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of mental action: from birth, our minds have been driven by greed, anger, ignorance, and attachment, racing with scattered thoughts.\n\nThe repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not give rise to greed or anger, nor generate delusion or attachment, nor entertain perverse thoughts, ever aspiring to the true and authentic. May we encounter the scriptures, focus our minds with single intent, as though before the Three Treasures, universally guiding all to take refuge, attaining the fruit of non-action.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of verbal action: from birth, our mouths have uttered frivolous speech and falsehoods, engaged in harsh words and slander. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge in divisive speech, nor harbor thoughts in the mind, but ever maintain purity, forever severing slander. May we encounter the scriptures and, before the sacred images, concentrate our thoughts with precision, universally enabling all to hear and know, eternally realizing the fruit of immortality and sagehood.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the eye faculty: from birth, our eyes have been false and unreal, never truly authentic, wantonly generating conditions, falsely beholding forms. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our eyes in generating conditions or coveting perceptions of form. With true and proper vision, we shall see all appearances as empty, seeking the inconceivable fruit of ultimate attainment.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the ear faculty: from birth, our ears have heard the five tones, discerning purity and impurity. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our ears in hearing sounds, lest they disturb body and mind, entangling us in afflictions. May we realize the fruit of quiescence.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the nose faculty: from birth, our noses have distinguished fragrance and stench, perceiving the flow of qi. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our noses in smelling fragrances, discriminating between the foul and the aromatic, mingling and confounding primordial qi, agitating the numinous terrace. May we realize the fruit of mystery and emptiness.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the tongue faculty: from birth, our tongues have craved the five flavors, insatiable and unfulfilled, speaking slander and falsehoods, maligning the loyal and flattering the virtuous. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our tongues in savoring flavors, nor engage in quarrels or gossip, nor incite defamation. May we realize the fruit of truth and authenticity.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the body faculty: from birth, our bodies have sought only sensual pleasure, unaware of the suffering to come after death. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge the body’s conditions in coveting illicit pleasure or pursuing wanton delight, but ever seek to withdraw and deliver others. May we return and realize the fruit of the Great Dao.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of the mind faculty: from birth, our minds have lacked steadfast constancy, shifting and unpredictable, like apes or horses, akin to fire and wind. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge the mind’s faculty, maintaining constancy from beginning to end, with movement and stillness undisturbed. May we enter and realize the fruit of spontaneity.\n\n**One bow**\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, repent the sins of the three karmic actions and six faculties as above. We universally vow to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, all the venerable and sagely ones, all perfected and immortals, all the great sage assemblies who have attained the Dao, and all the concealed and manifest honored sages of the ten directions: may you arouse the mind of protection and extend your compassionate intent. May the repentant patron so-and-so, from kalpas past to this very day, have all sins and karmic offenses, from the moment this mind of resolve is generated, completely extinguished. May this extend even to our parents in this present life, our masters who have guided us to liberation, our countless ancestors, siblings, and six relations, our in-laws and kin—those living in this world and those yet to come—who, by virtue of this repentance, have all their transgressions dissolved. For those already departed, may they not sink into evil destinies or dwell in dark obscurity, but swiftly attain rebirth in the Land of Eternal Bliss.\n\n**One bow**\n\n**Section Three: Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures**\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have heard the words of the Great Canon: all sentient beings, born between heaven and earth, know not the sheltering and supporting [of the Dao]. Though they receive the Great Dao, they are unaware of their true origin. Turning away from brightness toward darkness, pursuing the superficial and abandoning the fundamental, reverting from correctness to perversity, estranging themselves from truth and embracing falsehood, they defile the Three Luminaries and perpetually commit the ten evils, never generating shame or remorse, but constantly harboring venomous thoughts. Now, those who cultivate goodness and establish merit must first take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thus, the scriptures say: if one does not take refuge in the Three Treasures, then good dharmas have no foundation to rely upon. The Three Treasures are the Treasure of the Dao, the Treasure of the Scriptures, and the Treasure of the Masters. Though their paths differ, their fruits and causes vary.\n\nThe Treasure of the Dao: throughout the three realms and ten directions, it manifests in myriad forms. Sometimes as a sovereign, sometimes as an imperial teacher, it establishes heaven and earth, nurturing and sustaining living beings, absolving the roots of transgression, dissolving and dispelling calamities. Riding dragons and appearing in forms, driving chariots and soaring through the void, it abides in non-action and spontaneity—thus is the Treasure of the Dao honored.\n\nThe Treasure of the Scriptures: inscribed in purple characters on flowery terraces, written in mysterious texts on soaring trees, concealed in the secret repositories of celestial and immortal officials, bound in azure dragon’s precious scrolls, encased in white phoenix’s jade boxes, comprising four divisions and five thousand [scrolls], inscribed on jade tablets and golden slips, resting on stands of mystery and emptiness, wrapped in frost-like silk veils, they encompass the ultimate Mahāyāna—thus is the Treasure of the Scriptures honored.\n\nThe Treasure of the Masters: without understanding the Dharma’s principles, how can one distinguish the roots of things? Desiring to cross the river of craving and reach the shore of the Dao, without a ladder or a boat, how can one attain fruition without the aid of a teacher? Only by accomplishing the precepts can one establish this Dharma-body—thus is the Treasure of the Masters honored.\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, prostrate ourselves for peace and to offer posthumous deliverance. Before the true and the images, we repent our sins and transgressions, bowing our heads in submission, taking refuge and paying reverence.\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Dao of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Scriptures of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Masters of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nToday, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual universally vow to the Most High and all the authentic Three Treasures of the ten directions. We humbly pray that your compassion universally descends, your wondrous responses follow the needs of beings. The repentant patron so-and-so prostrates for peace and posthumous deliverance, relying on the Three Treasures and reverently serving the Most Perfect and True. We humbly pray that the power of your mysterious light and wisdom constantly delivers the four kinds of birth, steadily ferrying the vessel of compassion, eternally responding to the three realms. May this bring joy to humans and spirits, and may the hidden and manifest alike receive your grace.\n\n**May all who hear or witness this, and those who enter the karmic conditions of the Dharma to pay reverence, awaken to the Dao.**\n**One bow**\n\n**Chapter Four: Dedication and Adornment**\n\nToday, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, prostrate in reverence to the Three Clarities and Four Realms, the Eight Poles and Nine Empyreans, the Thirty-Six Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors, the Four Quarters and Six Directions, the Five Directions of the Boundless, the Ten Directions’ Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Perfectly True Radiant August Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Lords, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the great holy hosts of the Ten Directions who have already attained the Dao, the Central Heaven’s Three August Star Emperors, the Sun and Moon and Five Agents, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Southern Palace and Northern Dipper, the Revolving Balance and all luminaries, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Four Seas and Nine Provinces, the lords of famous mountains and great marshes, the Perfected of Highest Truth, the Directors of Destiny and Registrars of Life, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the bureaus of the netherworld, the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu, the Six Palaces and Nine Courts, the officials of the earthly realms above and below, the Nine Lands’ Thirty-Six August Lords, the dragon spirits and all worthies and sages of this realm.\n\nWe humbly pray that they collectively descend without partiality, jointly respond with discernment.\n\nThe repentant patron so-and-so, with utmost sincerity in heart, purifies the ritual space, commissions scriptures and invites sacred images, kindles lamps and burns incense, prostrates and offers devotion, beseeching our assembly to universally venerate the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions—manifest in boundless transformations and under myriad appellations.\n\nWe only pray that the great Perfected and Sages, the great divine immortals, the great lords and rulers, the great dragon kings, and the numinous consciousness of empty space, bear witness to this repentance, rescue sentient beings, and universally enable all who hear or know to awaken to the Great Dao.\n\nThe repentant patron so-and-so, prostrating with all five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly invokes and prostrates to the Merciful Honored Ones, reverently saluting the Perfected and Sages.\n\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering upon hearing cries.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure August.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who generates boundless fortune.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who extends lifespan and increases years.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who dispels calamities and resolves misfortune.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams who shields the body.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces who wards off misfortune.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Purple Clarity who descends blessings.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who augments great fortune.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Bridge who universally ferries.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who protects life and shields the body.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who responds to needs and attends to karmic conditions.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy whose forms flow through billions of kalpas.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who divides forms into myriad transformations.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who protects the state.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy who enables rebirth according to wishes.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merits.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected of the Ocean of Empty Wisdom.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected who universally attains wondrous practices.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected of Great Compassion who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected of Great Mercy who extricates from transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual humbly pray to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction, all the honored ones and sages, all the great Perfected, all the great youths, who pervade the boundaries of the Ten Directions, fill the realms of the Mysterious Void, and manifest in all honored and sagely forms.\n\nThe repentant patron so-and-so first dedicates these merits to universally adorn and ascend in offering to the imperial house, the myriad ancestors and ten thousand forebears, the imperial father and mother, the revered spirits of the seven ancestral temples, that their souls may ascend to the Purple Empyrean, refine their essences in the Vermilion Mound, bathe in the jeweled pools, repose in the wondrous gardens, don robes of crimson auroras, wear crowns of emerald clouds, ride the Threefold Plain Clouds, drive the Eight-Phoenix Chariot, transcend the Flowery Towers, serve in the Jade Clarity, face the \"Vacuous August One,\" stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the highest sages, be promoted to the ranks of divine Perfected, have their names inscribed in the celestial registers, dwell in the upper realms, bring benefit and peace to the lower lands, eternally protect the ancestral line, perpetually flourish the sacrificial rites, and enjoy boundless offerings—may all under heaven rejoice in this great fortune.\n\nNext, we pray for the present emperor: may the dragon’s chart shine resplendent, the phoenix’s calendar flourish, his blessed reign be without end, his grand foundation eternally firm, myriad virtues gather like clouds, a thousand auspices descend like mist. May his sagely body enjoy fine health, his imperial mind radiate wisdom, the sky of Yao eternally shelter, the sun of Shun forever shine. With his sagely wisdom, perfect and all-pervading, his virtue and teachings widely bestowed, he is hailed as the pinnacle of prosperity. As in ancient times, may his grace extend to Hua and Yi, his benevolence reach the remote frontiers. May his ministers be enlightened and upright, his royal plans well-ordered, his civil and military officials of heroic talent, diligently cultivating the imperial enterprise. May the five marquises and nine governors, the hundred officials and myriad functionaries, secure the state and pacify the people, serve the public and follow governance, eradicate the ills of the age, harmonize the realm, ensure abundant harvests of grain and beans, quell weapons of war, and together enjoy peace and prosperity—all singing the praises of sagely brilliance.\n\nNext, we pray for the imperial heir: may he be endowed with the weight of primal goodness, his Dao radiate layered brilliance, his virtue align with Heaven, his brightness match the sun, aiding and sheltering all beings, assisting in the perfection of sagely governance. May his moral and heavenly wealth abound, rites and music daily renew, his light illuminating the royal plans, his grace moistening the common people. May the golden branch flourish, the jade leaves extend their fragrance.\n\nFor the empress, the six palace consorts, and imperial concubines, the imperial daughters and moonlike maidens, may they rival the beauty of the Golden Mother, match the years of the talisman of firm Qian, eternally unwaning, their earthly virtue enduring, accumulating merits and piling up virtues, inwardly sagely and outwardly kingly.\n\nFor the imperial princes and royal clans, the heirs and feudal lords, the noble relatives and court worthies, the provincial governors and regional commanders, the frontier inspectors and their aides, the county magistrates and overseers—ever bearing toil and labor, ever cherishing loyalty and filial piety—may they, through this rite of repentance, have bodies as steadfast as mountains, lifespans as vast as the deep sea, eternally guard the inner citadel, forever rest on the unshakable stone. May their utmost virtue be pure and profound, their kindness extend to the black-haired and swarthy, lost treasures return like beasts, pheasants tame and pests cease. May their light align with the Dao, perfectly aiding non-action.\n\nNext, may all beings—scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, and every class—throughout the land under heaven, whether noble or base, exalted or humble, equally partake in the Dharma of repentance, mutually rely upon and extol it, each attaining peace and well-being, universally increasing joy and contentment.\n\nMoreover, may all creatures—those that creep, fly, or stir—every sentient being, be freed from entanglements, all receive the moisture of the Dharma, forever dissolve karmic obstacles, face the sacred and the true, sharing the same vow and the same bliss.\n\nNext, may the nine generations of ancestors of the repentance sponsor, certain, along with clan kin, those who have passed before or transformed after, new souls and old acquaintances, by virtue of the precious marks, universally cross the Dharma bridge, directly reach the Vermilion Mound, swiftly transcend the fires of refinement, their souls purified and luminous, receiving retribution with clarity, ascending the ranks of immortals, all illuminating the ancestral line.\n\nMay the living—elders and youths, inner and outer kin—each attain longevity, their ancestral temples blessed with auspiciousness, all bathed in compassionate grace, forever dwelling in the sagely age, together meeting the conditions of the Dao.\n\nMoreover, may those in the three wretched paths, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, and the nine dark realms, no longer linger at the round gate, transcend to the pure and adorned, all by the power of the Dao, turning toward the mysterious merit.\n\nMay all wishes be perfectly fulfilled, together ascending the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Recitation of Repentance**\n\nToday, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, each person directs their mind, gazing reverently toward the Merciful Honored One, reciting and inquiring in repentance.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, certain, joins hands before the heart, kneels lengthily, and listens attentively.\n\nThe *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: All sentient beings, from immeasurable kalpas past until this day, have turned and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, drifting on the river of desire, sinking in the realm of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, certain, does not know the past karma—from what cause it arose; does not awaken to the karmic conditions of former lives—from what they were obtained; does not awaken to the true and real—how to escape birth and death. Today, by good fortune, encountering this rite of repentance, bows in homage, takes refuge, and seeks to listen and receive with discernment.\n\nThe *Scripture of Karmic Retribution* states: Once, in the Hall of Cold Radiance and Cinnabar, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings suffering the sins of birth and death, divided his body throughout the Three Realms, scattered his form in the ten directions, traversing heaven above and earth below, nowhere not journeying. Arriving at the Heaven of Accumulated Virtue in the World of Mount Sumeru, seated upon a seven-jeweled radiant throne, he rejoiced with the great assembly of sages who had attained the Dao across the three times, the Heavenly Emperors, Flying Celestial Kings, Perfected Ones, Divine Lads, and countless hosts, expounding the Dharma.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, rising from the seat of fearlessness, sighed: \"For immeasurable kalpas, I have never seen the Merciful Honored One as joyful as today, bestowing the great Dharma clouds, pouring the great Dharma rain, universally enabling those present to attain awakening, each receiving benefit according to their portion, inconceivable.\"\n\nWishing to rely on divine penetrations to observe the karmic conditions of good and evil in the boundless worlds, to reveal the future, enabling knowledge of past lives, the three times—past, future, and present—having spoken thus, prostrated and bowed to the ground, gazing up at the Merciful Countenance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation: \"You now can generate this vow, arouse the great mind of goodness, benefiting all, inconceivable. By this karmic condition, he immediately emitted nine-colored radiance, penetrating and illuminating the heavens and the hundred million worlds, even the boundless lands below, the majestic spirit pervading without obstruction, shining clearly before the eyes, as if on the palm of the hand.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Universal Salvation and the great assembly, riding this majestic light, beheld above the heavens the divine play of the host of sages, their necks bearing perfect halos, bodies complete in marks, transforming appearances at will, large or small as suited. Some rode upon the light soaring through the void, mounted dragons or cranes, carefree and responsive, their divine penetrations unobstructed. They saw celestial youths and maidens, jade lads and maidens, countless in number. They saw phoenixes and peacocks, lions and apotropaic beasts, attending to the left and right. They saw golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial music and celestial flowers, celestial fruits and celestial trees, jeweled ponds and golden gardens, immortals at play, venomous dragons and fierce beasts, markets encircling the city walls, celestial kin and celestial offerings, a hundred flavors arrayed, banners, flowers, parasols, and canopies, adorned with a hundred treasures. They saw flying terraces and traveling lodges, shifting within the void, celestial robes and cloud canopies, welcoming in the empty firmament. They saw lands entirely transformed into seven treasures—gold, silver, pearls, and jade—palaces and gardens, bamboo groves, the sounds of birds and beasts, songs and music, clothing, mats, carpets, and cushions, all naturally arising, not crafted by human hands. They saw immortals consulting on Dharma marks, heavenly kings inquiring about fortune and misfortune, hundreds, thousands, even ten thousand million jeweled seats, expounding the Great Vehicle, flying immortals, celestial immortals, and those newly learning immortality questioning the Dharma and debating its subtleties. They saw such realms of blessedness, joy, and freedom, manifold and beyond naming.\n\nMoreover, they saw below the heavens the great sages and lofty perfected ones riding clouds and driving through the void, bearing banners and holding tablets, inspecting the records of sentient beings' sins and blessings. Flying celestial kings and spirits of good and evil, celestial lads, daily roaming the human realm, recording good and evil, reporting to the heavens. The cloud palaces and star offices, the palaces of the sun and moon, the lords of mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams, examining the people, assessing the merits and demerits of good and evil. They saw the five planets lose their courses, the seven luminaries deviate, the twenty-eight constellations not adhering to their celestial fields, inauspicious stars and baleful luminaries encroaching upon the imperial throne. They saw nations where warfare arose on all four fronts, the people rebelling, floods, droughts, locusts, fierce winds, and violent rains. They saw people whose years were entangled by inauspicious stars, whose fortunes were afflicted by malevolent stars, harmed by heavenly nets, plagued by earthly snares, their households troubled, their populations perishing, the five pestilences and seven afflictions causing calamities, local deities and tomb ghosts clinging to grasses and trees, wrongful deaths and demonic disturbances, falsely acting as ancestors, possessing spirits causing turmoil, water and wood spirits creating havoc, men and women without children or with children who do not live to maturity. They saw men and women in cangues and fetters, imprisoned, flogged and tortured, entangled in lawsuits and disputes, impoverished and distressed, with none to pity them, bedridden with chronic illness, desiring life yet not living, desiring death yet not dying, afflicted with leprosy, epilepsy, madness, and malignant diseases, foolishness and confusion, bodies incomplete.\n\nThey saw those struck by lightning and thunder, their bodies covered in sores, those harmed by blades, weapons, water, and fire—burned, scorched, hacked, or shot. They saw those devoured or stung by venomous insects and fierce beasts, their cries swallowed in the maw of struggle. They saw the orphaned and widowed suffering cold and hunger, bearing hardship alone. They saw men and women parted midway through life, never to reunite in this body, mothers and children torn asunder, made into slaves and bondservants, their forms misshapen and hideous, shunned by all, their lives cut short, their arms cradling untimely death. They saw men and women born incomplete—hands and feet twisted or lame, ears deaf and eyes blind, mute and afflicted with every malady. They saw men and women with bodies split open, festering with pus and blood, lips and mouths shattered, noses collapsed, loathed by all. They saw upon the earth and among men the mountains and rivers, the peaks and streams, the Yangtze and Huai, the seas and oceans, the birds in flight and beasts on land, the creatures of water rising and sinking, all living things, all creeping things, every kind of strange being.\n\nAnd in the depths beneath the earth, within the Nine Dark Hells and the Fengdu Prisons, they saw sinners enduring every manner of torture, their torments beyond naming, their suffering bitter and piercing, cutting to the bone and wounding the heart—places of karmic retribution.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, beholding all the heavens and all the earths, saw how these causes and conditions differed in sin and blessing, suffering and joy. They knew not what cultivation in past lives had brought this, nor what transgressions in this life had wrought; what blessings in former lives had been, nor what sins in this life had arisen. Was it the natural endowment of the body? Was it the consequence of karmic retribution? Was it the work of the Three Agents? Was it the cause of parents? Was it the lot of this present life? Was it the seed sown in past lives? Was it sin borne by one alone? Was it calamity passed to descendants? Could it be that through cultivating goodness one might be delivered? Or was it simply the natural course of fate?\n\nOnly wishing that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, would deign to grant enlightenment, that all beings might awaken to the causes and conditions of past lives.\n\nThe Merciful One replied: All living beings are children of the Dao. When a child is in pain, parents grieve; when the child’s illness is cured, parents find peace. Since such suffering exists, it must be treated. Excellent, Perfected One of Universal Salvation, that you have aroused such a profound mind, enlightening and benefiting all, awakening every kind. Your question truly accords with my heart. Had you not spoken, I would have still explained. Your compassion is no different from mine. Your merit and virtue are beyond conception. You are the field of blessing for the world, the boat and oar for the world, the father and mother of the world, the guide and teacher of the multitudes, the leader of the people, the master of the Dharma, the arbiter of cause and effect. Now take your seat again, and I shall expound.\n\nToday, the master of this repentance rite has heard from the beginning of the kalpa the words of the Supreme Perfected One, inquiring of the heavens above and the earth below, of the suffering and joy of beings, the manifold causes of sin and blessing, the unfathomable conditions of past lives. Now, the master of this repentance rite, for the sake of peace and deliverance, performs this rite of repentance, prostrating body and mind, wholeheartedly arousing devotion. Bowing to the Merciful One, they reverently honor the Perfected and Sacred.\n\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who saves from suffering at the sound of a cry.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme in Heaven.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Teacher of the Three Realms.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifestation and Self-Mastery.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Radiant World.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transmits the True and illuminates all.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, vast source of the Dharma.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who extends life through vast kalpas.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless compassionate shade.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Dharma Treasury.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who broadly opens expedient means.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers beings from distress.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who saves from the Eight Difficulties.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms the Three Wretched Realms.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who prospers the nation and transforms the people.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who guards the nation.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless reach.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, ocean of merit and virtue.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s wishes.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of the Empty Sea and Treasury of Wisdom.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the patron of this ritual and all the assembly humbly pray that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Divine Youths, throughout the ten directions and the farthest reaches of the empty void, all the manifest and hidden honored and sacred ones, may universally bestow their compassionate light and together dispense the medicine of the Dharma. May they elevate and advance the ancestral lines of the nation, the seven clans and three ancestral halls, safeguard the lord of the empire, the king, and his ministers and aides. May they deliver the master of this repentance rite, ourselves, our parents of three lifetimes, our teachers and kin, from the nine generations above to the seven generations below, all benefactors and donors, all those who dwell in realms yet unilluminated by the sun and moon, the flying and walking, the sinking and floating, the souls suffering in the Nine Dark Hells and all prisons, that they may be freed from calamity and together ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nToday, the assembly of this ritual has heard that in a past kalpa, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation inquired of the heavens above and the earth below, of the manifold sufferings and joys, the causes of sin and blessing. The master of this repentance rite humbly prays that today, offering sincerity, they may come to hear the words of the scripture. What the Perfected One of Universal Salvation once asked—of the heavens above, the multitudes of sages and perfected ones, in golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial palaces—where they roam freely, carefree and transforming, in every manner of indescribable joy.\n\nThe Merciful One said: This comes from cultivating the Dao through vast kalpas, step by step ascending the ranks, attaining the status of immortality.\n\nBeneath the heavens, the great sages and exalted ones ride clouds and mount the void, recording the good and evil of the human realm, reporting to the heavens above, receiving Our teachings and commands—some to promote, some to punish. Thus, in those places, within the boundaries of lands and states, floods and droughts, locust plagues, fierce winds and violent rains, the fourfold rise of warfare—all arise from civil and military officials who, relying on their ranks and positions, defy the laws of the land, oppress the myriad people, pervert justice under the guise of public duty, and manipulate the king’s law, thereby incurring such retribution.\n\nAs for the people, men and women alike, who in this life suffer manifold illnesses and hardships, various demonic calamities, peril, distress, and adversity, whose bodies are incomplete—those who are poor and lowly, who upon death enter hell, endure all manner of karmic retribution, sink for ten thousand kalpas, and remain in the evil destinies—all this stems from immeasurable kalpas past down to the present kalpa, to this very life and day. Some suffer due to the deeds of their parents, some due to their own actions, the consequences flowing downward and extending onward, creating the three karmas, the six senses, and the ten grave evils. Generation after generation, they inherit all manner of bitter retribution; age after age, they endure every kind of demonic affliction.\n\nWhat We speak of—the karmic deeds of sentient beings—is such that even a single deed encompasses hundreds of variations. To speak of it briefly would be to leave much unsaid.\n\nAt that time, Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High consent to reveal the causes and consequences of good and evil, the matters of karmic retribution, prostrated and bowed to the ground, saying: The Most High has said that sentient beings are foolish and benighted, sunk in the snares of the world, unable to awaken, bound only to karmic conditions, flowing through birth and death, enduring all manner of sin and suffering. We humbly pray that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy may take pity and deliver them, so that future sentient beings may turn their hearts toward the good Dao, avoid bitter retribution, and escape the nine dark hells of Fengdu and the myriad prisons, where they endure all manner of torture.\n\nThe Most High said: If there are men or women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, purify their dwellings, and keep their bodies clean and adorned; who set up canopies and seats, install Our image, surround it with banners and flowers, keep lamps burning continuously, burn incense and scatter flowers in offering, sit or walk in mindfulness of the Dao; or who invite Dharma masters, or themselves, for the sake of protecting the state and bringing peace to the people, harmonizing winds and rains, averting disasters and delivering from hardship, safeguarding their dwellings, seeking to extend blessings and longevity, dispelling ghosts and expelling evil; or for the sake of their parents or themselves in times of illness or calamity, when stars and constellations exert their influence, seeking children, or ransoming and liberating those who have left the household life; or for the sake of uncles, brothers, wives, and children; or to console the earth spirits and tomb guardians, protect servants and livestock, and all manner of wealth; or for the sake of masters, lords, Dharma kin, the nine generations of ancestors—parents, brothers, uncles, wives, children, and the six relations—who have passed away, to provide offerings and deliverance; if they but come before Our image, bow to the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthies who manifest in infinite response across the ten directions, offer sincerity like melting snow, and with body and mind repent the sins of immeasurable kalpas, of lives past and present, of every rebirth down to this very day—then their sins shall be extinguished as they wish.\n\nThe transformative names of Us, recorded in the scriptures and spread among humankind, dispel heavenly disasters above, eradicate earthly calamities below, and benefit the people in between. In this life and the next, their merit shall never cease. They shall attain peace and stability for the realm, longevity for the emperor, harmony in the stars and constellations, and timely winds and rains. Demons, thieves, and enemies shall become good friends. Venomous creatures and fierce beasts shall harbor no ill intent. Wind, water, fire, and warfare shall cause no harm. Their wishes shall be fulfilled, their prayers answered. The suffering souls in the nine dark hells shall escape their dark prisons and be reborn in the heavenly realms. The four kinds of birth and six destinies shall all attain liberation.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High expound this repentance Dharma for the deliverance of sentient beings, rejoiced in body and mind beyond all measure, extolling the Heavenly Worthy with these verses:\n\nExcellent is the Primordial Beginning Worthy,\nRevered by all in the Three Realms.\nHis sacred power is beyond thought,\nHis wisdom and virtue peerless.\n\nUpon the natural seven-jeweled throne,\nHe manifests in the flowering grove.\nComplete in form and appearance,\nUnobstructed as the empty sky.\n\nTo reveal the profound mystery,\nHe opens the gates of myriad wonders.\nHaving realized the supreme Dao,\nHe turns the wheel of the Great Vehicle.\n\nWith skill he expounds the Dharmas,\nUniversally reviving all beings.\nHaving heard this Dharma,\nOur hearts are purified, our defilements removed.\n\nOvercome with joy,\nWe bow our heads to the Jade Void.\n\nToday, the assembly of this ritual, along with the repentance master, from immeasurable kalpas past until now, have never before encountered this repentance Dharma. Today, humbly offering prayers for peace and deliverance, we reverently face the compassionate Worthy, the scriptures, and the sacred image, arousing boundless resolve and infinite intention. With our five limbs touching the earth, we wholeheartedly invoke:\n\nWe bow our heads to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently honoring the Perfected Sages.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues the suffering upon hearing their cries.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Emperor.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to names and transforms.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Net who manifests in transformation.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who divides into millions of bodies.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who extends compassion through vast kalpas.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Ten Thousand Jeweled Lights.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Lamp Light.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who manifests boundlessly.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Universal Deliverance.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms with sovereign ease.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Master of the Three Realms.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transmits the truth and universally illuminates.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who opens the way for sentient beings.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who takes pity without end.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who rescues the suffering.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who guards the state.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Vows.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Perfected One, Treasury of Wisdom in the Vastness of Space.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues the Suffering.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this Dao altar, together with the great assembly, reverently pray to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, to all the Venerables and Sages, to all the Great Perfected Ones, and to all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions and fill the boundless realms of mystery, manifesting or concealed in all their majesty.\n\nThrough the power of great compassion, the power of inconceivable deliverance, and the power to bring peace to sentient beings, may all beings—whether dwelling in the heavenly realms—be elevated to the Formless Realms; whether in the divine realms, ascend to the Two Form Realms; whether in the human realm, attain the First Desire Realm; and those in the hells, hungry ghost, or animal realms, be reborn as humans, forever freed from suffering and retribution.\n\nWe further pray that the Compassionate Venerable, leading all disciples, may manifest and proclaim merit and virtue in this place of ritual repentance, so that:\ncountless lands receive blessings,\ncountless beings attain liberation,\ncountless realms of dharma come to know,\ncountless superior beings embody the Great Vehicle,\ncountless middling beings perform offerings,\ncountless lesser beings generate faith,\ncountless heavenly dragons guard this place,\nand countless vajras sever demonic delusions.\n\nThe repentance master [Name], from kalpas without measure past, has cast off bodies and received bodies, taking birth in various realms, up to the present life. Today, may all sins—from the slightest thread or hair, a single name or kind, to those as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—be utterly extinguished from this day forward, with the arising of a single thought. May parents, teachers, uncles, brothers, oneself, spouse, children, the six relations, and all kin, through this act of repentance, together attain liberation and be spared from suffering and affliction. May all beings realize the supreme Dao.\n\n**First Bow**\nThus concludes the first fascicle of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and Ninefold Darkness*.\n**Second Fascicle of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and Ninefold Darkness***\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate\n\n**First Chapter: The Mirror of Compassionate Reflection**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentance master [Name], reverently join hands and listen attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable has taught that all sentient beings, in committing even a single deed, generate hundreds of karmic consequences—too many to enumerate in full, so let us speak briefly.\n\nThen the Perfected One of Universal Salvation addressed the assembly, vowing to elucidate the myriad transgressions of future beings before the image of the Compassionate Venerable, repenting each one in turn. Though the causes may not yet be fully expounded, may they be broadly explained, so that beings of endless kalpas may find refuge.\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable said: Men and women of the world, casting off bodies and receiving bodies through kalpas without measure, take rebirth due to the sins constructed by the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, reckless indulgence, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, delusion, deceitful speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech, envy of those superior, obstructing all things, consuming meat and wine, violating scriptural precepts, damaging sacred images, neglecting fasting rituals, disrespecting teachers, turning from truth to falsehood, believing in perverse views, cursing spirits, failing to honor the Three Treasures, slandering the worthy, scorning the empty and absurd, indulging in sounds and forms, becoming attached to fragrances and flavors, sinking into transgression, creating karma inwardly and outwardly, perpetuating cycles of mutual generation. The six senses arise in turn, compounding faults; the roots of sin grow, and with each thought, wrongdoing forms. There are boundless, immeasurable sins, their number like the dust of the earth, long-accumulated habits residing within. From past causes to present, kalpa after kalpa, with the arising of a single thought, all may be purified—like a bright mirror, where countless particles of dust, from before and behind, even the grease and grime of myriad impurities, accumulate to form obscuring films, dimming inner and outer clarity. Yet once it encounters a skilled craftsman, who wipes, polishes, and refines it, its surface and interior become radiant, reflecting near and far, resplendently clear, restored to its original state. Why? Because its nature is fundamentally pure.\n\nSo too are sentient beings: the spirit is originally pure, without defilement. But after receiving form, inner and outer dusts gradually stain it, turning it evil. The six roots, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, six desires, six consciousnesses—discriminating and creating delusion—generate a filthy, encumbered body. Inner obscurations and outer afflictions arise, losing the true nature, drifting in the cycle of birth and death, sinking deeper into sin, meeting retribution through karmic conditions, and thus plunging into hell, enduring all manner of suffering, submerged for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of great compassion, I pity sentient beings, and so from kalpa to kalpa, I revolve through the human realm—sometimes in China, sometimes among barbarians; sometimes old, sometimes young; sometimes ordinary, sometimes sacred; sometimes female, sometimes male; sometimes noble, sometimes base—manifesting in various forms, teaching and transforming with skillful means, delivering sentient beings. The scriptural teachings spread, awakening all, enabling them to escape suffering and forever depart from the hells of mud and fire. Yet beings are dull-witted and cannot comprehend. Now, for your sake, I will broadly reveal the causes and conditions, further distinguishing them, so that future beings may turn their hearts toward the good path.\n\nUpon hearing this parable and its distinctions, Universal Salvation’s body and mind leapt with joy. Praising the Compassionate Venerable, he spoke this verse:\n\nExcellent, Primordial Beginning Venerable,\nTrue Father and Mother of all beings.\nYou expound again the three and six roots,\nAnd further illustrate with the mirror parable.\nWith skillful means, You rescue the submerged,\nWith compassion, You deliver from suffering.\nHaving heard this Dharma,\nOur bodies and minds understand all causes.\nFor endless kalpas in the Dao altar,\nYou are the Master who preaches for the assembly.\n\nToday, the repentance master of this Dao altar, [Name], prostrates for peace and in supplication for the departed. Having heard the verses and their instructions on the repentance Dharma, this is inconceivable. With five limbs touching the earth, I listen single-mindedly. Bowing my head to the Compassionate Venerable, I reverently pay homage to the true sages.\n\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestower-of-Fortune Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Responding-to-Cries Deliverer-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Life-Nurturing Savior-of-Lives Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Unmoving Radiance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Great Penetration Spirit-Responding Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Supreme Virtue Radiance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Flowing King Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Unobstructed Sound Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Eternal Dharma-Wheel Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Turner-of-All-Adversities Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Boundless Luminance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Virtue-Luminous King Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Serene Wondrous Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Fragrant Luminance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Square-Flower Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Pure Contemplation Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Mind-Detachment Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the World-Walking Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Longevity Preserver-of-Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Great One Deliverer-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Universal Compassion Protector-of-the-Nation Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Boundless Horizon Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Ocean-of-Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Carefree Joy Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Wish-Fulfilling Rebirth Heavenly Worthy.\n\nToday, the patrons of this Dao altar and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, to all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Great Immortals, all the Great Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless void, past and future, manifest and hidden, all true sages. May the rain of sweet dew wash away all dust and defilement. May the power of compassionate light deliver all beings, guiding them to the other shore, ultimately pure.\n\nThrough this repentance text offered by the repentance master [Name] for peace and in supplication for the departed, may the power of deliverance from suffering, the power of support, the power of salvation and protection, the power of disaster elimination, the power of virtue, and the power of peace ensure all wishes are fulfilled. May all sentient beings universally repent together and return to realize the Dao fruit.\n\nOne bow.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar and the repentance master [Name] once more offer utmost sincerity, listening attentively to the scriptural words. The world in which all earthly beings dwell—the Sahā world—is floating, illusory, defiled, and impure. Hells, hungry ghosts, and animals fill the land of retribution. Few cultivate goodness; many commit evil.\n\nIn such a world, the four seasons pass and change, reckoning human lifespans, some long, some short. Spring, summer, autumn, winter—wind, rain, cold, heat—day and night, darkness and light, sun and moon hasten by. The land is of sand and gravel, uneven and treacherous. Mountains and rivers are perilous and obstructed; grasses and trees bear thorns. Not one thing brings joy.\n\nThe human body we receive is subject to birth, aging, illness, and death—a temporary aggregation of impurities, fragile and insecure. Because we have bodies, we seek clothing and food, yet often they are insufficient. Hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and deprivation afflict us. The laws of rulers drive us relentlessly; we cannot be at ease. Stubborn and dull-witted, our vision is shallow and clumsy. We associate with unwise companions.\n\nOur eyes see evil forms, our ears hear evil sounds, our noses smell foul odors, our tongues taste bitter flavors, our bodies endure harsh touches, our minds contemplate wicked dharmas—such matters are boundless. Life is impermanent, truly fearful. Thoughts pass in succession, never pausing for even a moment. Swift as a spark from struck stone or a flash of lightning, a hundred years pass in but a few days.\n\nAmidst such countless sufferings, there is no moment of peace. Moreover, beings’ karmic marks persist unbroken. Their natures are stubborn and hard, like earth mixed with tiles and stones. Those of many desires, seeking much profit, suffer greatly. Those who are ever content, though dwelling on earth, are at peace. Those who know no contentment, though in heaven, remain unsatisfied.\n\nMoreover, long-accumulated evil causes sever good roots. Delusion and attachment blind them, preventing awakening. The darkness of ignorance veils their eyes. Some are entangled by new karma; others face retribution for past grievances. As ministers, they are disloyal; as children, unfilial. Their hearts harbor hidden malice; they secretly slander and curse. Evil spirits assail them, leading to repeated illnesses. Unexpected slander arises; misfortune strikes without warning. Careers stall; desires go unfulfilled. Water, fire, and weapons cause harm. Separation and death bring suffering. Countless sorrows and griefs cannot be fully recounted.\n\nMoreover, the hindrance of afflictions is heavy; good fruits are rarely encountered. Even when seen or heard, they do not seek or desire to transcend suffering and be reborn. Instead, they rely on youthful beauty, family and children, towering mansions, and various pleasures, merely preserving their lives. Yet in an instant, all collapses. Regardless of wealth or nobility, the great limit approaches—what use are such pursuits?\n\nMoreover, beings do not realize the world is empty and false, that human and heavenly realms are like dreams. Illness, suffering, and fragility bind them; sorrows entangle them. Time fleets by; cold and heat alternate. Not a moment is spent awakening and cultivating goodness. They only wish to drift endlessly in the sea of suffering, long mired in birth and death.\n\nI pity beings more than parents pity their children. Parents’ love for their children lasts but one lifetime; my compassion for beings spans eternal kalpas. When parents see their children are unfilial, their hearts grow distant. When I see beings are unvirtuous, my compassion only deepens.\n\nShould beings descend into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu or the Avīci and other infernal realms of suffering, I ever preach the Dharma, taking their torments upon myself. Now, seeing the questions you have raised concerning the karmic causes of beings’ sins and blessings, it is as though I have swallowed iron and stone, as though an arrow has pierced my heart. My thoughts of compassion and mercy never cease for even a moment. Today, I expound this repentance ritual to rescue those sunk in delusion. You must diligently practice it and broadly deliver beings in future kalpas.\n\nThus, the Universal Savior proclaims these gāthās anew:\n\nThe Primordial Beginning, Supreme and Unsurpassed First Honored One,\nTranscends the Three Realms, peerless and without equal.\nFor countless kalpas, you have accumulated sublime practices,\nPerfecting the pure and virtuous causes of blessings and wisdom.\nAll afflictions and habitual defilements are severed;\nUltimately, old karma is not recreated anew.\nYour spiritual penetrations and mighty powers know no fear;\nYou perceive the Three Times with clarity, discerning the mundane and the real.\nYour wisdom and all virtues are perfectly complete,\nGathered into this wondrous Dharma-body.\nThough dwelling in hell, you take the place of beings,\nEnduring the boiling cauldrons, searing furnaces, and scorching coals.\nFrigid waters and icy springs do not harm your body;\nSword trees and blade mountains do not rend your flesh.\nSeeing their anguish, your heart is filled with sorrow,\nYet you rejoice in suffering for their sake.\nThus, you attain this wondrous reward-body,\nLike the moon cradled in the vast sea, its light serene and clear.\nIt embraces all without obstruction,\nNurturing the myriad things without exhaustion.\nRoaming within the Three Clarities’ Dharma-positions,\nYour heart transmits the flow of compassionate transformation without end.\nOur praises cannot suffice to extol you,\nFor your boundless grace spans kalpas beyond reckoning.\n\nToday, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind. The repentance-master, so-and-so, acknowledges the emptiness of the Four Great Elements, the transience of the Three Realms, the uncertainty of life’s span, the fragility of the body’s form, and the entanglements of karmic burdens—all offenses are of my own making. Today, encountering this repentance ritual, I vow with utmost sincerity, bowing my head in reverence. May the fires of the Three Poisons be extinguished, and the mind of a hundred virtues arise. Prostrating with five limbs to the ground, I wholeheartedly listen with devotion, seeking peace and offering this repentance text in memorial.\n\nI bow my head to the Merciful Honored One, paying homage to the true sages.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Upon Hearing the Sound.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Perfection in the Great Net.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Light Pervading Illumination.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Subdues Demons and Dispels Afflictions.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Goodness and Protection.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Union with the Dao.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Loving Practice of the Dao.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Subtle Body.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Commands the Directors of Destiny.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Extracts the Ten Sufferings.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Love.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Contemplates the Wondrous.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Attains Auspiciousness.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Qi.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Myriad Perfected.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Origin.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Calamity.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grotto.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vaidūrya.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merits.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accords with Wishes for Rebirth.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Wondrous Practice.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Vast Faith.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Extracts Transgressions.\n\nToday, the Dharma-assembly’s sponsor, so-and-so, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected, all the great youths, and all the true sages throughout the ten directions and the vast expanse of the unseen, manifest and hidden. May they bestow their minds of vast compassion, mercy, deliverance, disaster-dispelling, blessings-gathering, and suffering-rescue, so that the repentance-master’s aspirations may harmonize with their heart, that they may ride the fruit of true sages, uplift sentient beings, and ascend together to the supreme Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repentance of Deluded Thoughts**\n\nToday, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind, reverently facing the Merciful Honored One to repent the karmic offenses of deluded thoughts. The repentance-master, so-and-so, gathers their mind, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nAll beings, from the moment their bodily forms are born, are stained by the impurities of the dust. Eyes behold the five colors, noses smell the five fragrances, tongues taste the five flavors, ears hear the five sounds—all are but chaotic distractions. The true sound is not discerned; the true color is not seen. The mind arises in coarse violence, sinking into infatuation and attachment, giving rise to the roots of manifold karmic deeds, all stemming from deluded thoughts.\n\nWhether man or woman, once the mind’s thought arises and turns toward me, repenting all manner of karmic offenses, first repent deluded thoughts and doubts, then repent all karmic deeds.\n\nThe Universal Savior asks, “What are deluded thoughts?”\nThe Merciful Honored One replies, “Beings’ deluded and inverted thoughts all arise from the mind. Forcibly making distinctions, they fixate on the body, and upon encountering circumstances, delusion arises—every thought is false. For this reason, contemplate the body with wisdom: bones, flesh, skin, bodily form, hair, the six sense faculties, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits. Reflect carefully—there is no true substance to be found. They are merely a temporary aggregation of shared illusions, coalescing to form the body. Searching within and without, where am I to be found? Since the body is illusory, the mind becomes empty. Emptiness and illusion are not real—all are deluded thoughts. The body being a deluded thought, all dharmas are likewise. Self and other, right and wrong, love and hatred, grasping and rejecting, forms, sounds, fragrances, tastes, jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, frivolous speech, harsh words—all karmic deeds, in an instant, are dissolved. Within and without, all is pure and empty, naturally uniting with the true Dao. All such beings, if before the Three Treasures they practice repentance of deluded thoughts...”\n\nOr before the Dao altar, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the scriptures and dharmas, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the lectures and praises, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before heaven and earth, the empty void, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the sun, moon, and stars, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the images of all sages and revered ones, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before kings and emperors, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before civil and military officials, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the Dharma-body of those who have left the household, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before parents, uncles, brothers, and all kin, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before teachers, masters, and Dharma-kin, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before the virtuous and wise, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nOr before sacred altars and holy traces, they entertain deluded thoughts.\nAll such deluded thoughts—whether already entertained or yet to arise—once conceived in mind and intent, incur grave transgression.\nThe mind generates deluded thoughts, and the body bears the karmic burden, afflicting the present household.\nIt invites demonic adversities, entanglement in the six illnesses, thwarted aspirations, compounded hardships, calamities extending to the seven generations, and fault binding life after life.\nFailing to awaken to the true Dharma, not comprehending the real principle, one descends into the fiery gloom of hell.\nEnduring myriad torments, one is reborn in a body neither male nor female.\nWithout repentance, one sinks into eternal perdition.\n\nThen the Merciful One spoke in verse:\n*\"In life, the mind’s deluded thoughts deceive and mock all things.\nAt death, one enters the fiery gloom of hell, where form and visage char and rot.\nReborn as neither man nor woman, hideous and despised,\none lives in folly, never hearing the Dharma of true principle.\"*\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentant one, from limitless kalpas past to this very life and day—teachers, fellow disciples, disciples, parents, brothers, and one’s own flesh and blood—have harbored deluded thoughts yet unrepented.\nNow, prostrating in reverence, we offer this repentance text for peace and merit-transference, bowing with the five limbs to the earth.\nWith single-minded focus, we listen attentively, bowing our heads to the Merciful One, paying homage to the true sages.\n\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Answers Cries for Help.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Unobstructed Spiritual Power.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Wisdom.\nWith devoted

the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Dharma Comprehension.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the sponsor of this Dao altar and the great assembly reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all revered sages, all great Perfected Ones, all great youths, and all true sages across the ten directions, the infinite void, past and future, manifest and hidden.\nBy the power of the great Dao-mind, the true sage-mind, the boundless mind, the unobstructed intent, the inconceivable intent, and the power of merit,\nmay the repentant one—from beginningless time through rebirth after rebirth to this very life and day, the nine ancestors and seven generations, one’s own kin, both living and deceased—have all deluded thoughts and inverted karmic causes dissolved through this repentance.\nFrom this day forward, may they realize the true sage-mind and walk the Way of Non-Action.\nMay evil thoughts and evil karma never again be created.\nFurther, by the power of the sages and the power of the Dao, may all beings enter the realm of attentive hearing, attain peace and bliss, and awaken to the great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Three: Removing Doubts**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each directing their minds, reverently face the Merciful One to repent the karmic offenses of doubt.\nThe repentant one gathers their thoughts with utmost sincerity, listens attentively to the scriptural words, and reflects: though the body of beings is fleeting and illusory, it possesses form—pain and itch, ache and soreness, hunger and cold, heat and dampness, inner disturbances and outer contacts, each thought assailing the next.\nThe mind unbalanced, sorrow and affliction arise together.\nHow, through contemplation, can these be swiftly eradicated?\n\nThe Merciful One says: doubt is but delusion and falsehood.\nAll that has form is fleeting and illusory, each thought impermanent.\nBeings cling to it, falsely perceiving it as real.\nIf one knows the body is not real, all sufferings vanish.\nSimply forget the self, and all delusions are extinguished—how then could pain and itch, ache and soreness remain?\n\nThe Universal Savior says: the doubts of beings are deeply entrenched; to suddenly forget the self is truly unattainable.\nWhat expedient means can gradually reveal the causes and conditions?\n\nThe Merciful One says: one must resolve the will, contemplate the body with wisdom, listen and reflect carefully—finding no true substance—and yet still generate doubt, which leads to sinking and drowning.\nThese beings, their karmic actions impure, receive differing retributions.\nLike form scattering shadow, like echo responding to sound,\nnobility and baseness, good and evil, must manifest in gradation.\n\nThough these gradations exist, beings fail to comprehend their fundamental nature.\nThey see the long-lived yet do not know their longevity arises from diligent observance of precepts.\nThey see the short-lived yet do not know their brevity arises from slaughter.\nThey see the wealthy and noble yet do not know their fortune arises from aiding the poor and relieving suffering.\nThey see the impoverished and lowly yet do not know their plight arises from greed, theft, and insatiability.\nThey merely see the long-lived and desire longevity for themselves;\nthey merely see the wealthy and desire wealth for themselves.\nSuch yearnings—who is without them?\nUnknowing of past karmic causes and conditions, their fate is already determined at birth.\nThis is called delusion—such are these beings.\n\nWhenever they encounter scriptures and repentance rites, they cannot recite or deeply believe them, thus giving rise to scorn and slander.\nThey see the realms beyond the Three Realms yet do not believe them to be blissful;\nthey see the realms within the Three Realms yet do not know them to be suffering.\nBeyond the Three Realms lies effortless freedom, heavenly joy, celestial raiment and sustenance, and longevity spanning kalpas—yet they call this suffering.\nWithin the Three Realms, sun and moon hasten, cold and heat alternate, the four hundred and four illnesses afflict, laws and prisons constrain, blades and warfare rage, floods and fires consume, birth, aging, sickness, and death prevail—yet they call this bliss.\nTheir nature and perception differ, giving rise to delusion.\n\nThey see others observing long fasts and eating plain fare, eschewing adornment, wearing coarse garments and partaking of simple food, their forms like withered wood and their hearts like cold ash—yet do not recognize their transcendence and liberation, only desiring to inflict harm upon themselves.\nThey see others upholding precepts, reciting scriptures, and practicing the Dao with unwavering diligence, praying for the nation’s peace and their own liberation—yet dismiss it as pointless, thus bringing suffering upon themselves.\nThey see beauty and conceive slanderous thoughts.\nThey see others copying scriptures and sacred images yet do not generate faith; instead, they knit their brows and cast sidelong glances, joining in disparagement.\nThough incapable of such practices themselves, they harbor doubt in all things.\n\nBefore the Three Sages, they raise doubts;\nbefore the Dao altar, they raise doubts;\nbefore the scriptures, they raise doubts;\nbefore the true images, they raise doubts.\nSuch beings exhaust body and mind in ceaseless toil, their thoughts and intentions ever stirring, their resolves and imaginings giving rise to endless doubt.\nWhen will they ever pause?\nUnknowing how to seek the true principle and dispel their doubts, they indulge their karmic roots and wallow in hesitation.\nThose who recognize the truth find demonic delusions naturally dispelled;\nthose who do not recognize it find their doubts ever deepening.\nSuch people, upon death, enter the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where they receive differing retributions.\n\nThe Merciful One, moved by compassion, once more proclaims this gāthā:\nBorn into the world with a doubting heart,\nthey die and enter the Wind-and-Thunder Hell.\nTheir limbs severed inch by inch,\nthey weep in sorrow day and night.\nThey traverse sword trees and blade mountains,\ntheir pain piercing bone and marrow.\nReborn in the bodies of birds and beasts,\ntheir retribution knows no end.\n\nToday, in this grand Dao altar, if any among you remain hesitant and doubtful, failing to sever such thoughts in this life, they will only grow in the next.\nIt is through the accumulation of good deeds that one attains freedom from transgression.\nYou have not yet escaped the cycle of birth and death, the turning wheel of rebirth.\nIf you receive such retribution, what regret will suffice?\n\nNow, having encountered this Dao altar’s repentance rite, you may cleanse past transgressions.\nWith sincere devotion, prostrate yourselves.\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, knows that life is fleeting, the body uncertain.\nA lifetime is but a moment; how many days are there in a hundred years?\nFrom kalpas immeasurable, you have cast off lives and taken new births, until this present life and day.\nIndulging the six senses, you have given rise to doubts.\nTogether with your teachers, fellow disciples, parents, uncles, brothers, and all kin—those living and deceased—you have accumulated deluded and karmic transgressions, never awakening to them.\nToday, we prostrate for peace and offer this repentance rite.\nWith five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, listen attentively.\nWe bow our heads to the Merciful One, reverently honoring the true sages.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy, Bestower of Blessings.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Through Sound.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Tablet and Dharma Treasury.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Reveals the Luminous Pearl.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Transformation, the Primordial Sovereign.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Dharma.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Purple Ultimate.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True and Wondrous Form.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Immeasurable Life.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Measure.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Virtue and Dao.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Supreme Perfected King.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Radiant Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to the Perfected.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Response.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Pristine Perfection.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Life.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Safeguards Destiny.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, the Great One Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Protects the Nation.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reach.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wish.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Recluse Perfected.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected Who Delivers from Suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Compassionate Perfected Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Merciful Perfected Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the altar’s sponsor, so-and-so, and all present reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all the venerable sages, all the great perfected, all the divine youths, those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless cosmos, and encompass past, future, hidden, and manifest—all true sages—to practice the method of gathering thoughts.\n\nMay the repentance master, so-and-so, and all kin from nine generations and seven lineages, both living and deceased, who have given rise to doubts and received this repentance rite, attain liberation and enter the gate of faith.\nMay they steadfastly uphold their resolve, take aspiration as their heart, perceive both inner and outer dharmas, cultivate goodness and perform meritorious deeds, copy scriptures and make offerings to sacred images—without giving rise to doubt or encountering obstacles.\n\nUpon beholding men and women of upright bearing, as well as all manner of good deeds in the world, one vows to forever revere, comply with joy, and encourage such persons, wishing them to attain good fruit. May this extend universally to all beings—those of the four modes of birth and six paths of existence—so that together they may transcend and realize the supreme Dao.\n*One bow*\n\n**Chapter Four: Extinguishing the Fire of the Mind**\n\nToday, within this Daoist sanctuary, each member of the assembly directs their mind, gazing reverently toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting and extinguishing the karmic offenses of the mind’s fire.\n\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, joins palms, bows in full prostration, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings, from the first division of south and north, gradually recognize east and west. They cherish the fine and despise the coarse, delight in wealth and resent poverty, their convictions shaping their actions. They fail to measure short and long, covet profit and forget gratitude, estrange kin and favor outsiders. At the sight of adornments, they are insatiable; upon hearing plain truth, they react as if to a foe or enemy. Mountains are likened to sin, while wind resembles good fruit.\n\nMoreover, their wisdom is narrow and shallow, their qi coarse and foolish. They act with abandon, clinging to their own rightness in speech. Greed knows no bounds, and vexation is endless. They regard goodness as an enemy and rejoice at evil. Though they amass vast wealth, they still claim destitution; though their karmic deeds are deep and numerous, they insist all is just. From beginning to end, they neither perceive nor comprehend. Months and years accumulate, yet they neither repent nor regret.\n\nDoubt and delusion arise from the mind itself; ignorance, attachment, greed, and anger also spring from the mind. The mind generates anger and joy, yet ancestral roots and fundamental integrity remain unsteady. They indulge in wine and take life, reveling in their desires. Though their attire is refined—silks adorning their forms—lustful thoughts arise, bringing ruin to families and nations. They boast of youth and strength, flaunting splendor, scorning virtuous friends while clinging to wicked companions. From dawn to dusk, they wallow in confusion, sinking into night’s delirium. They fail to recognize kin or honor parents. Once deluded, they do not turn back—like fire consuming a mountain, wind and flame raging fiercely, nearly impossible to extinguish.\n\nWind stirs atop fire, its intent rooted in the human heart. Fire blazes, wind rises, the mind pursues, and intention follows. Foolish and common, they cling to defilement as truth. Thoughts stir the wind, blending into illusion.\n\nThereupon, the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:\n\n> Anger’s thoughts are demonic foes,\n> Words diverge, discord grows.\n> Wills clash, countenances darken,\n> Glowering eyes, brows slanted—\n> Like the five-hued serpent’s glare.\n> Death comes in an instant,\n> Entangling one in hell’s torment.\n> Exhort all beings to reform and repent,\n> Lest they linger in prison’s snare.\n> But if the great Dao-mind is aroused,\n> All karmic obstacles dissolve and fade.\n\nAt that time, the Merciful Honored One addressed the assembly of universal salvation, saying: “The offenses of sentient beings arise from the mind and are extinguished by the mind. With but a single thought, all may be dispelled. Karma’s bonds cling to the body like a rope binding a bird. Though it may wander east, west, south, or north, it flies only as far as the rope allows, feeding wherever it lands, believing itself free. Yet it does not perceive the one who holds the rope, drawing it near to seize it. Only when captured does it know terror. Once in hand, its life and death rest with another. Though it cries and pleads, flapping in distress, there is no escape, no savior.\n\nThe karmic deeds of humans are likewise. Failing to restrain the six senses, they indulge the seven consciousnesses, committing all manner of evil without reflection. Karmic bonds form, and they are reborn according to their deeds. The invisible rope of karma binds their minds. Though born into wealth and nobility, or among animals, hungry ghosts, sickness, and evil destinies—wherever they transform, they find fleeting joy, believing themselves content, utterly unaware. Their former creditors, the karmic adversaries, await in the unseen realm, tracking their deeds to claim them. Disaster strikes unseen. Suffering and affliction arise, yet they do not awaken. They blame the gods, embrace false views, kill living beings in sacrifice, endure past misfortunes, and forge new enmities. In that moment, there is no savior, no recourse.\n\nToday, all within this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures describe, must reflect deeply and stand in awe. The invisible rope of karma is none other than unwholesomeness. The suffering of rebirth is wrought by the mind. Without repentance, how can it be dispelled? Just as form and shadow arise from ignorance and vanish with its cessation, one must cultivate shame and remorse, purifying body and mind, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this present life, having cast off and received countless bodies—along with masters, teachers, disciples, superiors, inferiors, parents, siblings, and all kin—has, through the fire of the mind, created karmic conditions beyond measure or reckoning.

If one encounters another who awakens the true and upright heart, cultivating all good fruits, regardless of whether they have attained fulfillment or are still preparing, may we turn our minds and thoughts with joy and humility, clearly advancing that person. May their vows for good conditions, the deliverance of all beings in the Dharma Realm, and ourselves, our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, the four kinds of birth and six paths of existence, all together attain liberation and return to the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n*End of the Second Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms*\n\n*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms*\n\nThe Venerable Left Immortal Lord Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate has compiled this text.\n\n**Chapter One: Severing Afflictions**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting and severing the karmic offenses of afflictions.\n\nThe repentant master, with gathered mind and kneeling in reverence, listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, born from the shelter of their parents’ wombs, may grow in wealth or poverty in youth, rise to nobility or fall into lowliness, commit a single evil or a hundred evils, be male or female—yet they do not comprehend the cycles of rebirth, nor discern its beginning or end.\n\nFor afflictions exist. Afflictions arise from clinging to views; clinging to views arises from inversion; inversion arises from delusion; delusion arises from doubt; doubt arises from manifold sufferings; and manifold sufferings arise from all karmic deeds.\n\nOnce karmic deeds are created, impermanence presses upon them, leaving no freedom.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One addressed Universal Salvation, saying: \"Afflictions are what cause sentient beings to take form and dwell in the human world. Not only do the rich and noble, the poor and lowly, men and women all seek clothing and food, but they must also pursue the conditions of life, provide for their needs, sustain their daily use, be bound by royal laws, constrained by hierarchies of honor and humility, unite with kin, and distinguish between love and attachment—even unto old age, sickness, and death. Or, failing to complete their allotted lifespan, they drift with their karma, flowing into the Three Evil Realms, gradually distancing themselves from the paths of humans and heavens. Unaware of the suffering of impermanence, they do not awaken.\n\nYet those with wisdom and clarity, who embody the absence of thought, who possess insight and perceive delusion, who discern doubt—do not regard these as suffering. They abide in ease and joy, following their thoughts to generate intentions, and their intentions to create karma. They cling to views as truth, invert right and wrong, conjure delusions in response to circumstances, and pursue desires with doubt. Indulging the six senses, they commit sins as numerous as the grains of the Ganges; neglecting the three karmic actions, they sow seeds for boundless hells. All this stems from afflictions, which defile body and mind.\n\nWith a body, there are afflictions; without a body, there are no afflictions. Since afflictions exist, one must cultivate and practice.\n\nUniversal Salvation asked: \"What good must be cultivated to depart from afflictions?\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: \"Extinguish the three karmic actions and establish the three virtuous practices: the virtuous practice of the mind, the virtuous practice of the body, and the virtuous practice of speech.\n\nFirst, the virtuous practice of the mind: (1) not coveting, (2) not harboring anger, and (3) not being deluded. Be pure and self-disciplined, desire little and know contentment, restrain greed and abandon the pursuit of profit, be compassionate and patient, gentle and forgiving, subdue anger and remain free from resentment, contemplate the subtle and abide in stillness, comprehend existence and penetrate non-existence, and with wisdom, clearly understand all dharmas. This is called the virtuous practice of the mind.\n\nNext, the virtuous practice of the body: (1) not killing, (2) not stealing, and (3) not engaging in improper sexual conduct. Be benevolent and wise, broadly giving alms, pitying all beings, saving lives and delivering the dying, humble and yielding, taking nothing that is not rightfully yours, and relinquishing body, life, and wealth without reluctance. Be truly pure and clean, far from improper conduct, free from lust and desire, and keep the mind from dissipation. This is called the virtuous practice of the body.\n\nAs for the virtuous practice of speech: (1) not lying, (2) not using flowery or deceptive language, (3) not engaging in divisive speech, and (4) not uttering abusive words. Speak truthfully, without falsehood; let your words be genuine, free from embellishment; let your expressions be balanced, upright, and without duplicity; do not create divisions or take sides; let your voice be harmonious, soft, and clear; skillfully expound the Dharma and recite the profound verses. This is called the virtuous practice of speech.\n\nWhen the three practices are virtuous, there is no doubt. Without doubt, there is no delusion. Without delusion, there is no inversion. Without inversion, there is no clinging to views. Without clinging to views, there are no afflictions. Without afflictions, there are no manifold sufferings. Without manifold sufferings, there are no karmic deeds. Without karmic deeds, there is peace and joy, and one enters the Dao of Non-Action.\"\n\nUpon hearing the teaching of the three virtuous practices, Universal Salvation realized that all sentient beings could be cured of the illness of afflictions. Praising the Merciful Honored One, he composed this verse:\n\nI bow to the true Dharma Lord among the sages,\nWho expounds the medicine for the afflictions of beings.\nThe priceless treasure within the hearts of beings\nIs ever plundered by the six thieves.\nThe arrow of anger pierces the heart,\nThe lock of ignorance and attachment has no key.\nThe shackles of self and others confine the body,\nWhile the demonic thoughts of the six relations plunder it.\nNow, relying on the three virtuous practices to drive them away,\nFor endless kalpas, the four marks shall not cling.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, along with the repentant master, having heard of these afflictions, must deeply reflect. For countless kalpas, we have witnessed all sufferings. What was once deemed joy is now suffering in this life, yet we cannot awaken, cannot sever afflictions. Instead, they increase, entangling us in past karma, trapping us in this illusory world, obscuring the Great Dao, and preventing us from awakening to the true essence. Afflictions and calamities arise daily, binding us ever tighter.\n\nNow, having encountered the scriptural teachings of the Merciful Honored One, who broadly expounds the Dharma gates and elucidates afflictions, we are lifted from ignorance. May all sentient beings awaken.\n\nThe repentant master, from beginningless kalpas until the present kalpa, in this life and today, along with nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, both the living and the deceased, and all kin—having indulged the three karmic actions of the body, the four of speech, and the ten of the mind, from beginningless ignorance—have created the Three Poisons, the Four Destinies, the Five Hindrances, the Six Dusts, the Seven Leaks, the Eight Defilements, the Nine Knots, and the Ten Entanglements, leaving us without freedom. Afflictions have confined us in cages, casting us into the currents of transmigration.\n\nToday, encountering this repentance ritual is like the sun at noon, the moon at night, the blind regaining sight, the mute speaking, the deaf hearing, the guilty receiving pardon. Prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, with a single mind, I bow to the Merciful Honored One and reverently pay homage to the true sages.\n\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\n\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of Mysterious Reality.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Flies Through the World.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Yang’s Transformations.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Turns My Body.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mirror-Pure Heart.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Mystery.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Peace and Stillness.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Gate of Mystery.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Purity.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Liberates from Birth and Death.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Adornment.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Contemplates the Wondrous Body.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Universal Covering.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Mystery.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects the Spirits.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Turns the Dharma.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of True Mystery.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Flourishing Yang.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reach.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Left Mysterious Perfected.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Right Mysterious Perfected.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this ritual arena, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Immortals and Great Perfected, all the Heavenly Hosts and Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, manifest and hidden, all true sages. May they together extend their virtuous power to save and protect all beings. May the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, forever sever afflictions, depart from defilement, and for past and present lives, generate virtuous power to assist those in the Three Wretched Realms, forever escape evil destinies, and may all of us attain rebirth in the pure and joyful lands of the ten directions. May all afflictions, habitual sins, and karmic causes, through this repentance, be wholly dissolved. From this day forward, may we practice the true appearance of the Dao, without laziness or negligence. May we attain the power of wisdom and expedient means, dispel all calamities, safeguard the realm, liberate the six paths—both hidden and manifest—deliver the distant souls of the nine generations and three lineages, and together escape the cages of confinement, ascending together to the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Second Section: Repentance of the Dusts and Toils of Suffering**\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, each person directs their mind, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of all the dusts and toils of suffering. The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, collects their mind, surrenders their life, takes refuge, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nAll beings, from the moment of birth and the formation of their bodies, bear the round heavens upon their heads and tread the square earth beneath their feet. Their flesh is foul and filthy, their bones and flesh rank and base. They do not avoid the stars and constellations, constantly offending wind and rain, accumulating these yang transgressions, inevitably incurring yin offenses. Within heaven and earth, regardless of high or low status, the categories of sins are boundless. Some sins arise from the three karmas, some from the six roots, some from the inner mind’s perversity, some from attachment to external conditions. Some arise from the Three Poisons giving rise to the Four Perversions, some from the three karmas generating the one hundred and eight afflictions, some from the five views producing the sixty-two views, some from the ten evils giving rise to forty kinds of evil, some from the six senses generating the eighty-four thousand gates of dusts and toils. Or from a single thought in a single moment, the Four Perversions arise, the one hundred and eight afflictions are generated, the sixty-two views are established, the forty kinds of evil are committed, and the eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering are created. How much more so for a day, a month, a year—arising from thoughts and intentions? How much more so after passing through kalpas, giving rise to manifold sins? Thus, the toils of suffering follow one after another, without end.\n\nNow, the root of these sins arises from three kinds. The Universal Savior says: What are the three? The first is vexation, the second is karma, the third is thought. Due to these three, one cannot perceive the sages nor the wondrous and excellent affairs of humans and heavens. If in a single day, a single hour, a single thought, one awakens to these three hindrances—even the three karmas, six roots, one hundred and eight afflictions, sixty-two views, forty kinds of evil, and eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering—all may be purified.\n\nYet these beings do not believe my words, do not follow the scriptural teachings, do not know how to resolve enmity, do not seek liberation. They accumulate evil as numerous as the sands, their sins filling heaven and earth. The Three Poisons, Ten Evils, Five Views, Six Dusts, Six Defilements, Six Entrances—these give rise to uninterrupted karmic offenses. Or they commit incomplete practices, sever karmic actions through faith, slander the Heavenly Worthies, revile the Three Treasures, destroy the worthy and sagely, ruin the true Dharma, disbelieve in sin and merit. They commit the Ten Evil Karmas: delusion turning truth into falsehood, foolish and confused karma; disloyalty to the sovereign, treacherous and flattering karma; unfilial conduct toward parents, rebellious karma; disrespect toward honored teachers, irreverent karma; betrayal of friends, unrighteous karma; committing the Four Grave Offenses that obstruct the sagely Dao; violating pure precepts, breaking the Eight Observances; transgressing the Five Precepts and Seven Hindrances, incomplete and flawed karma; disbelieving the Ten Precepts, regardless of severity, defiling thoughts with expedient means; failing to observe the six long fasts and ten monthly fasts, inconsistent cultivation; improper conduct within the various dignified deportments; the two thousand four hundred subtle dignified deportments; hindering the cultivation of bodily precepts, mental concentration, and wisdom; committing various offenses during the spring and autumn Eight Kings’ festivals; engaging in manifold evils, violating the six dignified deportments; lacking compassion toward suffering beings, unfeeling and unmindful karma; failing to rescue or aid, lacking salvation and protection; harboring jealousy, generating self-and-other karma; unequal treatment of enemies and loved ones; indulging in the Five Desires without weariness, failing to renounce; seeking ease through clothing, food, gardens, baths, and ponds, generating frivolous karma; or directing leaky merit toward the Three Sages, obstructing the path of leaving the household. Such karmas are boundless and immeasurable, impossible to fully recount.\n\nUniversal Salvation asked, \"With what mind should one act to extinguish these karmic obstructions and transgressions?\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied, \"First, one must arouse seven kinds of wholesome minds as expedient means to achieve their eradication. What are the seven?\n\n1. Shame and remorse,\n2. Fear and dread,\n3. Weariness and renunciation,\n4. The arising of the supreme wholesome mind,\n5. Equal regard for enemies and loved ones,\n6. Mindfulness of repaying the kindness of the Heavenly Worthy, the sovereign, the master, and parents,\n7. Contemplation that all delusive thoughts and the nature of transgressions are empty.\n\nIf one fails to cultivate these wholesome minds and does not arise repentance, calamities will afflict distant ancestors, misfortunes will taint future generations, and in this present life, one will suffer blindness, deafness, and chronic illness. At death, one will fall into the nine dark hells, remaining for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—emaciated, ghostly, and inhuman in form.\"\n\nThen the Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:\n\nIf one harbors an unwholesome mind,\nAnd without cause commits manifold karmas—\nEven a single thread or hair,\nOr countless billions—\nAt death, one enters the eighteen hells,\nEnduring every kind of suffering.\nLater reborn among starving tigers,\nForever denied a full meal.\nEven if one gains a human body,\nOne is slain by water, fire, or the sword,\nOr suffers chronic illness,\nMadness, or epilepsy.\n\nToday, in this grand Dharma assembly, as the scripture declares, we ought to be deeply terrified. Within this body lie such toils and afflictions—how, through kalpas uncounted, could we have awakened to them, shrouded as we are in ignorance? Some commit the ten evils themselves; others teach the ten evils; still others praise the ten evils or openly advance them. With every thought and every moment, one dwells upon the ten evils. Even for a single hair’s weight of transgression, one will one day receive its retribution—how could remorse then avail?\n\nNow, we must strive with diligence and repent with vigor. Whether in the six paths or among the four modes of birth, seeing those who suffer or are yet to suffer, I now generate the aspiration that all may equally attain liberation.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, prostrates in reverence, dedicating this repentance rite for peace and to offer posthumous merit. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he bows his head to the Merciful Honored One and pays homage to the true sages.\n\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Mysterious Perfection Heavenly Worthy of myriad blessings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and delivers the Dragon Kings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the ten-thousand-kalpa turning wheel.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions who respond to all names.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy beyond thought and discussion.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who eliminates afflictions.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of lofty and far-reaching virtue.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of dust-like marvels.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose body radiates the Dharma.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose wisdom is invincible.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the profound and ultimate Dharma.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Supreme Purity Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who advances the Dao.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and responds.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who knows suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms beings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of faith and wisdom.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers from distress.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transcends immortals.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who ensures long life and preserves destiny.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who protects the realm.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to wishes.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose merit is like the ocean.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of wondrous efficacy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of profound understanding.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great mercy who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the sponsor of this Dharma assembly and all present reverently aspire that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the southern direction, all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected ones, all the great divine immortals, all the great celestial immortals, and all the great youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, responding to every name—all true sages, may with the Great Mysterious Water wash away the karmic afflictions, transgressions, and toils of the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, his parents who gave him life, his masters who transmitted the Dharma and conferred ordination, his uncles, brothers, male and female kin, and all sentient beings bound by present and past conditions, infinite and immeasurable.\n\nBy the power of this repentance, may we rely on the power of the Dao, the power of the true sages, the power of the repentance rite, the power of cause and effect, the inconceivable power, and the power of merit, so that all may be extinguished, all views awakened, and the profound principle thoroughly understood. May all beings, without exception, transcend the toils and transgressions of worldly dust, realize the unconditioned, and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\n\n**Chapter Three: Returning to Faith and Reverence**\n\nToday, in this grand Dharma assembly, each person directs their mind upward to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of irreverence and lack of faith.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, bows his head and kneels in reverence, listening attentively to the scripture’s words: All sentient beings, creating evil causes and acting inappropriately, harbor minds like raging fire, burning fiercely without discrimination. Whether ugly or fair, their thoughts are sharp as blades, their severity sparing neither strong nor weak. Over time, days accumulate into months, months into years, yet they fail to cultivate even a moment’s goodness. Day by day, their transgressions grow, and their enmities multiply, increasing their suffering karma and consigning them to eternal submersion.\n\nFrom past conditions to present, from kalpa to kalpa, with every thought and intention, they generate irreverence and lack of faith, slandering the Three Sages, defaming the Three Sages, belittling the Three Sages, defiling the Three Sages, mocking the Three Sages, cursing the Three Sages, reviling the Three Sages, deceiving the Three Sages, arrogantly scorning the Three Sages, contemptuously deriding the Three Sages, devouring the offerings to the Three Sages, deluding the Three Sages, encroaching upon the Three Sages, wasting and damaging the possessions of the Three Sages.\n\nThey disparage scriptures and repentance texts, debate their authenticity, recklessly discuss gains and losses, obstinately argue right and wrong, distinguish shallow and deep, and collectively criticize strengths and weaknesses. Their appearance is unclean, their clothing is unclean, their hands and feet are unclean, their sandals are unclean, their breath is unclean.\n\nThey drink wine and eat meat, consuming pungent and spicy foods, uttering foul language, their hearts lacking reverence. Some do not wash their hands, some do not burn incense, some do not rinse their mouths, some do not bathe, yet they enter the sacred altar or approach the Dharma seat. Some go to the Daoist sanctuary to listen to the Dharma and sutras, pressing close to the revered images, defiling the true sages—divine immortals, spirit persons, jade lads and jade maidens, vajra guardian kings, heavenly marshals, and mighty warriors, the protective and awe-inspiring deities.\n\nSome, in the presence of the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the scriptures and Dharma, or the monastic Dharma-body, display arrogance and disdain, refusing to bow in reverence or prostrate in sincerity. Some lie down while listening to the great virtuous masters expound the Three Caverns’ Mahayana scriptures. Some, reeking of wine, meat, and pungent foods, ride in carriages or on horses straight into the sanctuary, approaching the Heavenly Worthy to read or recite scriptures and repentance texts. Some, upon seeing others observe fasts and receive precepts, refuse to believe or follow, dismissing them as hypocritical. Some bring men and women together into the sanctuary to listen to the Dharma and sutras, speaking loudly and disrupting the assembly. Some, when speaking or forming intentions, first debate right and wrong, comparing merits and virtues. Some rely on the Three Treasures to cunningly seek wealth. Some misuse the Dharma teachings to deceive men and women. Some embezzle the wealth of the Three Treasures to sustain themselves. Some threaten or coerce monastics, seeking their faults to extort their possessions and support their families. Some carry scriptures and images into the marketplace to preach. Some, while traveling, falsely claim merit to gather wealth for themselves. Some pawn scriptures and images, lending them for profit to provide for their kin. Some, when expounding the Dharma from high seats, take the offerings for their own use. Some, without studying the scriptures, precepts, talismans, or ritual texts, set themselves up as masters, accepting offerings. Some indiscriminately recruit disciples, not selecting the worthy, and transmit the scriptures and Dharma, leaking true secrets. Some, without following the regulations, receive teachings from masters, acting on their own whims to alter or augment the scriptures and Dharma. Some expose sacred images to dust and filth, damaging the permanent abode. Some let halls and temples collapse, defiling the scriptures and Dharma. Some destroy banners, lamps, and merit offerings, disrespecting the radiant countenances. Some steal precious scriptures, treating them like common texts. Some privately copy them without care, mixing them with mundane books, showing no reverence. Some place beds and pillows where they sleep beside them. Some, in their chambers, leave foul and disorderly messes, handling pungent foods while reciting true scriptures. Some betray the Dao and their masters, violating their vows.\n\nAll such intentions and mental formations transgress the bright statutes and violate the precepts. These offenses are measureless and boundless. If one commits even the slightest act of irreverence or disbelief, in this life their family will be incomplete, their departed kin will suffer, and they themselves will receive the karmic retribution of leprosy. Upon death, they will fall into the Nine Dark Hells, enduring ten thousand kalpas before rebirth, where they will take the form of wild beasts.\n\nThen, the Compassionate Worthy, for the sake of those yet to awaken, spoke these verses:\n\nBorn into the world without reverence,\nDefiling the true forms of the Dao.\nThe lofty sages and immortal perfected,\nSpirit persons and divine beings,\nJade lads and jade maidens,\nVajra guardians and mighty warriors,\nAttendant protective deities—\nAll such sacred forms,\nIf damaged or treated with contempt,\nDefiled and disrespected,\nSlandering monastics,\nSpeaking without propriety,\nStriking, scolding, oppressing, or neglecting,\nCommitting lewd acts or mocking,\nArrogant and scornful,\nDebating the scriptures and Dharma,\nForcibly arguing right and wrong,\nBreaking fasts and precepts,\nStealing the wealth of the Three Treasures,\nAll manner of irreverence—\nUpon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells,\nEnduring the eighteen realms of suffering.\nTheir feet tread upon mountains of knives,\nTheir hands grasp trees of swords.\nNaked, they embrace bronze pillars,\nTheir bare bodies lie upon iron beds.\nFire mountains rest upon their heads,\nIron rods press upon their backs.\nHungry, they eat burning coals;\nThirsty, they drink molten bronze.\nBoiling cauldrons seethe and scald,\nFire chariots burn their bodies.\nPounded by pestles, ground by mills,\nHung upside down or stood on their heads,\nSawn apart, sliced by blades,\nNeedles pierce their limbs and joints.\nNarrow gorges crush their bodies,\nFrigid ice severs their sinews and bones.\nScorching embers chase them east and west,\nLeaping and stumbling without rest.\nAbiding in foul and stinking places,\nDrowning in dark and turbid waters,\nPoured into the four rivers,\nEvil birds peck out their eyes.\nBronze dogs bite and tear,\nPoisonous snakes compete to devour.\nOx-headed demons break their spines,\nDying and reviving ten thousand times a day.\nUnbearable pain—\nIn life, they suffer leprosy.\nToday, the great assembly in this sanctuary,\nHearing these verses as the scriptures describe,\nShould deeply reflect in alarm and sorrow.\nHow can one awaken to such karmic causes?\nIf such sins are committed, retribution is inescapable;\nWhen remorse comes, it will be too late.\nEach should diligently advance,\nSincerely repent their transgressions.\nIf, within the six paths, one takes the four forms of birth—\nGreat or small bodies—\nThey devour one another.\nIf retribution has not yet been received,\nNow, with reverence,\nMay all be liberated.\n\nThe repentance master [Name] prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text for the deliverance of the departed. With five limbs touching the ground, wholeheartedly they arise in devotion:\nProstrating to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently bowing to the true sages.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Hearer of Cries Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Mysterious

Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, to all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Heavenly Immortals, all the Great Divine Youths, all the Great Dragon Spirits—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless void, manifesting and concealed, all true and sacred beings.\nWe humbly pray that the realms of suffering be swept away, and the roots of evil be eradicated.\nThe penitent, so-and-so, from the time of this bodily existence, for all transgressions committed, now repents with utmost sincerity, and with a single thought, beseeches their dissolution.\nFrom this day forward, may we constantly hold faith and reverence, reflect upon past wrongs, and purify the heart in remorse.\nMay we, in future lives, turn the wheel without cease, attain eternal longevity, and may the departed souls all ascend to the realms of rebirth.\nMay our present kin ever dwell in blessed lands.\nMay we realize the formless, and swiftly ascend to the sacred fruit.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Four: Removing Obstacles**\n\nToday, in this Dao altar, each member of the assembly directs their mind, reverently facing the Compassionate Venerable, repenting the sins of obstacles.\nThe penitent, so-and-so, kneels with utmost sincerity, attentively listening to the scriptural words:\nAll sentient beings, through the mind of greed and desire, arouse the six consciousnesses, the six dusts, the six desires, and the six defilements, giving rise to deluded and false thoughts, generating all manner of obstacles.\nClearly committing sins, yet the mind remains unaware.\nRepeatedly doing wrong, yet words still claim righteousness.\nAll due to ignorance—how can one recognize transgressions?\nOnly seeing others’ faults while praising one’s own virtues, how can one distinguish others’ reverence?\nUnaware of my own inferiority, I divide bodies into noble and base, high and low, never equal.\nThe noble dwell in lofty halls and towering chambers, draped in purple and girded with gold, with vermilion walls and pepper-scented chambers, jade terraces and cinnabar railings.\nThe base are barefoot servants, following behind and leading ahead, their voices faint, their demeanor lowly.\nThe wealthy wear light furs and ride fat horses, feasting on fine delicacies, their words resonant as bells, their hearts vast as the sea.\nThe poor are consumed by hunger and cold, neglecting rites and propriety, their words and deeds at odds, their actions improper.\nIn these bodily karmas, how can one uphold and maintain? The transgressions multiply—who can awaken?\nYet within the world’s snare, the mind of obstruction arises.\nObstructing others from taking refuge in the Three Treasures and the sacred teachings of the Heavenly Worthy.\nObstructing others from believing in and revering the scriptures and Dao of the Great Way.\nObstructing others from loyalty to the sovereign.\nObstructing others from serving and honoring masters, superiors, and those of the Dharma.\nObstructing others from filial piety toward parents.\nObstructing others from turning scriptures and practicing the Dao for the realm.\nObstructing others from eliminating calamities and seeking blessings for the family.\nObstructing others from diligent service to the realm.\nObstructing others from toiling for the family.\nObstructing others from arousing the mind for the supreme Dao.\nObstructing others from chanting and singing the Dao.\nObstructing others from upholding precepts and maintaining purity.\nObstructing others from liberating lives.\nObstructing others from reciting scriptures to cultivate goodness.\nObstructing others from enduring humiliation and bearing shame.\nObstructing others from joyful almsgiving.\nObstructing others from diligent cultivation.\nObstructing others from dwelling in mountains and valleys, practicing qi absorption and exhalation.\nObstructing others from seeking the Dao and pursuing ascension.\nObstructing others from copying scriptures and adorning scroll ribbons.\nObstructing others from sculpting sacred images to inspire faith.\nObstructing others from constructing numinous altars and Daoist abbeys, and inviting others to reside and maintain them.\nObstructing others from preparing vegetarian feasts and making offerings.\nObstructing others from disciplining the body and refining conduct, polishing the heart and nature.\nObstructing others from making offerings to the Dharma body.\nObstructing others from reverent incense offerings and cultivation.\nObstructing others from equality and non-duality.\nObstructing others from leaving worldly defilements and forever removing afflictions.\nObstructing others from repenting and confessing transgressions to escape calamities.\nObstructing others from maintaining the altar’s incense and lamps day and night.\nObstructing others from cultivating wisdom and intelligence through constant study of scriptures.\nObstructing others from learning arts to adorn their name and body.\nObstructing others through affection and love.\nObstructing others through bonds of sentiment.\nObstructing others through profit and aid.\nObstructing others through instruction and guidance.\nObstructing others through greed and attachment.\nObstructing others through disdain and contempt.\nObstructing others through indulgence and falsehood.\nObstructing others from all manner of good deeds—even the slightest good deed of another.\nOnce a good deed arises, one must not arbitrarily create obstacles.\nThose who create obstacles, for their own sake, do not recognize that good deeds are the path to liberation from worldly dust. Unable to practice themselves, they instead create mutual obstructions.\nFor every obstacle or hindrance created, one incurs boundless and immeasurable sins, causing one’s present self to suffer old age, illness, solitude, and unfulfilled wishes, and upon death, to enter the Nine Dark Hells, enduring all sufferings. Only after ten thousand kalpas may one be reborn as a fish or turtle, subjected to human carving and slicing.\nWithout repentance, there is no means of liberation.\n\nAt that time, the Compassionate Venerable, saving all sentient beings, spoke this verse:\n*In past lives, without a good heart,*\n*Obstructing all things.*\n*Speaking dark and deceitful words,*\n*Claiming past wrongs as the path.*\n*Bonds of affection and love,*\n*Greed, attachment, and contempt—*\n*Clinging together in evil,*\n*Upon death, entering the Flowing Sands Hell.*\n*Even if reborn as a human,*\n*One suffers poverty, cold, and solitude.*\n*In this life, enduring long illness,*\n*Good medicine turns to poison.*\n\nToday, in this Dao altar, each member of the assembly directs their mind, hearing this verse, truly filled with sorrow and grief.\nIf one bears such sins of obstruction, when retribution comes, it will be difficult to repent and withdraw.\nNow, we must vow to dissolve and remove these karmic obstacles.\nThe penitent, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, fully prostrating with the five limbs, wholeheartedly making this vow.\n\nWe bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One, reverently paying homage to the True Saints.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Mysterious Truth Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies Transformation.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transmits the

reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, King of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Unbounded Sovereign Power.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Great One Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Ensures Longevity and Preserves Life.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Vows.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reach.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Perfected Person of Wondrous Faith.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Perfected Person of Wondrous Sound.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Perfected Person of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Perfected Person of Great Compassion Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the penitent and the entire assembly of this Dao altar, gazing upward, vow to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, to all the Venerable Ones and Saints, all the Great Divine Immortals, all the Great Perfected Beings, all the Great Perfected Persons, and all the Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, hidden and manifest, all True Saints.\n\nBy the inconceivable power of the great Dao, the subtle and wondrous power of merit and virtue, and the responsive power of the Merciful Honored One’s name, may the penitent’s nine generations of ancestors, fellow masters and teachers, disciples and dharma companions, as well as parents, uncles, brothers, and all living and deceased family members—across both this life and the next—have all their heavy karmic obstructions, vast as mountains and deep as the sea, dissolved and eradicated through this act of repentance.\n\nMay they rely on the power of the divine immortals, the dragon deities, the Three Saints, and the Perfected Persons to forever extinguish these obstacles. May those who have sunk into suffering ascend to rebirth, free from further affliction. From this day forward, may they, upon seeing others cultivate all manner of good deeds, never again generate obstacles. May the seeds of goodness grow ever stronger, universally delivering all sentient beings to together transcend into the Pure Land.\n\nOne bow.\n\n*Thus concludes the third scroll of The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and the Nine Dark Realms.*\n*Beginning of the fourth scroll of The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and the Nine Dark Realms.*\n\n*Compiled by the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan.*\n\n**Chapter One: Ceasing Anger and Resentment**\n\nToday, the entire assembly of this Dao altar, each directing their minds, gazing upward to the Merciful Honored One, repent for the karmic offenses of anger and resentment. The penitent, so-and-so, collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, arising from clinging views, give rise to anger and resentment. The source of anger and resentment lies solely in the mind. When the mind generates anger and resentment, it is like fire and wind. When wind and fire blaze fiercely, they soon subside of their own accord. Yet these sentient beings, unable to let go, cling to foolish views, giving rise to anger and resentment. Sometimes, from greed and attachment, the six senses are stirred, defiled by the six dusts, and the thought of anger arises. Or they resent the Heavenly Worthies of the great Dao, deeming their words lacking in truth and uprightness, uttering only frivolous speech, ever devoid of faith. Or they resent heaven and earth, cursing the cold and heat, embracing only ignorance, unashamed before the vastness that covers and supports all. Or they resent the sun, moon, and stars, exposing their bodies without shame, unabashed before their illumination, constantly complaining of their slowness or swiftness. Or they resent the scriptures, dismissing them as empty words, failing to study and explore them, often slandering or praising them. Or they resent their parents, neglecting filial duties, utterly lacking in devotion and care, ungrateful for their toil. Or they resent their brothers, lacking the bond of shared roots, treating them as outsiders, their affection no deeper than distant friends. Or they resent their family members, failing to cultivate kindness and gentleness, deficient in respect toward superiors and unrestrained in their treatment of subordinates. Or they resent the precepts and fasts, performing them without reverence, frequently violating them, lacking in sincerity and devotion. Or they resent the ruler, failing to praise the peace of the realm, harboring thoughts of rebellion and murder, not establishing loyalty and goodness. Or they resent those who expound the teachings, refusing to listen to good causes, uttering only harsh words, confounding truth and falsehood. Or they resent the temples and monasteries, failing to revere and support them, engaging in excessive slander, unwilling to contribute to their construction and maintenance. Or they resent the departed, lacking in memorial rites, not creating good causes to aid their journey in the dark realms. Or they resent the divine principles, neglecting sacrifices, instead trusting in heretical shamans, engaging in licentiousness and killing. Or they resent the elderly, failing to show filial piety, devoid of compassion, attributing their condition to karmic retribution. Or they resent the prisons, not examining the circumstances, constantly speaking of hardships, aiding in the addition of shackles and restraints. Or they resent the poor and lowly, wrongfully oppressing them, making it difficult for them to voice their grievances, unmindful of their hunger and cold, perpetually subjecting them to suffering. Or they resent the birds and beasts, unmindful of their feathers and fur, only indulging in greed and cruelty, seeking only to slaughter and cook them. Or they resent their servants, unable to endure their lowly status, only knowing how to inflict suffering.\n\nSuch anger and resentment—whether already committed or not, whether toward kin or strangers, whether by men or women, whether by humans or non-humans—when the mind conceives and the intention arises, giving rise to anger and resentment, it is like wood giving birth to fire, fire arising naturally. The transgression deepens, the fault becomes most grave, and the departed ancestors remain confined in the dark realms, unable to attain liberation.\n\nThereupon, the Merciful Honored One, observing these sentient beings recklessly indulging in anger and resentment, sighs with compassion and speaks this verse:\n\nAll you men and women,\nListen carefully and reflect well.\nBefore the Heavenly Worthy of the great Dao,\nNever give rise to anger and resentment.\n\nBefore kings and parents,\nIn scripture halls and Daoist sanctuaries,\nBeside preachers who expound and praise the Dharma,\nNever give rise to anger and resentment.\nShould you see renunciates,\nOr virtuous ones who revere goodness of heart,\nWho give alms to the poor,\nOr prisoners and wayfarers,\nWho tread upon the orphaned and exposed,\nThe sick and the fatherless—\nYet still, some men and women\nMay conceive anger and resentment.\nLike wood giving birth to fire,\nFire arises naturally in return.\nOnly by relinquishing clinging views\nAnd awakening to the impermanent Dao\ncan this be overcome.\n\nThereupon, the Merciful Honored One spoke again:\nIf sentient beings commit even a single act of anger or resentment,\nIn this life they will suffer from wind and perverse illnesses.\nAt death, they enter the Eight Cold and Eight Hot Hells,\nThen pass through the Needle-Peak Hell,\nWhere only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn—\nTheir bodies as frogs, toads, or *hóu* fish.\nEven if they return to the human realm,\nThey remain dull-witted, clumsy, and malevolent.\nWithout repentance, they sink forever into darkness.\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One, mindful of those yet unawakened,\nproclaimed these verses once more:\n\nIn this world, many harbor anger,\nEver nursing minds of poison and harm.\nTheir thoughts ever constricted,\nThey rage at men, they rage at women,\nAt livestock and servants—\nSuch bodies, seared by sorrow.\nWielding knives or clubs,\nThey seek only to harm.\nFuming with resentment,\nNever knowing even brief joy.\nAt death, they enter the cold and hot hells,\nWhere needles pierce their bodies,\nThrough heart and liver,\nThrough intestines and flanks.\nBlood flows without measure.\nLater, they are reborn as frogs,\nOr mute in the moon’s light,\nOr as *hóu* fish.\nFloating in anger upon the water,\nHawks and kites descend to seize them,\nTearing and devouring their flesh.\nEven if reborn among humans,\nThey suffer the retribution of dullness,\nEver ugly and awkward,\nTheir words lacking skill,\nTheir speech offending others,\nNo one to show them pity.\n\nToday, in this grand assembly,\nAs the scriptures declare,\nAll should reflect deeply:\nThose who bear such sins\nWill endure retribution most profound.\nNow, in repentance,\nMay all attain liberation together.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence,\nOffering this text of repentance for peace and deliverance.\nWith five limbs touching the earth,\nAttending with single-minded focus,\nThey bow their head to the Merciful Honored One,\nAnd pay homage to the true sages:\n\nWith devoted heart, they bow to\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings of Jade Clarity,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Clarity’s Highest Summit,\nThe Nine-Colored Heavenly Worthy of Dragon Form,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preaches in the Fragrant Grove,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Whose True Countenance Radiates Light,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Lamp of Dharma and Sea of Wisdom,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Truly Awakens and Delivers from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Wisdom Who Delivers from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Brilliance Who Extends Lifespan,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Shades All Boundaries,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms the Three Realms,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Non-Action,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Entrusts the Substance,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Talismans,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grove,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Light,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Those to Be Delivered,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Grand Unity Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Realm,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,\nThe Perfected One Who Universally Saves,\nThe Perfected One Who Universally Delivers,\nThe Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this assembly,\nAlong with all present,\nRaises their aspirations toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the southwest,\nAnd all the honored ones, all the sages,\nAll the great Perfected Ones, all the great immortals,\nAll the great divine youths,\nWho pervade the ten directions,\nFill the boundless void,\nAnd manifest as all true sages—\nMay they together emit rays of compassion,\nAnd together extend their sheltering protection.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], from kalpas without measure,\nHas committed sins of anger and resentment without limit.\nToday, in prostration and repentance,\nThey pray for these to be extinguished,\nTo escape retribution,\nAnd attain perpetual purity.\nFrom this day forward,\nMay they never again harbor anger or resentment,\nMay they clearly understand clinging views,\nAnd embody the true and eternal.\n\nMay the departed spirits of their ancestors,\nAnd all their kin—past, present, and future—\nForever sever the bonds of transgression,\nNever traverse the Nine Dark Realms,\nNor the four modes of birth or six paths of existence,\nBut together receive the fruits of karma,\nAnd inherit the supreme Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repentance for Delusion**\n\nToday, in this grand assembly,\nEach person directs their mind,\nBowing their head to the Merciful Honored One,\nRepenting the sins of delusion.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], with reverent faith,\nAttends to the scriptural words:\nAll sentient beings arise from the primal qi in delusion,\nClinging to existence.\nThough they accumulate merit and diligence,\nThey cannot escape obstruction.\nThus, they cultivate good fruits,\nThat they may attain liberation.\n\nYet these sentient beings,\nNot understanding how to cultivate merit,\nAccumulate good virtues,\nBut give rise to the three poisons,\nAnd commit acts of delusion.\nSome curse heaven and earth,\nOr revile spirits and gods.\nSome rebel against rulers and fathers,\nFailing in loyalty and filial piety,\nTurning to perversity,\nEstablishing laws that disrupt order,\nFavoring their own kin within,\nFlattering others without,\nDisbelieving in sin and blessing,\nConceiving thoughts against all bounds,\nClaiming their nature is self-arising,\nEternal and indestructible,\nMaking no distinction between good and evil,\nNo difference between elder and younger,\nPassing through lives and rebirths,\nEver acting in delusion.\nSome, before sacred images,\nOr in places of scripture and Dharma,\nOr before Dharma masters,\nOr beside kings, parents, or teachers,\nOr among fellow students, monastic kin,\nOr among the six relations—branches and vines of flesh and blood—\nWives, concubines, sons, and daughters,\nOr beneath heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars,\nOr in temples of numinous spirits,\nOr before the traces of sages in the empty sky,\nOr among humans, non-humans, insects, beasts, and birds,\nCommit acts of delusion,\nMock those who practice goodness and give alms,\nOr perform meritorious deeds,\nThus incurring sins of slander and defamation.\n\nAll such acts are called delusion, arising ever from the heart. Should one commit delusion in even a single name or place, the offense entangles distant ancestors and brings calamity upon the living, leaving no recourse for remorse. Bound in darkness, they suffer in this life from perverse winds and grievous afflictions, meeting death only to enter the Frigid Night Hell, where after ten thousand kalpas they are reborn in the body of a venomous serpent. Without repentance, they sink forever in the evil destinies.\n\nMoved by compassion for those yet unawakened, the Merciful Venerable One spoke this gatha:\n\nIn the world of men, those who are deluded,\nWho disbelieve in sin and merit,\nMock those who cultivate virtue and merit,\nAnd say there is no past life.\nThey show no reverence for sun and moon,\nNor for heaven, earth, and stars.\nAll numinous and holy beings,\nThey slight and scorn without exception.\nEver committing unwholesome deeds,\nThey engage in every kind of evil.\nClinging stubbornly to their own nature,\nAt death they enter the Eighteen Hells,\nEnduring every torment and affliction,\nReborn after ten thousand kalpas as serpents.\nTheir hearts ever filled with venom,\nTheir bellies devoid of organs.\nHungry and thirsty, they find no food,\nAnd all who see them seek to kill.\nEven if reborn among humans,\nThey still suffer the retribution of delusion.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Dharma hall, hearing these verses, are filled with awe and dread. Should any bear such transgressions, their retribution will be exact and unerring. Let us all awaken, lest we suffer the same fate. When the day of our sinking comes, even if we seek repentance, it may be too late. Or we may endure the torments of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, unable to transcend, until together we resolve to seek liberation.\n\nThe penitent, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing himself fully to the ground, concentrating his mind in single-pointed resolve. He bows his head to the Merciful Venerable One, paying reverence to the true and holy.\n\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Jade Purity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Hearer of Cries Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Lofty Mysterious Void Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Boundless Self-Mastery Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Lofty Jade Emperor Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Dragon Han Brahma-Savior Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Supreme Purple Void Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Transcendent Perfected Sage Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Attainer of Fruition Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Jade Radiance Subtle Light Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Supreme Expedient Means Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Radiant Protector of Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Manifestation of Expedient Vision Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Wondrous Fruit Pearl Radiance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Pervasive Opener of Mysteries Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Dharma-Realm Responsive Compassion Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Mind-Responsive Awakener Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Deliverer of the Dark and Bright Realms Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Great Wisdom Ocean Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Fearless Power Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Compassionate Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Treasure Repository Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Longevity Protector of Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Universal Compassion Protector of the Realm Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Ocean of Merit Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Carefree and Joyous Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Wish-Fulfilling Rebirth Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Wisdom-Contemplating Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the World-Responsive Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Great Compassion Savior from Suffering Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, he pays homage to the Great Compassion Remover of Transgressions Perfected One.\n\nToday, the patrons of this Dharma hall and the great assembly, gazing toward the southwest, invoke the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Worthies and Saints, all the Great Holy Assemblies, pervading the ten directions and filling the boundless void, manifesting all true and holy beings. Through the great compassion and salvation of the Dao, they resolve to universally deliver all.\n\nThe penitent, so-and-so, for his ancestors of past lives, his birth parents, his karmic parents, his preceptor who conferred the precepts, the masters who established the altar and sponsored the rites, his uncles and brothers, his own kin and in-laws, his wives, sons, and daughters, and all his living and deceased family—should any bear boundless and immeasurable deluded transgressions, whether already committed or yet to be, whether already awakened or yet unawakened—by virtue of this Dharma hall today, he repents and seeks their eradication. From this day forward, he vows never to commit them again. May all beings forsake the three evil destinies and together attain liberation, gradually realizing the unconditioned and reaching the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Repentance of Stinginess and Greed, Third Scroll**\n\nToday, in this Dharma hall, each member of the great assembly directs his mind upward, gazing toward the Merciful Venerable One, repenting the transgressions of stinginess and greed.\n\nThe penitent, so-and-so, collects his mind and gathers his thoughts, listening attentively to the scriptural words. All beings dwell in the floating world, where a hundred years pass in but a few days. In the midst of this fleeting time, like the flash of a spark from struck stone, how can one endure? Like a moth darting into flame, they seek their own destruction. Unable to awaken and comprehend, they remain entangled without respite. Day by day, their transgressions accumulate, and with each passing moment, their sins and sufferings grow. Clinging to miserliness, they are ever burdened by greed, amassing wealth as high as mountains, yet their hearts remain unsatisfied. They plan for a single day’s life as if it were a thousand years. Yet when they were born, they brought not a single coin, and when they die, they take not a single coin away. In a single morning’s departure, all is emptiness. Boundless stinginess and greed become the seeds of transgression.\n\nOr before the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr before the great treasury of scriptures, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr before the Dharma bodies of those who have left the household life, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr in places of fasting, precepts, and offerings, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr in places of burning incense and lighting lamps, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr in the construction of monasteries, halls, and temples, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr upon the field of merit and virtue, they harbor stinginess and greed.\n\nOr before emperors and kings, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr before fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr before the worthy and the elders, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr regarding others’ or their own wealth and possessions, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of food and drink, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of carriages and horses, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of clothing and adornments, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of vast fields and estates, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of magnificent dwellings, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr at the sight of servants and slaves, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing dilapidated temples and monasteries, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing towering forests and mountains, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing lush blossoms and rotting fruit, they harbor stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing the poor, the aged, and the sick, they fail to think of relief and deliverance, harboring stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing prisoners in suffering, they neglect compassion and remembrance, harboring stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing travelers in distress, they refuse to aid and rescue, harboring stinginess and greed.\nOr upon seeing the hungry and cold with emaciated bodies, they withhold what is needed, harboring stinginess and greed.\n\nEven to the slightest—whether their own possessions, others’ belongings, public goods, or common property; be it a thread, a hair, a blade of grass, a tree, a flower, a fruit, a grain of rice, or a pinch of wheat—they either gluttonously consume or hoard with miserly attachment. Toward others, they act with stinginess and contempt, refusing to perform good deeds or make offerings. They torment themselves with accumulation, burdened by worry and vexation. They wish wealth for themselves and poverty for others. When their bodies perish, they are like a boat without oars, like a cart without wheels—only evil deeds remain, with no goodness to record. Thus, the karmic causes lead them to fall into the evil destinies.\n\nThereupon, the Compassionate Venerable One, moved by pity for all beings, spoke this verse:\n\nIf in past lives one was stingy and greedy,\nclinging and miserly without cease,\namassing wealth like mountains and peaks,\nyet the heart ever craves as if to swallow rivers and seas.\nNever content, even in places of fasting and precepts,\nin making images or copying scriptures,\nin constructing monasteries and halls,\nor in burning incense and lighting lamps—\nwherever merit is made,\nnot a single hair’s worth is offered,\nyet still seeking benefits through contrivance.\nAt death, they enter the Hell of Cold Ice,\nwhere their bodies are frozen and shattered,\nevery joint broken and destroyed.\nIn later lives, they dwell among border tribes,\nor become a household dog,\nguarding without rest,\nfierce and despised by all.\nOnly after ten thousand kalpas do they receive rebirth,\nyet as humans, they are incomplete:\nhands withered or feet lame,\neyes blind or ears deaf,\nnoses crooked or mouths askew,\nchests protruding or spines bent.\nTheir forms are hideous and misshapen,\nnowhere met with pity.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, having heard these words of scripture, are filled with dread. If such sins exist, they will bear retribution in future lives. Now, with earnest devotion, they wish to cleanse past transgressions. May all beings—whether in hell, as hungry ghosts, or as animals—suffering from such karmic retribution, through the power of this repentance ritual, the power of the Great Dao, and the power of merit, all attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], from limitless kalpas past to the present kalpa, in this life and this day, along with teachers, parents, their own person, and all kin—whether in this life or past lives, the living and the deceased—has committed boundless and immeasurable sins of stinginess and greed, never having purified them, nor even been aware of them. Today, prostrating for peace and in memorial, they recite this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, listening with single-minded sincerity.\n\nThey bow their heads to the Compassionate Venerable One, reverently paying homage to the true sages.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Hearer of Cries Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Numinous Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Golden Mirror Wondrous Countenance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Precept-Born Prolonging Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Boundless True Image Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Omnipresent Verifying Fruition Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Ever-Aiding Universal Salvation Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Naturally Empty and Still Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Expedient Causes and Effects Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Multitudinous Wondrous Compassionate Light Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jeweled Cause Dharma Ocean Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the True Constancy Delivering Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Hundred Million Majestic Names Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Protector of the Nation Eternal Peace Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Wisdom Eye Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Vast Propagator of the Teaching Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Expedient Wisdom Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Turning Dharma Wheel Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jeweled Forest Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Empowering the Dao Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great One Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Prolonging Life Preserving Destiny Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Carefree and Joyous Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Wish-Fulfilling Rebirth Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Merit Ocean Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Vast Faith Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Wondrous Virtue Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Compassion Saving from Suffering Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Compassion Removing Sins Perfected Person.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this ritual and the great assembly, gazing toward the southwest, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Persons, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected Persons, the Youth Saving from Suffering, the Youth of Supreme Wisdom, the Youth Attending to Medicine—manifesting throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless and mysterious realms, appearing as all true sages. May they generate compassionate vows and the power of universal salvation. May the repentant one, [Name], in their three lives—past, present, and future—along with their nine generations of kin, their own person, spouse, and children, all sins of stinginess and greed, through this repentance ritual, have their names stricken from the register of offenses. May all beings who have not yet attained liberation, and those already delivered, together through this repentance, be freed and realize the supreme Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\nRecitation of the Chapter on Almsgiving, the Fourth\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of withholding almsgiving.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], awakening to understanding, bows deeply and kneels in earnest, receiving the scripture’s words: All beings, while embodied in this world, indulge in insatiable desire, ever greedy throughout the day—when do they ever relinquish? Forsake?\n\nTheir kin fill the chambers, gold and jade overflow the halls, yet their hearts remain unsatisfied, still harboring stinginess and attachment. They do not cherish beneficence, but fix their thoughts on miserliness and avarice.\n\nYet almsgiving yields boundless merit, benefiting all in ways beyond conception. There are three kinds of almsgiving: the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, and the almsgiving of wealth.\n\nThe almsgiving of the Dao entails constantly sharing one’s teachings—the scriptures and doctrines of the Three Caverns—with skillful means. Whether provisional or ultimate, expansive or concise, they guide beings to enter the One Vehicle, forever severing the bonds of attachment and ascending to the realm of eternal bliss. From kalpa to kalpa, the Wheel of the Dao turns unceasingly. Past and future alike remain unwavering, without regret. This is the foremost, beyond all conception.\n\nThe almsgiving of the body means offering one’s own life to rescue and relieve all beings from illness, water and fire, blades and weapons, and countless calamities—all receive shelter and protection. Through expedient means, one spares neither body nor life. Seeing all the starving as if suffering one’s own hunger, seeing all the freezing as if enduring one’s own cold. Even to the point of offering one’s own labor to replace another’s peril, without reservation. Or serving the Dharma-bodies of those who have left the household, attending to their needs—gathering herbs in the mountains, running errands at their side, constructing and repairing temples, sweeping halls, planting orchards, performing all meritorious deeds. Digging wells by the roadside, repairing bridges and paths, never shirking toil, only striving with wholehearted devotion. The merit is towering, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe almsgiving of wealth has two forms. The first is inner wealth: one’s body, limbs, the hundred bones and nine orifices, skin and nails—exerting all effort to save and deliver, sparing nothing, offering it to others. The second is outer wealth: money, land, cities, and estates; wives, children, servants, and slaves; oxen and horses; gold, silver, pearls, and jade; silks and brocades; toys and adornments—all scattered and given freely, unattached in the heart.\n\nThere are also nine kinds of almsgiving, each distinct, yet all yielding benefit according to the intention behind them:\n1. Almsgiving to the true, responsive, and transformed images of those who have entered the Dao;\n2. Almsgiving to the Mahāyāna scriptures and teachings;\n3. Almsgiving to the sacred forms of immortals and perfected beings;\n4. Almsgiving to the numinous temples, monasteries, halls, pavilions, chambers, and cloisters of the Mysterious Altar;\n5. Almsgiving to the Dharma-bodies of male and female renunciates—black caps and yellow robes, all monastic garments and implements—ensuring their offerings are never lacking;\n6. Almsgiving to the permanent endowments: incense, oil, lamps, candles, estates, and servants;\n7. Almsgiving to bells, chimes, banners, flowers, canopies, seats, and all ritual implements;\n8. Almsgiving of vegetarian meals—rice, flour, oil, and incense—to the Dharma-bodies of renunciates and those who uphold the precepts, observe fasts, and diligently cultivate the Dao;\n9. Almsgiving to the poor, orphaned, widowed, sick, imprisoned, and all in peril or suffering.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One declares: The merit of these various forms of almsgiving is beyond conception. Moreover, why were the people of antiquity free from disasters? The Merciful Honored One says: The people of antiquity were simple and sincere at heart, embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue. They were neither greedy nor desirous. Later ages grew shallow and frivolous; people became deceitful, seeking only wealth, unaware of karmic conditions. They valued possessions over life, leading to the ruin of families and nations. Within, they harbored myriad evils; without, they forged alliances with the violent and reckless. Enmity and hatred followed one after another, with no means of awakening. Thus, the Dharma-gate of almsgiving was established to encourage generosity.\n\nYet today’s fourfold assembly clings to wealth and does not value life. To relinquish their wealth is as if relinquishing their very lives—hence the saying, “life and wealth.” If one can practice almsgiving, then:\n- No inner thieves arise,\n- No outer thieves appear,\n- Inner and outer are at peace,\n- All suffering is dispelled.\n\nThrough almsgiving today, stinginess and avarice are shattered. The transformative power of the sages reaches unseen realms, and blessings are received according to one’s merit.\n\nIf beings do not practice the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, the almsgiving of inner wealth, the almsgiving of outer wealth, or the nine kinds of almsgiving—\n- Seeing vegetarian feasts prepared, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing those who uphold the precepts and cultivate practice, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the true scriptures expounded, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the Dharma-bodies of renunciates suffering cold, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing lamps lit in offering, they refuse to add to the almsgiving;\n- Seeing incense burned and lamps extinguished in places of offering, they refuse to replenish the almsgiving;\n- Seeing banners and images in the Dao altar insufficient, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing ancient sacred sites damaged, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the halls and temples of numinous monasteries in disrepair, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the cases and covers of the Great Treasury of Scriptures incomplete, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the implements of offering not conforming to the Dharma, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the recitation of hymns and praises in the ritual processions, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the permanent endowments insufficient, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the sounds of bells and chimes not harmonious, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing construction unfinished, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing prisoners, the poor, the elderly, the sick, the meritorious, or the fields of blessing, they refuse to give.\n\nOr they do not give with expedient means, with compassion, with persuasion, with teaching, with reduction, with a good heart, with clear instruction, with skillful methods or partial teachings, with impartiality, with loyalty and filial piety, with good intentions, with influence, with medicine or healing arts, or with generosity.\n\nFor all the above, those who refuse to give—even in this life, their families will never know peace.\n\nCouples, man and wife, part midway in life.\nTheir own bodies maimed, afflicted by foul disease,\nthey perish and descend into the Nine Dark Realms,\npassing through all the hells,\nfor ten thousand kalpas to receive the bodies of serpents and dogs.\n\nThereupon the Merciful Honored One, pitying their unawakened state, spoke in verse:\n\nIf one is wealthy and noble,\nvirtuous, good, and wise,\npossessing healing arts and influence,\nyet refuses to give in any way—\nsaying, “I am rich in this world,\nand shall enjoy eternal bliss,”\nnot believing in rebirth,\nthen poverty is but the guest of wealth.\n\nIn this life, they die suddenly,\ntheir families separated in their prime.\nDead, they enter the dark and bitter prison,\ntheir hearts pierced by iron (chains).\nReborn in the bodies of serpents and dogs,\nfierce and savage, ever guarding their dens.\nEven if they regain human form,\nthey remain dull and ignorant, devoid of understanding.\nDestined to lonely poverty and lowly station,\nthey serve others for generation upon generation.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Dao altar,\nhearing what the sutra has declared,\nis seized with terror.\nIf any among us bear such sins,\nhow could we know it?\nIn the world to come, we must receive the retribution.\nToday, through this ritual recitation,\nwe must apply ourselves with diligence,\nwishing together to repent,\nthat all may be dissolved and extinguished.\nMay the six paths and four modes of birth\nall attain liberation.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, prostrates for peace,\ninvoking blessings and making vows with this repentance text,\nbowing with the five limbs to the ground,\nconcentrating the mind in single-pointed devotion.\nHe bows his head to the Merciful Honored One,\nreverently saluting the true and sacred.\n\nWith

assembly\nnow turn their hopes to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the southwest,\nto all the honored ones and sacred beings,\nto all the great perfected ones,\nto all the great divine youths,\nwho pervade the ten directions,\nfill the boundless cosmos,\nand manifest before all honored and sacred ones.\nMay they bestow the power of the Dao,\ntogether with the power of expedient means,\nso that the repentance sponsor, so-and-so,\nhis parents, teachers, fellow students,\nand all his six relations,\nfor the three periods of time past,\nmay have their sins of refusing to give—\nwhether already repaid or yet to be repaid—\nall dissolved and liberated through this repentance ritual.\nMay his family,\nlife after life,\nbe born into wealth and nobility,\nendowed with wisdom and intelligence,\nand bestow kindness upon all.\nMay all suffering beings\nattain peace together,\nquickly awaken to non-action,\nand swiftly ascend to the sacred fruit.\n\nOne bow.\n\nThe fourth scroll of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster-Dissolution and the Nine Dark Realms* concludes.\n\nThe fifth scroll of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster-Dissolution and the Nine Dark Realms*\n\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate\nFirst Chapter: *Against Frivolous and Deceitful Speech*\n\nToday, in this Dao altar, the great assembly,\neach directing their minds,\nlooks up to the Merciful Honored One,\nrepenting the sins of frivolous and deceitful speech.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, collects his mind, kneels, and listens attentively to the sutra’s words:\nAll sentient beings,\ndriven by the four delusions,\nrely solely on the six senses.\nThey take a single good deed\nand call it boundless;\nthey commit myriad sins\nyet claim no fault.\nSeeing others’ faults,\nthey amplify and slander;\nseeing others’ accumulated virtue,\nthey criticize and destroy it.\nThey speak only of themselves,\nclaiming their virtue and conduct are complete,\nhiding their cunning with eloquent tongues,\nadorning their words with splendid rhetoric.\nParted for a moment,\nthey say it was half a year;\nseeing each other for a day,\nthey act as if it were a hundred years.\nSuch foolish obstinacy\nis all frivolous and deceitful speech.\n\nOr before the Heavenly Worthy and the great Dao,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the Three Caverns’ scriptures,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before dharma masters and great virtuous ones,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the lord-emperor and king,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before parents and honored kin,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the worthy and the elders,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the foolish, lowly, and base,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the deaf, blind, and six afflicted,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before the revered and wealthy,\nthey speak frivolously and deceitfully.\nOr before teachers, dharma friends, and those of the dharma body,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr before senior companions,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr relying on wealth and nobility,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr relying on intelligence,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr relying on authority and wisdom,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr before those they know,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\nOr before the sacred hosts of the heavens,\nthe perfected ones of the ten directions,\nthe stars, the sun, the moon,\nand all numinous powers,\nthey engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.\n\nWhenever one sets the mind to engage in frivolous and deceitful speech, in flowery words devoid of truth, one incurs grave transgressions. In this present life, one’s own body suffers twisted mouth and crooked face; at death, one falls into the Avīci Hell of Torn-Out Tongues, where only after ten thousand kalpas does one take rebirth in the body of a wild beast. Without repentance, one can hardly transcend to the Pure Land.\n\nThereupon, the Compassionate Venerable, for the sake of those yet unawakened, spoke this gāthā:\n\nIf in this present body one speaks frivolously and deceitfully,\ndissembling before the Three Jewels,\nbefore father and mother, before sons and daughters,\nbefore the sovereign and the common folk—\nwherever people gather,\none slanders and harms the loyal and the worthy,\nsows discord among friends,\nand envies those more virtuous than oneself.\nOne spreads rumors and stirs up strife,\nindiscriminately speaks of right and wrong,\nturns falsehood into truth,\nand calls white black.\nOne gossips about others’ strengths and weaknesses,\npresumes to know their likes and dislikes.\nWherever one goes, one creates discord and chaos;\nat death, one falls into the Hell of Torn-Out Tongues.\nIron awls pierce the tongue,\nmountains of rock press upon the body.\nThe tongue is stretched to a hundred feet,\nnailed fast with iron spikes.\nDrip by drip, blood flows forth;\nin the next life, one takes the form of a wild dog,\ndevouring all manner of filth,\nday and night lost in deluded thoughts.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this ritual arena, having heard this gāthā, reflects: since beginningless kalpas, all sentient beings have transmigrated and suffered retribution—by what means may one awaken and know this? Now, I repent and vow to cultivate diligence. May the merit of this day bring us all to liberation together.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in homage. With five limbs touching the earth and single-minded reverence, we listen attentively.\n\nWe bow our heads to the Compassionate Venerable, paying homage to the Perfected and Sacred Ones.\n\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Natural Transformation through Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy beyond form.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who perceives form.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Self-Mastery and Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue Pervading All.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who gives birth to the myriad beings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who harmonizes yin and yang.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Virtue and Power.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who abides through the Three Times.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who established heaven and earth.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon’s Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Unceasing Compassion.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Light that Illuminates All.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms the Three Realms.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Golden Splendor and Vast Brilliance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants longevity and preserves life.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who protects the realm.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s vows.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reach.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Sunlight.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Moonlight.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who removes transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this ritual arena, together with the great assembly, reverently beseeches the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, and all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms—to together open the gate of great forgiveness and save these sentient beings.\n\nMay the repentant one, so-and-so, their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants, their own person, and all their karmic relations—both the living and the deceased—who, through measureless kalpas of abandoning and assuming bodies, have committed the above transgressions of frivolous and deceitful speech, and who, without the power of the Dao, have not attained liberation, through this act of repentance, have their sins extinguished. From this day forward, may they never again commit such offenses, abandoning false and flowery speech to practice only simplicity and truth.\n\nMay all sentient beings universally embody the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repentance for Malicious Speech and Double-Tongued Words**\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled devotees turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words. The repentant one, so-and-so, kneels in humility, collects their thoughts, and listens attentively to the scriptural teachings.\n\nAll sentient beings bear heavy burdens from the karma of speech, and none is graver than the sin of double-tongued words, where cunning eloquence takes precedence. They belittle the humble to flaunt their wit, mock their superiors, and scorn their inferiors; they treat the noble and the kin with arrogance, unmoved by their plight, deeming their own judgments flawless. They indulge in rich flavors, heedless of excess; they crave foul and rank foods, consuming without restraint. Some deceive the worthy and delude the sagely, slander the true and revile the Dao, spread rumors of others’ faults, and boast of their own righteousness. They curse the wind and rain, repeat hearsay as truth, turn existence into nothingness, and refine the coarse into the delicate. They sow discord among the good, praise the foolish, slander one to another, and another to the first—condemning others’ words while justifying their own. They estrange others’ kin, befriend the foolish, turn intimacy into estrangement, and transform affection into enmity. Their words are ornate yet false, their fabrications passed off as truth; their speech strays from meaning, they slander rulers and fathers, disparage teachers and friends, undermine the loyal and good, suppress those superior to themselves, and harm the innocent. Their vanity and deceit know no bounds; their mouths proclaim virtue while their hearts conceal vice. The paths of such transgressions are manifold, and the sins they weave run deep. Face-to-face, they sigh in regret, turning good into evil, constantly gathering omens and false accusations, ever drawn to perverse teachings. They invoke heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits—yet in all their utterances, not a single word is true or upright.\n\nSome commit malicious speech and double-tongued words before the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the scriptures, and the revered masters. Some do so before kings, parents, the virtuous, and the dharma-body. Some before the deities of heaven, the sun, the moon, the void, and the sacred assemblies. Some before all manner of boundaries—wells, stoves, doors, households, and various kin. Some before humans and non-humans alike. Such speech and tongues, scheming in all directions, deceive even the empty void. The roots of these measureless sins all stem from the tongue; even if likened to the sands of the Ganges, they could not be exhausted.\n\nThe slightest infraction—even a hair’s breadth—brings a distinct retribution: in this life, a twisted mouth, a paralyzed tongue, muteness, a blocked nose. In death, they fall into the Molten Copper Hell, where only after ten thousand kalpas do they reemerge, reborn as venomous creatures—centipedes, snakes, and vipers. If they do not repent, how can these sins be extinguished?\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One, moved by their unawakened state, spoke in verse:\n\n*In past lives, with malicious tongues,*\n*They cursed kin and stranger alike.*\n*Unmindful of good or evil words,*\n*They spoke whatever came to mouth.*\n*They called to heaven and cried to earth,*\n*Summoned ghosts and dragged along spirits.*\n*Even the Three Treasures, heaven and earth,*\n*The sun, moon, and stars—none were spared.*\n*Over wells and stoves, flowing waters,*\n*At doorways and crossroads,*\n*Beneath shrines, forests, and mountains,*\n*They cursed the loyal and good.*\n*Regardless of rank or station,*\n*Parents, flesh and blood,*\n*Servants, slaves, and attendants—*\n*Wherever they dwelt, poisonous words followed.*\n*In death, molten copper was poured,*\n*Their bodies wreathed in smoke.*\n*Later, reborn as wasps and centipedes,*\n*Their mouths sought to harm all things.*\n*Or as clams and mussels,*\n*Buried in sand and mud,*\n*Retreating into their shells at will.*\n*Even if reborn as humans,*\n*They would still be mute and stammering.*\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled, as the scriptures declare, have committed the offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—retribution knows no error, and none of us can escape. If these sins remain, what fate awaits us in days to come? Thus, we cycle endlessly through hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms, our karmic debts unceasing.\n\nNow, I prostrate in repentance, beseeching the Dao with sorrow, praying that the Dharma’s grace may universally dissolve these bonds. May the repentant one, so-and-so, kneeling in devotion, recite this repentance text for peace and to honor the departed, prostrating with utmost sincerity, listening with a single mind.\n\nI bow my head to the Merciful Honored One, reverently saluting the true and sacred.\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity, Bestower of Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Answers Cries and Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Treasures and Radiant Light.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestations.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Constantly Saves and Delivers.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Purity and Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Karmic Conditions.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects the Nation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Delivers Beings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Compassion.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Intent.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pacifies the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Heaven and Earth.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delights in the Land.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Beings’ Hearts.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Fulfills All Realms.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Broadly Dissolves Disasters.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Gives Life to Myriad Things.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Supreme Unity, Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation Protection.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of the Dharma-Body, Natural Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Mysterious Emptiness and Supreme Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions. With sincere devotion, may they broadly open the path of deliverance.\n\nMay the repentant one, so-and-so, their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants, both the living and the deceased, and all their kin—who have committed the above offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—through this act of repentance, have their sins extinguished.\n\nFrom this day forward, I vow never again to commit such acts.\nIn life after life, may I be endowed with voice and eloquence,\nto speak with wisdom and discernment,\nto harmonize and benefit all,\nto adapt to the shallow and the profound,\nand universally deliver the six paths and four kinds of birth,\nall sharing in the great Dao of unity.\n\n*One bow*\n\n**Third Section: Breaking Lustful Desires**\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, each member of the assembly directs their mind,\nbowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One,\nrepenting the sins of lustful desire.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, kneels in reverence and takes refuge,\nattentively listening to the scriptural words:\nAll sentient beings, if they give rise to lustful desire,\nare confined in dark prisons,\ndrowned in the river of craving,\nwith no hope of escape,\nforever sunk in suffering.\n\nFrom the distant past until now,\nthrough the cycles of birth and death over kalpas,\nthe bones accumulated by their bodies would form great mountains,\nthe mother’s milk they have drunk would equal the waters of the four great seas,\nand the blood they have shed would surpass even this.\nParents, siblings, and the six relations—all have exhausted their allotted years.\nThe tears they have shed would be like the waters of the four great seas.\nThus it is said: with craving, there is birth; with the end of craving, there is extinction.\nIt is known that birth and death arise from lustful desire.\nThe sin of lustful desire causes sentient beings to fall into hell,\nto receive the bodies of hungry ghosts.\nIf reborn as animals, they take the forms of doves, sparrows, owls, and other birds.\nSuch beings may entertain lustful thoughts\nbefore the scriptures, Dharma masters, or in sacred halls and numinous observatories of the Heavenly Worthy,\nor in pure places, divine temples, or near sacred sites.\nThey may violate the chaste,\nseize and harm others,\nseparate mother and child,\ntake away another’s sons and daughters,\ndisrupt bonds of affection,\nsever ties of love,\nshowing no regard for the virtuous.\nThey may expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries,\nor in thought and mind defile the Dharma bodies of male and female renunciates.\nOr they may engage in impure acts with the five kinds of persons.\nAll such beings who direct unwholesome thoughts toward the Dharma bodies of renunciates\nare like those who burn and destroy sacred images and palaces—\nupon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu,\nnever to be reborn for kalpas.\nTheir descendants for nine generations suffer short lives and bitter poverty.\nFor each and every such act of lustful desire,\ntheir households in this life encounter unjust calamities,\nofficial troubles and heavy misfortunes,\ntheir own bodies afflicted by wind and evil,\nyear after year stricken with illness.\nUpon death, they enter the Nine Dark Hells,\nonly to be reborn after ten thousand kalpas,\nreceiving the retribution of filthy, worm-ridden bodies.\nIf they do not repent, they will forever remain sunk in suffering.\n\nFor those yet unawakened, the Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:\n\nIn past lives, they engaged in illicit lust,\nrecklessly and without restraint.\nThey violated the wives and concubines of others,\nseparating them from their kin.\nThe six relations were all involved,\nas were the bodies of renunciates.\nEven among the six kinds of animals,\nthey made no distinction between good and evil.\nIn pure places,\nwithin sacred halls and numinous observatories,\nbefore scriptures or near images,\nthey exposed themselves beneath heaven and earth,\nunder the sun, moon, and stars,\nshowing no regard for ghosts and spirits.\nBy famous mountains and great marshes,\nin shrines and divine temples,\neverywhere they indulged in lustful desire—\nupon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells.\nMen embrace great bronze pillars,\nwomen lie upon beds of scorching iron.\nTheir bodies engulfed in smoke and fire,\ntheir flesh and fat all charred and rotted.\nFurther tormented by boiling cauldrons,\nbeaten day and night with iron rods.\nLater cast into the Hell of Icy Cold,\ntheir bodies torn apart,\npounded in mortars, ground in mills,\nsawed asunder, hacked by blades.\nEven if they regain human form,\nthey are afflicted with madness and evil diseases.\n\nToday, the assembly in this Daoist sanctuary,\nas described in the scriptures, is deeply terrified.\nIf such sins exist, how can one become aware of them?\nAmong the four kinds of birth and six paths,\nseeing those who suffer and those yet to receive punishment—\nthrough this act of repentance, may all attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text,\nbowing with the five limbs touching the ground.\nKneeling to the Merciful Honored One, they reverently pay homage to the true and sacred beings.\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Self-Mastery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies Heaven and

of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Solar Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Wisdom and Lunar Compassion.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled,\nreverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm,\nthe myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—\nall the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions,\nfilling the boundless void and hidden or revealed in all realms.\n\nMay the power of this Daoist sanctuary, the power of chanting praises, and the power of self-transformation enable the repentant one, [Name], along with their birth parents, extended kin, uncles, brothers, personal relatives, and all living and deceased across two generations—should any bear the karmic burden of lust and desire as described above—to now sincerely prostrate, repent, and cleanse their transgressions. From this day forward, may they perceive form as emptiness, sever karmic retribution, and refrain from further transgression. May they cherish the body as a treasure, guard conduct as a pearl, encounter no obstacles, and enter the shore of non-action, ascending together to the fruition of the Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\n**Chapter Four: Distant Aversion and Attachment**\n\nToday, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, each directing their minds, face the Merciful Honored Ones and repent the sins of aversion and attachment between self and others. The repentant one, [Name], gathers their heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, when first setting intention, are often foolish, their actions seldom sincere. Attachment accumulates like mountains, yet they claim it is never enough. Aversion discards as if filth, yet they resent not having cast it away entirely. Thus, their minds fail to awaken and comprehend, distinguishing self from others, judging strength and weakness. Words and deeds diverge, entangled in worldly nets, indulging in obstinate folly. They gaze without satiety, listen without discernment, yielding to greed and delusion, forsaking tranquility and harmony. What pleases the eye, they stare at without ceasing; what pleases the ear, they listen to without tiring. They speak only of others’ faults to extol their own virtues. When the mind is pleased, they overlook ugliness; when words are affectionate, they disregard closeness or distance.\n\nThus, sentient beings may harbor aversion or attachment before the seats of true and sacred beings, or before kings, parents, or revered teachers. They may conceive such thoughts before uncles, brothers, men, or women, or before the heavens, earth, sun, moon, or the boundless void. They may foster such desires at sacred sites or before divine altars. These immeasurable, boundless sins of aversion and attachment between self and others—should one commit even a single instance or kind—lead to rebirth in the hells of manifold suffering, with no hope of escape. Even if reborn, they shall assume non-human forms. Without repentance and liberation, they shall forever sink in suffering.\n\nThen the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:\n\nAversion and attachment arise from self and other,\nSelf-generated, singular in intent.\nWhat was deemed evil now seems good,\nAversion lengthens, attachment shortens.\nThose despised are cut off in form and shadow,\nYet still the foolish heart is not sated.\nThose loved stand like mountains,\nYet still they claim it is never enough.\nAll things share a single body,\nYet distinctions of beauty and ugliness arise.\nSelf and other emerge from the mind,\nGood and evil all stem from nature.\nUpon death, they enter the great hells,\nEnduring every torment and poison.\nBlades pierce the heart,\nIron awls tear the tongue.\nA hundred joints are nailed with iron,\nLater reborn as geese or ducks,\nOr as fish and turtles,\nSlaughtered, unable to speak.\nAt the mercy of others’ lives and deaths,\nSubject to every manner of cooking and preparation.\nLater, reborn as humans,\nThey become the mute, deaf, or dumb.\n\nToday, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, as the scripture declares, are filled with sorrow. If such sins are committed, how can their retribution be endured? Moreover, the repentant one, [Name], along with their nine generations of ancestors, parents, revered teachers, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all kin—from limitless and beginningless kalpas to this very life and day, through countless rebirths—have harbored these sins of aversion and attachment between self and others, never awakening. Now, establishing this Daoist sanctuary for peace and offering this repentance, they prostrate with five limbs to the earth, wholeheartedly invoking:\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Through Sound.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Western Numinous Forest Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Discipline-Generated True Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Emptiness and Great Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of All-Pervading Great Movement.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings and Radiant Brilliance.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Essence and Celestial Sovereignty.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms the Dao Through Myriad Movements.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Illumination Through the Dao’s Movement.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accords with the World.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Splendor and True Sovereignty.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Transformations in the Golden Palace.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Orthodox Dao and Non-Action.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy and Dharma King of Penetrating Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Clarities’ Purple Palaces.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Dao’s Illumination and Accomplishment.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Countenance and Radiant Light.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Compassion Who Eradicates Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Lights’ Turning Wheel.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Virtue and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Longevity.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Ocean of Merit and Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of True Stability and Radiance.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Radiant and Wondrous Sound.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless void and hidden or revealed in all realms. May they bestow their benevolent power, enabling the repentant one, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, and all living and deceased relatives to beseech liberation from the aforementioned karmic offenses. From this day forward, may they never again commit such transgressions. May all who have sunk in suffering, through the power of this repentance, ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\n**First Bow: The Fifth Precept on Non-Stealing**\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, each with sincere heart, bows their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of theft. The repentant one, [Name], collects their mind, kneels in reverence, and surrenders body and soul, heeding the scriptural words: all sentient beings, lacking integrity, must not take even a blade of grass or a single leaf without just cause—how much less may they steal. Yet beings, deluded by present gain, seize what is not theirs through manifold unjust means.\n\nSome breach walls or dig through barriers, waylay travelers, or plunder by force. Some default on debts, break contracts, or deceive with words and heart. Some take what is not theirs, reasoning none will know—yet the heavenly net is vast; where can they escape? Some steal from the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptures, dharma treasures, or ritual implements. Some take offerings meant for perfected sages, or the sacred tools of worship. Some plunder the three-tiered altars, the treasures of the numinous halls, or the vessels of fasting assemblies. Some steal from the materials used to sculpt sacred images, or the alms of the faithful who uphold precepts. Some take the seven treasures donated to the Three Treasures, or the jewels of jeweled thrones, jeweled canopies, jeweled chariots, jeweled banners, jeweled crowns, jeweled mirrors, jeweled trees, jeweled flowers, jeweled halls, jeweled steeds, or the sacred robes and cloud-patterned vestments. Some steal from the jeweled repositories of scriptures, the treasures of jeweled halls, or the jeweled caskets and relics. Some take the possessions of exalted perfected ones, or the oil and incense meant for lamps and offerings. Some plunder the common stores of the assembly, the tribute granaries of the state, or the precious treasures of immortals, jade maidens, vajra guardian kings, or celestial lions. Some steal from the dharma-bodies of male or female officials, or the fruits and vegetables of the Three Sages’ blessed lands. Some take sacrificial animals from spirit temples, or precious substances like giant clams, agate, lapis lazuli, amber, gold, silver, pearls, jade, copper, iron, silk, brocade, or fine linen. Even a single coin, a single thread—whether little or much—all incur grave transgression.\n\nSome break into storehouses, pick locks, alter seals, or tamper with labels and caskets. Some hoard military supplies, evade taxes, or withhold even a fraction of what is due, seeking only personal gain. Some steal the vestments or ritual implements entrusted to dharma masters, or the fresh offerings not yet presented to the spirits. Some take from loving parents, siblings, friends, or neighbors; from travelers’ luggage; from the destitute, the aged, or the infirm. Some seize goods meant for trade, the seeds and livestock of farmers, or take by deceit, coercion, or force. Some claim public authority, or take through neglect, fraud, or jest. Some take by force, subterfuge, or false pretenses; by greed, unreturned loans, or barter; by refusal to repay, by deception, or by hiding the truth. Some beg with false humility or demand with threats. All such crooked acts incur fault and blame.\n\nIf it is not one’s own, even a hair’s weight must not be coveted—all such taking is theft. Even lost items found on the road, carried by wind or birds, delivered by spirits or gods—clothing, bedding, utensils, carriages, horses, cloth, grain, or the tiniest speck—if concealed, become the karmic offense of theft. This shortens one’s lifespan, brings misfortune to nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, and offers no escape. In life, one suffers illness; in death, one falls into hell. Even if reborn, one becomes an ox or beast of burden. Without repentance, one remains forever sunk in suffering.\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One spoke these verses:\n\n*In past lives, they stole and plundered,*\n*Taking the Three Treasures’ wealth.*\n*Alms given in faith, offerings made in devotion,*\n*Or the possessions of kings and people—*\n*None of it theirs, yet at the sight,*\n*They harbored thieving hearts,*\n*Always scheming to steal.*\n*They robbed travelers by force,*\n*Threatened, coerced, or framed the innocent.*\n*They tunneled through walls, plundered by night,*\n*Or lurked in empty places,*\n*Seizing cattle, servants, slaves,*\n*Wealth, jewels, and treasures—*\n*All by cunning means.*\n*In death, they enter the hell of fire-carts,*\n*Their bodies scorched and shattered.*\n*In later lives, they become oxen or horses,*\n*Repaying their debts to others.*\n*Yoked, their flesh and fat are torn away,*\n*Nostrils and mouths ripped apart.*\n*Hungry and thirsty, they suffer endlessly,*\n*Unable to speak.*\n*At others’ mercy, they are slaughtered,*\n*Only to be reborn as humans—*\n*Then robbed and killed in turn,*\n*Repaying the sins of past lives.*\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary must reflect deeply on these scriptural words, which inspire true dread. With utmost sincerity, they must bow in repentance, seek mercy, and pray that all beings—whether already suffering retribution or yet to face it—may, through this act of repentance, attain universal liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing themselves to the ground with utmost devotion. Bowing their head to the Merciful Honored One, they reverently pay homage to the sacred beings:\n\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at a Cry.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Equal and Vast Compassion.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Abides in the World and Delivers Beings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestations.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends All Karmic Bonds.\n\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Eradicates All Thoughts.\nWith sincere

Worthy Whose Dao-Invocation Dissolves Disasters.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Scatters Flowers and Prolongs Life.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Palace Ever-Bright.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Brings Prosperity and Great Peace to the Nation.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Dire Perils.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Guards Life as a Divine Spirit.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Dharma-Wheel Spreads Transformation.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Longevity and Preserves Life.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Nation.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected of Stellar Radiance.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected of Fiery Radiance.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, together with the great assembly, each directs their mind and aspires toward the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, and all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms of reality.\n\nBy the power of dissolving disasters and guarding life,\nBy the power of rescuing from suffering and eradicating transgressions,\nBy the power of boundless merit and virtue,\nBy the power of innumerable immortals,\nBy the power inconceivable—\n\nThe master of repentance, [Name], along with their teacher, fellow disciples, Daoist companions, all dharma kin, the seven generations of ancestors, the nine lineages of descendants, their birth parents, uncles, brothers, all branches and vines of kinship—from beginningless time until this very day—have committed the aforementioned sins of theft, used false weights and measures, deceived the good and kind, sought gain through improper means, spread fear and violence, engaged in stealth and coercion, invoked spirits and ghosts, deceived themselves, indulged in cruelty, disregarded joy and anger, ignored the poor and destitute, and given free rein to greed and savagery, accumulating manifold transgressions.\n\nRelying on this repentance ritual, may these sins be eradicated.\nFrom this day forward, in life after life, may they attain the wish-fulfilling pearl, ever possess the seven treasures, wear finest garments, taste the hundred flavors of sweet dew, and receive all manner of medicines and remedies as desired, bestowing them upon all beings without exception, never again committing theft.\n\nMay all beings be free from the thought of theft, ever content, unstained by attachment, ever delighting in wise generosity, relieving the poor and rescuing the suffering, offering head, eyes, brain, and marrow as readily as spittle.\n\nWith a mind of dedication, may they accomplish the supreme Dao.\nOne bow.\n\nThe Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Compassion Daoist Ritual Arena for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms Concludes\nThe Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Compassion Daoist Ritual Arena for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms\n\nCompiled by Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan\n\nFirst Repentance: On the Killing of Living Beings\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual arena, all present turn their minds toward the Compassionate Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of killing living beings.\n\nThe repentant master, [Name], gathers his mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, so long as they dwell within the human realm, remain entangled in the web of the world. Having never encountered a virtuous friend and constantly associating with the foolish, they accumulate habits that become deeply ingrained. Like the mingling of fragrant and foul, they are stained by manifold transgressions. They give free rein to reckless cruelty, perpetrating suffering without cause, never awakening a heart of compassion. They kill living beings, devouring flesh and bone.\n\nAt times, for the sake of parents, themselves, brothers, wives, children, or extended kin, they gather in villages and hamlets, slaughtering countless beings without a thought for their lives.\n\nThey kill cattle, sheep, mules, horses, pigs, dogs, and other domesticated creatures, those raised and fed by humans. They boil and butcher deer, foxes, rabbits, tigers, leopards, and wolves—those dwelling in mountains and forests—slaughtering the six kinds of livestock without a moment’s hesitation, heedless of whether they are fat or lean.\n\nSome pierce with blades until blood flows; others scald until skin peels away. Though life has yet to depart, their bellies are slit open, bones removed, sinews stripped, intestines torn out, and flesh carved away. The agony they endure is beyond measure, and the karmic retribution they incur is impossible to repay.\n\nThey kill sacred birds—phoenixes, cranes, geese, ducks, turtledoves, pigeons, crows, magpies, owls, and kites—along with all manner of flying creatures. They stretch tall nets, raise long poles with sticky paste, pluck feathers and singe wings, or maim them in treetops. Desperate for death yet unable to die, longing for life yet denied it, they sever their feet, remove their heads, cut off their wings, gouge out their eyes, all to fill the kitchen and sate their hunger.\n\nThey kill soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, snails, clams, crabs, and other armored creatures. They drain rivers and dig trenches, set bamboo traps and scatter sand, cast nets and weirs, or use baskets to ensnare scales and fins. They boil and butcher them on islands, piling bones into mountains, their stench carried on the wind. Though they have taken countless lives, their desire remains unquenched.\n\nThey kill snakes, vipers, scorpions, bees, wasps, dung beetles, midges, centipedes, locusts, ants, and all manner of crawling things. They kill mosquitoes, horseflies, lice, fleas, mayflies, moths, and other creatures born of transformation—every wriggling, flying, or submerged being.\n\nThough these may be venomous creatures, they too seek peace. They thrive in heat and dampness, perish in cold and ice, all partaking in the transformations of creation, never entering the kitchen. To kill them without cause—how can such suffering be endured?\n\nThey fly hawks and hunt with dogs, draw bows and nock arrows, their hearts stirred by greed and savagery, knowing only the taking of life. They set mountains ablaze, drain forests and rivers dry. They wield arrows and blades, grasp spears and halberds, killing living beings. They crush with hands, trample with feet, press down while sitting or lying, killing living beings. They till fields and plant crops, build walls and erect barriers, killing living beings. They construct houses, dig pits, and excavate earth, killing living beings. They dismantle fences, clear grass, and level ground, killing living beings. They gather firewood, fell trees, pluck flowers, and pull up grass, killing living beings. They light lamps and raise candles, killing living beings. They divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings. They wash their hair, bathe their bodies, drink water, and eat meals, killing living beings. They thresh grain and husk wheat, split open wombs and crush eggs, killing living beings. They swat ropes, fan away mosquitoes, open their mouths, close their eyes, raise their hands, or stamp their feet, killing living beings. They kill before sacred images, scriptures, or in the presence of the Dharma; they carry creatures home from the ritual arena to slaughter. In anger or frustration, without cause, they kill living beings. In joy or revelry, indulging their desires, they kill living beings. They slaughter for sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, or for the sick, seeking to avert unseen misfortune. They prepare medicinal decoctions using living creatures, killing them. Some die in their hands, others perish on the butcher’s block, roasted in raging fires, their lineages severed, their reproduction halted, their life roots destroyed, utterly annihilated.\n\nThey kill creditors, enemies, or good people from the four directions. They abort fetuses and crush eggs, not sparing even birds and beasts. They kill out of fear, out of dread, by their own hand, or by instructing others. They kill through cursing, poisoning, or drugging. They kill through spells, anger, or joy. They kill deliberately, accidentally, with words, hands, intent, thoughts, glances, or in combat.\n\nIn all such acts of killing, with every movement of hand or body, they cruelly harm all manner of creatures. Each bears its own sin, and none can escape retribution.\n\nThus speaks the Compassionate Honored One:\nHe who amasses boundless wealth will surely bring suffering upon himself;\nHe who accumulates excess sin will repay his past debts.\nWithout remorse, without a heart to save, he remains mired in delusion.\nCalamity flows to his ancestors, and upon death, he enters the hells of interrogation and punishment, enduring every torment.\nEven if he is reborn, his form will be that of a different species.\nWithout repentance, how can he transcend this fate?\n\nThen the Compassionate Honored One proclaimed again in lamentation:\nIn past lives, you killed living beings—\nCattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs,\nGeese, ducks, pheasants, rabbits,\nDeer, tigers, leopards, and their kin,\nOwls, crows, swallows, sparrows,\nJackals, wolves, foxes, raccoon dogs,\nMules, donkeys, horses,\nFish, turtles, cicadas, maggots,\nSnails, clams, shrimp, mussels,\nDung beetles, ants, and their like,\nLeeches, mosquitoes, fleas, lice,\nCentipedes, midges, and all manner of worms.\nYou slaughtered them all, never awakening a heart of kindness.\nWhoever you encountered, you harmed without mercy,\nAnd upon death, you fell into the hells,\nEnduring every suffering, tormented day and night.\nIn that place of unbearable agony,\nAll those cattle and sheep\nWill come to demand their lives,\nSaying, “You ate my flesh.”\nOr, “You killed my body,”\nClaiming you had no right.\nToday, we meet again—\nYou must repay your past debts.\n\nEven as you seek escape, there is no path—\nThe demon-king unfolds the scroll of transgressions.\nUpon examination, the truth is known:\nLife for life, each must be repaid.\n\nIf reborn in another form,\nYou enter the assembly of beasts,\nAgain becoming oxen, sheep, or dogs,\nEven geese, ducks, and their kind.\nSubjected once more to slaughter,\nYou repay the sins of your past life.\n\nToday, in this grand repentance hall, all present—\nAs the sutras declare—\nEvery sentient being,\nFor killing without cause,\nOr causing others to kill,\nHas committed acts swift and innumerable.\nTo repay life and settle karmic debts,\nWho can take another’s place?\nIn life, one suffers punishment,\nRelying on the strength of kinship;\nBut upon death, entering the Three Wicked Paths,\nWho will come to your rescue?\n\nSuch karmic retribution is clear and exact.\nNow, we beseech repentance to □,\nTo wash away past transgressions.\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial.\nFive limbs touching the earth, with wholehearted devotion,\nWe bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One,\nReverently paying homage to the true and sacred.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we pay homage to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity Who Bestows Blessings,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at a Cry,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Brilliance,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Golden Radiance and Light,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Great Mystery Without Form,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Abides in the World and Saves Beings,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestations,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Inner Reality,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Forced Designation,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Aids the Dharma,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Saves

Great Unity Who Rescues from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merits,\nThe Perfected of Boundless Heart,\nThe Perfected of Numinous and Universal Reality,\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering,\nThe Perfected of Great Mercy Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, in this repentance hall, the repentant one and all present\nRaise their aspirations toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northwest,\nAll the venerable ones, all the sages,\nAll the immortals, all the assemblies,\nAll the great perfected ones,\nAll the great divine youths,\nWho pervade the ten directions,\nFill the boundless cosmos,\nAnd manifest as all true and sacred beings—\nTogether, may they pour the Dharma-water\nTo cleanse all sentient beings.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], since time without beginning,\nAlong with nine generations of ancestors,\nTeachers, parents,\nAll Dharma-kin,\nUncles, brothers,\nSix relations and family,\nBoth the living and the dead—\nHave accumulated boundless, measureless sins of killing,\nNow in the hells, hungry ghost, and animal realms,\nReceiving retribution and repaying debts,\nUnsettled until now, but settled today.\n\nBy virtue of this repentance and deliverance,\nMay we forever break free from the snares of attachment.\nFrom this day forward,\nWe vow never to create or commit such acts again.\nMay we regard the bodies of sentient beings as our own,\nAnd see the killing of sentient beings as the killing of ourselves.\nWith manifold compassion,\nCherish them as we cherish ourselves.\nMay all beasts attain human birth,\nAwaken to the profound principle,\nAnd realize the supreme Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\n\n**Second Section: Washing Away the Crimes of Destruction**\n\nToday, in this grand repentance hall, each person directs their mind,\nBowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One,\nRepenting for boundless, measureless crimes of destruction.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], collects their thoughts and kneels in reverence,\nAttentively listening to the sutra’s words:\nAll sentient beings, by virtue of having form,\nFrom time without beginning until today,\nParents, brothers,\nOne’s own body and family,\nShedding and assuming forms through countless rebirths—\nHave failed to emulate loyalty and goodness,\nInstead harboring much harm and ruin,\nIndulging in arrogance and dissipation,\nFailing to restrain themselves,\nSeizing and plundering servants and slaves,\nDestroying without cause,\nHarming sentient beings,\nCommitting countless defilements.\n\nMoreover, when serving as officials,\nFailing to emulate integrity and diligence,\nOften engaging in destruction,\nDisloyal to the state,\nConstantly resorting to flattery and deceit,\nUnattuned to the times,\nDisdaining the great Dao,\nConcealing good and practicing evil,\nNot judging by principle,\nEnvying the worthy and resenting the capable,\nDeceiving superiors and bullying subordinates,\nRelying on official power and influence,\nRefusing to act with fairness,\nAllowing personal likes and dislikes to sway their hearts,\nIndulging in favoritism and rejection.\n\nOr perhaps they have:\nBesieged cities and razed towns,\nBurned others’ homes,\nSold good people into bondage,\nEnticed others’ servants and slaves,\nWrongfully oppressed the innocent,\nBullied the virtuous.\n\nOr they have:\nDestroyed images of the sacred and venerable.\n\nOr perhaps they have:\nDestroyed Daoist temples and sacred altars,\nOr ruined public monasteries and permanent endowments,\nOr damaged the great canon of scriptures,\nOr broken the vessels and implements for offerings.\nIn all things, they fail to cultivate reverence,\nSeeking only to destroy.\nAs echo answers sound,\nSo too do words of ill omen bring forth their due.\nWhen qi is coarse, the voice is harsh;\nWhen the heart is pleased, you are at ease.\nFor all beings, reverence and faith come first,\nAnd solemn adornment resides in mindfulness.\nTo commit such acts of destruction is to accumulate all manner of karmic transgressions,\nCausing one’s kin across the three lifetimes to suffer retribution,\nEver bound to evil affinities,\nAnd at death, to enter the bitter hells of suffering,\nWhere they shall endure the punishment of shaved heads and severed hair.\nIf they do not repent,\nThey shall forever bear the weight of sinking and drowning.\n\nThereupon, the Compassionate Venerable One, moved by pity for those yet unawakened, spoke again in verse:\n\nIn former lives, they scorned and slighted,\nDamaging all manner of things,\nAnd the forms and images of the sacred,\nThe temples, the profound altars,\nThe permanent endowments, the Daoist sanctums.\nRelying on power, they bullied the good and kind,\nTheir hearts cruel and oppressive.\nAt death, they enter the hells of bitter suffering,\nWhere kin ever contend in strife,\nTormenting one another in turn.\nIn later lives, though born as humans,\nThey suffer the retribution of shaved heads and severed hair.\nTheir kin endure sorrowful wailing,\nLike tumbleweeds, when shall their wandering cease?\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist sanctuary,\nHaving heard the inconceivable words of the Compassionate Venerable One,\nWhere karmic consequences are made manifest,\nAnd transmigration endlessly continues,\nNow arouse the mind of resolve,\nAnd seek mercy through rites of repentance.\nMay those in the hells, the hungry ghosts, and the realm of beasts,\nBy the power of this repentance,\nThe power of merit and virtue,\nAnd the inconceivable power,\nAll attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace,\nAnd offers this repentance text in supplication.\nWith five limbs touching the earth,\nAnd a single mind, they listen attentively.\nBowing in reverence to the Compassionate Venerable One,\nThey pay homage to the true and sacred.\n\nWith sincere devotion, they pay homage to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings from the Jade Clarity,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering at a Cry’s Sound,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Florescence,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Manifests in Accord with the World,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Wondrous Forms,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms Across Myriad Kalpas,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Mountain of Merit and Virtue,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Pure Flowing Light,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preaches the Dharma Without Obstruction,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Opens Conditions and Delivers Beings,\nThe Heavenly Worthy, King of Pure Wisdom and Virtue,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Form,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Emptiness and Formlessness,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Lifespan,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Constantly Preaches the Dharma,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Wealth Abundantly,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Bestows the Dharma,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Without Equal,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Illumination,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Perfects All,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Ensures Longevity,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Protects the Realm,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy,\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reaches,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue,\nThe Perfected of the Great Solar Canopy of Compassion,\nThe Perfected of the Lunar Purity of Great Mercy,\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Perfected of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this Daoist sanctuary,\nTogether with the great assembly,\nTake refuge and aspire toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northwest,\nAll the Venerables and Sages,\nAll the great heavenly immortals,\nThe earthly immortals,\nAll the great Perfected,\nAll the great Perfected Who Save from Suffering,\nAll the great youths,\nThe Youths of the Primal Boundary,\nWho pervade the ten directions,\nAnd fill the boundless realms,\nAll the true and sacred ones of the past and future.\nMay they, by the power of the Dao,\nThe power of merit and virtue,\nThe power of supreme goodness,\nThe power of the heavenly immortals,\nAnd the power of spiritual penetrations,\nCause the repentant one, [Name],\nFor the immeasurable kalpas of transgressions from destroying and plundering,\nThrough this repentance rite,\nTo wash away faults and offenses,\nAnd forever dispel obstacles and afflictions.\nMay they not suffer retribution,\nBut ascend to realize the fruits of the Dao,\nAnd reach the shore of non-action.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Three: On Not Violating the Fast**\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled turn their minds as one, bowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of breaking the fast.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], gathers the heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: All sentient beings, from the moment they receive form until this very day, have been bound by stinginess, greed, and craving—drinking wine, eating meat, chewing without restraint, nourishing flesh and blood, fostering pus and decay. Day by day, afflictions and illnesses arise, and the roots of sin grow ever deeper.\n\nMoreover, through birth, aging, sickness, and death, through scorching heat, dampness, cold, and wind, through bitter pain and corrosive suffering, they are assailed by noxious qi, and a hundred diseases invade the body. Thought after thought, impermanence ceaselessly presses on, day and night unrelenting. The bodily form and the knowing nature differ in each, yet all revolve in endless cycles, trapped for ten thousand kalpas without escape.\n\nThese sentient beings, their minds often corrupted, treat the fasts and precepts with irreverence. As the years advance and old age approaches, as sickness and distress entwine them, in this one life, one lifetime, they toil for self-preservation, all because of their voracious consumption of impure foods. Their organs steam and ferment, offending the true and sacred ones. The winds of karma fan their bodies, causing gold and jade to dissolve, their forms to wither prematurely.\n\nYet I, who neither drink nor eat, embrace the Dao in its naturalness, transforming without limit, living forever without death. I constantly expound the scriptures and teachings, seeking to deliver all beings. If, in their ignorance and delusion, they cannot believe or follow, I am ever concerned, never at rest. Thus, I offer the fast as a means to dispel their sickness and suffering.\n\nMoreover, the hosts of the Three Clarities, who long ago realized the truth of the Dao, always observe the fasts with diligence, never growing lax. How much more so the six fasts of the lunar months, the ten days of upright conduct, the eight seasonal nodes, the three primal festivals, the jiazi and benming days, the three assemblies of the gengshen, and all other fasts and gatherings—subtle and wondrous beyond thought—all established by the Merciful Honored One to guide and receive sentient beings, enabling them to cultivate practice and escape the perils of demonic obstacles.\n\nYet you, all you sentient beings, though you know the names of these fasts, do not arouse reverent hearts. And even when you do, you often violate them. Some mix impure foods, blending the foul with the sacred, sharing the same kitchen without purifying themselves, treating all with careless disdain. Others eat after midday, their minds still stained, slandering the utmost truth, equating it with falsehood. Their words are deceitful, their hearts swayed by love and hatred. Such foolishness leads to countless violations of the fast.\n\nSome break the Fast of the Great Perfected, some the Fast of the Golden Register, some the Fast of Divine Incantations, some the Fast of the Yellow Register, some the Fast of Illuminating the True, some the Fast of Spontaneous Perfection, some the Three Primal Fasts, some the Fast of Mud and Ash, some the Fast of the Cavern Spirits—fasts such as these, whether established for the state, for the deliverance of ancestors, for the rescue of the drowning, for the sake of departed kin, or for the benefit of others. At first, they arise with faith and devotion, but later, regret takes hold. Their sins deepen, and they suffer boundless torment.\n\nIf, for the sake of the Dharma-body of ordained men and women, whether ten, a hundred, or even more, the fast is distributed according to its scale, ensuring no partiality, then all who speak of fasting must do so with a giving heart—not with ostentation, nor with meager offerings. Those who are ordained should share equally in the fast. To select or discriminate is to treat it with disdain. To fail to arouse reverence is to break the fast.\n\nFurthermore, if one takes for oneself even a single coin from the offerings of a fast, the construction of images, or any other materials, one must repay tenfold within ten years. If not repaid, the retribution is severe illness, deformity, and eternal banishment from the human realm. They will roost like birds, sleep exposed like beasts. Even if reborn as humans, they will be afflicted by the six chronic illnesses—deaf, blind, and lacking the five senses. If one uses the food of the fast to make offerings to the Dharma-body, or the banners and canopies for venerable images, yet does so without reverence, later growing remorseful, the karmic consequences are beyond description.\n\nWhen life ends, they are reborn as hungry ghosts—necks thin as bowstrings, bellies swollen like drums, bodies burdened by iron wheels, flames scorching them on all sides. To cover themselves with cloth is like touching a mountain of fire. When they eat or drink, it turns to pus and blood. If they suffer this in the present life, they lie bedridden with malignant disease, their bodies festering and foul, shunned by all. For years and months, flesh wastes away, sinews dissolve. Once cast into hell, they will scarcely be reborn in heaven. In future lives, even if born among humans, they will be deaf, blind, and afflicted by the six illnesses, bereft of beauty, inferior to others. All their kin will treat them as outcasts. If they become husband and wife, they will part midway, leaving orphaned sons and widowed daughters to depend on others. Poor, cold, and hungry, their forms will be ugly, barely clinging to human form.\n\nAll such sins arise from breaking the fast. If one does not repent, they will sink ever deeper. Thus, the Merciful Honored One, for the sake of those yet unawakened, speaks these verses:\n\nThose who break the fast in life\nAre reborn as hungry ghosts.\nHungry, they eat raging fire;\nThirsty, they drink molten bronze.\nTheir bodies char and wither,\nTreading the edge of frost and blade.\nDay and night without respite,\nTheir suffering knows no end.\nEven if a time of liberation comes,\nThey are no better than dogs and horses—\nHungry, cold, poor, and lowly,\nHow could they possess full form?\n\nI now extend my compassion,\nMy wisdom boundless through kalpas.\nI establish this great Dharma-bridge\nTo save the foolish and deaf.\nI bow my head to the Supreme Dao,\nRoaming freely in the Palace of the Great Ultimate.\n\nToday, all assembled in this sanctuary, having heard these verses, having heard this scripture, having heard this repentance, all sentient beings who have committed such deeds must undergo retribution. Today, they vow and set their minds to dedicate their merit to the Three Saints, that they may avoid such sins. Whether in the six paths of rebirth or the four modes of birth, whether they have already suffered or have yet to face retribution, all now confess openly, aspiring to attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and in offering to the ancestors, bowing fully to the ground, vowing with a mind of devotion. Bowing to the Merciful Honored One, paying homage to the true and sacred ones.\n\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity who bestows blessings.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and delivers from suffering.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Splendor.\nWith wholehearted

all.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of long life and life-preservation.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who delivers from suffering.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who guards the realm.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to vows.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless expanse.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, ocean of merit and virtue.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies who fulfill all four perfections.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Perfected of Dharma Liberation.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Perfected of the Wheel of Heaven.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion who delivers from suffering.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy who removes transgressions.\n\nToday, the assembly in this sanctuary, together with the benefactors, reverently aspire that the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northwest, all the venerable ones and sages, all the great divine immortals, all the great heavenly immortals, all the great earthly immortals, all the great water immortals, all the great Perfected, all the great youths, the immortals of the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens, the sages of rivers and ancient sites, all the assemblies of holy ones, all the wondrous forms—the forms of the Perfected, the forms of jade youths, the forms of jade maidens, the Dharmakāya forms—pervading the ten directions, filling the realms of profound emptiness, all the true and sacred ones, with minds of vast deliverance, minds of Dao-power, minds of the Perfected, minds of the youths, may enable the repentant one, [Name], and their nine generations of ancestors across three lifetimes—their past bodies, future bodies, and present bodies—possessing boundless, immeasurable karmic ties, past and present, or transgressions of breaking precepts, to repent today and, by the power of the Dao, attain universal liberation.\n\nFrom this day forward, facing the sacred and the true, with purified minds and bodies, they reverently uphold the precepts, aspiring that the merit and virtue may uplift their nine generations of ancestors, rescue those sunk in suffering, and deliver themselves, all their kin, and all beings of the six paths and four modes of birth, that all may ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\n**First Bow**\n**Chapter Four: Transgressions Against Scriptures and Precepts**\n\nToday, the assembly in this sanctuary, each with focused mind, prostrates in homage to the Merciful Honored One, repenting for transgressions against scriptures and precepts.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], gathers their mind and kneels in earnest, listening attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings possess the three karmas and the six senses. From kalpa to kalpa, in this life and today, they commit theft, sexual misconduct, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, frivolous speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech—boundless, immeasurable transgressions that entangle the body, leaving no means of liberation.\n\nThe scriptures and precepts clearly expound the Dharma gates, varying in number and differing in rank. They admonish and guide beings to diminish karmic roots. Some receive the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Seven Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twelve Acceptable Precepts, Fourteen Precepts for Upholding the Body, Twenty-Four Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, or even the Forty Precepts of the Lower Grade of the Cavernous Mystery, the Sixty Precepts of the Middle Grade, the Eighty-One Precepts of the Upper Grade, the One Hundred Eighty Precepts, or the Three Hundred Precepts of the Upper Clarity for Observing the Body, and the Seven Hundred Twenty Precepts of the Cavernous Spirit. Each has its sequence, guiding the deluded multitude.\n\nThose who uphold the precepts gain boundless, immeasurable blessings; those who do not uphold them incur boundless, immeasurable karmic retribution. Moreover, the scriptures of the Three Caverns circulate among humans. If beings cannot believe and accept them, how much less the precepts? These are the city walls and dwelling houses of beings, where jade youths and jade maidens, vajra spirit-kings, and guardians come to attend and protect, praising on all sides, dispelling calamities, delivering from misfortune, preserving life, and prolonging years. The compassionate light of the true and sacred ones brings joy to all heavens. Thus, blades and weapons, floods and fires, tigers, wolves, insects, and snakes, illnesses, prisons, ghosts, thieves, hunger, cold, and afflictions are forever eradicated. One then obtains sons when seeking sons, daughters when seeking daughters, wealth, nobility, intelligence, and dignified appearance, earning respect among people—benefits beyond conception. In past lives, they are reborn in heavenly palaces and pure lands, amidst flower terraces and jeweled trees, with natural clothing and food, wondrous offerings from celestial kitchens, cloud canopies and dragon chariots, carefree and joyous, constantly hearing the scriptures, standing in attendance to the Merciful Honored One. In future rebirths, they will encounter the true Dao.\n\nAll sentient beings, if they uphold the precepts, are like a precious sword that severs all, like a Dharma boat that ferries all, like a fierce fire that burns all, like pure water that washes all. Those who uphold the precepts guard against wrongdoing, restrain evil, discipline body and mind, subdue demonic foes, and move the numinous and sacred. Yet you, all beings, whether having received them personally or witnessed others receiving them, have failed to revere and believe, constantly harboring arrogance, committing countless transgressions, accumulating slander, treating them as mere play, neglecting to uphold them, acting contrary to their words, writing carelessly, reciting irreverently, altering the text, and deviating from the scriptures.\n\nSome may read the *Taiqing Treasury Scriptures*, the *Shangqing Treasury Scriptures*, or the *Yuqing Treasury Scriptures*—whether reciting them themselves or witnessing others recite them—yet treat them with frivolity, failing to arouse reverent mindfulness. They disdain the sacred words, extol the Great Dao without offering devotion, and neglect their protection with half-hearted care. Some transcribe them with poor paper and ink, binding them shoddily with crooked cords and slanted rollers, staining or losing the text. Others annotate and alter the meanings, their ignorance obstructing the principles, devoid of veneration. Such transgressions, with deep karmic roots, if left unrepented, will forever bar one from the cycles of rebirth.\n\nShould they remain in the world, they will be afflicted by malignant illnesses, their bodies frail and feeble, their breath faint and weak, their speech coarse and clumsy, ignorant of rites and music, unable to discern right from wrong. When their life ends, they will fail to ascend to the Pure Land, their sins plunging them into profound darkness, where suffering ceaselessly torments them. No rebirth awaits them—only relentless trials, each debt repaid in full, enduring agony with groans, their flesh and bones severed by karmic bonds. They will bear the torment of a single body: climbing a thousand-fathom sword-tree, grasping its branches to ascend, only to sink into a cauldron of boiling water, crushed beneath its weight until utterly consumed. Only then may they find respite—all from violating the precepts, born of disbelief.\n\nThus the Compassionate One spoke in verse:\n*Those who transgress scriptures and precepts in life*\n*Shall enter the hell of blades and needles in death.*\n*Pierced on all sides, their bodies endure*\n*Ten thousand pains beyond endurance.*\n*They traverse the blade-mountains, then plunge*\n*Into cauldrons of boiling water.*\n*Death they seek but cannot find—*\n*Only after ten thousand kalpas may they be reborn.*\n\nToday, the assembly of this grand ritual, as the scriptures foretell, trembles with dread. For the transgressions we have committed—violating scriptures and precepts, boundless and measureless, grave and weighty sins—we shall suffer their retribution in future lives or even in this present existence. Now, we prostrate ourselves in sincerity, making confession and repentance. May all beings across the four modes of birth and six realms of existence, sharing the same karmic cause and effect, each attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant sponsor, [Name], humbly offers this text of repentance for peace and merit-transference, prostrating with the five limbs touching the earth, wholeheartedly invoking the sacred. Bowing in reverence to the Compassionate One, we pay homage to the true and holy sages:\n\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity who bestows blessings.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues upon hearing cries of suffering.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Brilliance.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon Radiance.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Attained Dao.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mountain of Virtue and Treasure.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, King of the Mountain of All Treasures.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Supreme Virtues.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of All Wisdom.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Power of Dao-Wisdom.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Nature of Dao and Things.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Virtue.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Dharma Joy.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformation and Transmission.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Precepts.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Dissemination.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Rebirth According to Aspiration.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Virtue.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Salvation.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One who Delivers from Suffering.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin-Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant sponsor of this ritual and the entire assembly lift their aspirations toward the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, together with all venerated sages, all great immortals, all great perfected ones, and all great divine youths—manifesting across the ten directions and throughout the boundless cosmos. May they, in unison, bestow the power of the Dao and arouse compassionate hearts. May the repentant sponsor, [Name], their parents of three lifetimes, their present parents, and all their kin—who have violated precepts and defied scriptures, accumulating manifold sins—through this act of repentance, attain liberation. From this day forward, through all future lives, may they don the dark crown and yellow robe, assuming the dharma-bodies of male or female officials. May they together uphold the precepts, receive the precepts at the same altar, accept the registers of precepts, study under the same master, undergo the same ordination, be jointly recommended, and simultaneously be delivered. Whether as male or female officials or youths, may they forever vow to observe the precepts, reverently tend the incense fire, remain ever vigilant, instruct and guide their dharma-disciples, uphold their vows, and walk the supreme Dao.\n\nMay the power of virtue and wisdom, through skillful means, rescue and deliver all sentient beings, freeing them from worldly defilements. May all who hear or witness this be filled with joy, ascend to the realization of non-action, and return to the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nThe *Tai Shang* Merciful Compassion Ritual Arena for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms: Repentance Scroll Six Concludes\n*The Tai Shang Merciful Compassion Ritual Arena for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms: Repentance Scroll Seven*\n\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate\n\n**Chapter One: Dispelling Disobedience and Rebellion**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this ritual arena, each turning their minds, bow their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of disobedience and unfilial impiety.\n\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, gathers their mind, kneels reverently, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings, from the moment they receive the illumination of sun and moon, drift with the turning of fate, endowed with skin and hair, all owing to their parents.\n\nThe Universal Savior says: Without examining the causes and conditions of parents, the weight of their kindness and obligation, how can one know the requital of their nurturing?\n\nThe Merciful Honored One says:\nIf the form is straight, its shadow must be upright;\nIf the form is not straight, its shadow must be crooked.\nIf the voice is clear, its echo must be pure;\nIf the voice is not clear, its sound must be turbid.\nFilial piety and impiety follow this principle.\n\nIf one is filial and fraternal, within a single household, the old and young live in peace. The world holds them in esteem, divine spirits guard them, and descendants carry on the lineage, their filial kindness unbroken. They attract filial devotion, treasuring it as a precious jewel.\n\nYet if one is unfilial, generation after generation, within a single household, all become enemies. Though they speak of parents, they treat them as foes, summoning the disobedient to be their children. Parents and siblings keep separate finances and meals, share gardens but divide vegetables, split fields and grain, hide delicacies, and eat in secret. Though in human form, they are worse than birds and beasts. Divine spirits do not protect them; all their deeds in life are inauspicious. Upon death, they enter hell, enduring every suffering. Only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn, as the *bailao* bird, whose young, upon hatching, devour their mother. Only after leaving the nest do they return to the human realm, where the unfilial gather as fathers and sons, harming one another, mutually resentful. No suffering in the world exceeds this.\n\nYet without a father, one would not be born; without a mother, one would not be raised. Thus, heaven and earth cover and nurture, entrusting life to the mother’s body. The two *qi* congeal, and for ten months she carries the child, burdened and heavy, sitting and lying uncomfortably. When the time is full, at the moment of birth, the mother is terrified, her life hanging by a thread. Her heart aches, her spirit grieves, and in an instant, she fears for her life. On the day of delivery, internal and external pains assail her, agony intertwined. She loses her voice in wailing, enduring great torment, trembling in fear, shocked and sighing.\n\nOnce born, the mother rejoices beyond measure, wrapping the child in swaddling clothes. For three months, she lies on her side, ever wary of evil spirits. When hungry, the child needs food—only the mother feeds them. When thirsty, the child needs drink—only the mother nurses them. Calculating the milk she drinks, it amounts to eight *hu* and four *sheng*. For a thousand days, the mother carries the child, washing away dirt and grime, placing them in dry spots while taking the wet, swallowing bitterness and offering sweetness. Without the father, there is no closeness; without the mother, there is no nurturing.\n\nIn the *Kaihuang* kalpa of old, there was a sentient being whose parents were aged, their strength and vitality waning. From dawn to dusk, their child never came to inquire after them. The parents dwelled alone in an empty room, like strangers. They had little clothing and scant food, hunger and cold piercing their bodies. Their hands and feet were stiff, their ears deaf and eyes dim. They slept on a single bed with a thin mat, each day feeling like a year. Their bodies were frail and emaciated, infested with ants and lice. Mosquitoes bit their flesh, and they could not sleep all night, sighing and groaning. Seeing their child’s unfilial conduct, they leaned on a staff to call out, heads bowed and breath subdued, wishing to voice their grievances but unable to finish their words. Their child raised their voice, glaring angrily, and cursed their parents. Turning away, they retreated, leaning on the wall to return home, beating their chest in sorrow, eyes swollen from weeping, crying out in misery, wishing they had died sooner.\n\nThe mother said to her elder son: When you were small, had I not raised you, fed you, and shielded you, you would not have survived. For ten months, I carried you like a heavy burden, my breath panting, more labored than running. At times, I suffered chills and fever, unable to sit or lie comfortably. My belly split, my chest felt full, my hair fell out, and I grew thin, unable to eat. A month before birth, I was constantly anxious, fearing we would not part. On the day of delivery, my life was like a flickering candle. My limbs and veins felt as if cut by knives, my five viscera and six bowels burned like fire. After you were born, joy and fear mingled; the pains and sorrows cannot be fully described. For three years, I carried you day and night, never apart. I endured filth, lost sleep, and missed meals, watching your complexion to tend to your hunger and fullness. If you fell ill, my heart ached for you. Hearing your suffering, I could not eat. My mouth and throat were parched as I sought every blessing. Gold and silver, clothes and toys—I wished for your safety and spared nothing.\n\nI remember when you were small, you followed me everywhere, never leaving my side. You ate when I ate, slept when I slept. A single day without me, and you would not eat all day; a single night without me, and you would cry without sleep. How have you grown to suddenly become my enemy? Now, though I have you, it would be better if I had never borne you. I wish I could die soon and be free of you.\n\nThus, that child truly incurred the grave sin of disobedience and unfilial impiety. Upon death, they entered the Fengdu Hell of the North, enduring every suffering, experiencing all bitterness, dying and being reborn ten thousand times—none of it can be fully recounted.\n\nThen, the Merciful Honored One, for those yet unenlightened, spoke this verse:\n\nGood naturally meets good,\nEvil returns to its evil root.\nIn life, lacking kindness and filial piety,\nIn death, one sinks forever.\nEnduring all sufferings,\nPassing through the eighteen gates.\nIf not on the day of my three pardons,\nOne will never hear of liberation.\nReborn as the *bailao* bird,\nFlesh and bone torn by one’s young.\nWhen the retribution is complete and one returns to the human path,\nOne meets again as child and grandchild.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this ritual arena, hearing these scriptural words, must awaken greatly.\n\nFrom past lives to this present existence, should any have committed the karmic transgressions of disobedience and unfilial conduct, in days to come they may yet suffer this retribution. Let them now diligently advance, arouse the mind of repentance, and vow that all beings who receive such retribution may together attain liberation. The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial rites, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly arousing the vow.\n\nWith bowed head, I pay homage to the Merciful Honored One, reverently saluting the true sages.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues suffering upon hearing cries.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Upper Jade Palace.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who saves and delivers the world.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Pristine Radiance of Cosmic Qi.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Sound and Self-Mastery.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Self-Mastery and Dharma Victory.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Capital and Myriad Longevities.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy, King of Everlasting Joy.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Salvation and Deliverance.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constantly Increasing Superior Goodness.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Congealed Splendor and Golden Flowers.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Purple Purity who delivers souls.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Dharma and Expedient Means.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who engenders and completes the myriad existences.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Moisture Dharma Ocean.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Transformation and Responsive Assembly.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmonious Embrace and Nurturing Life.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Realizing Fruition and Perfect Illumination.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Brahma Golden Body.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao’s Intent.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Cultivating Wondrous Practices.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Constancy and Quiescence.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Awesome Virtue.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Radiance and Wondrous Brilliance.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Response and Manifestation.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Supreme One who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and National Protection.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to vows.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Perfected of Eastern Florescence.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Five Emperors Perfected.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith sincere reverence, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Deliverance from Sin.\n\nToday, the patrons of this ritual arena and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, to all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected, all the great immortals, all the great divine youths, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless cosmos, and manifest as all true sages. With cinnabar flowers and pure water, may they cleanse the three lifetimes’ kin of the repentant one, [Name], from the infinite kalpas past to this very day—should any have committed the karmic transgressions of disobedience and unfilial conduct, whether enacted or yet to be received—through this repentance, may all be extinguished, and may they not suffer retribution. From this day forward, in life after life, may they revere their parents as heaven and earth, as emperors and kings; may they stand in awe of their parents as the stars and the sun and moon. In the state, may they be utterly loyal; in the family, utterly filial. Toward all beings, human and non-human, may they fully observe kindness and obedience. May they awaken to past transgressions and early realize the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Vowing to Repay the Kindness of Mercy**\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, each member of the great assembly directs their mind and takes refuge in the Merciful Honored One, speaking of the karmic causes and effects of repaying the kindness of mercy. The repentant one, [Name], collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All beings cycle through birth and death, revolving through the dark realms. Now, I radiate great light, penetrating the five directions and ten lands. All suffering beings are delivered, save only those guilty of disobedience, who cannot ascend. Know that the kindness and righteousness of parents is profound and weighty. The boundless heavens cannot be repaid; even grinding one’s bones to powder and carving one’s flesh cannot fully requite it. If one can cultivate steadfast resolve, outwardly practicing filial devotion and nurturing, inwardly harboring vast compassion, then not only one’s own parents, but all beings are one’s parents. All beings are one’s brothers. All beings are one’s sisters. All beings are one’s flesh and blood. All beings are one’s sons and daughters. All beings are those who nurture and raise. All beings are those one loves and protects. Do not harm their lives; do not consume their flesh. Whether in past lives, future lives, or the present life, regard all beings as kin. Through manifold expedient means, this is called repaying kindness. Should any man or woman wish to perform meritorious deeds to repay the kindness of heaven and earth, the sovereign, their teachers, and their birth parents, let them proceed in order: first for heaven and earth, second for the emperor, third for their teachers, fourth for their birth parents, fifth for all beings of the great earth, and sixth for all their own kin. Yet among worldly men and women, from the moment they emerge from their mother’s womb, through one year, ten years, a hundred years, or a hundred and twenty years, they must prepare in advance. Beginning with the first seven-day period, cycling repeatedly, even unto distant years, let the meritorious deeds they perform follow this order: first, commissioning images; second, commissioning scriptures; third, erecting long banners of forty-nine feet, establishing forty-nine Dharma bodies, providing vegetarian feasts, and constructing ritual arenas to invite scriptures and images. Let the Dharma masters’ ritual lamps number forty-nine vessels, or more as their capacity allows. Let lamps be arranged like chariot wheels, burning for three days and nights, seven days and nights, or forty-nine days and nights, dedicated to the sovereign, the emperor, their teachers, Dharma kin, parents, siblings, and all their own kin. With hearts laid bare and utmost sincerity, they pay homage to my invoked titles, repent their own transgressions, pray for blessings and grace, repay the kindness of mercy, offer wholehearted devotion, and extol with praise.\n\nAll past transgressions, once repented, must be amended with renewed cultivation. Diligently observe fasts and precepts, turn the heart toward compassion and goodness, and extend almsgiving to the fields of merit—whether to the poor and lowly, the disabled, the sick and solitary elders, prisoners, hungry ghosts, or all sentient beings. Those who lack benevolence should be exhorted to embrace virtuous causes. For travelers from afar in dire need, provide succor, rescue them from peril, and offer clothing and food to ensure their sufficiency. Then, renew the vow to honor parents with filial piety. The wealthy should commission images and copy scriptures to deliver beings from the three wretched destinies and the five sufferings, and to liberate those sunk in the depths of torment. According to their vows, they may attain rebirth—this is the repayment of kindness.\n\nIf any man or woman, through accumulated deeds, has ever slandered the Three Treasures, been disloyal or unfilial, offended the sovereign or ruler, teachers, or parents, or committed the five grave transgressions—such deep and weighty sins that they fear falling into hell at life’s end and suffering myriad torments—let them, for the sake of the sovereign, ruler, teachers, or parents, generate resolve and make vows: transcribe scriptures and repentance texts, even a single line or verse; venerate my invoked titles, one or two or many. On the day of their passing, they shall not enter hell nor endure former karmic retribution, but proceed directly to heaven to receive boundless joy.\n\nIf any man or woman, for the sake of the sovereign, ruler, teachers, parents, or their own kin, observes the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, either at home or at sacred altars, venerates my sacred titles, repents sins and averts misfortune, holds grand vegetarian feasts, prepares fragrant offerings piled high as mountains, gathers fruits and herbs, presents flowers, and arranges pure offerings—vigilantly seeking blessings and grace through the night—then may the nation and household be secured, the great earth delivered, and all sentient beings rescued. Let none commit the ten evils or grave offenses, and may the sins of nine generations of ancestors, whether already suffered or yet to be, all be extinguished. If on such days the meaning of the scriptures is expounded, and the ignorant and benighted are guided to awaken loyalty, filial piety, and the resolve to save others, this merit shall be foremost.\n\nThen, the Compassionate Honored One, for the sake of those yet unawakened, spoke this verse:\n\nAll people in the world,\nShould cultivate filial piety in body and mind.\nRevere and cherish heaven and earth,\nAs you would your own parents.\nUltimately attain the fruit of the Dao,\nWith wondrous practices renewed each day.\nI now expound the sublime Dharma,\nTo deliver those sunk in suffering.\nKarma unfolds in endless retribution,\nTurning the wheel of kalpas day and night.\nI establish this great Dharma bridge,\nTo ferry you across the river of craving.\nWondrous indeed are the Three Caverns’ scriptures,\nTranscending those with karmic affinity.\n\nToday, the master of repentance in this ritual arena, along with the assembly, having heard the scriptural teachings on repaying kindness through myriad causes, all awaken to the need for gratitude and vow never to act in defiance. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, they bow with their entire being, wholeheartedly generating resolve.\n\nWith reverence, they bow to the Compassionate Honored One,\nAnd pay homage to the true sages.\n\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Through Sound.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Upper Jade Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Splendor.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, King of All Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Clarity’s Spiritual Transformations.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Conduct and Right Contemplation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preaches in the Nine Dark Realms.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Divine Merit.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Manifests in All Directions.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Golden Splendor and Wondrous Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Empty Tranquility and Right Contemplation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms the Three Realms.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Hundred Million Heavenly Worthies Who Respond to Names.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves According to Vows.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Essence and Dharma Ocean.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues Lives from the Purple Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Illuminating Lofty Conduct.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades All Beings Without Limit.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Wondrousness.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Adornment.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean Treasury.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Auspicious Response.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Longevity.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Nation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Vows.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Wondrous Awareness.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Compassionate Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this ritual arena, along with the assembly, reverently pray that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, all the honored ones, sages, great perfected, great heavenly immortals, great earthly immortals, and all the great youthful saviors who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless cosmos, and manifest in response to names—may they sprinkle the waters of the Jasper Pool to purify body and mind. Through their unimpeded power, may the repentance master here generate resolve and turn toward all manner of good causes, thereby attaining immeasurable blessings, fulfilling every wish, and accomplishing all aspirations. From this day forward, they vow to repay kindness to the best of their ability. May all karmic adversaries from past kalpas, all sins great and small, along with those of their teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, their own kin, and the three generations of affinal relatives—whether from past lives, now liberated, or presently living—be enabled to establish merit and repay virtue. Through the power of this repentance, may all beings, whether male or female, embody the mysterious wind of unity and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow to the third repentance rite: *Dissolving Residual Karmic Obstructions*\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Compassionate Honored One to repent and release the multitude of residual karmic obstructions. The repentance master, with sincere heart and kneeling posture, listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll beings arise from the primordial qi of the undifferentiated. Through the kindness of parents—carrying, nurturing, breastfeeding—they gradually grow, yet unable to discern, they become entangled in desire, and the roots of transgression flourish. If not for repentance, if not for the expounding of scriptures and precepts, gently guiding them into the right Dao, they would forever remain bound by the ignorance of aversion and attachment, fettered to the mundane world.\n\nParents can only give birth to us; they cannot perfect us. It is our teachers who reveal the scriptures and precepts, enabling us to transcend afflictions. Thus, the kindness of teachers surpasses even that of parents.\n\nYet we see beings who, from the moment they establish themselves in the world, fail to recognize the profound debt owed to their teachers. Instead, they respond with scorn and abuse, withhold what is needed, deny sweet sustenance, refuse clothing and food, treat them as strangers, or even plot harm. Such acts align them with rebellious children, inviting karmic retribution in return.\n\nWe see beings who observe fasts and precepts—some, occupying high positions, humiliate those beneath them; others, relying on wealth and status, oppress the orphaned and impoverished...\n\nSome abuse their power to oppress the lowly and weak; others, holding office, make extortion their intent, inflicting cruel punishments at will, enriching themselves at public expense, and acting against the Dao/Way. They encroach upon the blessed lands of the Three Treasures, occupying their pure sanctuaries. Some commission revered images, transcribe scriptures, or establish sacred observatories, construct refectories, and hold fasts and rituals. Yet as leaders, they steal property, engage in fraudulent trade, or misappropriate the wealth of monastic endowments or donors. They live alongside parents, siblings, and kin, yet in all their dealings, they deceive and rob one another. They shift fences to encroach on others’ land, seize fields and gardens, exploit public authority to seize others’ inns and shops, cheat merchants in trade, use false weights and measures, reduce lengths and widths, conceal fractions of grain, falsify calculations, substitute coarse for fine, exchange short for long, and devise a hundred deceits to gain the slightest profit. They burn others’ homes, falsely implicate the innocent, envy others’ wealth and status, spread slander, and vent rage upon their parents. They lend capital to exact exorbitant interest, indulge in greed and desire, seize others’ property by force, refuse to repay debts, and deny their obligations. They kill without cause, engage in illicit sacrifices, defy public and private authority, file baseless accusations, act with arrogance and rudeness, deceive superiors and betray subordinates. Some strip the belongings of ordained practitioners, desecrate graves to steal coffins, or cast nets and traps to cunningly seize creatures from ponds, pools, rivers, the Huai and Ji, seas and streams, springs, lakes, and waterways. Such karmic offenses are manifold and beyond count. If beings commit even one such transgression, they incur grave retribution, burdening billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, as well as their parents, themselves, and their six relations and nine clans. The deceased and those of past lives suffer misfortune, descending into hell, where each is ground by millstones, enduring retribution for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—if reborn at all, they may not survive infancy, living out their days in solitude. Such karmic conditions are predestined. Today, in this ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the sins and blessings, good and evil of beings return in retribution, seen and heard like a turning wheel, swift as an echo. Let each gather their thoughts and cultivate in accord with the teachings. If years pass in vain, and age and illness press upon you, when body and life perish in a single day, what means remain to escape this sinking into darkness? Through this rite of repentance, may all—those present, past, and yet to incur such karmic offenses—receive the moisture of the Dharma, universally attain liberation, and be freed from bondage.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence, bowing with body, mind, and heart, to offer this text of repentance for peace and merit-transference. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, they raise their thoughts in devotion:\n\nWith bowed head, they pay homage to the Compassionate Venerable One, reverently saluting the true and sacred.\n\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering at a Cry.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Upper Jade Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wondrous Dharma.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Stillness and Compassion.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Flowing Gold and the Purple Ultimate.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Illumines the Dark Night.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Suffering’s Liberation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Nine Nights’ Jeweled Light.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Wondrous Splendor.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Jeweled Pearl.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Divine Penetration and Profound Abyss.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Illumination.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Perfected.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Illuminating Beneficence.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wisdom’s Response.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Wondrous and Marvelous.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mighty Spirit.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Eternal Abiding.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Flowing Light and the Dharma Realm.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and State Protection.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wish.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Wisdom’s Countenance.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Wisdom’s Contemplation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Sin-Removal.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this ritual assembly, together with all present, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Perfected Persons, all the Great Divine Youths, and all the boundless hosts of divine immortals and sacred assemblies—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the vast expanse, and manifest as all true and sacred beings. With the water of cinnabar blossoms, may they cleanse the hearts and mouths of the repentant one, [Name], their billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, their parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, their sons and daughters, all their kin, and both the living and the dead. From kalpas past to the present, from this life to this very day, for all the karmic offenses and sins they have committed, and all the residual karmic burdens they have accrued in this world, whether now confined in the prisons of hell, may they repent and be swiftly purified, depart from evil paths, enter good conditions, avoid the five destinies, and universally attain carefree joy. May they drink from the single Dharma, be reborn in eternal bliss, realize the unconditioned, and together ascend the Great Dao/Way.\n\nOne bow. *Seeing Karmic Retribution*, Fourth Chapter.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Daoist ritual, each with sincere intent, reverently bows to the Merciful Honored One, repenting and expounding the karmic causes and effects of retribution. The repentant one, [Name], kneels with devoted heart, attentively heeding the scriptural words:\n\nAll beings who deface or destroy the true and sacred images of the Perfected, or the Three Caverns’ scriptures, shall in this life suffer leprosy as retribution, and upon death enter hell, where only after ten thousand kalpas may they be reborn—into the body of a wild beast. If they return to the human realm, their tongues shall rot and decay.\n\nThose who slander the Dharma-body of the renunciates shall in this life suffer the retribution of festering sores, and in past lives be reborn among the six kinds of livestock.\n\nThose who desecrate or damage sacred temples and altars shall in this life have their eyebrows and beards fall out, their bodies fester and waste away, and in past lives be reborn as venomous serpents.\n\nThose who show disrespect to the sacred images and true countenance of the Heavenly Worthy and the Great Dao/Way shall in this life be dull-witted and foolish, and in past lives be reborn in poverty and lowliness.\n\nThose who do not believe in the scriptures or the retribution of past lives shall in this life suffer deafness and blindness, and in past lives be reborn among birds and beasts.\n\nThose who do not believe in the karmic causes and effects of sin and merit shall in this life be enslaved as servants, and in past lives be reborn among barbarian tribes.\n\nThose who slight or disdain the Dharma-body of the renunciates shall in this life be lame and crippled, and in past lives be reborn among swine and dogs.\n\nThose who defile the sacred grounds of the Three Treasures shall in this life be ugly in appearance, and in past lives be reborn in filth and dung.\n\nThose who engage in licentious acts with the Dharma-body of the renunciates shall in this life suffer the retribution of loneliness and widowhood, and in past lives be reborn in latrines and cesspits.\n\nThose who steal the wealth and property of the Three Treasures shall in this life be impoverished, and in past lives be reborn as servants.\n\nThose who steal the communal possessions of the monastic community shall in this life suffer from wind-borne diseases, and in past lives be reborn in animal forms.\n\nThose who steal the offerings of the fourfold assembly shall in this life be afflicted with madness, and in past lives be reborn as fools.\n\nThose who consume the vegetables and fruits of the Three Treasures shall in this life suffer from wasting thirst, and in past lives be reborn as starving tigers and venomous serpents.\n\nThose who steal the food offerings of the fast shall in this life be struck dead by thunderbolts, and in past lives be reborn as vipers and serpents, or upon death enter the realm of hungry ghosts.\n\nThose who steal the Dharma-robes and ritual implements shall in this life be naked and exposed, and in past lives be reborn as starving dogs.\n\nThose who steal the scriptures, images, and vestments shall in this life suffer painful retributions, and upon death enter hell, where they shall remain for ten thousand kalpas without release.\n\nThose who break the fast or violate the precepts shall in this life suffer from throat diseases, and in past lives be reborn deaf and blind.\n\nThose who kill living beings shall in this life suffer from chronic illness and short lifespans, and in past lives be reborn among the six kinds of livestock.\n\nThose who consume meat or partake of impure foods shall in this life suffer from poverty and disease.\n\nThose who indulge in wine and give free rein to their passions shall in this life be afflicted with madness and lack steadfastness of mind.\n\nThose who mock or ridicule the renunciates shall in this life bear the appearance of gibbons and apes.\n\nThose whose hands or feet are maimed or broken have come from disrespect toward the Three Sages.\n\nThose whose eyes are afflicted with cataracts have come from disbelief in the scriptures.\n\nThose whose tongues are shriveled or retracted have come from defacing the scriptures.\n\nThose who are mute and unable to speak have come from slandering the Dharma-body of the renunciates.\n\nThose whose noses are blocked and cannot smell have come from indulging in wine, meat, and the five pungent roots.\n\nThose whose bodies fester and ulcerate have come from destroying the true and sacred images.\n\nThose whose eyebrows and beards fall out have come from failing to revere the sacred images.\n\nThose whose lips curl, teeth protrude, and noses collapse have come from disrupting ritual arenas.\n\nThose who are hunchbacked, crook-chested, or have twisted spines and short legs have come from arrogance and disdain.\n\nThose who are afflicted

love.\n\nThose who are shorn of hair, with deep-set eyes and long noses, have come from hunting and taking life.\n\nAll such bodily forms in this life arise from past offenses and karmic transgressions, from dying and passing through hell, and even in future rebirths, the retribution shall know no respite.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One addressed the Universal Savior, saying: “You must wholeheartedly believe and uphold this, clearly instructing future generations, so that all men and women may fully understand the karmic retributions of past lives, the manifold causes and conditions. Today, the great assembly of this Daoist ritual, as the scriptures declare, suffers these various retributions in this life due to deeds committed in past lives. You must awaken and reflect deeply. Do not say that hell is unreal or that heaven is a falsehood. You must arouse sincere and earnest mindfulness, with deep remorse and gravity. May all beings follow and obey the teachings, entering the Dharma-gate, just as one who wishes to traverse a perilous path must find a ladder or boat. Without such merit, by what means can one cross over?”\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in supplication.

Awakening to the fruits of karma, may I cultivate practice in accordance with the teachings.\n\nMay I, in life after life, never lose my human nature. May all sentient beings, in the worlds to come, together be born in the Land of Bliss and equally partake of the Mysterious Wind.\n\nProstrating in reverence, I take refuge in the Supreme True Dao.\nOne bow.\n\nThe *Tai Shang*’s Compassionate *Dao* Altar: *Nine Dark Hells Repentance for Disaster Dispelling*, Scroll Seven—Concluded\nThe *Tai Shang*’s Compassionate *Dao* Altar: *Nine Dark Hells Repentance for Disaster Dispelling*, Scroll Eight\nCompiled by Supreme Left Immortal Lord Ge Xuan\n\n**First Chapter: Deliverance from the Sufferings of Fengdu Hell**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this *Dao* altar, each with concentrated mind, reverently faces the Compassionate Honored One to deliver those suffering in Fengdu Hell.\n\nThe repentant master, kneeling in prostration, listens attentively to the scriptural words: Hell is neither existent nor nonexistent.\n\nThe Universal Savior asks, “Why is it said to be nonexistent?”\nThe Compassionate Honored One replies, “If all sentient beings do not indulge the three karmic actions, do not give rein to the six senses, do not commit the ten evils, nor perpetrate the five rebellious acts or any transgressions, then upon death they will not enter the nine dark hells of Fengdu but proceed directly to the heavenly realms, carefree and at ease. This is what is meant by nonexistent.”\n\n“Why is it said to be not nonexistent?”\n“If sentient beings indulge the three karmic actions and six senses, commit the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, and boundless transgressions, then upon death they will enter the nine dark hells of Fengdu, where each offense is examined and punished. They shall endure bitter agonies for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth. This is what is meant by not nonexistent.”\n\nSince it is known to be not nonexistent, one must seek repentance. A single day of self-reflection, awakening, and repentance dissolves the sins of ten thousand kalpas. How is the power of this repentance known? In ancient times, there was a man born foolish and ignorant, who committed myriad sins. One day, he reflected and awakened; witnessing the five signs of decay, he was seized with terror and took refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereupon, the roots of his decay and transgressions instantly dissolved, and his heavenly years were prolonged. Thus, all here present, with the teachings clearly expounded, know that repentance enables sentient beings to avoid hell and its manifold sufferings.\n\nIf one does not encounter a good spiritual guide, evil karma deepens. They may know only to wash away the grease and grime from the body but fail to sweep the dust from the heart. Thus, at life’s end, they enter hell and endure the weight of their transgressions. At such a time, remorse and fear come too late. Body and mind are shattered, spirit and soul scattered. The wind-knives stand before them; repentance is no longer possible. What recourse remains for their suffering?\n\nAll you sentient beings, do not rely on your prime of life, do not cling to wealth and treasure, do not become attached to family and kin. Do not indulge in fleeting pleasures, courting the agony of death. When the great limit arrives, it spares neither rich nor poor, neither old nor young, neither noble nor base—all are ground to nothingness. Like the wind’s lamp or spark from stone, what endures? Like lightning at noon or morning dew, what is firm?\n\nWhen the five celestial messengers and the death-dealing ghosts of impermanence arrive, even youth and radiant beauty cannot resist. At that moment, grand halls and secluded chambers become irrelevant; fine carriages and mighty steeds cannot follow; wives, children, and kin are no longer one’s own; the seven treasures and precious ornaments become playthings for others. The Merciful Honored One said: In the Red Clarity Kalpa of old, there was a sentient being, sharp-witted and intelligent, who subdued afflictions. Though wealthy, he refused to give alms to the poor. When his life ended, he fell into the animal realm, reborn as a red fox, enduring karmic retribution in full. All you sentient beings, be ever vigilant—lest in a single morning you be bound to such suffering, when regret comes too late.\n\nConsider this: in the world of the living, if one faces even a minor matter and must enter the public court, though the offense be slight, the heart trembles in fear. Kinfolk grow anxious, exhausting every means to seek deliverance. How much more so for the beings in hell? Compared to them, such distress is but a shadow.\n\nCountless hells, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, are all governed within this celestial realm. Located in the far north, beyond the Northern Heavens, past boundless, measureless dark abysses, there lies a world called the Five Qi Mystic Heaven, the Dark North, the Solitary, Profound, and Utmost Land. Within it, the Five Qi Five Spirits Mystic Elder Black Emperor Heavenly Lord presides over the northern quarter, restraining the yin demons.\n\nBeneath this land lies the Great Void, the Vast Wilderness, and the boundless, fathomless Black Sea. Its waters are vile, its shores unknowable. At its center rises a great mountain, piercing the azure heavens above and plunging into the windy springs below—Mount Fengdu of the North. It towers one million six hundred thousand *li* high, with a circumference of five hundred thousand *li*. Its base sinks fifteen thousand *li* into the water. At the water’s edge, where the mountain’s foot meets the sea, lies a vast cavern called the Yin Shadow Heaven, the land known as Great Yin.\n\nBeneath the Water Emperor are thirty-six lesser hells, each walled in iron, ninefold encircled. Within each hell, grasses and trees arise from the naturally venomous qi, their branches and leaves transformed into blades and swords, their edges sharp and plentiful. Fierce beasts, scorching smoke, and black winds rage ceaselessly, day and night. The darkness is profound, poisonous qi and bloody light surge, and the stench of filth and decay fills the air. The light of sun, moon, and stars cannot penetrate these hells.\n\nThirty-seven kings preside, each over one hell. Within each, seventy tiers of knife-forests stand, along with countless iron nets. Fire blazes from above, flames surge from below, intertwining like fish in a searing pan. The iron-walled cities have four gates, and at each gate stand four great bronze dogs, each body spanning forty *li*. When they roar, the iron walls tremble. Their fangs are like forests of swords, their claws sharp and forms ferocious—beyond compare.\n\nThere are also countless iron birds, each over a *zhang* in size, with beaks of bronze and claws of iron. They beat their wings in flight, eyes like shooting stars, feathers like iron arrows, each tipped with swirling flames. When they shriek, their cries shake the earth like thunderbolts. Fire spews from their beaks and feathers, and all such creatures devour the marrow of the damned. The pain of the condemned is beyond description, their suffering piercing to the liver and heart. For immeasurable ages, they seek life but find none, seek respite but receive none.\n\nToday, in this ritual assembly, as the sutras describe, such hells exist—boundless and unceasing, their torments endless. Through this rite of repentance, we extend our prayers to all hells, that those enduring suffering may attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion. With bowed head, we pay homage to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerate the true sages:\n\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Upon Hearing the Cry.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Immortals.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Wondrously Serene Golden Light Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Fulfilled Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ever-Shining Dharma Lamp.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Ferries Across on the Jeweled Boat.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ever-Pure Dharma Sea.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Commands the Registrar of Life.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Ten Sufferings.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects the Realm.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Responses.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled King.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Supreme One Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Grants Longevity.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Realm-Protection.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Aspiration.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unified Dao.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Perfected of Azure Mystery.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Three Heavens’ Perfected.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Greatly Compassionate Perfected Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Greatly Merciful Perfected Who Delivers from Sin.\n\nToday, the repentant one and this great assembly humbly pray to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, to all the honored ones, all the sages, all the great perfected, all the great transformers, all the great immortals, and all the youthful saviors of suffering, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and respond to every invocation of the true and sacred.\n\nMay the subtle and wondrous radiance of their hair-tips illuminate the hells of Mount Fengdu. For the repentant one, [Name], and those of the past—nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, parents of three lifetimes, uncles, brothers, and all family—who may be confined in darkness, enduring torment, may they swiftly attain liberation through the power of this repentance, the power of merit and virtue, and the inconceivable power, ascending to the Dao of non-action.\n\nA Bow: Expounding the Thirty-Seven Hells, Second Scroll\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, each with concentrated mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One to recite the names of the thirty-seven hells.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], gathers his thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the exposition:\n\nIn Fengdu’s Mount Luoshan, to the east, west, south, and north, thirty-six hells are arrayed. At their center lies one hell, called the Northern Mount Luoshan, the Great Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering.\n\nThe Universal Savior speaks: “To the east, west, south, and north, thirty-six hells in all—may we hear their names.”\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replies:\nTo the east are nine hells: Heavenly One, Heavenly Overseer, Heavenly Leveler, Heavenly Void, Heavenly Sovereign, Nine Heavens, Primordial Rectitude, Punitive Rectitude, and Great Perfected.\nTo the south are nine hells: Flowing Fire, Fire Pellets, Fire Arrows, Flying Fire, Burning Feet, Fire Elephant, Burning Body, Primordial Leveler, and Prohibitive Punishment.\nTo the west are nine hells: Iron Chariots, Iron Horses, Iron Oxen, Iron Donkeys, Iron Awls, Iron Beds, Iron Staffs, Iron Chains, and Iron Rakes.\nTo the north are nine hells: Dark Sands, Northern Darkness, Female Azure, River Earl, Profound Darkness, Accumulated Kalpas, Statutory Decrees, Excrement and Urine, and Ice Pools.\n\nThese thirty-six hells, each governed by the karmic deeds of beings, administer punishment according to their offenses.\n\nAt their center lies one hell, where those guilty of the ten evils and five heinous crimes are confined. Within it stand:\nKnife Mountains and Sword Trees,\nCauldrons of Boiling Water and Furnaces of Burning Coals,\nMolten Copper Pillars,\nIron Plows and Iron Pellets,\nIron Awls and Iron Mills,\nIron Pestles and Iron Mountains,\nIron Nails and Iron Cangues,\nIron Rods and Iron Scales,\nIron Shackles and Iron Manacles,\nIron Locks and Iron Caskets,\nIron Birds and Ash Rivers,\nSnow Mountains and Ice Wells,\nFire Pits and Dismemberment,\nStrangulation and Sawing,\nFlaying of Skin,\nStinking Turtles and Smoldering Embers,\nBurning from Feet to Hands,\nBlades, Needles, and Narrow Rocks,\nFire Mountains and Fire Mills—\ncountless torments, beyond numbering.\n\nWithin hangs a mirror that reflects the sins of the damned, revealing every hidden transgression. A moment there is like an eon passed. Ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths, each agony more bitter than the last. No other hell compares.\n\nThe warden of this hell oversees all others, hence it is called the Great Central Hell.\n*Avīci* means “great,” and *bi* means “to obstruct.” *Wu jian* means “without respite.” Thus, it is called the Great Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering.\nAlternatively, *a* means “unceasing,” and *bi* means “unrelenting.” Torment and pain know no pause, no rest. Within, karmic winds blow upon the bodies and minds of the damned, shattering them into ten thousand deaths, only to revive them in an instant. Thus, in a single moment, ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths occur—so it is in all the hells.\n\nHere, the Great Emperor of Fengdu commands two hundred forty bureaus, overseeing fifty thousand minions who interrogate the damned, probing the weight of their sins, leaving no detail unexamined, and reporting all deeds, good and evil.\n\nConsider the Iron Chariot, engulfed in fierce flames, ever ablaze. A yakṣa dwells within; from afar, the damned see it as a fair maiden and long to approach. Yet upon entering, their flesh and bones turn to ash and smoke.\n\nThe Iron Ox’s body, head, fur, horns, and tail are sharp as blades. From afar, the damned see it as a golden lotus, but upon reaching it, flames and smoke consume their bodies, leaving no trace.\n\nThe Iron Horse’s form, mane, and tail are keen as sword edges. The Iron Donkey is the same. Each is led by a yakṣa to the damned. When they mount, their bodies dissolve. The Iron Rakes and other implements of torment—cruel, vicious, and venomous, with raging fires and razor edges—are beyond description.\n\nYou, all beings, may hear of these torments but must never witness them. Should you encounter such a place, escape would be impossible for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nDo not speak idly of hells and heavens. The unseen and the seen are equal; life and death are the same. It is like a man’s dream and his waking: death is as the dream, and birth as waking. What is done in dreams differs not from waking; what is done in death differs not from life. Joy in dreams is self-made; suffering in waking is self-caused.\n\nYou, all beings, should reflect deeply and seek early deliverance. The means to deliverance is none other than repentance. After repentance, abandon past wrongs and cultivate anew.\n\nMoreover, in the Middle Kingdom, it is rare to obtain a human body. Rarer still is one who cultivates good fruits. Like the sun and moon, whose light shines impartially, illuminating all, leaving no darkness unlit—you, all beings, are neither blind nor deaf. The blind see not the sun and moon; the deaf hear not of good and evil. Having heard of good and evil, having seen the sun and moon, those who do not awaken are like vines clinging to a tree: as the tree grows, so do they. When the tree falls, what will the vines cling to?\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures warn, trembles in fear and sorrow. Now, with diligence, we bow in repentance, seeking mercy. May we, life after life, never encounter such places. May all beings in hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms alike attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing himself to the ground with utmost sincerity. With reverence, he bows to the Merciful Honored One and venerates the true and sacred.\n\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves at the Sound of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Ascendant Immortals.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Lofty and Unsurpassed Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassion and Love.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Constant Mercy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of No Coming and No Going.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Shelters All.\n\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Fruits in the Six Paths.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Clarity and Numinous Transformation.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Clarity and Constant Serenity.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Orthodox Unity.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected Who Attends the Scriptures.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this Daoist ritual and all the assembly reverently pray that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Great Realized Ones, all the Great Dragon Spirits, all the Great Worthies and Sages, and all the Great Divine Youths—throughout the ten directions and the boundless expanse of the Mysterious Void, all the Perfected and Sages—by the power of great compassion, the power of repentance rites, the power of merit and virtue, and the power of inconceivable efficacy, may grant that the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, their parents of this and past lives, all their relatives by blood and marriage, and their living and deceased kin—those who have passed on, if they suffer in hell for their transgressions—through this act of repentance, be liberated.\n\nWe further pray that the Merciful Honored One may manifest the power of goodness to eradicate from the Fengdu Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering:\nthe karmic retribution of falling upon knife mountains and sword trees, where limbs and bodies are severed;\nthe karmic retribution of boiling cauldrons and burning coals, where bodies are scorched and cooked;\nthe karmic retribution of iron beds and bronze pillars, where bodies are seared and charred;\nthe karmic retribution of blade wheels and fire chariots, where thunderous bolts strike;\nthe karmic retribution of having tongues plowed and bodies harrowed, where agony is unbearable;\nthe karmic retribution of swallowing molten iron pellets and having molten bronze poured into the mouth, where bones and flesh dissolve and rot;\nthe karmic retribution of being pounded and ground into dust, where bodies are reduced to ashes;\nthe karmic retribution of having limbs and joints torn apart;\nthe karmic retribution of wading through filthy ash rivers, where torment and suffocation prevail;\nthe karmic retribution of enduring saltwater and freezing ice, where skin splits and flesh cracks;\nthe karmic retribution of being mauled by tigers, wolves, eagles, and hounds, where mutual destruction occurs;\nthe karmic retribution of being clawed and slashed by blade mountains, where bodies are torn and pierced;\nthe karmic retribution of being roasted in fire pits, crushed between grinding stones, where bodies are shattered;\nthe karmic retribution of darkness and confinement, where flesh mountains are carved, bodies are sawed, twisted, and nailed, and limbs are severed;\nthe karmic retribution of being hung upside down with iron rods, where bodies are butchered and burned, and cries of anguish resound;\nthe karmic retribution of the great and small Iron Enclosures, the thirty-seven cities, where the three luminaries are unseen, and the sounds *apapa*, *apavava*, *ataṭa*, *ararara* echo—the sufferings of the eight cold and eight hot hells;\nthe karmic retribution of all the hells, where iron hooks drag bodies, tendons are pulled, intestines are torn, flesh is sliced, and bones are shaved—countless agonies;\nmay all these karmic retributions be eradicated.\n\nMay the kings, their retinues, and all beings receive the moisture of the Dharma and together attain promotion and reward. May all our kin—those not related by blood yet closer than kin—after the breath of life has ceased, whether they have entered these hells or not, by the power of this repentance for karmic transgressions, ascend to the Heavenly Paradise and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n*Repentance of the Nine Dark Realms, Third Scroll*\n\nToday, all in this Daoist ritual assembly, each with focused mind, reverently face the Merciful Honored One to repent for the sufferings of the Nine Dark Hells in the Nine Dark Realms. The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, gathers their thoughts, kneels in devotion, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nThe Nine Dark Realms lie in the northeast, the land of yin and darkness. Beneath the nine ramparts is the Nine Dark Hell, deep and sunken, where beings are bound and confined.\n\nIn the east is the Wind and Thunder Hell, where black winds and thunderous bolts ceaselessly strike, and flying spears and halberds pierce through. The bodies of the condemned are torn apart, and for ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the south is the Fire Obscuration Hell, where the condemned swallow fire and devour coals, scorched by flames. Their heads and faces are charred and rotting, fire mountains rest upon their crowns, and their skin, flesh, and bones blaze in every joint. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the west is the Vajra Hell, where the condemned are beaten with countless iron hammers and rods. Their limbs rot and disintegrate, tendons and bones scatter, iron forks pierce their bellies, and golden hammers lodge in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the north is the Dark and Cold Hell, where the condemned sink into freezing pools. Ice spears and frost blades sever their tendons and bones, and the juices of a hundred poisons are poured upon them. Their bodies disintegrate, and their hearts and bellies rupture. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the center is the Universal Torment Hell, where the condemned endure unbearable pain from beatings. Their tendons snap, blood flows, and they collapse in suffocating agony. Then, the hell wardens impale them with iron forks, forcing them to ascend blade mountains and sword trees, where winds from eight directions sway the trees. Their feet tread upon blade mountains, and their bodies are impaled upon sword edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the southeast is the Bronze Pillar Hell, where great fires rage with fierce flames. The condemned embrace and climb the pillars, their outer and inner bodies charred and rotting, their backs and bellies oozing pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the southwest is the Butchery Hell, where the condemned are hung upside down, their bodies sliced by blades. Their four limbs, tendons, veins, skin, and five viscera are all cut by knives. Blood flows from their bodies, pooling upon the ground, the pain unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the northwest is the Fire Chariot Hell, where the condemned are torn apart by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some are placed within the chariots, which drag them east and west. All wheels are edged with blades, and as they turn, they slice the condemned. Fierce fires burn their bodies to cinders. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the northeast is the Boiling Cauldron Hell, where the condemned are impaled by iron forks and cast into cauldrons.\n\nTheir five bodily parts are boiled and simmered, their four limbs fester and dissolve, pus and blood reek with foulness—unbearable torment. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nPǔjì asked, “What grave offenses condemn one to such torment? And who presides over their unceasing interrogation?”\n\nThe Compassionate One replied, “Those who commit the three karmic transgressions—slandering the Great Vehicle, disloyalty to the sovereign, maligning monastics, defiling the Dharma-body, destroying sacred images, or embezzling monastic property—fall into the Nine Dark Hells to endure this retribution. There, the Three Officials govern the Nine Bureaus, where clerks and magistrates conduct inquiries, extending even to Fengdu.”\n\nPǔjì asked, “Is each transgression met with a single punishment, or are a hundred offenses met with a hundred torments?”\n\nThe Compassionate One replied, “Iron beds and bronze pillars, agony unbearable—crushed bones and scorched sinews repay the sin of lust. Freezing cold that sears to the bone, forcing them to lie in icy rivers, repays the sin of theft. Molten copper poured into their mouths, tongues torn out and plowed, eyes pecked by vile birds. Sword trees splay their limbs, grinding mills pulverize them like grain—this repays the sin of deceitful glances. Their bodies become hungry ghosts, wandering through cauldrons of boiling liquid, forced to swallow iron pellets when hunger strikes—this repays the sin of breaking precepts. Each interrogation and torment corresponds precisely to their karma, with no discrepancy.\n\nToday, in this ritual space, the penitent, [Name], prostrates in reverence, vowing to dedicate merit with diligence. May the anguish of the Nine Dark Hells be repented, and may all karmic retribution destined for them today be wholly dissolved. The penitent, [Name], bows in devotion, invoking blessings for peace, and recites this repentance text, prostrating with full sincerity, listening with undivided mind.\n\nWe bow in reverence to the Compassionate One, honoring the True and Sacred.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity who bestows blessings.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues suffering upon hearing cries.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Immortals.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of keen wisdom.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless wisdom.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Natural Great Perfection.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of unimpeded divine power.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who parts the darkness with radiant features.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, the Dharma King of luminous purity.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of compassionate countenance who rescues suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers and transcends life.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who illuminates the Nine Dark Hells.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delights in practicing the Dao.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who benefits through the Dharma.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Thousand Perfected.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of supreme radiance.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who rescues suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants longevity and preserves life.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who protects the realm.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to vows.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless expanse.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of the Great Ultimate.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Liberation.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion who rescues suffering.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy who absolves transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this ritual space and the great assembly pray to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northeast, and to all the Venerable Ones, all the Great Perfected, and all the Divine Youths—may they, who pervade the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the cosmos, and all the True and Sacred, radiate their perfect light to illuminate the dark prisons. May destruction be eradicated, and all attain purity. May all suffering souls transcend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. May blade mountains and sword trees transform into jeweled forests, cauldrons and furnaces into lotus blossoms. May ox-headed jailers become benevolent companions, and all ghosts and spirits abandon malevolent thoughts.\n\nThrough this repentance ritual, may all imprisoned in the earth prisons be absolved. May the six paths and four modes of birth awaken to non-action and ascend the true Dao. One bow.\n\n**Chapter Four: Absolving Hell-Prisons, Delivering Hungry Ghosts and Animals**\n\nToday, in this ritual space, each member of the great assembly directs their mind, gazing up to the Compassionate One, arousing compassion and cultivating equanimity. May all officials of the hells be elevated, and may hungry ghosts, animals, and beings in the evil destinies be delivered.\n\nThe penitent, [Name], kneels in reverence, concentrating their thoughts, prostrating in repentance. Moreover, the ox-headed jailers, rākṣasas, yakṣas, and countless malevolent ghosts dwelling in hell have yet to transcend the cycle of rebirth. Adrift in the vast sea of suffering, confined in the dark prisons, they have no refuge, forever shrouded in gloom. There are also copper dogs, iron birds, iron horses, iron snakes, iron donkeys, iron oxen, stinking turtles, fierce beasts, venomous insects, and all manner of evil beings—each repaying past misdeeds, bound by karmic retribution.\n\nToday, through this repentance ritual, we vow to universally dedicate our thoughts, relying on the power of goodness, the power of the Dao, and the power of merit. May all officials of the hells attain liberation, escape the realm of suffering, and gradually ascend to the ranks of celestial immortals, reuniting with the supreme Dao. May their karmic fruits transform, and may they be reborn as humans. May all venomous beings self-destruct.\n\nMoreover, those in the realm of hungry ghosts endure eternal hunger and thirst. Though they crave to devour mountains, they never hear the names of broth or water, food or drink, and instead consume pus, blood, and foulness. When their bodies move, their limbs ignite with fire. Their bellies swell like drums, their necks thin as bowstrings.\n\nToday, through this repentance ritual, we vow with boundless thoughts, relying on the power of merit, the inconceivable power, and the power of deliverance. May all hungry ghosts and their kin attain rebirth, receive human form, and enjoy exquisite food and drink that arrive at their wish.\n\nMoreover, those in the animal realm—all species, devoid of knowledge and freedom—endure whipping, torture, slaughter, and butchery. Some have feet, scales, wings, or hooves; some fly, some walk; some have fur, shells, horns, or claws; some are large, some small; some are eaten by humans, others are not. Aquatic creatures, wriggling beings, those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—all such kinds.\n\nThrough the power of this Daoist ritual arena, the power of repentance rites, and the power of merit, may they attain rebirth in the human realm. The repentant patron [Name] prostrates for peace and offers posthumous deliverance, fearing the karmic causes that may lead to downfall. Relying on this repentance, may all be fully liberated.\n\nThe repentant patron [Name] prostrates with five limbs to the ground, wholeheartedly invoking. Bowing in reverence to the Merciful Venerable One, paying homage to the true sages:\n\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response who saves from suffering.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Immortality.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Ascension through the Nine Grades.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who universally nourishes all beings.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who washes away stagnation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Cyclic Transformation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Radiance.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who verifies fruition.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers from calamity.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Transformation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Wisdom.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who propagates the Dao.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who opens the gate of life.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Transformation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who apportions rebirth.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Void and Nine Essences.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Rebirth according to Aspiration.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who protects the realm.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Universal Salvation.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Mercy who absolves transgressions.\n\nToday, the patrons of this ritual arena and the great assembly, looking up in hope, invoke the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, all the venerable ones and sages, all the great immortals of the Five Peaks, the immortals of watery abysses and grottoes, the worthies and sages of altars and earthly domains, all dragon deities and local earth gods throughout the ten directions, to the farthest reaches of the boundless void, all the infinite true sages bearing countless titles.\n\nMay all invoke the power of aspiration, the power of vast vows, the power of repentance rites, the power of merit, the boundless and infinite power, so that the repentant patron [Name]’s nine generations of ancestors, three lifetimes of kin, those who have relinquished or received bodies—whether in the hells, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the animal realm, yet to attain liberation—may, through this repentance, achieve transcendence and rebirth, attaining carefree freedom. Through this wondrous power and the power of the Dao, may it extend to all beings, that together they may embrace the mystic wind and ascend the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Section Five: Liberation from Harm Caused by Womb-Birth**\n\nToday, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds in devotion, prostrating before the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Compassionate Savior of Suffering in the ten directions, to dissolve and release the calamities of womb-birth and harm inflicted upon others.\n\nThe repentant patron [Name], gathering their heart in reverence, kneels and listens attentively, invoking this aspiration:\n\nFor the harm of womb-birth is inherited across generations—ancestral customs of worshipping ghosts and spirits, immersion in worldly defilements, and the proliferation of deceit and transgression. Thus, sins accumulate like mountains, summoning severe retribution. In recent years, affairs have been fraught with misfortune, entangled in illness and suffering, with unceasing calamities. Frightening dreams arise in profusion, and strange omens manifest without end. Since ancient times, the afflictions of ancestors have never ceased.\n\nWhether from the three generations of great-grandparents, seven generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or the three lifetimes of parents—both maternal and paternal—if ancestral tombs remain unsettled, they may harbor litigious spirits or malevolent ghosts, their baleful influence unbroken. Or perhaps in burial, construction, relocation, or renovation; in marriage rites or the selection of inauspicious days and hours; in violating taboos; or in excavating pits and trenches, disturbing earth spirits—such acts may subject the living and the dead to torment and punishment, binding their souls in confinement. The misfortunes thus incurred flow onward, extending even to future generations. The transgressions committed are too numerous to recount.\n\nToday, with utmost devotion, we perform this repentance rite, beseeching the Three Saints with sorrowful sincerity, that through this liberation, the repentant patron [Name] may attain deliverance.\n\nProstrating in reverence for peace and to offer this repentance text, the patron [Name] bows with body and mind, earnestly invoking the Compassionate Savior, paying homage to the True Saints:\n\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ascended Immortals.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Golden Palace and Jade Treasure.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Pristine Forces.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Divine Transformation and Dao’s Workings.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Natural Perfected Ones.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Wondrous Gathering in Golden Clouds.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Radiant Illumination, Dharma Kings.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Golden Form, Serene and Profound.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of a Hundred Billion Manifested Bodies.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Natural Golden Perfected Ones.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Mystic Penetration and Universal Awakening.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Origins, Keepers of Records.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Caverns, Profound and Still.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Supreme Mystery, Wondrous and Victorious.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Illuminating Response and True Realization.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Liberation from the Four Delusions.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Supreme Unity’s Savior of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Boundless Extent.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Great Compassionate Savior of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Great Merciful Redeemer of Sins.\n\nToday, the repentant patron and all assembled in this sacred precinct humbly beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the northeast, along with all the Venerable Saints, Great Perfected Ones, and Divine Youths—spanning the ten directions, the boundless void, past and future, all hidden and manifest True Saints.\n\nThrough the power of the Great Dao-heart, the power of non-action, the power of merit, and the power of supreme goodness, may the three generations of the repentant patron [Name]’s souls—whether lost to famine, banditry, or warfare; to blades, ropes, or unjust imprisonment; to tigers, wolves, or poisonous curses; to bewitchment by trees or stones; to fire, drowning, or self-inflicted wounds; to hanging, epidemics, or the five poisons; to ulcers, leprosy, abscesses, or festering sores; to madness, starvation, or freezing; to sudden malevolent forces or murder by evil spirits; to childbirth complications or miscarriage; to attacks by birds of prey or foxes; or to injuries from livestock—those confined in celestial prisons or earthly hells, bearing sand on their backs or stones upon their shoulders, hauling mountains or filling rivers, enduring ceaseless toil and suffering—be liberated.\n\nOr perhaps their tombs and burial grounds were disturbed, graves opened, coffins desecrated, bones scattered and exposed, skulls and limbs strewn apart, left unburied in the wild, their souls adrift without refuge. Through the power of this virtuous act, may the three generations of souls, long departed, find rest: if their bones lie in water, may they be water-buried; if in fire, fire-buried; if on earth, exposed to the elements; if devoured by beasts, hidden in concealment; if upon wood or stone, entrusted to their care; if slain by blades, transformed by the sword.\n\nMay the repentant patron [Name], from this day forward, be freed from misfortune, illness, and suffering; may nightmares cease, and omens vanish. May ancestral souls and tombs forever know peace and prosperity, their households flourishing, sons and daughters thriving, receiving blessings and office, with descendants succeeding in unbroken lineage. May glory and nobility endure across generations, ever upheld by the profound grace of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nThe Eighth Scroll of the *Tai Shang’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms* concludes.\nThe Ninth Scroll of the *Tai Shang’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms* begins.\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate.\n\n**First Chapter: Praying for the State**\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each with focused mind, gazes reverently toward the Compassionate Honored One. May you expound for all beings, teaching them to pray for the state and their households, seeking grace and blessings.\n\nThe repentant patron [Name], kneeling with hands clasped, listens attentively to the scriptural words. If the sovereign faces calamity—celestial bodies losing their course, wars erupting on all sides, winds and rains unbalanced, the hundred grains failing to ripen, the people stricken by plague, the land unsettled, armies mobilized for campaigns, or any manner of disasters and inauspicious omens—all must be reported to me.\n\nGreat merits shall be cultivated: transcribing scriptures and commissioning sacred images, establishing temples to deliver beings, and offering from the treasury precious treasures, jewels, gold, silver, pearls, coral, amber, palace gardens, silken banners, fields, gardens, and dwellings. These shall be dedicated as alms, sown into the field of the Three Treasures, to deliver sentient beings, rescue those in peril, release prisoners, establish fasts and precepts, arrange hundreds of high seats, and expound the profound and wondrous teachings of the Great Vehicle. Thus shall the people of the realm be exhorted to listen to the Dharma, practice almsgiving and repentance, and accumulate boundless, inconceivable merits of salvation and protection.\n\nIf the sovereign and ministers indulge in wrath, pursue depravity, slaughter without restraint, seek self-indulgence, and oppress all beings, bringing forth calamities upon the people—where sun and moon lose their brightness, baleful stars encroach upon the imperial throne, the land suffers floods and droughts, omens and locusts appear, the people rebel, and usurpers rise—then the sovereign and all under heaven must summon the Three Caverns’ Dharma Bodies and the assembly of the altar, countless in number, to fill sacred altars, temples, mountains, waters, grottoes, and holy sites. There, grand rituals shall be established, banners and canopies hung, flowers scattered, incense burned, lamps lit, the Dao practiced day and night, repentance offered without weariness, and the six periods observed with diligence. Treasures shall be widely dispensed to rescue all beings. Then, by my Dao-power, I shall manifest great divine transformations to assist in dispelling these disasters, causing the afflictions to dissolve at once.\n\nIf within the realm the Five Stars lose their proper course, dim luminaries stray, the Twenty-Eight Constellations deviate from their domains, sun and moon suffer eclipses, and yin and yang fall out of harmony, then the Southern Director of Destinies, Lord Han the Venerable, and the Controller of the Eight Directions of the Celestial Sphere, Sima the Longevous, shall regulate the celestial mechanism, restoring them to their rightful positions, and all calamitous omens shall be extinguished.\n\nIf great drought leaves the people parched and suffering, then the Dragon Kings shall shake thunder and summon torrential rains to end the drought’s hardship. If heavy rains pour unceasingly, floods surge to the heavens, and the people drown, then the Jade Maiden of the River, the Dark Lord of the Nine Seas, and the Officers of the True Qi shall gather the water-qi, part the clouds, and halt the rain, causing the waters to recede without harm. At this time, all dragon-spirits and ghosts shall likewise turn toward goodness.\n\nIf external demons, evil spirits, or malevolent ghosts—*chimei* and *wangliang*—enter the land to spread sickness and suffering, they shall be expelled together, allowed no respite. By the weight of my compassion and virtue, the imperial domain shall be eternally secured, the sovereign’s power ever renewed. The people shall ascend to the court of benevolence and longevity, the state placed within the realm of Huaxu. Yin and yang shall harmonize, sun and moon shine eternally, the seas and lands know peace, ministers and people enjoy well-being, the three frontiers remain tranquil, and the five grains flourish abundantly.\n\nYet, among the people of the world, though their wealth, status, and conditions differ, even if they cultivate the Dao, they may not discern the proper path. They may perform deeds yet remain beset by calamities, wavering in doubt, unable to attain clarity. They wonder: does the merit of salvation and protection vary in degree?\n\nThe Compassionate Honored One replied: Salvation and deliverance from distress depend upon utmost sincerity; the almsgiving of wealth is not measured by quantity. There are five kinds of merit:\n\nFirst, the creation of my sacred images—true, responsive, and transformative manifestations. Blessings shall flow across kalpas, and retribution shall be boundless. Why? Because sentient beings, lost in delusion, cannot fix their minds. Beholding my true form, they generate devotion. With devotion arisen, true numen descends to meet them. Focused and unwavering, they attain the fruit of non-action.\n\nSecond, the transcription of scriptural teachings—the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns. Blessings shall flow eternally, and merits shall be immeasurable. For scriptures guide the deluded, awakening boundless Dao-mind in beings, leading them from confusion to enlightenment, from enlightenment to truth. All sages who cultivate the Dao ascend to its fruition.\n\nThird, the establishment of temples to deliver beings, the construction of halls and sanctuaries. The merit is boundless, inconceivable. Why?\n\nThird, the deliverance of beings through monastic ordination and temple stewardship, the propagation of scriptures and icons to teach and transform sentient beings, inspiring them to awaken the Dao-mind—one realization opening myriad gates. Through the turning of karmic conditions, they aid the nation and transform the people, spreading the Dao and illuminating the Dharma, yielding the greatest benefit.\n\nFourth, the observance of purification rites and the practice of the Dao, the performance of repentance and the recitation of scriptures, the offering of praise and the burning of incense. The field of merit is boundless. Thus, purification rites cleanse the heart, the Dao enables penetrating insight, the practice of the Dao atones for transgressions, repentance invokes blessings, and the resonance of merit moves the heavens, dispelling calamities and bestowing fortune, upon which both life and death depend.\n\nFifth, the bestowal of all things in boundless fields of merit. The karmic retribution is towering, its merit profound and deep. Wealth and possessions are the lifeblood of sentient beings, clung to as if one’s own life, yet to relinquish them without hesitation, to give without stinginess, is to broadly establish merit, universally succoring sentient beings, inwardly stilling greed and avarice, outwardly eliminating plunder and theft. In life and death, they receive grace, and both humans and heavens reap the benefit.\n\nThese five Dharma-gates of merit-making are to be cultivated gradually according to one’s capacity, safeguarding the nation and securing the household, transcending rebirth and delivering from suffering. As the scriptures say, it is like a single sweet rain—all who receive it are nourished. According to their innate faculties, each attains flourishing growth. So too is the performance of repentance and the seeking of forgiveness.\n\nToday, the assembly of this Dao-field, having heard the scriptural teachings, exhorts sentient beings to establish these inconceivable merits. The repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this very kalpa and this present life, has never before encountered such merit or the analogies of these Dharma-gates. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text in ancestral veneration, they attain great awakening and understanding, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion.\n\nWith bowed heads, they pay homage to the Merciful Venerable One, reverently saluting the true sages:\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy, Bestower of Fortune.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Jade Void Radiant August Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Ultimate’s True Form.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of True Unity and Spontaneity.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Records All.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Qi.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Dragon Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Victorious Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Joyful Wandering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Poles.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Knows the True.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Five Qi.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Void.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Golden Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Devotion.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Capital.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects and Responds.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Nation.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Precious Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Perfect Quiescence.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this Dao-field, together with the great assembly, surrenders and takes refuge, reverently beseeching the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Heavenly Immortals, all the Immortals of the Great Grotto-Heavens, Earth Immortals, Water Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones of Universal Salvation, Perfected Ones Who Rescue from Suffering, Youths Who Rescue from Suffering, and all true sages throughout the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the mysterious void, and all realms manifest and hidden.\n\nMay their vast and mysterious grace universally flow through the land. May the emperor’s reign be eternally prolonged, the beacon fires of war unlit, weapons stilled and sheathed, borders secured and frontiers guarded. May the imperial princes and heirs together strengthen the imperial enterprise, ministers and officials loyal and upright, assisting counselors and chancellors sharing the nation’s prosperity, jointly upholding the cosmos.\n\nMay heaven and earth be bright and pure, the celestial signs clear and mysterious, floods and droughts forever dispelled, locusts and pests never arise. May the three frontiers know perpetual peace, disasters and epidemics sink into obscurity, wind and rain arrive in season, harvests be abundant in years of plenty. May heaven bestow sweet dew, earth bring forth auspicious clouds, the nation prosper with worthy ministers, households abound with filial piety and fraternal duty.\n\nNext, may the prisons of Mount Luofeng, the eight difficulties and nine dark realms, cease their torments, and the suffering souls forever escape the three evil destinies.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this present kalpa and life, together with nine generations of ancestors, parents, and all kin, by the power of this repentance and merit, may all attain liberation and return to the true Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Second Scroll: The Salvation of the People**\n\nToday, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present turn their minds upward, gazing toward the Merciful Honored One, to broadly save the people and expound all virtuous benefits.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, gathers their thoughts, joins their hands, and listens attentively to the scriptural words, ever mindful of sentient beings dwelling in an age of the three poisons and ten evils, beset by specters and malevolent spirits, wicked ghosts and wayward deities, venomous creatures and fierce beasts, blades and warfare, flood and fire, fetters and prisons, sickness and suffering—each affliction clinging fast, leaving none at peace.\n\nThus are the Three Caverns’ scriptures and precepts expounded, the rites of deliverance and purification performed, to universally ferry all beings across. Talismans, sacred diagrams, and divine incantations are entrusted to those who study the Dao, along with the Heavenly Emperors, the Saviors of Suffering Perfected Ones, the Three Great Demon Kings of Heaven, and the Five Demon Kings of Heaven, who spread throughout the world to rescue and protect all, granting them freedom.\n\nYet sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and blessing. They indulge the six senses, killing and stealing, engaging in debauchery and dissipation, stinginess and wrath, their natures inverted. They speak deceitfully, utter falsehoods, slander with harsh words and divisive tongues, devour living beings, break fasts and violate precepts, defy heaven and betray earth, turn from the true and embrace the perverse, curse gods and spirits—sins rampant, with not a shred of goodness.\n\nThus do poisonous winds and malignant qi, the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens, fill the world, spreading slaughter and strife. Those struck down and wounded number in the tens of thousands each day, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One dispatches the Heavenly Emperors, the Ten Ultimate Divine Kings, and the Four Administrators of the Three Realms to descend into the human realm, traversing and rescuing, delivering sentient beings, filling heaven and earth—yet who among them knows this?\n\nNow I solemnly declare to you: the methods of salvation are inconceivable, their spiritual responses swift. In universal deliverance, I proclaim with great compassion and mercy, entreating the Honored One to bestow these teachings.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One says: On the first day of the year, the eight solar terms, the Three Primes, the dark and full moons, the Five La Days, and the Ten Straight Days—on all such occasions, good men and faithful women who observe these days must abstain from meat and impurity, restrain the six senses, and banish all wayward thoughts. Thus purified, they burn incense, maintain the fast, recite the Dao, and pay homage to my transformed names.\n\nFirst, they repent for their own transgressions, openly confessing their faults, thereby transferring merit to amend their errors and escape suffering and calamity. If one cannot focus alone, they may invoke the Dharma-bodies of male or female officiants, praying earnestly with devotion, making offerings and prostrations.\n\nWhether at home or in sacred temples, with flowers, fruits, vegetarian meals, banners, blossoms, incense, lamps, and offerings of clothing, bedding, curtains, embroidered mats, fragrant oils, rice, and flour—whatever they possess—then the benevolent spirits will descend at once, delivering them from misfortune.\n\nIf one suffers from grave illness, chronic ailments, or the malevolent influence of the Ox Mansion, lingering for years without relief, their vitality drained, their wealth dissipated; if childbirth brings misfortune, or infants perish in their arms; if one leaves the household to become a monastic, only to later regret it; if nightmares and strange visions disturb the mind, or fires and alarms cause terror; if legal troubles arise unjustly, or one violates sacred prohibitions, defies divine retribution, disturbs graves, or is struck by flood, fire, entangling trees, or crushing stones—all manner of calamities, omens, and afflictions—then within the home, perform extensive rites of repentance and supplication. According to one’s means, pay homage to my transformed names, kindle lamps and burn incense day and night without cease. The Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings will descend to protect my transformed names.\n\nThe exorcised will be subdued, the sought will be granted, the presented will be conveyed, the entreated will be heeded. Transgressions will be redeemed, the living and the dead will be saved. This form of prayer and exorcism is foremost.\n\nIf emperors, kings, great ministers, and royal advisors, along with princes, consorts, imperial children, and celestial descendants, act on behalf of their parents, themselves, their kin, court relatives, and imperial kin, summoning the Dharma-bodies of male and female officiants—regardless of number—to their palaces, where they maintain the fast, practice the Dao, and perform repentance day and night without pause, their devotion unwavering, then the Ten Perfected Ones of Heaven and the Four Administrators and Five Emperors will descend to assess their merits and faults. The sick will recover, the dead will revive, the imperiled will be delivered, the imprisoned will be freed, travelers will return, and officials will be promoted. Water, fire, blades, warfare, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, malevolent spirits, and spectral entities will never assail them, nor will they suffer harm or offense.\n\nIf common folk act on behalf of emperors, kings, the people, the land, and all sentient beings, paying homage to my transformed names and true images, delivering all beings, each will attain peace and bliss—this is most inconceivable.\n\nIf warfare erupts on all four fronts, encroaching upon borders, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the weapons of war will retreat, leaving no harm or damage.\n\nIf plague and pestilence strike the people, and exorcisms bring no relief, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflicted will recover, free from lingering illness.\n\nIf floods and droughts disrupt the seasons, and the five grains fail to ripen, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the elements will harmonize, all things flourishing.\n\nIf poisonous winds and malignant qi scorch the people, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflictions will vanish at once, the body and qi restored to tranquility.\n\nIf venomous creatures and fierce beasts ravage the people and all living beings, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the insects and tigers will flee, the mountain spirits concealing them.\n\nIf a woman is pregnant and childbirth brings peril, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and mother and child will be reunited, free from danger.\n\nTen thousand disasters will vanish, a thousand transformations and myriad changes will cease. Turn to me, to my transformed names, who broadly protect all sentient beings—no wish will go unfulfilled. With sincere devotion, no peril will remain unaverted.\n\nToday, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present must turn their minds as the scriptures instruct, with utmost devotion, paying homage to all transformed names and manifestations.\n\nMay these merits and virtues broadly deliver all sentient beings, universally ferry them across to liberation. The repentant sponsor, so-and-so, has dwelt in the world since time immemorial, sunk in the depths of sin and suffering, yet to attain liberation.

May all sentient beings be delivered and saved, depart from the source of suffering, and together ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Three: Unbinding the Knots of Sentient Beings**\n\nToday, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, the Boundless Dao, and all true sages, that for the sake of sentient beings, they may untie all knots and fetters.\n\nThe repentant sponsor, so-and-so, with purified body and mind, bows in profound devotion. As the scriptures declare: In the beginning, the Primordial One transformed the Three Realms with a single qi. Heaven and earth move, and the myriad things take form; humanity dwells within, receiving its nature and nurturing its form, all born of this transformation. Externally, it draws upon refined qi; internally and externally, the five virtues intermingle to take shape. Sentient beings, enveloped within, emerge from the womb after ten months, encircled by the ten qi. As qi circulates and gives life, the hundred joints unfold. Within each joint, qi forms ten knots, and within each knot resides a spirit. Habitual patterns intertwine, and transgressions coil into bonds.\n\nTo untie these knots and harmonize the hundred spirits, the ten directions are established, each bearing countless names. Each invoked name has the power to unbind the knots of sentient beings. If the knots of sentient beings are dissolved, they deeply awaken to the source of the Dao—much like in the worldly realm, where capturing a thief requires summoning a thousand soldiers, yet once the thief is seized, not a single soldier is needed.\n\nMoreover, the body of sentient beings is a temporary convergence of earth, water, fire, and wind, of yin and yang, manifest and hidden, all arising from the mutual contamination of the five viscera and six senses. The mind-king and the will-steed sow and cultivate: knots of doubt and delusion, knots of entanglement and obstruction, knots of injury and harm, knots of illness and affliction, knots of slander and strife, knots of enmity and grievance, knots of chronic ailment, knots of muteness and silence, knots of frivolity and play, knots of trade and exchange, knots of wine and gluttony, knots of killing and harm, knots of scalding and fire, knots of jealousy and envy, knots of false speech, knots of frivolity and disdain, knots of greed and desire, knots of reckless bravery, knots of breaking fasts, knots of violating precepts, knots of idle amusement, knots of mental exhaustion, knots of accumulated resentment, knots of shamelessness, knots of lust and desire, knots of deafness, knots of blindness, knots of mental confusion, knots of anger and rage, knots of heavenly nets, knots of earthly snares, knots of water and fire, knots of the bridal chamber, knots of mutual conflict, knots of mutual hindrance.\n\nAll such sentient beings, dwelling within heaven and earth, experience the flourishing and withering of form. The burning house seethes unceasingly; floating life is ever restless. With all these vexing knots obstructing and tormenting the fleshly body, knot upon knot intertwines without end.\n\nPǔjì inquired: What is meant by the mind-king and the will-steed?\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: The mind is like a sovereign king; the will is like a monkey or a horse—difficult to tame, difficult to subdue, ever-shifting and unceasing. Even if the monkey and horse are stilled, the mind-king does not rest. If one skillfully subdues the sovereign king, the will-steed cannot shift and turn. Once shifting and turning cease, karmic knots no longer arise.\n\nPǔjì inquired: By what virtuous power may sentient beings be taught to awaken and dissolve these knots?\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: If sentient beings seek awakening and dissolution, let them, in a place of purity, adorn and purify their homes. According to their means, whether abundant or modest, let them light incense and lamps before my image, venerate the transformed names, repent of grievances and knots, listen attentively, contemplate deeply, and advance with courage and diligence. Thus may they awaken and dissolve all knots, avoiding the depths of suffering.\n\nBy the power of this repentance, let there descend the hundredfold-refined vajra, the thousandfold-blended jade elixir, the flowing light of Venus, the dispersed radiance of primal yellow. Let these wash away lewdness and perversity, dissolve grievances and knots, dispel vexation and torment, pacify body and mind. Let goodness and evil naturally align, and malevolence be ground away. May the Four Brahma Perfected Ones and the transformative lords of the ten directions enable all sentient beings to awaken. Let evil karma not arise, and let goodness deepen, that they may attain rebirth—how could they not be delivered?\n\nFurthermore, if sentient beings skillfully dissolve even a single knot, a hundred knots will loosen. They will ascend in pure qi and descend with heavenly talismans. The fierce generals Axiū, Iron-Forehead, and Copper-Headed Dharma-Protecting Divine Kings, with jade hooks and golden locks, will instantly still the thousand knots and myriad resentments, quieting the mind-monkey. Like an orange or a pearl, the will’s knots will forever cease. The mind will be without mind, and knots without knots. Enmity and hatred will be resolved, nets and snares dissolved.\n\nMay all sentient beings forever awaken to the true Dao and attain liberation.\n\nToday, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds to listen attentively, as the scriptures declare: Sentient beings in the world are forever bound by the cage of affliction, with no means of escape—where can they flee? By venerating this repentance ritual, they may suddenly awaken from their entanglements. Now, let them contemplate deeply and advance in reverent devotion.\n\nMay the power of virtue extend to all sentient beings, that all the knots they bear may, by the power of repentance, awaken to non-action and ascend to the true Dao.\n\nThe repentant sponsor, so-and-so, further reflects: Dwelling in the floating world, one daily accumulates evil qi. The body bears the three karmic actions; the mouth commits the four transgressions. Karmic roots intertwine, and knots gather, difficult to cast off. Today, let the body be refined and purified, the dust of defilement washed away.\n\nToday, prostrating for peace and offering prayers through this repentance text, with the five limbs touching the earth and the mind single-mindedly devoted, the repentant sponsor bows to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerates the true sages.\n\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering upon hearing the cry.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity and Luminous Sovereignty.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who establishes merit universally.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who widely propagates the Dao’s allure.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy adorned with meritorious virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who compassionately expounds the Dharma.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Most High’s teachings.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of unfathomable sagely virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy with wondrous golden countenance.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who engenders the four qi.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who verifies fruition and fulfills vows.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who opens the Dao to rebirth.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Hall of Ten Thousand Blessings.\n\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty and Wondrous Dao.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Wise and Virtuous Conduct.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Responsive Manifestation.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Numinosity.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Ocean.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Wonders.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Meritorious Virtue and Luminous Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Delivers from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Realm.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Vows.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Meritorious Virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Perfected of the Golden Wheel.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Perfected Who Subdues Demons.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Delivers from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, together with the great assembly, prostrate in utmost sincerity, gazing upward in hope that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Transformative Titles, all the Great Manifestations, all the Great Divine Immortals, all the Great Assemblies of Sages, all the Great Divine Youths, and all the Worthies and Sages throughout the ten directions and the boundless reaches of the Mysterious Void—all the Perfected and Sages—may, through the might of the Vajra Guardians and the waters of Supreme Harmony, cleanse the accumulated defilements within the body of the repentance master, named so-and-so, purifying the field of the heart-mind. May obstructions dissolve, the flow of nourishing and protective qi circulate, and all share a purified heart-mind, continuously cultivating goodness without generating defiled thoughts or stirring afflictive toil.\n\nToday, this Daoist ritual is conducted with purity as its purpose. May the ancestral spirits, the consciousness of departed kin, parents, and family members swiftly escape karmic entanglements, never to sink into suffering. May the living and the deceased of two generations together ascend to the fruition of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Four: Arousing the Heart of Praise**\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart-mind upward, gazing toward the Compassionate Venerable One, exhorting all beings to arise in praise.\n\nThe repentance master, named so-and-so, gathers their heart-mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: No one receives birth without arising from past karma. Thus, each is endowed with a divine and outstanding nature, each with its own karmic conditions. Transgressions and blessings, fortune and misfortune—all proceed from karma. Therefore, short or long lifespans, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to prior determination. If one knows they have committed the three karmic actions or the ten evils, their transgressions are grave and weighty. They should awaken to remorse, seek repentance, and perform rites of contrition. Let boundless thoughts arise from an immeasurable heart-mind. Whenever encountering good conditions, one must offer praise. The merit of praise is inconceivable.\n\nIf one sees the emperor, sovereign, empress, imperial consorts, princes, princesses, ministers, and high officials arouse a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing that blessings protect the realm and the imperial enterprise endure forever.\n\nIf one sees the construction of palaces or the establishment of vast Daoist altars, one must offer praise, wishing for swift completion and the attainment of refuge.\n\nIf one sees the imperial grace bestowing ordination upon male and female officials and Daoists, one must offer praise, wishing for liberation from suffering and purity across three lifetimes.\n\nIf one sees the adornment and casting of sacred images, the true responsive and transformative bodies, one must offer praise, arousing a heart of reverence and making offerings without cease.\n\nIf one sees the transcription of the Three Caverns’ Great Canon of sacred scriptures, one must offer praise, wishing for eternal circulation and the transformation and deliverance of all.\n\nIf one sees halls, pavilions, towers, and terraces adorned with splendor and elegance, one must offer praise, wishing that all may attain refuge and constantly behold and revere them.\n\nIf one sees bells, chimes, and Daoist implements of bronze and iron, one must offer praise, wishing to awaken the deluded masses and make their voices heard in the darkest nights.\n\nIf one sees the expounding of various scriptures and the elucidation of wondrous meanings, one must offer praise, wishing to ride the merit to liberate those imprisoned in suffering.\n\nIf one sees the recitation of scriptures and repentance texts, their upholding, and the making of offerings, one must offer praise, wishing to attain the conditions for the Dao and remain steadfast without retreat.\n\nIf one sees the performance of ritual circumambulation, hymns of praise, prayers for blessings, and petitions for fortune, one must offer praise, wishing that the power of blessings universally pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust.\n\nIf one sees men and women burning incense, lighting lamps, and diligently prostrating in reverence, one must offer praise, wishing their prayers be fulfilled.\n\nIf one sees the burning of incense, one must offer praise, universally wishing that the fragrant smoke be offered to all Perfected and Sages.\n\nIf one sees the illumination of lamps dispelling darkness, one must offer praise, wishing that karmic debts be forever dissolved and all attain equality with the sun and moon.\n\nIf one sees the observance of fasts, the upholding of precepts, and the making of offerings to the Perfected and Sages, one must offer praise, wishing that all sentient beings in the world, all creatures with consciousness, forever enter the Dharma gate and never sink into the realms of suffering.\n\nIf one sees the making of offerings to humans and gods, one must offer praise, wishing for towering blessings and longevity, and inexhaustible wealth and fortune.\n\nIf one sees diligent devotion, thought after thought of utmost sincerity, one must offer praise, wishing for no retreat and constant joy.\n\nIf one sees courageous reverence and the arousal of a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing to avoid encountering demonic obstacles and swiftly attain the true Dao.\n\nIf one sees those who dwell at home constantly reciting scriptures and repentance texts, one must offer praise, wishing that all heavenly Perfected may hear and behold them.\n\nIf one sees those who dwell in mountains to cultivate the Dao, residing in hermitages and cliffs, guarding their resolve in tranquility, seeking neither fame nor profit, one must offer praise, wishing that those who first attain the Dao may sequentially open the path to deliverance for others.\n\nIf one sees men and women of upright bearing, one must offer praise, universally wishing that they leave the household life and perpetuate the true teaching.\n\nIf one sees all good conditions in the world, one must offer praise, wishing that humans and gods attain fruition and all receive benefit.\n\nThrough such manifold praises of good deeds, exhort and inspire all beings to accomplish the heart-mind of the Dao and enter diligent practice. Thus may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, one’s own parents, uncles, brothers, oneself, one’s descendants, and all family members—from beginningless kalpas to the present kalpa, in this life and this birth, through the accumulated actions of today—all the heavy transgressions of the three karmic actions, the six sense faculties, the five rebellious acts, and the ten evils be completely dissolved.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao ritual, as proclaimed in the scriptures, must recognize that the power of praising goodness is inconceivable. We must diligently advance, widely offering praise, wishing that this merit universally extend to all sentient beings. The repentance master, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial rites, bowing with five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly invoking and reverently saluting the Merciful Honored One and the true sages.\n\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Relieves Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Jade Void Radiant August Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Mystery Capital.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Immeasurable Life.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Eternal Stillness and Silence.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Unobstructed Eloquence.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Inconceivable.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Transformation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of True Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Initiates Salvation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Appearances.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Expounds True Emptiness.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Dharma and Sacred Wisdom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Concealment and Non-Action.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unfathomable Dark Source.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Joy and Universal Salvation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Transformation and Mysterious Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Illumination and Non-Action.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Penetration and Myriad Changes.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves According to Merit.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams Who Protects the Body.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Relieves Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Nation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Joyous Transcendence.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected of Equal Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected of Cyclic Transformation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Relieves Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentance master of this Dao ritual and the great assembly take refuge and aspire toward the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the venerable ones and sages, all the gods and immortals of the heavens, all the great dragon spirits and local earth deities, all the great perfected ones, all the great true adepts, and all the divine youths—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest as all true sages. May they, by the power of the great Dao, the power of non-action, the power of merit, and the power of the inconceivable, enable the repentance master, so-and-so, from beginningless kalpas to the present kalpa, in this life and this day, along with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, oneself, and all family members—both the living and the deceased—who may have encountered various good conditions but failed to offer praise, to have all their transgressions dissolved through this act of repentance.\n\nFrom this day forward, may we ourselves, upon hearing or seeing any good conditions, rejoice and leap with joy, redoubling our praise, encouraging diligent cultivation, and aspiring to accomplish the universal salvation of all beings. May our nine generations of ancestral spirits, our parents of this life, our teachers and Dharma companions, our fellow practitioners and kin, our uncles, brothers, and all family members—those who have passed away—be freed from karmic obstructions and forever severed from afflictions. May the power of this repentance extend universally, adorning and pacifying the realm, bringing peace to the borders, and even enabling those in hells, hungry ghost realms, and animal existences to equally rely on this profound grace and attain the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nThe Ninth Scroll of the *Tai Shang Merciful Dao Ritual for Eliminating Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms* concludes.\n\nThe Tenth Scroll of the *Tai Shang Merciful Dao Ritual for Eliminating Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms*\n\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate\n\n**Chapter One: Manifesting Merit and Receiving Blessings**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao ritual, each directing their mind, respectfully addresses the Merciful Honored One, declaring their merits to receive blessings. The repentance master, so-and-so, joins palms, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural teachings.\n\nThe Universal Salvation inquires: The various Dharma gates of merit manifested by the Merciful Honored One exhort and instruct sentient beings to cultivate practice. Yet beings are weak and feeble, unable to fully accomplish these; we wonder what levels of merit may be attained through cultivation.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One says: Merit is boundless, but broadly speaking, there are nine types, each yielding blessings according to one’s capacity. All beings should listen carefully:\n\n1. Creating images\n2. Copying scriptures\n3. Establishing temples\n4. Liberating beings\n5. Conducting Dao rituals\n6. Reciting scriptures and performing repentance rites\n7. Upholding precepts\n8. Universally offering vegetarian feasts and provisions\n9. Practicing generosity\n\nWhether constructing halls, pavilions, towers, galleries, permanent estates, banners, flowers, lamps, candles, bells, chimes, cymbals, or other ritual implements—all such endeavors accumulate boundless merit, bringing immeasurable blessings in the past, present, and future, beyond conception.\n\nThose who create images or copy scriptures will, in this life, attain noble status and, in past lives, be reborn in the families of heavenly kings. Those who establish temples and liberate beings will, in this life, attain great wealth and, in past lives, be reborn in the families of kings. Those who perform rituals and recite invocations will, in this life, be protected by benevolent spirits and, in past lives, be reborn with keen intelligence. Those who uphold vegetarian precepts, revere the teachings, and burn incense will, in this life, enjoy enduring peace and, in past lives, be reborn in wealthy and noble families. Those who observe precepts and repent will, in this life, be revered and protected by the gods and, in past lives, be reborn among humans with perfect form and appearance. Those who offer scriptures and images will, in this life, receive good karmic retribution and, in past lives, be reborn with handsome features. Those who offer vegetarian feasts and provisions will, in this life, have abundant clothing and food and, in past lives, be reborn with dignified bearing. Those who give alms to the poor will, in this life, attain radiant perfection and, in past lives, be reborn with auspicious marks.\n\nThose who refrain from consuming living beings will, in this life, enjoy freedom from illness and suffering and, in past lives, attain a long-lived body. Those who abstain from wine and meat will, in this life, have spirits that abide in their bodies and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of sages and worthies. Those who are free from craving and content with little will, in this life, have bodies free from foul odors and, in past lives, be reborn with pure bodies. Those who release life and ransom creatures will, in this life, be spared from premature death and, in past lives, be reborn with reverent bodies. Those who expound the teachings and transform others will, in this life, attain the dual cultivation of blessings and wisdom and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of renunciates.\n\nMoreover, the retribution of meritorious deeds is like an echo responding to sound, like a shadow following form—no difference in magnitude, purity and turbidity naturally distinct. Yet you, in your ignorance and delusion, fail to recognize causes and conditions, disbelieve in the consequences of sin and merit, and do not understand that this body arises from the seeds of past blessings. You do not know that this body is but a fleeting apparition, that it is utterly illusory, that it is momentary and impermanent. Instead, you indulge in stinginess and greed, killing living beings, stealing, engaging in illicit sex and dissipation, consuming living creatures, uttering deceitful and frivolous speech, slandering the scriptures and teachings, amassing wealth—all the while believing this life has no limit.\n\nConsider all beings: with eyes open, they commit countless sins; with eyes closed, they enter the prison of suffering. A lifetime of transgressions—when have they ever awakened? They cannot arouse a single thought of goodness to disperse the karmic deeds that bind them to past and future rebirths. Though they seek to liberate themselves, they plant the seeds of affliction, yet fret over their descendants, lamenting their lack of sustenance. I grieve for worldly people, who weep at the moment of death, yet from youth are consumed by worry for their sons and daughters, never recalling the kindness of their parents’ nurture. From time without beginning, they have imitated one another, never awakening, ever sinking deeper into ignorance.\n\nI reflect further on all of you, who follow one another in folly, never self-aware. Thus I reveal the karmic causes and conditions of past lives, that you may emerge from the river of suffering and desire. I also lament that sentient beings drift and drown, never escaping the sea of suffering. This world is called the \"Realm of Abandoned Worthies and Profit-Seeking,\" also known as the \"Realm of Mixed Retribution.\" The heavens of desire and attachment arise within it, fleeting as lightning—appearing for a moment, then vanishing; briefly gathering, then scattering. Birth, aging, sickness, death; pain, itching, soreness, aching; hunger, cold, dryness, dampness; water, fire, blades, weapons; demonic spirits, thieves, poisonous winds, malignant diseases—all these afflictions intertwine, moment by moment impermanent, never abiding for even an instant. How much suffering! Yet even as these torments bind you in the present, you remain unaware—how then could you believe in the celestial realms, the blessed lands of immortals, the Dao of eternal life, and the freedom of non-action?\n\nI observe that the lives of worldly beings are shorter than those of mayflies; their dwellings more cramped than a hair’s tip; their foulness more vile than excrement; their pleasures no different from those of dung-beetles. Yet they remain oblivious, mistaking this for happiness—is this not suffering? I further reflect that no one is born without prior karma. Thus, when examining the essence of spirit and form, each has its causes and conditions. Sin and merit, fortune and misfortune—all arise from karma. Therefore, longevity or premature death, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to its kind, even among birds, beasts, insects, fish, chickens, dogs, grasses, and trees. How much more so for human birth, which is so rarely encountered! Once this body decays, when will it be regained after ten thousand kalpas?\n\nThus I earnestly admonish and exhort you: diligently cultivate precepts, fast, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, prostrate in worship, burn incense, light lamps, give alms, and repent. Vow to deliver the living and liberate the dead; create images and copy scriptures; establish temples and build bridges; dig wells by the roadside to aid travelers and relieve the thirsty. Through countless expedient means, pave the path for all beings in the future. What do I seek in this? All sentient beings should reflect deeply.\n\nToday, in this grand assembly, as the scriptures teach and the Dharma reveals—whether in full or in part, beyond comprehension—we earnestly establish the foundation of blessings for ourselves and others, creating the path for the future. Now, as I bow in reverence and recite, let each of you be diligent. May these merits benefit all without limit, and may every sentient being receive their nourishment.\n\nThe repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, prays that these merits respond to the heart’s aspirations.

May they together bestow their responsive grace to rescue and protect all beings. May the master of repentance, so-and-so, who undertakes this matter, obtain a response in accordance with their heart, all through the power of this repentance.\n\nMay the afflicted recover from illness, may calamities be averted, may those who have passed afar be reborn, may those who have recently departed attain liberation, may the living receive benefit, and may all their prayers be fulfilled. Furthermore, may the four kinds of birth and the six paths of existence all receive this grace; may the spirits of plants and trees, and the lingering souls of the forsaken, seize this auspicious opportunity to ascend together to the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repaying Kindness and Offering Merit**\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart and mind, reverently beseeching the Merciful Venerable One to universally bestow boundless merit and virtue upon all people. Now, the causes and effects of repaying kindness are expounded.\n\nThe master of repentance, so-and-so, humbly reflects and listens attentively to the scriptural words: When a person is born, Heaven and Earth serve as their model; they bear the yin and embrace the yang, receiving shelter within the womb, their life suspended by Heaven. The Heavenly Emperor then summons the Youth Who Records Lifespans to traverse the human realm, examining and measuring sins and blessings, the fortune or misfortune of men and women, the brevity or length of their lives. Every three days, a report is made; every seven days, a memorial is submitted; every hundred days, a record is finalized—unceasing even for a moment.\n\nIf one cultivates goodness and establishes merit, the Divine Youths of the Heavens, the Lords of Life and the Recorders of Deeds, will extend their years and eliminate calamities. If one commits sins and accumulates evil, the Heavenly Kings and the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens will seize their hun and po souls, bringing them before the Three Officials to have their consciousnesses collected. If one’s allotted lifespan is not fulfilled, it is due to the sins they have committed; if one completes their allotted lifespan, it is due to the goodness they have accumulated.\n\nWhen a person seeks to extend their lifespan, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Earthly Offices. The various Heavens and Emperors examine and verify according to the registers, determining life and death. They then dispatch the officials of the Three Realms and the Youth Who Observes Life to gather the spirit and soul, cutting off the breath of life. If a person is afflicted by prolonged illness, bedridden and gravely stricken, their life nearing its end, and if their family and kin, according to their means, establish a Daoist ritual, recite scriptures, and perform repentance—regardless of the number of scrolls—the family and kin may reverently face the various Heavens and Sages, confessing the karmic offenses of the sick person’s embodied existence, thereby releasing their spirit and soul, extending their lifespan, and restoring them to health.\n\nIf the great limit of life is imminent, one may still be rescued through the performance of extensive merit and virtue, dedicating it to the departed soul to spare them from suffering and distress. The living will face no hardship or terror. From the first seventh-day period after death to the three annual commemorations, during the days of ancestral remembrance, offerings of incense and lamps should be made tirelessly, day and night.\n\nWhy is this so? There are also the Youths Who Observe Life who monitor and report sins and blessings. If one enters the gate of life, blessings flow to their descendants, they do not linger in hell, and they suffer no karmic retribution. It is like a person initially entangled in a legal dispute, where the case remains unresolved—this is analogous to the situation of the newly deceased.\n\nThus, two spirits, one of good and one of evil, descend every ten days to inspect the household. For those who perform merit, the good spirit will advocate for them, enabling rebirth in Heaven. For those who do not perform merit, the evil spirit will record their deeds, leading them into confinement, causing their family to experience much fear and misfortune. If there is suffering, one may go to a Daoist abbey or remain at home, facing the image of the Venerable One, bowing to the manifest and hidden transformations, performing purification rituals and practicing the Dao, redeeming karmic offenses to attain liberation. Their names will be inscribed in the registers of immortals, and their bodies will dwell in carefree joy.\n\nSuch are the various causes and effects of repaying kindness and offering merit, which are foremost and truly worthy of praise. If there are good men and good women who, for the sake of their parents and all their kin, paint or sculpt images, construct halls, and vow with sincere faith to widely encourage and exhort others—such actions are inconceivable. All people, within the various dharmas, who arouse a single good thought or make a single vow, harboring a heart of gratitude and repayment, are called good fruits, and are inconceivable.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, as spoken in the scriptures, reverently beseech the Merciful Venerable One to expound this Dharma gate of merit and virtue for all sentient beings, serving as a path through life and death—this is inconceivable. The master of repentance, so-and-so, for the sake of their nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of forebears, parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all their kin—whether in hell, as hungry ghosts, as animals, or among all beings with consciousness—who have not yet received offerings or performed repayment, now wholeheartedly bows in reverence to the true and sacred beings invoked by name. May this merit and virtue pervade both the living and the deceased, enabling all to attain liberation.\n\nToday, humbly for the sake of peace and the offering of merit through this repentance text, prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, the heart directs its thoughts. Bowing to the Merciful Venerable One, I reverently bow to the true and sacred beings.\n\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Mysterious Spirit.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades and Observes the Dharma Realm.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Light and Profound Stillness.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Nine-Colored Majestic Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Expedient Means for Liberation.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Receives Blessings in Every Direction.\n\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Guards the Soul Without Hindrance.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Turns the Dharma in Accordance with the Heart.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Emptiness.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Perfected.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transports and Delivers.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Spirit.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Rank.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Subtlety.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Mystery.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Sovereign.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Response and Primordial Harmony.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Virtue Who Rescues from Tribulation.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Vastly Saves in the Cinnabar Landscape.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Supreme Unity Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Perfected of Dharma Liberation.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Perfected of Jeweled Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, along with the great assembly, take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, all the Venerable Ones and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, all the Great Divine Youths, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms. May they, by the power of great compassion, the power of great mercy, the power of the Dao, and the power of the Dharma, universally illuminate the worlds below, the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu. May the master of repentance, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of descendants, teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all their kin—whether dwelling in the Three Evil Paths, yet to attain liberation, whether departed long ago or recently passed—all ascend today through sincere repentance. Regardless of the weight of their transgressions, may they together attain liberation and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Circulation of Teachings**\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, each with focused mind, take refuge and repent, gazing reverently upon the Compassionate Venerable One, to expound the teachings of salvation and the circulation of all dharmas.\n\nThe master of repentance, [Name], collects their thoughts and listens attentively as the scriptures are revealed: The Primordial Beginning, with one qi, transformed into three qi, dividing into the Three Heavens. The realms of the Three Clarities emerged from the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures. Thus, the Three Vehicles conjoined the soaring mystery of qi, naturally forming chapters—jade characters and golden writings, dragon scripts and phoenix seals—each a great square of one zhang, with eight corners radiating light. They taught the heavens and circulated through the worlds, turning the Dharma Wheel for five kalpas from beginning to end.\n\nThough heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all beings, guiding humans and gods across the Three Realms and ten directions, all receiving benefit.\n\nIt is asked: When did the Three Caverns descend to the world? Did they come simultaneously, or in succession?\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable One replied: At the beginning of each kalpa, the Cavern of Perfection descends to transform the world. People embraced virtue and power, dwelling in emptiness and non-being. All upheld the true and correct, attaining long life without death. Next, the Cavern of Mystery descended. The great simplicity had already declined, the pure wind had scattered, and people gradually became frivolous, losing the Dao and rebelling against virtue. Then, the Cavern of Spirit descended. People grew even more frivolous, failing to uphold the great teachings, turning from truth toward falsehood, their lifespans shortening. When the Three Caverns ceased to function, worldly wisdom flourished daily. Humans and ghosts intermingled, the kalpa’s end drew near, lifespans fell below a hundred years, impermanence prevailed in every thought, and ruin never ceased.\n\nI have descended again to proclaim the Three Caverns, spreading transformation among humanity, adapting to the capacities of each era, and propagating the scriptural teachings. Moreover, the Sacred Ancestors have manifested in the human realm to save and deliver sentient beings, expounding precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or Xia, whether sages or commoners, they pervaded the ten directions, universally enabling liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns, scattered throughout the world, exhorts sentient beings to diligently cultivate and practice.\n\nThose who accumulate transgressions and karmic burdens, sinking into evil paths, unable to believe and uphold the teachings, follow only falsehoods and various deceptive spirits. They exhaust body and mind, only to descend into hell. Those who believe in and uphold the great Dharma of the Three Caverns shall all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others escape through corpse liberation, their forms vanishing into hidden realms. Though their names and traces remain, they secretly traverse the unseen worlds, unknown to others.\n\nFurthermore, it is said: After I withdraw, demonic teachings will flourish. People will die young, wars, floods, and fires will follow one after another, diseases will linger, and suffering will persist day and night. Wealth and treasures will be exhausted in service to deceitful spirits, falsehoods will multiply daily, and the frivolous and deceitful will spread with the times. Hunger, cold, and misery will drive fathers and sons to wander, never awakening.\n\nAgain, I reflect upon you all, sunk in the depths of kalpas: I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind.\n\nMoreover, the scriptures teach sentient beings to recognize the root and origin, the causes of past lives, the retribution of sin and blessing, the auspicious and inauspicious, the gates of life and death, and the means of expedient practice. They urge turning from evil to embrace goodness, preserving life and nature, attaining long life and non-action, and taking refuge in the Great Dao. Those who preserve them shall receive blessings; those who cultivate them shall be divinely protected.\n\nThus, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, divine beings, and immortals of the heavens always desire that people diligently burn incense and repent, so that benevolent spirits will protect them and the multitude of sages will bestow their thoughts. If one bears transgressions, bound internally and externally, malevolent spirits will wreak havoc, diseases will afflict, and disasters—water, fire, blades, poisonous creatures, fierce beasts, shackles, and prisons—will bring inescapable suffering.\n\nIf one only adorns the exterior—face, clothing, hands, and feet—yet fails to inwardly cleanse the body, mind, roots of transgression, and evil karma, are they not foolish and deluded? Just as the face, hands, feet, and clothing, when diligently washed and scrubbed, must become pure.\n\nThe Supreme Pole Perfected One spoke: When the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Accumulation World of the Heaven of Blessed Virtue, expounding the Dao amidst the assembly of celestial immortals, he thought of the Universally Beneficent Perfected One, who arose with fearless power and extended his mind of vast compassion. For the sake of all sentient beings, he inquired about karmic conditions and proclaimed the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones.\n\nAt that moment, the earth turned to the hue of refined gold, and the heavens rained down precious flowers, fragrant incense, and wondrous treasures, all drifting through the void to fill the space before the Dao, beyond count. \"All you sentient beings, you ought to believe and uphold this, exert yourselves with sincere devotion, propagate my teachings, and not allow external demons to disrupt and disturb the realm.\"\n\nWhen the Universally Beneficent Perfected One and the assembly of celestial beings heard these words, they wept in longing and admiration, choked with sorrow, as if they had lost their parents. They vowed that the Merciful Honored One would constantly admonish and instruct them, so that they might awaken and realize the supreme Dao.\n\nThereupon, the Universally Beneficent addressed the assembly of celestial immortals and sages: \"In the cities, towns, villages, and tranquil mountain forests of the lands in the ten directions, if there are diligent scholar-immortals, or pure and faithful officials and clansmen who protect and uphold the scriptures and repentances, reverently invoking the responsive titles of the transformation bodies—if they delight in paper and ink, copying and binding the scrolls with silk cords, adorning them with the seven treasures, and exhorting the people of the realm to bow in worship and make offerings as if facing the true form, unwavering day and night, circulating and proclaiming them so that those who have not heard may hear and those who have not seen may see—those who cultivate in accordance with the Dao shall be protected by the assemblies of celestial immortals, jade maidens, and the ten divisions of mighty spirits. Such persons shall forever attain peace and happiness, fulfill their aspirations, and this majestic power is inconceivable, like the boundless void, impossible to exhaust.\"\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones are inconceivable. May all sentient beings—those who have already suffered or have yet to suffer—all attain liberation. The repentance master [Name] today prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, wholeheartedly invoking: \"We bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One, reverently paying homage to the true sages.\"\n\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering at the sound of cries.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Divine Grotto.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who harmonizes spirits and benefits beings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who embodies the myriad virtues.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless illumination.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of perfect fulfillment in the myriad practices.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of primordial yang’s transformative measure.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who expounds the Dao and pervades transformation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the six penetrations who relieves suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of true intention.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who roams and abides.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lotus Flower.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of silent contemplation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the lofty perfected.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of unimpeded freedom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal moisture and non-action.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who universally ferries across like a boat and oar.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of supreme virtue and luminous countenance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who bestows longevity and preserves life.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s wishes.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who protects the realm.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless expanse.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the ocean of merit and virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Universally Beneficent Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Universally Saving Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Greatly Compassionate Perfected One who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Greatly Merciful Perfected One who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentance master of this ritual assembly and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the lower realm, the various Honored Ones and sages, the lofty immortals of the Golden Towers, the sagely emperors of the Jade Capital, the dragon spirits and earth gods, the true officials of villages and domains, the celestial immortals and lords of the grotto-heavens, the assemblies of immortals throughout the ten directions, the entire expanse of the mysterious void, and all the manifested true sages—by their inconceivable power and boundless merit and virtue—may enable the repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, to uplift the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages, the recently departed and the long-deceased, parents and the six relations, and all kin. Through this repentance, may they transcend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss, not linger in the three evil destinies, nor tread the five sufferings. May all living kin, close and distant relatives, and all branches of the family tree attain lasting peace and be forever free from suffering.\n\nMoreover, may those who seek to avert misfortune, those who seek to repay karmic debts, those burdened by karma, and those afflicted by illness—all, by the power of this repentance, forever rely on the great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nChapter Four: Manifest Verification and True Realization\n\nToday, in this ritual assembly, each person directs their mind, bows in homage, and takes refuge, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, manifesting the repentance dharma and verifying the karmic conditions. The repentance master [Name], gathering their mind and kneeling reverently, listens attentively to the scriptural words: \"The Dao gives rise to the one qi, which divides and transforms into the three powers. Responding to the world, it establishes names and manifests titles according to conditions, pervading the dharma-realm, as numerous as the grains of dust. Furthermore, there are accomplished scholar-immortals who have ascended to the highest ranks among the heavens, also beyond count.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, serving as rulers, kings, queens, consorts, dukes, and the people of the realm, as well as the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, teachers, parents, themselves, and all kin—even those in the three evil destinies, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, and the nine dark realms—who day and night practice the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, light lamps, and bow in worship to the titles of the Heavenly Worthies, then the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions and their countless assemblies will together come to witness and record their merits among the heavens. Their own blessings and longevity shall be boundless, disasters will vanish, transgressions will be extinguished, the realm will be at peace, the people will be at ease, the three evil destinies will cease their opposition, the five sufferings will halt their bitterness, and all stagnant sentient beings will attain liberation.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate addressed the Master of Mystic Words, saying: \"Always with this scripture and the transformative titles of the Heavenly Worthy, circulate and widely disseminate them, that they may pervade the ten directions. Let all men and women copy, enshrine, and reverently recite them, and they shall invoke the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, the Vajra Warriors, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits to guard their lands and protect their people. If one establishes images wherever one dwells, the merit shall be immeasurable.\n\nIf there be male or female officials of the Dharma-body who, on the ten straight days of the first and last of the month, the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, the days of their own life-destiny and the Geng-Shen, and the assemblies of the twelfth month, wish for the peace of the realm, quiet their minds, and silently recite the titles of the Heavenly Worthy, then they shall be met by immortals descending to receive them, and cloud-cranes coming to welcome them.\n\nIf one extols and praises, exhorting all men and women to receive, uphold, and recite these sacred images, the merit is truly inconceivable.\n\nIf there be sentient beings who, upon seeing the compassionate titles of the Heavenly Worthy, harbor disbelief, slight the Dharma-treasure, and doubt or slander the sacred texts, know that such persons have, from kalpas without measure, sunk into the lower ghosts, enduring manifold sufferings and passing through strange forms, only now to be reborn into the human realm. Foolish and blind, they comprehend nothing, habituated to evil causes, unable to believe or revere.\n\nIf there be sentient beings who, upon hearing this repentance ritual—be it a single sentence, a single verse, a single title, a single bow—generate a mind of faith, know that such persons in former lives once entered the jeweled city, heard the wondrous Dharma, and entered the jeweled treasury, where they personally read and recited. Now reborn, their faith and devotion only deepen.\n\nIf one initially holds this repentance ritual in reverence but later regrets, ceasing to bow or recite, and allows the mind to grow indolent, know that such a person, though possessing a human body, has not yet severed their strange forms. After this life’s transgressions, they shall again fall into evil destinies, suffering for ten thousand kalpas without hope of liberation.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate completed the transmission of the scripture, and the Master of Mystic Words bowed his head in reverence and thanks. Then, moved by the true words, he received the seven transformative titles of the Heavenly Worthy, to be imparted to sentient beings for the salvation of the living and the deliverance of the dead. Thus, all beings shall be shown how to recite them without neglecting the sacred teachings.\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, the repentance-master [Name], prostrating for [specific matter], bows in worship to this repentance text. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he raises his thought, bows his head to the Compassionate Worthy, and reverently salutes the true sages:\n\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Titles.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades All Actions.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wisdom.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Non-Action.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Fills Empty Space.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Purity.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Conditions.\n\nToday, the repentance-master of this ritual arena and the great assembly, looking up, vow that the Seven Transformative Titles of the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure from the ten directions shall together lend their virtuous power to shelter and protect all beings. May the repentance-master [Name] fulfill his heart’s wishes, and may all karmic retributions and opposing forces be dissolved. May all living kin be free from obstacles and calamities, their misfortunes severed. Further, may they gain keen intelligence and profound virtue, their merits complete and their conduct perfected, their official and scholarly aspirations fulfilled, their achievements towering, their honors ever-renewed. May inner and outer realms alike know well-being, with superiors and inferiors in proper order. May weapons be stilled, winds and rains timely, and longevity prolonged. May their names be inscribed on jade tablets, one act of merit repaid ten thousandfold, eternally without end. Life after life, may they forever escape sinking and drowning. May their descendants continue for a hundred million years.\"\n\nMay all sentient beings together ascend the Dao’s shore.\n\n**First Bow**\nThe Immortal Lord Ge Xuan proclaimed: The Most High Lord Lao said, \"All the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions are born of the Primordial Beginning in response to qi, abiding and pacifying the lands, teaching and guiding sentient beings. According to karmic conditions and perceptions, they scatter their reflections and divide their bodies, transforming endlessly. With the turning of kalpas, they appear and vanish without constancy, opening the path to salvation for all, their blessings extending across the ten thousand heavens.\n\nIf Daoist priests, female officials, and all men and women can arouse a heart of goodness—for the sake of the ruler, parents, wives and children, themselves and their kin, the\n\nMay all be freed from suffering and universally attain liberation.\nMay all awaken to non-action and together ascend the Dao’s fruit.\n\n**First Bow**\nHere ends the Tenth Scroll of *The Most High’s Compassionate Dao-Field: The Nine Dark Realms Repentance Rite for Dispelling Disasters*.",

After the rise of the Flame Emperor’s Han, sacred texts gradually spread among humankind. In the western lands of Shu, the golden palaces bequeathed their teachings; in the eastern realm of Wu, the Great Ultimate transmitted its doctrine. Thus, secret scrolls of the Great Existence and jade chapters of the Cavern Realms emerged—Zhang and Xu revealed them in earlier times, while Tao and Lu disseminated them later. Master and disciple followed in succession, and generations produced such figures.\n\n*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms* originated with the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan, during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Later Han. Dwelling in reclusion on Mount Yushan of Tiantai, he cultivated the Dao in seclusion. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, descended into the Immortal’s chamber and bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Celestial Writ*, the *Jade Script of Cavern Reality*, the *Cavern Mystery*, the *Cavern Spirit*, and the thirty-six divisions of precious scriptures. The Immortal, abiding in the mountains, refined his thoughts and stilled his mind. Over decades, he communed with spirits and moved the sacred. Mountain spirits and tree ghosts guarded and bowed in reverence.",

      "translated_text": "The wandering souls and lost spirits all attain transcendence and rebirth. This was deemed the profound essence of the Great Vehicle, capable of enlightening sentient beings and rescuing those drowning in suffering. Thus, from within the Three Caverns, the Immortal distilled their essential teachings, compiling repentance texts to ensure that all beings of the present age might hear and witness them. For future generations of scholars, these would be easily understood and practiced, extending even to the boundless.\n\nIn the icy nights of Fengdu’s Avīci Hell, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties and Nine Dark Realms—where tormented souls languish in confinement—none would remain trapped. Whether living, past, or yet to come, all who have committed fresh transgressions or carried ancestral sins, whose karmic entanglements and calamities have bound them, would receive the moistening grace of the Dharma, assembling in the realm of true perfection. Thus, this teaching spread.\n\nThereafter, those drawn to evil causes numbered barely two or three in a hundred, while those awakening to virtuous conditions reached eight or nine in ten. Hence, the ranks of immortals were fully established, and the work of transformation and guidance was complete. This text is therefore set at the beginning of the scroll.\n\n---\n\n*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, Scroll One\nCompiled by the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan\n\nThe Primordial and the Jade Emperor, supreme sages, respond to beings by manifesting forms and establishing teachings according to circumstance. Without the treasure of scriptures, the dust of delusion cannot be dispelled. From their mouths flow jade texts, expounding these sacred mysteries, returning to purity and simplicity—this depends on the heart. For those who seek learning, the method is here revealed.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states: In the Dragon Han kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Reality* scriptures:\n1. *Supreme*\n2. *Wondrous Grove*\n3. *Great Clarity*\n4. *Penetrating Vision*\n5. *Highest Clarity*\n6. *Transformation and Enlightenment*\n7. *Primordial Yang*\n8. *Wondrous Perfection*\n9. *Opening the Mountain*\n10. *Ten Immortals*\n11. *Jade Grove*\n12. *Yellow and Lao*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Jade Clarity Realm.\n\nIn the Crimson Brightness kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Mystery* scriptures were expounded:\n1. *Spiritual Harmony*\n2. *Numinous Treasure*\n3. *Communion with Spirits*\n4. *Immeasurable*\n5. *Assembly of Immortals*\n6. *Inner Secrets*\n7. *Utmost Perfection*\n8. *Gathering Virtue*\n9. *Refining Essence*\n10. *Life and Death*\n11. *Palace Diagrams*\n12. *Dispelling Demons*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Highest Clarity Realm.\n\nIn the Kaihuang kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Spirit* scriptures were expounded:\n1. *Great Perfection*\n2. *Utmost Virtue*\n3. *Yellow Court*\n4. *Refining Qi*\n5. *Dao and Virtue*\n6. *Primordial Spirit*\n7. *Great Kalpa*\n8. *Inner Simplicity*\n9. *Divine Invocations*\n10. *Three Sovereigns*\n11. *Subduing Demons*\n12. *Lesser Kalpa*\n\nThese scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Great Clarity Realm.\n\nThus, the thirty-six divisions of the Three Cavern scriptures are arrayed upon golden tablets, with the Seven Sages setting forth the model, illuminating the royal canon. Once in ten thousand kalpas, the Dharma emerges in accordance with humanity.\n\nThe Three Caverns may be summarized as the One Vehicle. Therefore, the *Orthodox Unity* states: Though the Three Caverns are three, when encompassed together, they form the Dao of the One Vehicle. The *Great Mystery* is the Great Vehicle, the *Great Peace* the Middle Vehicle, and the *Great Clarity* the Small Vehicle. *Orthodox Unity* permeates all three.\n\nIn terms of rank and illumination, the Three Caverns correspond to the Three Clarities. The *Great Mystery* governs the three palaces above, the *Great Peace* the three palaces in the middle, and the *Great Clarity* the three palaces below.\n\nThese Three Cavern scriptures fully elucidate the profound canon, teaching and transforming according to circumstance, delivering humans and devas, and guiding all beings. In the human world, conduct varies in elevation, and the Dharma varies in depth, yet they enable the Six Paths to return to truth and the Three Vehicles to awaken to realization.\n\nNow, contemplating the ages to come, I see those ascending and descending through the Six Paths, the four kinds of birth in the dark and manifest realms, the icy nights of the Nine Dark Realms, the Fengdu and Five Sufferings, the languishing souls and spirits—all enduring karmic retribution, suffering in life, unable to escape the demons of grievance. Therefore, from the Three Cavern scriptures, I have compiled and expounded the *Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, a work of ten scrolls, establishing its principles and completing its chapters.\n\nBy investigating the profound and abstruse meanings, whether living or deceased, those who revere the sages and repent their transgressions will immediately depart the Three Evil Paths, ascend to the Nine Clarity Realms, awaken to non-action, and return to the Great Dao.\n\nThe *Great Mystery Scripture* states: Formerly, the Lord of the Azure Youth declared, \"To practice the Dao is苦, and not to practice the Dao is also 苦.\" Consider how, from birth to old age, from illness to death, the suffering of protecting the body is boundless, and the accumulation of vexations and sins only ceases at death. Many prayers fail to prolong life.\n\nAs for the苦 of practicing the Dao: maintaining purity and preserving truth, guarding the mysterious and contemplating the numinous, seeking teachers and upholding the Dharma, diligently cultivating the heart without laziness, and resolutely applying the will—this too is a 苦 endeavor. Regard the ranks of feudal lords as passing guests; regard gold and silk as mere pebbles...",

      "translated_text": "Regard the esteem for plain silk as coarse cloth. This may be called the ability to inquire into the Dao.\n\nThe Lord of Western Citadel declared: \"After death, to fall into the Three Evil Realms is easy; to obtain a human rebirth is difficult. Having obtained a human rebirth, to depart from the female form and become male is difficult. Having become male, to possess a complete and sound body is difficult. Having attained a complete body, to be born in the Central Kingdom is difficult. Having been born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter sagely rulers and parents is difficult. Having encountered sagely rulers and parents, to be born in an age where one may study the Dao and cultivate a heart of benevolence and kindness is difficult. Having cultivated a heart of benevolence and kindness, to believe in the virtue of the Dao and the attainment of long life is difficult.\"\n\nNow, the Three Evil Realms are hell, the realm of hungry ghosts, and the realm of beasts—difficult to escape and be reborn as a human, instead becoming birds, beasts, insects, or livestock. If one seeks to avoid these, by what virtuous power may it be done?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"If one seeks to avoid the Three Evil Realms, one must first broadly vow before my manifested images of true sages, then eliminate the Three Actions and Six Roots, and afterward take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereafter, dedicate the merit, confess one’s transgressions, and inquire into repentance—thus attaining the divine within the human and joining the Dao of celestial immortals.\"\n\n**Chapter One: Broadly Vowing Aspirations**\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life, we have obtained human form, dwell in the floating world, and have encountered the true teaching. Gazing upon the sacred countenance, we bow our heads in reverence and take refuge, vowing great aspirations:\n\nFirst, we vow that from this day forward, we and all in this assembly shall establish myriad virtuous practices, transforming the six destinies and four births, that all may equally attain liberation and forever depart from the defiled and chaotic realms of the world.\n\nSecond, we vow that life after life, we shall leave the household, forsake worldly attachments and affections, follow conditions to beg alms, broadly cultivate fields of merit, constantly practice compassion and forbearance, and forever transcend the distinctions of self and other.\n\nThird, we vow to constantly encounter noble friends who guide and instruct us.\n\nFourth, we vow to meet enlightened masters and receive the supreme Dao.\n\nFifth, we vow to hear the true Dharma and practice it as taught.\n\nSixth, we vow to behold the Heavenly Worthy and personally receive the sacred decree.\n\nSeventh, we vow to deliver all beings, placing others before ourselves.\n\nEighth, we vow to widely proclaim the Dharma to the ignorant and benighted.\n\nNinth, we vow that all sentient beings shall awaken the intention for the Dao, believe in and venerate the scriptures and images, construct numinous temples, and offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles according to their means.\n\nTenth, we vow that our hearts shall remain steadfast and unwavering. By this virtuous power, may demonic forces be subdued, and the realm attain peace and tranquility. May those who have not heard hear, and those who have not seen see. May those who delight in the Lesser Vehicle not doubt the Middle Vehicle; may those who have entered the Middle Vehicle not doubt the Great Vehicle; and may those who have entered the Great Vehicle wish all sentient beings to hear the wisdom of enlightenment. May those who have not yet awakened awaken; may those who have awakened grow further; and may those who have grown become eyes and ears for others, Dao guides, parents, elder brothers, and friends—gathering in the Dao altar, joining as companions in the Dharma.\n\nWe further vow that all sentient beings, before the scriptures and the venerable, in their own bodies and others’, in all inner and outer Dharma, shall not generate minds of transgression, arrogance, anger, jealousy, or stinginess.\n\nWe further vow that all the merit we cultivate shall not be for ourselves alone but shall universally extend to all. Upon seeing the orphaned, solitary, imprisoned, or ailing, may we arise with minds of rescue, salvation, the Dao, and sincerity.\n\nWe further vow that the hidden and manifest true sages shall together bestow their protection and deliverance. May the repentant patron so-and-so and all of us in this assembly fulfill our broad vows, our hearts aligning with the true sages. May the power of our vows extend to our parents of past, present, and future lives, our six relations, and all living kin—may they all attain peace and happiness. May those who have passed not be reborn in evil realms, and may those yet to come not accumulate grave transgressions. May all equally realize the fruition of the vows we make today.\n\n**One bow**\n\n**Chapter Two: Eliminating the Three Actions and Six Roots**\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life and past lives, we have not heard the true Dharma, often arising perverse thoughts, our discerning natures lost in confusion, failing to seek the ultimate principle.\n\nThe *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* states: \"All that has form is transient and illusory. Thought after thought perishes, never pausing for even a moment. Suffering and affliction revolve endlessly; unawakened and unenlightened, we traverse the Three Ways, enduring myriad kalpas of bitterness. Receiving one body after another, we are bound by the fetters of affliction—all due to the Three Actions.\"\n\nFor there are Six Roots: the eye root, ear root, nose root, tongue root, body root, and mind root. These roots give rise to all actions, hence the Six Roots are like grasses and trees, producing myriad flowers and fruits, endlessly generating one another. Thus arise the Six Passions, Six Desires, Six Defilements, Six Entrances, Six Thieves, Six Dusts, and Six Consciousnesses. Yet form, sound, fragrance, flavor, touch, and dharmas are fundamentally empty and tranquil, neither moving the body nor disturbing the mind. It is sentient beings who cling and grasp, vainly harboring preferences and aversions, thought after thought racing in competition, afflictions binding the body. By these causes and conditions, we drift and wander through birth and death.\n\nIf one can purify wisdom and carefully reflect, awakening to these Six Roots before my image, then all roots shall be exhausted.\n\nThe Three Actions are: bodily action, mental action, and verbal action. We in this assembly, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have indulged the Three Actions and Six Roots for countless kalpas, never once awakening. Today, before the image of the true sages, we arouse the mind of wisdom, generate the intention to awaken, and pledge to eliminate them.\n\nFirst, we repent the sins of bodily action: from birth, we have killed, stolen, and indulged in lust, greedily seeking fine and smooth things. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not commit killing or stealing, nor crave fine and smooth things, nor indulge in lust, seeking liberation from the fetters of desire. May we encounter the scriptures and, before the images, bathe in fragrant waters, purifying body and spirit, contemplating the Dao and reflecting on truth. Striking the Dharma drum, we visualize the Three Treasures, repenting for all sentient beings, forever seeking the fruit of purity.\n\n**One bow**\n\nNext, we repent the sins of mental action: from birth, our minds have been driven by greed, anger, ignorance, and attachment, racing with scattered thoughts.",

We universally vow to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, all the venerable and sagely ones, all perfected and immortals, all the great sage assemblies who have attained the Dao, and all the concealed and manifest honored sages of the ten directions: may you arouse the mind of protection and extend your compassionate intent. May the repentant patron so-and-so, from kalpas past to this very day, have all sins and karmic offenses, from the moment this mind of resolve is generated, completely extinguished. May this extend even to our parents in this present life, our masters who have guided us to liberation, our countless ancestors, siblings, and six relations, our in-laws and kin—those living in this world and those yet to come—who, by virtue of this repentance, have all their transgressions dissolved. For those already departed, may they not sink into evil destinies or dwell in dark obscurity, but swiftly attain rebirth in the Land of Eternal Bliss.\n\n**One bow**\n\n**Section Three: Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures**\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have heard the words of the Great Canon: all sentient beings, born between heaven and earth, know not the sheltering and supporting [of the Dao]. Though they receive the Great Dao, they are unaware of their true origin. Turning away from brightness toward darkness, pursuing the superficial and abandoning the fundamental, reverting from correctness to perversity, estranging themselves from truth and embracing falsehood, they defile the Three Luminaries and perpetually commit the ten evils, never generating shame or remorse, but constantly harboring venomous thoughts. Now, those who cultivate goodness and establish merit must first take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thus, the scriptures say: if one does not take refuge in the Three Treasures, then good dharmas have no foundation to rely upon. The Three Treasures are the Treasure of the Dao, the Treasure of the Scriptures, and the Treasure of the Masters. Though their paths differ, their fruits and causes vary.\n\nThe Treasure of the Dao: throughout the three realms and ten directions, it manifests in myriad forms. Sometimes as a sovereign, sometimes as an imperial teacher, it establishes heaven and earth, nurturing and sustaining living beings, absolving the roots of transgression, dissolving and dispelling calamities. Riding dragons and appearing in forms, driving chariots and soaring through the void, it abides in non-action and spontaneity—thus is the Treasure of the Dao honored.\n\nThe Treasure of the Scriptures: inscribed in purple characters on flowery terraces, written in mysterious texts on soaring trees, concealed in the secret repositories of celestial and immortal officials, bound in azure dragon’s precious scrolls, encased in white phoenix’s jade boxes, comprising four divisions and five thousand [scrolls], inscribed on jade tablets and golden slips, resting on stands of mystery and emptiness, wrapped in frost-like silk veils, they encompass the ultimate Mahāyāna—thus is the Treasure of the Scriptures honored.\n\nThe Treasure of the Masters: without understanding the Dharma’s principles, how can one distinguish the roots of things? Desiring to cross the river of craving and reach the shore of the Dao, without a ladder or a boat, how can one attain fruition without the aid of a teacher? Only by accomplishing the precepts can one establish this Dharma-body—thus is the Treasure of the Masters honored.\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, prostrate ourselves for peace and to offer posthumous deliverance. Before the true and the images, we repent our sins and transgressions, bowing our heads in submission, taking refuge and paying reverence.\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Dao of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Scriptures of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Masters of all ten directions.\n\n**One bow**\n\nToday, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual universally vow to the Most High and all the authentic Three Treasures of the ten directions. We humbly pray that your compassion universally descends, your wondrous responses follow the needs of beings. The repentant patron so-and-so prostrates for peace and posthumous deliverance, relying on the Three Treasures and reverently serving the Most Perfect and True. We humbly pray that the power of your mysterious light and wisdom constantly delivers the four kinds of birth, steadily ferrying the vessel of compassion, eternally responding to the three realms. May this bring joy to humans and spirits, and may the hidden and manifest alike receive your grace.",

May we encounter the scriptures and, before the images, bathe in fragrant waters, purifying body and spirit, contemplating the Dao and reflecting on truth.

offering to the imperial house, the myriad ancestors and ten thousand forebears, the imperial father and mother, the revered spirits of the seven ancestral temples, that their souls may ascend to the Purple Empyrean, refine their essences in the Vermilion Mound, bathe in the jeweled pools, repose in the wondrous gardens, don robes of crimson auroras, wear crowns of emerald clouds, ride the Threefold Plain Clouds, drive the Eight-Phoenix Chariot, transcend the Flowery Towers, serve in the Jade Clarity, face the \"Vacuous August One,\" stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the highest sages, be promoted to the ranks of divine Perfected, have their names inscribed in the celestial registers, dwell in the upper realms, bring benefit and peace to the lower lands, eternally protect the ancestral line, perpetually flourish the sacrificial rites, and enjoy boundless offerings—may all under heaven rejoice in this great fortune.\n\nNext, we pray for the present emperor: may the dragon’s chart shine resplendent, the phoenix’s calendar flourish, his blessed reign be without end, his grand foundation eternally firm, myriad virtues gather like clouds, a thousand auspices descend like mist. May his sagely body enjoy fine health, his imperial mind radiate wisdom, the sky of Yao eternally shelter, the sun of Shun forever shine. With his sagely wisdom, perfect and all-pervading, his virtue and teachings widely bestowed, he is hailed as the pinnacle of prosperity. As in ancient times, may his grace extend to Hua and Yi, his benevolence reach the remote frontiers. May his ministers be enlightened and upright, his royal plans well-ordered, his civil and military officials of heroic talent, diligently cultivating the imperial enterprise. May the five marquises and nine governors, the hundred officials and myriad functionaries, secure the state and pacify the people, serve the public and follow governance, eradicate the ills of the age, harmonize the realm, ensure abundant harvests of grain and beans, quell weapons of war, and together enjoy peace and prosperity—all singing the praises of sagely brilliance.\n\nNext, we pray for the imperial heir: may he be endowed with the weight of primal goodness, his Dao radiate layered brilliance, his virtue align with Heaven, his brightness match the sun, aiding and sheltering all beings, assisting in the perfection of sagely governance. May his moral and heavenly wealth abound, rites and music daily renew, his light illuminating the royal plans, his grace moistening the common people. May the golden branch flourish, the jade leaves extend their fragrance.\n\nFor the empress, the six palace consorts, and imperial concubines, the imperial daughters and moonlike maidens, may they rival the beauty of the Golden Mother, match the years of the talisman of firm Qian, eternally unwaning, their earthly virtue enduring, accumulating merits and piling up virtues, inwardly sagely and outwardly kingly.\n\nFor the imperial princes and royal clans, the heirs and feudal lords, the noble relatives and court worthies, the provincial governors and regional commanders, the frontier inspectors and their aides, the county magistrates and overseers—ever bearing toil and labor, ever cherishing loyalty and filial piety—may they, through this rite of repentance, have bodies as steadfast as mountains, lifespans as vast as the deep sea, eternally guard the inner citadel, forever rest on the unshakable stone. May their utmost virtue be pure and profound, their kindness extend to the black-haired and swarthy, lost treasures return like beasts, pheasants tame and pests cease.

Today, by good fortune, encountering this rite of repentance, bows in homage, takes refuge, and seeks to listen and receive with discernment.\n\nThe *Scripture of Karmic Retribution* states: Once, in the Hall of Cold Radiance and Cinnabar, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings suffering the sins of birth and death, divided his body throughout the Three Realms, scattered his form in the ten directions, traversing heaven above and earth below, nowhere not journeying. Arriving at the Heaven of Accumulated Virtue in the World of Mount Sumeru, seated upon a seven-jeweled radiant throne, he rejoiced with the great assembly of sages who had attained the Dao across the three times, the Heavenly Emperors, Flying Celestial Kings, Perfected Ones, Divine Lads, and countless hosts, expounding the Dharma.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, rising from the seat of fearlessness, sighed: \"For immeasurable kalpas, I have never seen the Merciful Honored One as joyful as today, bestowing the great Dharma clouds, pouring the great Dharma rain, universally enabling those present to attain awakening, each receiving benefit according to their portion, inconceivable.\"\n\nWishing to rely on divine penetrations to observe the karmic conditions of good and evil in the boundless worlds, to reveal the future, enabling knowledge of past lives, the three times—past, future, and present—having spoken thus, prostrated and bowed to the ground, gazing up at the Merciful Countenance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation: \"You now can generate this vow, arouse the great mind of goodness, benefiting all, inconceivable. By this karmic condition, he immediately emitted nine-colored radiance, penetrating and illuminating the heavens and the hundred million worlds, even the boundless lands below, the majestic spirit pervading without obstruction, shining clearly before the eyes, as if on the palm of the hand.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Universal Salvation and the great assembly, riding this majestic light, beheld above the heavens the divine play of the host of sages, their necks bearing perfect halos, bodies complete in marks, transforming appearances at will, large or small as suited. Some rode upon the light soaring through the void, mounted dragons or cranes, carefree and responsive, their divine penetrations unobstructed. They saw celestial youths and maidens, jade lads and maidens, countless in number. They saw phoenixes and peacocks, lions and apotropaic beasts, attending to the left and right. They saw golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial music and celestial flowers, celestial fruits and celestial trees, jeweled ponds and golden gardens, immortals at play, venomous dragons and fierce beasts, markets encircling the city walls, celestial kin and celestial offerings, a hundred flavors arrayed, banners, flowers, parasols, and canopies, adorned with a hundred treasures. They saw flying terraces and traveling lodges, shifting within the void, celestial robes and cloud canopies, welcoming in the empty firmament. They saw lands entirely transformed into seven treasures—gold, silver, pearls, and jade—palaces and gardens, bamboo groves, the sounds of birds and beasts, songs and music, clothing, mats, carpets, and cushions, all naturally arising, not crafted by human hands. They saw immortals consulting on Dharma marks, heavenly kings inquiring about fortune and misfortune, hundreds, thousands, even ten thousand million jeweled seats, expounding the Great Vehicle, flying immortals, celestial immortals, and those newly learning immortality questioning the Dharma and debating its subtleties. They saw such realms of blessedness, joy, and freedom, manifold and beyond naming.\n\nMoreover, they saw below the heavens the great sages and lofty perfected ones riding clouds and driving through the void, bearing banners and holding tablets, inspecting the records of sentient beings' sins and blessings. Flying celestial kings and spirits of good and evil, celestial lads, daily roaming the human realm, recording good and evil, reporting to the heavens. The cloud palaces and star offices, the palaces of the sun and moon, the lords of mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams, examining the people, assessing the merits and demerits of good and evil. They saw the five planets lose their courses, the seven luminaries deviate, the twenty-eight constellations not adhering to their celestial fields, inauspicious stars and baleful luminaries encroaching upon the imperial throne. They saw nations where warfare arose on all four fronts, the people rebelling, floods, droughts, locusts, fierce winds, and violent rains. They saw people whose years were entangled by inauspicious stars, whose fortunes were afflicted by malevolent stars, harmed by heavenly nets, plagued by earthly snares, their households troubled, their populations perishing, the five pestilences and seven afflictions causing calamities, local deities and tomb ghosts clinging to grasses and trees, wrongful deaths and demonic disturbances, falsely acting as ancestors, possessing spirits causing turmoil, water and wood spirits creating havoc, men and women without children or with children who do not live to maturity. They saw men and women in cangues and fetters, imprisoned, flogged and tortured, entangled in lawsuits and disputes, impoverished and distressed, with none to pity them, bedridden with chronic illness, desiring life yet not living, desiring death yet not dying, afflicted with leprosy, epilepsy, madness, and malignant diseases, foolishness and confusion, bodies incomplete.",

      "translated_text": "They saw those struck by lightning and thunder, their bodies covered in sores, those harmed by blades, weapons, water, and fire—burned, scorched, hacked, or shot. They saw those devoured or stung by venomous insects and fierce beasts, their cries swallowed in the maw of struggle. They saw the orphaned and widowed suffering cold and hunger, bearing hardship alone. They saw men and women parted midway through life, never to reunite in this body, mothers and children torn asunder, made into slaves and bondservants, their forms misshapen and hideous, shunned by all, their lives cut short, their arms cradling untimely death. They saw men and women born incomplete—hands and feet twisted or lame, ears deaf and eyes blind, mute and afflicted with every malady. They saw men and women with bodies split open, festering with pus and blood, lips and mouths shattered, noses collapsed, loathed by all. They saw upon the earth and among men the mountains and rivers, the peaks and streams, the Yangtze and Huai, the seas and oceans, the birds in flight and beasts on land, the creatures of water rising and sinking, all living things, all creeping things, every kind of strange being.\n\nAnd in the depths beneath the earth, within the Nine Dark Hells and the Fengdu Prisons, they saw sinners enduring every manner of torture, their torments beyond naming, their suffering bitter and piercing, cutting to the bone and wounding the heart—places of karmic retribution.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, beholding all the heavens and all the earths, saw how these causes and conditions differed in sin and blessing, suffering and joy. They knew not what cultivation in past lives had brought this, nor what transgressions in this life had wrought; what blessings in former lives had been, nor what sins in this life had arisen. Was it the natural endowment of the body? Was it the consequence of karmic retribution? Was it the work of the Three Agents? Was it the cause of parents? Was it the lot of this present life? Was it the seed sown in past lives? Was it sin borne by one alone? Was it calamity passed to descendants? Could it be that through cultivating goodness one might be delivered? Or was it simply the natural course of fate?\n\nOnly wishing that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, would deign to grant enlightenment, that all beings might awaken to the causes and conditions of past lives.\n\nThe Merciful One replied: All living beings are children of the Dao. When a child is in pain, parents grieve; when the child’s illness is cured, parents find peace. Since such suffering exists, it must be treated. Excellent, Perfected One of Universal Salvation, that you have aroused such a profound mind, enlightening and benefiting all, awakening every kind. Your question truly accords with my heart. Had you not spoken, I would have still explained. Your compassion is no different from mine. Your merit and virtue are beyond conception. You are the field of blessing for the world, the boat and oar for the world, the father and mother of the world, the guide and teacher of the multitudes, the leader of the people, the master of the Dharma, the arbiter of cause and effect. Now take your seat again, and I shall expound.\n\nToday, the master of this repentance rite has heard from the beginning of the kalpa the words of the Supreme Perfected One, inquiring of the heavens above and the earth below, of the suffering and joy of beings, the manifold causes of sin and blessing, the unfathomable conditions of past lives. Now, the master of this repentance rite, for the sake of peace and deliverance, performs this rite of repentance, prostrating body and mind, wholeheartedly arousing devotion. Bowing to the Merciful One, they reverently honor the Perfected and Sacred.\n\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who saves from suffering at the sound of a cry.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme in Heaven.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Teacher of the Three Realms.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifestation and Self-Mastery.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Radiant World.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transmits the True and illuminates all.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, vast source of the Dharma.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who extends life through vast kalpas.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless compassionate shade.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Dharma Treasury.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who broadly opens expedient means.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers beings from distress.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who saves from the Eight Difficulties.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms the Three Wretched Realms.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who prospers the nation and transforms the people.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who guards the nation.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless reach.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy, ocean of merit and virtue.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s wishes.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of the Empty Sea and Treasury of Wisdom.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Universal Virtue and Wondrous Conduct.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the patron of this ritual and all the assembly humbly pray that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Divine Youths, throughout the ten directions and the farthest reaches of the empty void, all the manifest and hidden honored and sacred ones, may universally bestow their compassionate light and together dispense the medicine of the Dharma. May they elevate and advance the ancestral lines of the nation, the seven clans and three ancestral halls, safeguard the lord of the empire, the king, and his ministers and aides. May they deliver the master of this repentance rite, ourselves, our parents of three lifetimes, our teachers and kin, from the nine generations above to the seven generations below, all benefactors and donors, all those who dwell in realms yet unilluminated by the sun and moon, the flying and walking, the sinking and floating, the souls suffering in the Nine Dark Hells and all prisons, that they may be freed from calamity and together ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nToday, the assembly of this ritual has heard that in a past kalpa, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation inquired of the heavens above and the earth below, of the manifold sufferings and joys, the causes of sin and blessing. The master of this repentance rite humbly prays that today, offering sincerity, they may come to hear the words of the scripture. What the Perfected One of Universal Salvation once asked—of the heavens above, the multitudes of sages and perfected ones, in golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial palaces—where they roam freely, carefree and transforming, in every manner of indescribable joy.\n\nThe Merciful One said: This comes from cultivating the Dao through vast kalpas, step by step ascending the ranks, attaining the status of immortality.",

      "translated_text": "Beneath the heavens, the great sages and exalted ones ride clouds and mount the void, recording the good and evil of the human realm, reporting to the heavens above, receiving Our teachings and commands—some to promote, some to punish. Thus, in those places, within the boundaries of lands and states, floods and droughts, locust plagues, fierce winds and violent rains, the fourfold rise of warfare—all arise from civil and military officials who, relying on their ranks and positions, defy the laws of the land, oppress the myriad people, pervert justice under the guise of public duty, and manipulate the king’s law, thereby incurring such retribution.\n\nAs for the people, men and women alike, who in this life suffer manifold illnesses and hardships, various demonic calamities, peril, distress, and adversity, whose bodies are incomplete—those who are poor and lowly, who upon death enter hell, endure all manner of karmic retribution, sink for ten thousand kalpas, and remain in the evil destinies—all this stems from immeasurable kalpas past down to the present kalpa, to this very life and day. Some suffer due to the deeds of their parents, some due to their own actions, the consequences flowing downward and extending onward, creating the three karmas, the six senses, and the ten grave evils. Generation after generation, they inherit all manner of bitter retribution; age after age, they endure every kind of demonic affliction.\n\nWhat We speak of—the karmic deeds of sentient beings—is such that even a single deed encompasses hundreds of variations. To speak of it briefly would be to leave much unsaid.\n\nAt that time, Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High consent to reveal the causes and consequences of good and evil, the matters of karmic retribution, prostrated and bowed to the ground, saying: The Most High has said that sentient beings are foolish and benighted, sunk in the snares of the world, unable to awaken, bound only to karmic conditions, flowing through birth and death, enduring all manner of sin and suffering. We humbly pray that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy may take pity and deliver them, so that future sentient beings may turn their hearts toward the good Dao, avoid bitter retribution, and escape the nine dark hells of Fengdu and the myriad prisons, where they endure all manner of torture.\n\nThe Most High said: If there are men or women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, purify their dwellings, and keep their bodies clean and adorned; who set up canopies and seats, install Our image, surround it with banners and flowers, keep lamps burning continuously, burn incense and scatter flowers in offering, sit or walk in mindfulness of the Dao; or who invite Dharma masters, or themselves, for the sake of protecting the state and bringing peace to the people, harmonizing winds and rains, averting disasters and delivering from hardship, safeguarding their dwellings, seeking to extend blessings and longevity, dispelling ghosts and expelling evil; or for the sake of their parents or themselves in times of illness or calamity, when stars and constellations exert their influence, seeking children, or ransoming and liberating those who have left the household life; or for the sake of uncles, brothers, wives, and children; or to console the earth spirits and tomb guardians, protect servants and livestock, and all manner of wealth; or for the sake of masters, lords, Dharma kin, the nine generations of ancestors—parents, brothers, uncles, wives, children, and the six relations—who have passed away, to provide offerings and deliverance; if they but come before Our image, bow to the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthies who manifest in infinite response across the ten directions, offer sincerity like melting snow, and with body and mind repent the sins of immeasurable kalpas, of lives past and present, of every rebirth down to this very day—then their sins shall be extinguished as they wish.\n\nThe transformative names of Us, recorded in the scriptures and spread among humankind, dispel heavenly disasters above, eradicate earthly calamities below, and benefit the people in between. In this life and the next, their merit shall never cease. They shall attain peace and stability for the realm, longevity for the emperor, harmony in the stars and constellations, and timely winds and rains. Demons, thieves, and enemies shall become good friends. Venomous creatures and fierce beasts shall harbor no ill intent. Wind, water, fire, and warfare shall cause no harm. Their wishes shall be fulfilled, their prayers answered. The suffering souls in the nine dark hells shall escape their dark prisons and be reborn in the heavenly realms. The four kinds of birth and six destinies shall all attain liberation.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High expound this repentance Dharma for the deliverance of sentient beings, rejoiced in body and mind beyond all measure, extolling the Heavenly Worthy with these verses:\n\nExcellent is the Primordial Beginning Worthy,\nRevered by all in the Three Realms.\nHis sacred power is beyond thought,\nHis wisdom and virtue peerless.\n\nUpon the natural seven-jeweled throne,\nHe manifests in the flowering grove.\nComplete in form and appearance,\nUnobstructed as the empty sky.\n\nTo reveal the profound mystery,\nHe opens the gates of myriad wonders.\nHaving realized the supreme Dao,\nHe turns the wheel of the Great Vehicle.\n\nWith skill he expounds the Dharmas,\nUniversally reviving all beings.\nHaving heard this Dharma,\nOur hearts are purified, our defilements removed.\n\nOvercome with joy,\nWe bow our heads to the Jade Void.\n\nToday, the assembly of this ritual, along with the repentance master, from immeasurable kalpas past until now, have never before encountered this repentance Dharma. Today, humbly offering prayers for peace and deliverance, we reverently face the compassionate Worthy, the scriptures, and the sacred image, arousing boundless resolve and infinite intention. With our five limbs touching the earth, we wholeheartedly invoke:\n\nWe bow our heads to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently honoring the Perfected Sages.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues the suffering upon hearing their cries.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Emperor.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to names and transforms.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Net who manifests in transformation.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who divides into millions of bodies.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who extends compassion through vast kalpas.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Ten Thousand Jeweled Lights.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Lamp Light.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who manifests boundlessly.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Universal Deliverance.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms with sovereign ease.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Master of the Three Realms.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transmits the truth and universally illuminates.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who opens the way for sentient beings.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who takes pity without end.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who rescues the suffering.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.\nWith sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion who guards the state.",

Today, may all sins—from the slightest thread or hair, a single name or kind, to those as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—be utterly extinguished from this day forward, with the arising of a single thought. May parents, teachers, uncles, brothers, oneself, spouse, children, the six relations, and all kin, through this act of repentance, together attain liberation and be spared from suffering and affliction. May all beings realize the supreme Dao.\n\n**First Bow**\nThus concludes the first fascicle of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and Ninefold Darkness*.\n**Second Fascicle of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and Ninefold Darkness***\nCompiled by Ge Xuan, Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate\n\n**First Chapter: The Mirror of Compassionate Reflection**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentance master [Name], reverently join hands and listen attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable has taught that all sentient beings, in committing even a single deed, generate hundreds of karmic consequences—too many to enumerate in full, so let us speak briefly.\n\nThen the Perfected One of Universal Salvation addressed the assembly, vowing to elucidate the myriad transgressions of future beings before the image of the Compassionate Venerable, repenting each one in turn. Though the causes may not yet be fully expounded, may they be broadly explained, so that beings of endless kalpas may find refuge.\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable said: Men and women of the world, casting off bodies and receiving bodies through kalpas without measure, take rebirth due to the sins constructed by the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, reckless indulgence, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, delusion, deceitful speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech, envy of those superior, obstructing all things, consuming meat and wine, violating scriptural precepts, damaging sacred images, neglecting fasting rituals, disrespecting teachers, turning from truth to falsehood, believing in perverse views, cursing spirits, failing to honor the Three Treasures, slandering the worthy, scorning the empty and absurd, indulging in sounds and forms, becoming attached to fragrances and flavors, sinking into transgression, creating karma inwardly and outwardly, perpetuating cycles of mutual generation. The six senses arise in turn, compounding faults; the roots of sin grow, and with each thought, wrongdoing forms. There are boundless, immeasurable sins, their number like the dust of the earth, long-accumulated habits residing within. From past causes to present, kalpa after kalpa, with the arising of a single thought, all may be purified—like a bright mirror, where countless particles of dust, from before and behind, even the grease and grime of myriad impurities, accumulate to form obscuring films, dimming inner and outer clarity. Yet once it encounters a skilled craftsman, who wipes, polishes, and refines it, its surface and interior become radiant, reflecting near and far, resplendently clear, restored to its original state. Why? Because its nature is fundamentally pure.\n\nSo too are sentient beings: the spirit is originally pure, without defilement. But after receiving form, inner and outer dusts gradually stain it, turning it evil. The six roots, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, six desires, six consciousnesses—discriminating and creating delusion—generate a filthy, encumbered body. Inner obscurations and outer afflictions arise, losing the true nature, drifting in the cycle of birth and death, sinking deeper into sin, meeting retribution through karmic conditions, and thus plunging into hell, enduring all manner of suffering, submerged for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of great compassion, I pity sentient beings, and so from kalpa to kalpa, I revolve through the human realm—sometimes in China, sometimes among barbarians; sometimes old, sometimes young; sometimes ordinary, sometimes sacred; sometimes female, sometimes male; sometimes noble, sometimes base—manifesting in various forms, teaching and transforming with skillful means, delivering sentient beings. The scriptural teachings spread, awakening all, enabling them to escape suffering and forever depart from the hells of mud and fire. Yet beings are dull-witted and cannot comprehend. Now, for your sake, I will broadly reveal the causes and conditions, further distinguishing them, so that future beings may turn their hearts toward the good path.\n\nUpon hearing this parable and its distinctions, Universal Salvation’s body and mind leapt with joy. Praising the Compassionate Venerable, he spoke this verse:\n\nExcellent, Primordial Beginning Venerable,\nTrue Father and Mother of all beings.\nYou expound again the three and six roots,\nAnd further illustrate with the mirror parable.\nWith skillful means, You rescue the submerged,\nWith compassion, You deliver from suffering.\nHaving heard this Dharma,\nOur bodies and minds understand all causes.\nFor endless kalpas in the Dao altar,\nYou are the Master who preaches for the assembly.",

May the rain of sweet dew wash away all dust and defilement. May the power of compassionate light deliver all beings, guiding them to the other shore, ultimately pure.\n\nThrough this repentance text offered by the repentance master [Name] for peace and in supplication for the departed, may the power of deliverance from suffering, the power of support, the power of salvation and protection, the power of disaster elimination, the power of virtue, and the power of peace ensure all wishes are fulfilled. May all sentient beings universally repent together and return to realize the Dao fruit.\n\nOne bow.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar and the repentance master [Name] once more offer utmost sincerity, listening attentively to the scriptural words. The world in which all earthly beings dwell—the Sahā world—is floating, illusory, defiled, and impure. Hells, hungry ghosts, and animals fill the land of retribution. Few cultivate goodness; many commit evil.\n\nIn such a world, the four seasons pass and change, reckoning human lifespans, some long, some short. Spring, summer, autumn, winter—wind, rain, cold, heat—day and night, darkness and light, sun and moon hasten by. The land is of sand and gravel, uneven and treacherous. Mountains and rivers are perilous and obstructed; grasses and trees bear thorns. Not one thing brings joy.\n\nThe human body we receive is subject to birth, aging, illness, and death—a temporary aggregation of impurities, fragile and insecure. Because we have bodies, we seek clothing and food, yet often they are insufficient. Hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and deprivation afflict us. The laws of rulers drive us relentlessly; we cannot be at ease. Stubborn and dull-witted, our vision is shallow and clumsy. We associate with unwise companions.\n\nOur eyes see evil forms, our ears hear evil sounds, our noses smell foul odors, our tongues taste bitter flavors, our bodies endure harsh touches, our minds contemplate wicked dharmas—such matters are boundless. Life is impermanent, truly fearful. Thoughts pass in succession, never pausing for even a moment. Swift as a spark from struck stone or a flash of lightning, a hundred years pass in but a few days.\n\nAmidst such countless sufferings, there is no moment of peace. Moreover, beings’ karmic marks persist unbroken. Their natures are stubborn and hard, like earth mixed with tiles and stones. Those of many desires, seeking much profit, suffer greatly. Those who are ever content, though dwelling on earth, are at peace. Those who know no contentment, though in heaven, remain unsatisfied.\n\nMoreover, long-accumulated evil causes sever good roots. Delusion and attachment blind them, preventing awakening. The darkness of ignorance veils their eyes. Some are entangled by new karma; others face retribution for past grievances. As ministers, they are disloyal; as children, unfilial. Their hearts harbor hidden malice; they secretly slander and curse. Evil spirits assail them, leading to repeated illnesses. Unexpected slander arises; misfortune strikes without warning. Careers stall; desires go unfulfilled. Water, fire, and weapons cause harm. Separation and death bring suffering. Countless sorrows and griefs cannot be fully recounted.\n\nMoreover, the hindrance of afflictions is heavy; good fruits are rarely encountered. Even when seen or heard, they do not seek or desire to transcend suffering and be reborn. Instead, they rely on youthful beauty, family and children, towering mansions, and various pleasures, merely preserving their lives. Yet in an instant, all collapses. Regardless of wealth or nobility, the great limit approaches—what use are such pursuits?\n\nMoreover, beings do not realize the world is empty and false, that human and heavenly realms are like dreams. Illness, suffering, and fragility bind them; sorrows entangle them. Time fleets by; cold and heat alternate. Not a moment is spent awakening and cultivating goodness. They only wish to drift endlessly in the sea of suffering, long mired in birth and death.\n\nI pity beings more than parents pity their children. Parents’ love for their children lasts but one lifetime; my compassion for beings spans eternal kalpas. When parents see their children are unfilial, their hearts grow distant. When I see beings are unvirtuous, my compassion only deepens.",

Now, seeing the questions you have raised concerning the karmic causes of beings’ sins and blessings, it is as though I have swallowed iron and stone, as though an arrow has pierced my heart. My thoughts of compassion and mercy never cease for even a moment. Today, I expound this repentance ritual to rescue those sunk in delusion. You must diligently practice it and broadly deliver beings in future kalpas.\n\nThus, the Universal Savior proclaims these gāthās anew:\n\nThe Primordial Beginning, Supreme and Unsurpassed First Honored One,\nTranscends the Three Realms, peerless and without equal.\nFor countless kalpas, you have accumulated sublime practices,\nPerfecting the pure and virtuous causes of blessings and wisdom.\nAll afflictions and habitual defilements are severed;\nUltimately, old karma is not recreated anew.\nYour spiritual penetrations and mighty powers know no fear;\nYou perceive the Three Times with clarity, discerning the mundane and the real.\nYour wisdom and all virtues are perfectly complete,\nGathered into this wondrous Dharma-body.\nThough dwelling in hell, you take the place of beings,\nEnduring the boiling cauldrons, searing furnaces, and scorching coals.\nFrigid waters and icy springs do not harm your body;\nSword trees and blade mountains do not rend your flesh.\nSeeing their anguish, your heart is filled with sorrow,\nYet you rejoice in suffering for their sake.\nThus, you attain this wondrous reward-body,\nLike the moon cradled in the vast sea, its light serene and clear.\nIt embraces all without obstruction,\nNurturing the myriad things without exhaustion.\nRoaming within the Three Clarities’ Dharma-positions,\nYour heart transmits the flow of compassionate transformation without end.\nOur praises cannot suffice to extol you,\nFor your boundless grace spans kalpas beyond reckoning.\n\nToday, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind. The repentance-master, so-and-so, acknowledges the emptiness of the Four Great Elements, the transience of the Three Realms, the uncertainty of life’s span, the fragility of the body’s form, and the entanglements of karmic burdens—all offenses are of my own making. Today, encountering this repentance ritual, I vow with utmost sincerity, bowing my head in reverence. May the fires of the Three Poisons be extinguished, and the mind of a hundred virtues arise. Prostrating with five limbs to the ground, I wholeheartedly listen with devotion, seeking peace and offering this repentance text in memorial.\n\nI bow my head to the Merciful Honored One, paying homage to the true sages.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Upon Hearing the Sound.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Perfection in the Great Net.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Light Pervading Illumination.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Subdues Demons and Dispels Afflictions.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Goodness and Protection.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Union with the Dao.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Loving Practice of the Dao.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Subtle Body.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Commands the Directors of Destiny.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Extracts the Ten Sufferings.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Love.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Contemplates the Wondrous.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Attains Auspiciousness.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Qi.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Myriad Perfected.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Origin.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Calamity.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grotto.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vaidūrya.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merits.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accords with Wishes for Rebirth.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Wondrous Practice.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Vast Faith.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Extracts Transgressions.\n\nToday, the Dharma-assembly’s sponsor, so-and-so, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected, all the great youths, and all the true sages throughout the ten directions and the vast expanse of the unseen, manifest and hidden. May they bestow their minds of vast compassion, mercy, deliverance, disaster-dispelling, blessings-gathering, and suffering-rescue, so that the repentance-master’s aspirations may harmonize with their heart, that they may ride the fruit of true sages, uplift sentient beings, and ascend together to the supreme Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repentance of Deluded Thoughts**\n\nToday, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind, reverently facing the Merciful Honored One to repent the karmic offenses of deluded thoughts. The repentance-master, so-and-so, gathers their mind, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nAll beings, from the moment their bodily forms are born, are stained by the impurities of the dust. Eyes behold the five colors, noses smell the five fragrances, tongues taste the five flavors, ears hear the five sounds—all are but chaotic distractions. The true sound is not discerned; the true color is not seen. The mind arises in coarse violence, sinking into infatuation and attachment, giving rise to the roots of manifold karmic deeds, all stemming from deluded thoughts.\n\nWhether man or woman, once the mind’s thought arises and turns toward me, repenting all manner of karmic offenses, first repent deluded thoughts and doubts, then repent all karmic deeds.\n\nThe Universal Savior asks, “What are deluded thoughts?”\nThe Merciful Honored One replies, “Beings’ deluded and inverted thoughts all arise from the mind. Forcibly making distinctions, they fixate on the body, and upon encountering circumstances, delusion arises—every thought is false. For this reason, contemplate the body with wisdom: bones, flesh, skin, bodily form, hair, the six sense faculties, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits. Reflect carefully—there is no true substance to be found. They are merely a temporary aggregation of shared illusions, coalescing to form the body. Searching within and without, where am I to be found? Since the body is illusory, the mind becomes empty. Emptiness and illusion are not real—all are deluded thoughts. The body being a deluded thought, all dharmas are likewise. Self and other, right and wrong, love and hatred, grasping and rejecting, forms, sounds, fragrances, tastes, jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, frivolous speech, harsh words—all karmic deeds, in an instant, are dissolved. Within and without, all is pure and empty, naturally uniting with the true Dao. All such beings, if before the Three Treasures they practice repentance of deluded thoughts...”",

They only wish to drift endlessly in the sea of suffering, long mired in birth and death.\n\nI pity beings more than parents pity their children.

When I see beings are unvirtuous, my compassion only deepens.",

      "translated_text": "Upon beholding men and women of upright bearing, as well as all manner of good deeds in the world, one vows to forever revere, comply with joy, and encourage such persons, wishing them to attain good fruit. May this extend universally to all beings—those of the four modes of birth and six paths of existence—so that together they may transcend and realize the supreme Dao.\n*One bow*\n\n**Chapter Four: Extinguishing the Fire of the Mind**\n\nToday, within this Daoist sanctuary, each member of the assembly directs their mind, gazing reverently toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting and extinguishing the karmic offenses of the mind’s fire.\n\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, joins palms, bows in full prostration, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings, from the first division of south and north, gradually recognize east and west. They cherish the fine and despise the coarse, delight in wealth and resent poverty, their convictions shaping their actions. They fail to measure short and long, covet profit and forget gratitude, estrange kin and favor outsiders. At the sight of adornments, they are insatiable; upon hearing plain truth, they react as if to a foe or enemy. Mountains are likened to sin, while wind resembles good fruit.\n\nMoreover, their wisdom is narrow and shallow, their qi coarse and foolish. They act with abandon, clinging to their own rightness in speech. Greed knows no bounds, and vexation is endless. They regard goodness as an enemy and rejoice at evil. Though they amass vast wealth, they still claim destitution; though their karmic deeds are deep and numerous, they insist all is just. From beginning to end, they neither perceive nor comprehend. Months and years accumulate, yet they neither repent nor regret.\n\nDoubt and delusion arise from the mind itself; ignorance, attachment, greed, and anger also spring from the mind. The mind generates anger and joy, yet ancestral roots and fundamental integrity remain unsteady. They indulge in wine and take life, reveling in their desires. Though their attire is refined—silks adorning their forms—lustful thoughts arise, bringing ruin to families and nations. They boast of youth and strength, flaunting splendor, scorning virtuous friends while clinging to wicked companions. From dawn to dusk, they wallow in confusion, sinking into night’s delirium. They fail to recognize kin or honor parents. Once deluded, they do not turn back—like fire consuming a mountain, wind and flame raging fiercely, nearly impossible to extinguish.\n\nWind stirs atop fire, its intent rooted in the human heart. Fire blazes, wind rises, the mind pursues, and intention follows. Foolish and common, they cling to defilement as truth. Thoughts stir the wind, blending into illusion.\n\nThereupon, the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:\n\n> Anger’s thoughts are demonic foes,\n> Words diverge, discord grows.\n> Wills clash, countenances darken,\n> Glowering eyes, brows slanted—\n> Like the five-hued serpent’s glare.\n> Death comes in an instant,\n> Entangling one in hell’s torment.\n> Exhort all beings to reform and repent,\n> Lest they linger in prison’s snare.\n> But if the great Dao-mind is aroused,\n> All karmic obstacles dissolve and fade.\n\nAt that time, the Merciful Honored One addressed the assembly of universal salvation, saying: “The offenses of sentient beings arise from the mind and are extinguished by the mind. With but a single thought, all may be dispelled. Karma’s bonds cling to the body like a rope binding a bird. Though it may wander east, west, south, or north, it flies only as far as the rope allows, feeding wherever it lands, believing itself free. Yet it does not perceive the one who holds the rope, drawing it near to seize it. Only when captured does it know terror. Once in hand, its life and death rest with another. Though it cries and pleads, flapping in distress, there is no escape, no savior.\n\nThe karmic deeds of humans are likewise. Failing to restrain the six senses, they indulge the seven consciousnesses, committing all manner of evil without reflection. Karmic bonds form, and they are reborn according to their deeds. The invisible rope of karma binds their minds. Though born into wealth and nobility, or among animals, hungry ghosts, sickness, and evil destinies—wherever they transform, they find fleeting joy, believing themselves content, utterly unaware. Their former creditors, the karmic adversaries, await in the unseen realm, tracking their deeds to claim them. Disaster strikes unseen. Suffering and affliction arise, yet they do not awaken. They blame the gods, embrace false views, kill living beings in sacrifice, endure past misfortunes, and forge new enmities. In that moment, there is no savior, no recourse.\n\nToday, all within this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures describe, must reflect deeply and stand in awe. The invisible rope of karma is none other than unwholesomeness. The suffering of rebirth is wrought by the mind. Without repentance, how can it be dispelled? Just as form and shadow arise from ignorance and vanish with its cessation, one must cultivate shame and remorse, purifying body and mind, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe repentance master, so-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this present life, having cast off and received countless bodies—along with masters, teachers, disciples, superiors, inferiors, parents, siblings, and all kin—has, through the fire of the mind, created karmic conditions beyond measure or reckoning. Today, prostrating in reverence for peace and offering this repentance rite, they cast themselves fully to the ground, listen with single-minded devotion, bow their head to the Merciful Honored One, and pay homage to the true sages.\n\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cherishes life and delivers beings.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of universally manifest virtue.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy whose mercy pervades the three realms.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms the six paths.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of flying cinnabar and radiant extremity.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grove and Primordial Cavern.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of inexhaustible numinous response.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of wisdom and diligent progress.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Floating Netherworld.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of eternal salvation and mercy.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of perfect wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of eternal ascent to the morning heavens.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of luminous wonder.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of enlightenment.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of vast salvation.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of all wonders.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Subtlety.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of wondrous understanding.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Ocean.\nWith devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.",

      "translated_text": "The Venerable Left Immortal Lord Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate has compiled this text.\n\n**Chapter One: Severing Afflictions**\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting and severing the karmic offenses of afflictions.\n\nThe repentant master, with gathered mind and kneeling in reverence, listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, born from the shelter of their parents’ wombs, may grow in wealth or poverty in youth, rise to nobility or fall into lowliness, commit a single evil or a hundred evils, be male or female—yet they do not comprehend the cycles of rebirth, nor discern its beginning or end.\n\nFor afflictions exist. Afflictions arise from clinging to views; clinging to views arises from inversion; inversion arises from delusion; delusion arises from doubt; doubt arises from manifold sufferings; and manifold sufferings arise from all karmic deeds.\n\nOnce karmic deeds are created, impermanence presses upon them, leaving no freedom.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One addressed Universal Salvation, saying: \"Afflictions are what cause sentient beings to take form and dwell in the human world. Not only do the rich and noble, the poor and lowly, men and women all seek clothing and food, but they must also pursue the conditions of life, provide for their needs, sustain their daily use, be bound by royal laws, constrained by hierarchies of honor and humility, unite with kin, and distinguish between love and attachment—even unto old age, sickness, and death. Or, failing to complete their allotted lifespan, they drift with their karma, flowing into the Three Evil Realms, gradually distancing themselves from the paths of humans and heavens. Unaware of the suffering of impermanence, they do not awaken.\n\nYet those with wisdom and clarity, who embody the absence of thought, who possess insight and perceive delusion, who discern doubt—do not regard these as suffering. They abide in ease and joy, following their thoughts to generate intentions, and their intentions to create karma. They cling to views as truth, invert right and wrong, conjure delusions in response to circumstances, and pursue desires with doubt. Indulging the six senses, they commit sins as numerous as the grains of the Ganges; neglecting the three karmic actions, they sow seeds for boundless hells. All this stems from afflictions, which defile body and mind.\n\nWith a body, there are afflictions; without a body, there are no afflictions. Since afflictions exist, one must cultivate and practice.\n\nUniversal Salvation asked: \"What good must be cultivated to depart from afflictions?\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: \"Extinguish the three karmic actions and establish the three virtuous practices: the virtuous practice of the mind, the virtuous practice of the body, and the virtuous practice of speech.\n\nFirst, the virtuous practice of the mind: (1) not coveting, (2) not harboring anger, and (3) not being deluded. Be pure and self-disciplined, desire little and know contentment, restrain greed and abandon the pursuit of profit, be compassionate and patient, gentle and forgiving, subdue anger and remain free from resentment, contemplate the subtle and abide in stillness, comprehend existence and penetrate non-existence, and with wisdom, clearly understand all dharmas. This is called the virtuous practice of the mind.\n\nNext, the virtuous practice of the body: (1) not killing, (2) not stealing, and (3) not engaging in improper sexual conduct. Be benevolent and wise, broadly giving alms, pitying all beings, saving lives and delivering the dying, humble and yielding, taking nothing that is not rightfully yours, and relinquishing body, life, and wealth without reluctance. Be truly pure and clean, far from improper conduct, free from lust and desire, and keep the mind from dissipation. This is called the virtuous practice of the body.\n\nAs for the virtuous practice of speech: (1) not lying, (2) not using flowery or deceptive language, (3) not engaging in divisive speech, and (4) not uttering abusive words. Speak truthfully, without falsehood; let your words be genuine, free from embellishment; let your expressions be balanced, upright, and without duplicity; do not create divisions or take sides; let your voice be harmonious, soft, and clear; skillfully expound the Dharma and recite the profound verses. This is called the virtuous practice of speech.\n\nWhen the three practices are virtuous, there is no doubt. Without doubt, there is no delusion. Without delusion, there is no inversion. Without inversion, there is no clinging to views. Without clinging to views, there are no afflictions. Without afflictions, there are no manifold sufferings. Without manifold sufferings, there are no karmic deeds. Without karmic deeds, there is peace and joy, and one enters the Dao of Non-Action.\"\n\nUpon hearing the teaching of the three virtuous practices, Universal Salvation realized that all sentient beings could be cured of the illness of afflictions. Praising the Merciful Honored One, he composed this verse:\n\nI bow to the true Dharma Lord among the sages,\nWho expounds the medicine for the afflictions of beings.\nThe priceless treasure within the hearts of beings\nIs ever plundered by the six thieves.\nThe arrow of anger pierces the heart,\nThe lock of ignorance and attachment has no key.\nThe shackles of self and others confine the body,\nWhile the demonic thoughts of the six relations plunder it.\nNow, relying on the three virtuous practices to drive them away,\nFor endless kalpas, the four marks shall not cling.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, along with the repentant master, having heard of these afflictions, must deeply reflect. For countless kalpas, we have witnessed all sufferings. What was once deemed joy is now suffering in this life, yet we cannot awaken, cannot sever afflictions. Instead, they increase, entangling us in past karma, trapping us in this illusory world, obscuring the Great Dao, and preventing us from awakening to the true essence. Afflictions and calamities arise daily, binding us ever tighter.\n\nNow, having encountered the scriptural teachings of the Merciful Honored One, who broadly expounds the Dharma gates and elucidates afflictions, we are lifted from ignorance. May all sentient beings awaken.\n\nThe repentant master, from beginningless kalpas until the present kalpa, in this life and today, along with nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, both the living and the deceased, and all kin—having indulged the three karmic actions of the body, the four of speech, and the ten of the mind, from beginningless ignorance—have created the Three Poisons, the Four Destinies, the Five Hindrances, the Six Dusts, the Seven Leaks, the Eight Defilements, the Nine Knots, and the Ten Entanglements, leaving us without freedom. Afflictions have confined us in cages, casting us into the currents of transmigration.\n\nToday, encountering this repentance ritual is like the sun at noon, the moon at night, the blind regaining sight, the mute speaking, the deaf hearing, the guilty receiving pardon. Prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, with a single mind, I bow to the Merciful Honored One and reverently pay homage to the true sages.\n\nWith sincere mind, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.",

May they together extend their virtuous power to save and protect all beings. May the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, forever sever afflictions, depart from defilement, and for past and present lives, generate virtuous power to assist those in the Three Wretched Realms, forever escape evil destinies, and may all of us attain rebirth in the pure and joyful lands of the ten directions. May all afflictions, habitual sins, and karmic causes, through this repentance, be wholly dissolved. From this day forward, may we practice the true appearance of the Dao, without laziness or negligence. May we attain the power of wisdom and expedient means, dispel all calamities, safeguard the realm, liberate the six paths—both hidden and manifest—deliver the distant souls of the nine generations and three lineages, and together escape the cages of confinement, ascending together to the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Second Section: Repentance of the Dusts and Toils of Suffering**\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, each person directs their mind, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of all the dusts and toils of suffering. The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, collects their mind, surrenders their life, takes refuge, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.\n\nAll beings, from the moment of birth and the formation of their bodies, bear the round heavens upon their heads and tread the square earth beneath their feet. Their flesh is foul and filthy, their bones and flesh rank and base. They do not avoid the stars and constellations, constantly offending wind and rain, accumulating these yang transgressions, inevitably incurring yin offenses. Within heaven and earth, regardless of high or low status, the categories of sins are boundless. Some sins arise from the three karmas, some from the six roots, some from the inner mind’s perversity, some from attachment to external conditions. Some arise from the Three Poisons giving rise to the Four Perversions, some from the three karmas generating the one hundred and eight afflictions, some from the five views producing the sixty-two views, some from the ten evils giving rise to forty kinds of evil, some from the six senses generating the eighty-four thousand gates of dusts and toils. Or from a single thought in a single moment, the Four Perversions arise, the one hundred and eight afflictions are generated, the sixty-two views are established, the forty kinds of evil are committed, and the eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering are created. How much more so for a day, a month, a year—arising from thoughts and intentions? How much more so after passing through kalpas, giving rise to manifold sins? Thus, the toils of suffering follow one after another, without end.\n\nNow, the root of these sins arises from three kinds. The Universal Savior says: What are the three? The first is vexation, the second is karma, the third is thought. Due to these three, one cannot perceive the sages nor the wondrous and excellent affairs of humans and heavens. If in a single day, a single hour, a single thought, one awakens to these three hindrances—even the three karmas, six roots, one hundred and eight afflictions, sixty-two views, forty kinds of evil, and eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering—all may be purified.\n\nYet these beings do not believe my words, do not follow the scriptural teachings, do not know how to resolve enmity, do not seek liberation. They accumulate evil as numerous as the sands, their sins filling heaven and earth. The Three Poisons, Ten Evils, Five Views, Six Dusts, Six Defilements, Six Entrances—these give rise to uninterrupted karmic offenses. Or they commit incomplete practices, sever karmic actions through faith, slander the Heavenly Worthies, revile the Three Treasures, destroy the worthy and sagely, ruin the true Dharma, disbelieve in sin and merit. They commit the Ten Evil Karmas: delusion turning truth into falsehood, foolish and confused karma; disloyalty to the sovereign, treacherous and flattering karma; unfilial conduct toward parents, rebellious karma; disrespect toward honored teachers, irreverent karma; betrayal of friends, unrighteous karma; committing the Four Grave Offenses that obstruct the sagely Dao; violating pure precepts, breaking the Eight Observances; transgressing the Five Precepts and Seven Hindrances, incomplete and flawed karma; disbelieving the Ten Precepts, regardless of severity, defiling thoughts with expedient means; failing to observe the six long fasts and ten monthly fasts, inconsistent cultivation; improper conduct within the various dignified deportments; the two thousand four hundred subtle dignified deportments; hindering the cultivation of bodily precepts, mental concentration, and wisdom; committing various offenses during the spring and autumn Eight Kings’ festivals; engaging in manifold evils, violating the six dignified deportments; lacking compassion toward suffering beings, unfeeling and unmindful karma; failing to rescue or aid, lacking salvation and protection; harboring jealousy, generating self-and-other karma; unequal treatment of enemies and loved ones; indulging in the Five Desires without weariness, failing to renounce; seeking ease through clothing, food, gardens, baths, and ponds, generating frivolous karma; or directing leaky merit toward the Three Sages, obstructing the path of leaving the household. Such karmas are boundless and immeasurable, impossible to fully recount.",

      "translated_text": "Universal Salvation asked, \"With what mind should one act to extinguish these karmic obstructions and transgressions?\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied, \"First, one must arouse seven kinds of wholesome minds as expedient means to achieve their eradication. What are the seven?\n\n1. Shame and remorse,\n2. Fear and dread,\n3. Weariness and renunciation,\n4. The arising of the supreme wholesome mind,\n5. Equal regard for enemies and loved ones,\n6. Mindfulness of repaying the kindness of the Heavenly Worthy, the sovereign, the master, and parents,\n7. Contemplation that all delusive thoughts and the nature of transgressions are empty.\n\nIf one fails to cultivate these wholesome minds and does not arise repentance, calamities will afflict distant ancestors, misfortunes will taint future generations, and in this present life, one will suffer blindness, deafness, and chronic illness. At death, one will fall into the nine dark hells, remaining for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—emaciated, ghostly, and inhuman in form.\"\n\nThen the Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:\n\nIf one harbors an unwholesome mind,\nAnd without cause commits manifold karmas—\nEven a single thread or hair,\nOr countless billions—\nAt death, one enters the eighteen hells,\nEnduring every kind of suffering.\nLater reborn among starving tigers,\nForever denied a full meal.\nEven if one gains a human body,\nOne is slain by water, fire, or the sword,\nOr suffers chronic illness,\nMadness, or epilepsy.\n\nToday, in this grand Dharma assembly, as the scripture declares, we ought to be deeply terrified. Within this body lie such toils and afflictions—how, through kalpas uncounted, could we have awakened to them, shrouded as we are in ignorance? Some commit the ten evils themselves; others teach the ten evils; still others praise the ten evils or openly advance them. With every thought and every moment, one dwells upon the ten evils. Even for a single hair’s weight of transgression, one will one day receive its retribution—how could remorse then avail?\n\nNow, we must strive with diligence and repent with vigor. Whether in the six paths or among the four modes of birth, seeing those who suffer or are yet to suffer, I now generate the aspiration that all may equally attain liberation.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, prostrates in reverence, dedicating this repentance rite for peace and to offer posthumous merit. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he bows his head to the Merciful Honored One and pays homage to the true sages.\n\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Mysterious Perfection Heavenly Worthy of myriad blessings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and delivers the Dragon Kings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the ten-thousand-kalpa turning wheel.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions who respond to all names.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy beyond thought and discussion.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who eliminates afflictions.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of lofty and far-reaching virtue.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of dust-like marvels.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose body radiates the Dharma.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose wisdom is invincible.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the profound and ultimate Dharma.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Supreme Purity Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who advances the Dao.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and responds.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who knows suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms beings.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of faith and wisdom.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers from distress.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who transcends immortals.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who ensures long life and preserves destiny.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who protects the realm.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to wishes.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy whose merit is like the ocean.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of wondrous efficacy.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of profound understanding.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great compassion who saves from suffering.\nWith sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great mercy who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the sponsor of this Dharma assembly and all present reverently aspire that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the southern direction, all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected ones, all the great divine immortals, all the great celestial immortals, and all the great youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, responding to every name—all true sages, may with the Great Mysterious Water wash away the karmic afflictions, transgressions, and toils of the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, his parents who gave him life, his masters who transmitted the Dharma and conferred ordination, his uncles, brothers, male and female kin, and all sentient beings bound by present and past conditions, infinite and immeasurable.\n\nBy the power of this repentance, may we rely on the power of the Dao, the power of the true sages, the power of the repentance rite, the power of cause and effect, the inconceivable power, and the power of merit, so that all may be extinguished, all views awakened, and the profound principle thoroughly understood. May all beings, without exception, transcend the toils and transgressions of worldly dust, realize the unconditioned, and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\n\n**Chapter Three: Returning to Faith and Reverence**\n\nToday, in this grand Dharma assembly, each person directs their mind upward to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of irreverence and lack of faith.\n\nThe repentance sponsor, so-and-so, bows his head and kneels in reverence, listening attentively to the scripture’s words: All sentient beings, creating evil causes and acting inappropriately, harbor minds like raging fire, burning fiercely without discrimination. Whether ugly or fair, their thoughts are sharp as blades, their severity sparing neither strong nor weak. Over time, days accumulate into months, months into years, yet they fail to cultivate even a moment’s goodness. Day by day, their transgressions grow, and their enmities multiply, increasing their suffering karma and consigning them to eternal submersion.\n\nFrom past conditions to present, from kalpa to kalpa, with every thought and intention, they generate irreverence and lack of faith, slandering the Three Sages, defaming the Three Sages, belittling the Three Sages, defiling the Three Sages, mocking the Three Sages, cursing the Three Sages, reviling the Three Sages, deceiving the Three Sages, arrogantly scorning the Three Sages, contemptuously deriding the Three Sages, devouring the offerings to the Three Sages, deluding the Three Sages, encroaching upon the Three Sages, wasting and damaging the possessions of the Three Sages.\n\nThey disparage scriptures and repentance texts, debate their authenticity, recklessly discuss gains and losses, obstinately argue right and wrong, distinguish shallow and deep, and collectively criticize strengths and weaknesses. Their appearance is unclean, their clothing is unclean, their hands and feet are unclean, their sandals are unclean, their breath is unclean.",

Some lie down while listening to the great virtuous masters expound the Three Caverns’ Mahayana scriptures. Some, reeking of wine, meat, and pungent foods, ride in carriages or on horses straight into the sanctuary, approaching the Heavenly Worthy to read or recite scriptures and repentance texts. Some, upon seeing others observe fasts and receive precepts, refuse to believe or follow, dismissing them as hypocritical. Some bring men and women together into the sanctuary to listen to the Dharma and sutras, speaking loudly and disrupting the assembly. Some, when speaking or forming intentions, first debate right and wrong, comparing merits and virtues. Some rely on the Three Treasures to cunningly seek wealth. Some misuse the Dharma teachings to deceive men and women. Some embezzle the wealth of the Three Treasures to sustain themselves. Some threaten or coerce monastics, seeking their faults to extort their possessions and support their families. Some carry scriptures and images into the marketplace to preach. Some, while traveling, falsely claim merit to gather wealth for themselves. Some pawn scriptures and images, lending them for profit to provide for their kin. Some, when expounding the Dharma from high seats, take the offerings for their own use. Some, without studying the scriptures, precepts, talismans, or ritual texts, set themselves up as masters, accepting offerings. Some indiscriminately recruit disciples, not selecting the worthy, and transmit the scriptures and Dharma, leaking true secrets. Some, without following the regulations, receive teachings from masters, acting on their own whims to alter or augment the scriptures and Dharma. Some expose sacred images to dust and filth, damaging the permanent abode. Some let halls and temples collapse, defiling the scriptures and Dharma. Some destroy banners, lamps, and merit offerings, disrespecting the radiant countenances. Some steal precious scriptures, treating them like common texts. Some privately copy them without care, mixing them with mundane books, showing no reverence. Some place beds and pillows where they sleep beside them. Some, in their chambers, leave foul and disorderly messes, handling pungent foods while reciting true scriptures. Some betray the Dao and their masters, violating their vows.\n\nAll such intentions and mental formations transgress the bright statutes and violate the precepts. These offenses are measureless and boundless. If one commits even the slightest act of irreverence or disbelief, in this life their family will be incomplete, their departed kin will suffer, and they themselves will receive the karmic retribution of leprosy. Upon death, they will fall into the Nine Dark Hells, enduring ten thousand kalpas before rebirth, where they will take the form of wild beasts.\n\nThen, the Compassionate Worthy, for the sake of those yet to awaken, spoke these verses:\n\nBorn into the world without reverence,\nDefiling the true forms of the Dao.\nThe lofty sages and immortal perfected,\nSpirit persons and divine beings,\nJade lads and jade maidens,\nVajra guardians and mighty warriors,\nAttendant protective deities—\nAll such sacred forms,\nIf damaged or treated with contempt,\nDefiled and disrespected,\nSlandering monastics,\nSpeaking without propriety,\nStriking, scolding, oppressing, or neglecting,\nCommitting lewd acts or mocking,\nArrogant and scornful,\nDebating the scriptures and Dharma,\nForcibly arguing right and wrong,\nBreaking fasts and precepts,\nStealing the wealth of the Three Treasures,\nAll manner of irreverence—\nUpon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells,\nEnduring the eighteen realms of suffering.\nTheir feet tread upon mountains of knives,\nTheir hands grasp trees of swords.\nNaked, they embrace bronze pillars,\nTheir bare bodies lie upon iron beds.\nFire mountains rest upon their heads,\nIron rods press upon their backs.\nHungry, they eat burning coals;\nThirsty, they drink molten bronze.\nBoiling cauldrons seethe and scald,\nFire chariots burn their bodies.\nPounded by pestles, ground by mills,\nHung upside down or stood on their heads,\nSawn apart, sliced by blades,\nNeedles pierce their limbs and joints.\nNarrow gorges crush their bodies,\nFrigid ice severs their sinews and bones.\nScorching embers chase them east and west,\nLeaping and stumbling without rest.\nAbiding in foul and stinking places,\nDrowning in dark and turbid waters,\nPoured into the four rivers,\nEvil birds peck out their eyes.\nBronze dogs bite and tear,\nPoisonous snakes compete to devour.\nOx-headed demons break their spines,\nDying and reviving ten thousand times a day.\nUnbearable pain—\nIn life, they suffer leprosy.\nToday, the great assembly in this sanctuary,\nHearing these verses as the scriptures describe,\nShould deeply reflect in alarm and sorrow.\nHow can one awaken to such karmic causes?\nIf such sins are committed, retribution is inescapable;\nWhen remorse comes, it will be too late.\nEach should diligently advance,\nSincerely repent their transgressions.\nIf, within the six paths, one takes the four forms of birth—\nGreat or small bodies—\nThey devour one another.\nIf retribution has not yet been received,\nNow, with reverence,\nMay all be liberated.\n\nThe repentance master [Name] prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text for the deliverance of the departed. With five limbs touching the ground, wholeheartedly they arise in devotion:\nProstrating to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently bowing to the true sages.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Hearer of Cries Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Mysterious Perfection Ten Thousand Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Cavernous Void Transforming Title Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Boundless Response Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Attaining the Dao Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Constant Joy Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Wondrous Dharma Joy Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Constant Savior of Beings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Unchanging Form Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Dharma Abode Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Mysterious Palace Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Responsive Transformation Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Great Void Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, they bow to the Dao Ocean Heavenly Worthy.",

Unable to practice themselves, they instead create mutual obstructions.\nFor every obstacle or hindrance created, one incurs boundless and immeasurable sins, causing one’s present self to suffer old age, illness, solitude, and unfulfilled wishes, and upon death, to enter the Nine Dark Hells, enduring all sufferings. Only after ten thousand kalpas may one be reborn as a fish or turtle, subjected to human carving and slicing.\nWithout repentance, there is no means of liberation.\n\nAt that time, the Compassionate Venerable, saving all sentient beings, spoke this verse:\n*In past lives, without a good heart,*\n*Obstructing all things.*\n*Speaking dark and deceitful words,*\n*Claiming past wrongs as the path.*\n*Bonds of affection and love,*\n*Greed, attachment, and contempt—*\n*Clinging together in evil,*\n*Upon death, entering the Flowing Sands Hell.*\n*Even if reborn as a human,*\n*One suffers poverty, cold, and solitude.*\n*In this life, enduring long illness,*\n*Good medicine turns to poison.*\n\nToday, in this Dao altar, each member of the assembly directs their mind, hearing this verse, truly filled with sorrow and grief.\nIf one bears such sins of obstruction, when retribution comes, it will be difficult to repent and withdraw.\nNow, we must vow to dissolve and remove these karmic obstacles.\nThe penitent, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, fully prostrating with the five limbs, wholeheartedly making this vow.",

The penitent, so-and-so, collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, arising from clinging views, give rise to anger and resentment. The source of anger and resentment lies solely in the mind. When the mind generates anger and resentment, it is like fire and wind. When wind and fire blaze fiercely, they soon subside of their own accord. Yet these sentient beings, unable to let go, cling to foolish views, giving rise to anger and resentment. Sometimes, from greed and attachment, the six senses are stirred, defiled by the six dusts, and the thought of anger arises. Or they resent the Heavenly Worthies of the great Dao, deeming their words lacking in truth and uprightness, uttering only frivolous speech, ever devoid of faith. Or they resent heaven and earth, cursing the cold and heat, embracing only ignorance, unashamed before the vastness that covers and supports all. Or they resent the sun, moon, and stars, exposing their bodies without shame, unabashed before their illumination, constantly complaining of their slowness or swiftness. Or they resent the scriptures, dismissing them as empty words, failing to study and explore them, often slandering or praising them. Or they resent their parents, neglecting filial duties, utterly lacking in devotion and care, ungrateful for their toil. Or they resent their brothers, lacking the bond of shared roots, treating them as outsiders, their affection no deeper than distant friends. Or they resent their family members, failing to cultivate kindness and gentleness, deficient in respect toward superiors and unrestrained in their treatment of subordinates. Or they resent the precepts and fasts, performing them without reverence, frequently violating them, lacking in sincerity and devotion. Or they resent the ruler, failing to praise the peace of the realm, harboring thoughts of rebellion and murder, not establishing loyalty and goodness. Or they resent those who expound the teachings, refusing to listen to good causes, uttering only harsh words, confounding truth and falsehood. Or they resent the temples and monasteries, failing to revere and support them, engaging in excessive slander, unwilling to contribute to their construction and maintenance. Or they resent the departed, lacking in memorial rites, not creating good causes to aid their journey in the dark realms. Or they resent the divine principles, neglecting sacrifices, instead trusting in heretical shamans, engaging in licentiousness and killing. Or they resent the elderly, failing to show filial piety, devoid of compassion, attributing their condition to karmic retribution. Or they resent the prisons, not examining the circumstances, constantly speaking of hardships, aiding in the addition of shackles and restraints.

you see renunciates,\nOr virtuous ones who revere goodness of heart,\nWho give alms to the poor,\nOr prisoners and wayfarers,\nWho tread upon the orphaned and exposed,\nThe sick and the fatherless—\nYet still, some men and women\nMay conceive anger and resentment.\nLike wood giving birth to fire,\nFire arises naturally in return.\nOnly by relinquishing clinging views\nAnd awakening to the impermanent Dao\ncan this be overcome.\n\nThereupon, the Merciful Honored One spoke again:\nIf sentient beings commit even a single act of anger or resentment,\nIn this life they will suffer from wind and perverse illnesses.\nAt death, they enter the Eight Cold and Eight Hot Hells,\nThen pass through the Needle-Peak Hell,\nWhere only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn—\nTheir bodies as frogs, toads, or *hóu* fish.\nEven if they return to the human realm,\nThey remain dull-witted, clumsy, and malevolent.\nWithout repentance, they sink forever into darkness.\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One, mindful of those yet unawakened,\nproclaimed these verses once more:\n\nIn this world, many harbor anger,\nEver nursing minds of poison and harm.\nTheir thoughts ever constricted,\nThey rage at men, they rage at women,\nAt livestock and servants—\nSuch bodies, seared by sorrow.\nWielding knives or clubs,\nThey seek only to harm.\nFuming with resentment,\nNever knowing even brief joy.\nAt death, they enter the cold and hot hells,\nWhere needles pierce their bodies,\nThrough heart and liver,\nThrough intestines and flanks.\nBlood flows without measure.\nLater, they are reborn as frogs,\nOr mute in the moon’s light,\nOr as *hóu* fish.\nFloating in anger upon the water,\nHawks and kites descend to seize them,\nTearing and devouring their flesh.\nEven if reborn among humans,\nThey suffer the retribution of dullness,\nEver ugly and awkward,\nTheir words lacking skill,\nTheir speech offending others,\nNo one to show them pity.\n\nToday, in this grand assembly,\nAs the scriptures declare,\nAll should reflect deeply:\nThose who bear such sins\nWill endure retribution most profound.\nNow, in repentance,\nMay all attain liberation together.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence,\nOffering this text of repentance for peace and deliverance.\nWith five limbs touching the earth,\nAttending with single-minded

Toward others, they act with stinginess and contempt, refusing to perform good deeds or make offerings. They torment themselves with accumulation, burdened by worry and vexation. They wish wealth for themselves and poverty for others. When their bodies perish, they are like a boat without oars, like a cart without wheels—only evil deeds remain, with no goodness to record. Thus, the karmic causes lead them to fall into the evil destinies.\n\nThereupon, the Compassionate Venerable One, moved by pity for all beings, spoke this verse:\n\nIf in past lives one was stingy and greedy,\nclinging and miserly without cease,\namassing wealth like mountains and peaks,\nyet the heart ever craves as if to swallow rivers and seas.\nNever content, even in places of fasting and precepts,\nin making images or copying scriptures,\nin constructing monasteries and halls,\nor in burning incense and lighting lamps—\nwherever merit is made,\nnot a single hair’s worth is offered,\nyet still seeking benefits through contrivance.\nAt death, they enter the Hell of Cold Ice,\nwhere their bodies are frozen and shattered,\nevery joint broken and destroyed.\nIn later lives, they dwell among border tribes,\nor become a household dog,\nguarding without rest,\nfierce and despised by all.\nOnly after ten thousand kalpas do they receive rebirth,\nyet as humans, they are incomplete:\nhands withered or feet lame,\neyes blind or ears deaf,\nnoses crooked or mouths askew,\nchests protruding or spines bent.\nTheir forms are hideous and misshapen,\nnowhere met with pity.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, having heard these words of scripture, are filled with dread. If such sins exist, they will bear retribution in future lives. Now, with earnest devotion, they wish to cleanse past transgressions. May all beings—whether in hell, as hungry ghosts, or as animals—suffering from such karmic retribution, through the power of this repentance ritual, the power of the Great Dao, and the power of merit, all attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], from limitless kalpas past to the present kalpa, in this life and this day, along with teachers, parents, their own person, and all kin—whether in this life or past lives, the living and the deceased—has committed boundless and immeasurable sins of stinginess and greed, never having purified them, nor even been aware of them. Today, prostrating for peace and in memorial, they recite this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, listening with single-minded sincerity.\n\nThey bow their heads to the Compassionate Venerable One, reverently paying homage to the true sages.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Hearer of Cries Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Numinous Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Golden Mirror Wondrous Countenance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Precept-Born Prolonging Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Boundless True Image Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Omnipresent Verifying Fruition Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Ever-Aiding Universal Salvation Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Naturally Empty and Still Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Expedient Causes and Effects Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Multitudinous Wondrous Compassionate Light Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jeweled Cause Dharma Ocean Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the True Constancy Delivering Life Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Hundred Million Majestic Names Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Protector of the Nation Eternal Peace Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Wisdom Eye Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Vast Propagator of the Teaching Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Expedient Wisdom Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Turning Dharma Wheel Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jeweled Forest Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Empowering the Dao Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great One Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Prolonging Life Preserving Destiny Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Carefree and Joyous Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Wish-Fulfilling Rebirth Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Merit Ocean Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Vast Faith Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Wondrous Virtue Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Compassion Saving from Suffering Perfected Person.\nWith devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Great Compassion Removing Sins Perfected Person.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this ritual and the great assembly, gazing toward the southwest, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Persons, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected Persons, the Youth Saving from Suffering, the Youth of Supreme Wisdom, the Youth Attending to Medicine—manifesting throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless and mysterious realms, appearing as all true sages.

      "translated_text": "**First Prostration**\nRecitation of the Chapter on Almsgiving, the Fourth\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of withholding almsgiving.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], awakening to understanding, bows deeply and kneels in earnest, receiving the scripture’s words: All beings, while embodied in this world, indulge in insatiable desire, ever greedy throughout the day—when do they ever relinquish? Forsake?\n\nTheir kin fill the chambers, gold and jade overflow the halls, yet their hearts remain unsatisfied, still harboring stinginess and attachment. They do not cherish beneficence, but fix their thoughts on miserliness and avarice.\n\nYet almsgiving yields boundless merit, benefiting all in ways beyond conception. There are three kinds of almsgiving: the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, and the almsgiving of wealth.\n\nThe almsgiving of the Dao entails constantly sharing one’s teachings—the scriptures and doctrines of the Three Caverns—with skillful means. Whether provisional or ultimate, expansive or concise, they guide beings to enter the One Vehicle, forever severing the bonds of attachment and ascending to the realm of eternal bliss. From kalpa to kalpa, the Wheel of the Dao turns unceasingly. Past and future alike remain unwavering, without regret. This is the foremost, beyond all conception.\n\nThe almsgiving of the body means offering one’s own life to rescue and relieve all beings from illness, water and fire, blades and weapons, and countless calamities—all receive shelter and protection. Through expedient means, one spares neither body nor life. Seeing all the starving as if suffering one’s own hunger, seeing all the freezing as if enduring one’s own cold. Even to the point of offering one’s own labor to replace another’s peril, without reservation. Or serving the Dharma-bodies of those who have left the household, attending to their needs—gathering herbs in the mountains, running errands at their side, constructing and repairing temples, sweeping halls, planting orchards, performing all meritorious deeds. Digging wells by the roadside, repairing bridges and paths, never shirking toil, only striving with wholehearted devotion. The merit is towering, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe almsgiving of wealth has two forms. The first is inner wealth: one’s body, limbs, the hundred bones and nine orifices, skin and nails—exerting all effort to save and deliver, sparing nothing, offering it to others. The second is outer wealth: money, land, cities, and estates; wives, children, servants, and slaves; oxen and horses; gold, silver, pearls, and jade; silks and brocades; toys and adornments—all scattered and given freely, unattached in the heart.\n\nThere are also nine kinds of almsgiving, each distinct, yet all yielding benefit according to the intention behind them:\n1. Almsgiving to the true, responsive, and transformed images of those who have entered the Dao;\n2. Almsgiving to the Mahāyāna scriptures and teachings;\n3. Almsgiving to the sacred forms of immortals and perfected beings;\n4. Almsgiving to the numinous temples, monasteries, halls, pavilions, chambers, and cloisters of the Mysterious Altar;\n5. Almsgiving to the Dharma-bodies of male and female renunciates—black caps and yellow robes, all monastic garments and implements—ensuring their offerings are never lacking;\n6. Almsgiving to the permanent endowments: incense, oil, lamps, candles, estates, and servants;\n7. Almsgiving to bells, chimes, banners, flowers, canopies, seats, and all ritual implements;\n8. Almsgiving of vegetarian meals—rice, flour, oil, and incense—to the Dharma-bodies of renunciates and those who uphold the precepts, observe fasts, and diligently cultivate the Dao;\n9. Almsgiving to the poor, orphaned, widowed, sick, imprisoned, and all in peril or suffering.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One declares: The merit of these various forms of almsgiving is beyond conception. Moreover, why were the people of antiquity free from disasters? The Merciful Honored One says: The people of antiquity were simple and sincere at heart, embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue. They were neither greedy nor desirous. Later ages grew shallow and frivolous; people became deceitful, seeking only wealth, unaware of karmic conditions. They valued possessions over life, leading to the ruin of families and nations. Within, they harbored myriad evils; without, they forged alliances with the violent and reckless. Enmity and hatred followed one after another, with no means of awakening. Thus, the Dharma-gate of almsgiving was established to encourage generosity.\n\nYet today’s fourfold assembly clings to wealth and does not value life. To relinquish their wealth is as if relinquishing their very lives—hence the saying, “life and wealth.” If one can practice almsgiving, then:\n- No inner thieves arise,\n- No outer thieves appear,\n- Inner and outer are at peace,\n- All suffering is dispelled.\n\nThrough almsgiving today, stinginess and avarice are shattered. The transformative power of the sages reaches unseen realms, and blessings are received according to one’s merit.\n\nIf beings do not practice the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, the almsgiving of inner wealth, the almsgiving of outer wealth, or the nine kinds of almsgiving—\n- Seeing vegetarian feasts prepared, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing those who uphold the precepts and cultivate practice, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the true scriptures expounded, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the Dharma-bodies of renunciates suffering cold, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing lamps lit in offering, they refuse to add to the almsgiving;\n- Seeing incense burned and lamps extinguished in places of offering, they refuse to replenish the almsgiving;\n- Seeing banners and images in the Dao altar insufficient, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing ancient sacred sites damaged, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the halls and temples of numinous monasteries in disrepair, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the cases and covers of the Great Treasury of Scriptures incomplete, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the implements of offering not conforming to the Dharma, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the recitation of hymns and praises in the ritual processions, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the permanent endowments insufficient, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing the sounds of bells and chimes not harmonious, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing construction unfinished, they refuse to give;\n- Seeing prisoners, the poor, the elderly, the sick, the meritorious, or the fields of blessing, they refuse to give.\n\nOr they do not give with expedient means, with compassion, with persuasion, with teaching, with reduction, with a good heart, with clear instruction, with skillful methods or partial teachings, with impartiality, with loyalty and filial piety, with good intentions, with influence, with medicine or healing arts, or with generosity.\n\nFor all the above, those who refuse to give—even in this life, their families will never know peace.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Two: Repentance for Malicious Speech and Double-Tongued Words**\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled devotees turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words. The repentant one, so-and-so, kneels in humility, collects their thoughts, and listens attentively to the scriptural teachings.\n\nAll sentient beings bear heavy burdens from the karma of speech, and none is graver than the sin of double-tongued words, where cunning eloquence takes precedence. They belittle the humble to flaunt their wit, mock their superiors, and scorn their inferiors; they treat the noble and the kin with arrogance, unmoved by their plight, deeming their own judgments flawless. They indulge in rich flavors, heedless of excess; they crave foul and rank foods, consuming without restraint. Some deceive the worthy and delude the sagely, slander the true and revile the Dao, spread rumors of others’ faults, and boast of their own righteousness. They curse the wind and rain, repeat hearsay as truth, turn existence into nothingness, and refine the coarse into the delicate. They sow discord among the good, praise the foolish, slander one to another, and another to the first—condemning others’ words while justifying their own. They estrange others’ kin, befriend the foolish, turn intimacy into estrangement, and transform affection into enmity. Their words are ornate yet false, their fabrications passed off as truth; their speech strays from meaning, they slander rulers and fathers, disparage teachers and friends, undermine the loyal and good, suppress those superior to themselves, and harm the innocent. Their vanity and deceit know no bounds; their mouths proclaim virtue while their hearts conceal vice. The paths of such transgressions are manifold, and the sins they weave run deep. Face-to-face, they sigh in regret, turning good into evil, constantly gathering omens and false accusations, ever drawn to perverse teachings. They invoke heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits—yet in all their utterances, not a single word is true or upright.\n\nSome commit malicious speech and double-tongued words before the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the scriptures, and the revered masters. Some do so before kings, parents, the virtuous, and the dharma-body. Some before the deities of heaven, the sun, the moon, the void, and the sacred assemblies. Some before all manner of boundaries—wells, stoves, doors, households, and various kin. Some before humans and non-humans alike. Such speech and tongues, scheming in all directions, deceive even the empty void. The roots of these measureless sins all stem from the tongue; even if likened to the sands of the Ganges, they could not be exhausted.\n\nThe slightest infraction—even a hair’s breadth—brings a distinct retribution: in this life, a twisted mouth, a paralyzed tongue, muteness, a blocked nose. In death, they fall into the Molten Copper Hell, where only after ten thousand kalpas do they reemerge, reborn as venomous creatures—centipedes, snakes, and vipers. If they do not repent, how can these sins be extinguished?\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One, moved by their unawakened state, spoke in verse:\n\n*In past lives, with malicious tongues,*\n*They cursed kin and stranger alike.*\n*Unmindful of good or evil words,*\n*They spoke whatever came to mouth.*\n*They called to heaven and cried to earth,*\n*Summoned ghosts and dragged along spirits.*\n*Even the Three Treasures, heaven and earth,*\n*The sun, moon, and stars—none were spared.*\n*Over wells and stoves, flowing waters,*\n*At doorways and crossroads,*\n*Beneath shrines, forests, and mountains,*\n*They cursed the loyal and good.*\n*Regardless of rank or station,*\n*Parents, flesh and blood,*\n*Servants, slaves, and attendants—*\n*Wherever they dwelt, poisonous words followed.*\n*In death, molten copper was poured,*\n*Their bodies wreathed in smoke.*\n*Later, reborn as wasps and centipedes,*\n*Their mouths sought to harm all things.*\n*Or as clams and mussels,*\n*Buried in sand and mud,*\n*Retreating into their shells at will.*\n*Even if reborn as humans,*\n*They would still be mute and stammering.*\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled, as the scriptures declare, have committed the offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—retribution knows no error, and none of us can escape. If these sins remain, what fate awaits us in days to come? Thus, we cycle endlessly through hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms, our karmic debts unceasing.\n\nNow, I prostrate in repentance, beseeching the Dao with sorrow, praying that the Dharma’s grace may universally dissolve these bonds. May the repentant one, so-and-so, kneeling in devotion, recite this repentance text for peace and to honor the departed, prostrating with utmost sincerity, listening with a single mind.\n\nI bow my head to the Merciful Honored One, reverently saluting the true and sacred.\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity, Bestower of Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Answers Cries and Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Treasures and Radiant Light.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestations.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Constantly Saves and Delivers.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Purity and Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Karmic Conditions.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects the Nation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Delivers Beings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Compassion.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Intent.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pacifies the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Heaven and Earth.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delights in the Land.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Beings’ Hearts.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Fulfills All Realms.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Broadly Dissolves Disasters.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Gives Life to Myriad Things.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Supreme Unity, Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Nation Protection.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of the Dharma-Body, Natural Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Mysterious Emptiness and Supreme Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions. With sincere devotion, may they broadly open the path of deliverance.\n\nMay the repentant one, so-and-so, their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants, both the living and the deceased, and all their kin—who have committed the above offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—through this act of repentance, have their sins extinguished.",

in dark prisons,\ndrowned in the river of craving,\nwith no hope of escape,\nforever sunk in suffering.\n\nFrom the distant past until now,\nthrough the cycles of birth and death over kalpas,\nthe bones accumulated by their bodies would form great mountains,\nthe mother’s milk they have drunk would equal the waters of the four great seas,\nand the blood they have shed would surpass even

there is birth; with the end of craving, there is extinction.\nIt is known that birth and death arise from lustful desire.\nThe sin of lustful desire causes sentient beings to fall into hell,\nto receive the bodies of hungry ghosts.\nIf reborn as animals, they take the forms of doves, sparrows, owls, and other birds.\nSuch beings may entertain lustful thoughts\nbefore the scriptures, Dharma masters, or in sacred halls and numinous observatories of the Heavenly Worthy,\nor in pure places, divine temples, or near sacred sites.\nThey may violate the chaste,\nseize and harm others,\nseparate mother and child,\ntake away another’s sons and daughters,\ndisrupt bonds of affection,\nsever ties of love,\nshowing no regard for the virtuous.\nThey may expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries,\nor in thought and mind defile the Dharma bodies of male and female renunciates.\nOr they may engage in impure acts with the five kinds of persons.\nAll such beings who direct unwholesome thoughts toward the Dharma bodies of renunciates\nare like those who burn and destroy sacred images and palaces—\nupon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu,\nnever to be reborn for

Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:\n\nIn past lives, they engaged in illicit lust,\nrecklessly and without restraint.\nThey violated the wives and concubines of others,\nseparating them from their kin.\nThe six relations were all involved,\nas were the bodies of renunciates.\nEven among the six kinds of animals,\nthey made no distinction between good and evil.\nIn pure places,\nwithin sacred halls and numinous observatories,\nbefore scriptures or near images,\nthey exposed themselves beneath heaven and earth,\nunder the sun, moon, and stars,\nshowing no regard for ghosts and spirits.\nBy

      "translated_text": "May the power of this Daoist sanctuary, the power of chanting praises, and the power of self-transformation enable the repentant one, [Name], along with their birth parents, extended kin, uncles, brothers, personal relatives, and all living and deceased across two generations—should any bear the karmic burden of lust and desire as described above—to now sincerely prostrate, repent, and cleanse their transgressions. From this day forward, may they perceive form as emptiness, sever karmic retribution, and refrain from further transgression. May they cherish the body as a treasure, guard conduct as a pearl, encounter no obstacles, and enter the shore of non-action, ascending together to the fruition of the Dao.\n\n**First Prostration**\n**Chapter Four: Distant Aversion and Attachment**\n\nToday, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, each directing their minds, face the Merciful Honored Ones and repent the sins of aversion and attachment between self and others. The repentant one, [Name], gathers their heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, when first setting intention, are often foolish, their actions seldom sincere. Attachment accumulates like mountains, yet they claim it is never enough. Aversion discards as if filth, yet they resent not having cast it away entirely. Thus, their minds fail to awaken and comprehend, distinguishing self from others, judging strength and weakness. Words and deeds diverge, entangled in worldly nets, indulging in obstinate folly. They gaze without satiety, listen without discernment, yielding to greed and delusion, forsaking tranquility and harmony. What pleases the eye, they stare at without ceasing; what pleases the ear, they listen to without tiring. They speak only of others’ faults to extol their own virtues. When the mind is pleased, they overlook ugliness; when words are affectionate, they disregard closeness or distance.\n\nThus, sentient beings may harbor aversion or attachment before the seats of true and sacred beings, or before kings, parents, or revered teachers. They may conceive such thoughts before uncles, brothers, men, or women, or before the heavens, earth, sun, moon, or the boundless void. They may foster such desires at sacred sites or before divine altars. These immeasurable, boundless sins of aversion and attachment between self and others—should one commit even a single instance or kind—lead to rebirth in the hells of manifold suffering, with no hope of escape. Even if reborn, they shall assume non-human forms. Without repentance and liberation, they shall forever sink in suffering.\n\nThen the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:\n\nAversion and attachment arise from self and other,\nSelf-generated, singular in intent.\nWhat was deemed evil now seems good,\nAversion lengthens, attachment shortens.\nThose despised are cut off in form and shadow,\nYet still the foolish heart is not sated.\nThose loved stand like mountains,\nYet still they claim it is never enough.\nAll things share a single body,\nYet distinctions of beauty and ugliness arise.\nSelf and other emerge from the mind,\nGood and evil all stem from nature.\nUpon death, they enter the great hells,\nEnduring every torment and poison.\nBlades pierce the heart,\nIron awls tear the tongue.\nA hundred joints are nailed with iron,\nLater reborn as geese or ducks,\nOr as fish and turtles,\nSlaughtered, unable to speak.\nAt the mercy of others’ lives and deaths,\nSubject to every manner of cooking and preparation.\nLater, reborn as humans,\nThey become the mute, deaf, or dumb.\n\nToday, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, as the scripture declares, are filled with sorrow. If such sins are committed, how can their retribution be endured? Moreover, the repentant one, [Name], along with their nine generations of ancestors, parents, revered teachers, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all kin—from limitless and beginningless kalpas to this very life and day, through countless rebirths—have harbored these sins of aversion and attachment between self and others, never awakening. Now, establishing this Daoist sanctuary for peace and offering this repentance, they prostrate with five limbs to the earth, wholeheartedly invoking:\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Through Sound.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Western Numinous Forest Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Discipline-Generated True Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Emptiness and Great Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of All-Pervading Great Movement.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings and Radiant Brilliance.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Essence and Celestial Sovereignty.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms the Dao Through Myriad Movements.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Illumination Through the Dao’s Movement.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accords with the World.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Splendor and True Sovereignty.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Transformations in the Golden Palace.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Orthodox Dao and Non-Action.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy and Dharma King of Penetrating Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Clarities’ Purple Palaces.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Dao’s Illumination and Accomplishment.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Countenance and Radiant Light.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Compassion Who Eradicates Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Lights’ Turning Wheel.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Virtue and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Longevity.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Protects the Realm.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Ocean of Merit and Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of True Stability and Radiance.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Radiant and Wondrous Sound.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.\nWith devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.\n\nToday, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless void and hidden or revealed in all realms. May they bestow their benevolent power, enabling the repentant one, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, and all living and deceased relatives to beseech liberation from the aforementioned karmic offenses.

The repentant one, [Name], collects their mind, kneels in reverence, and surrenders body and soul, heeding the scriptural words: all sentient beings, lacking integrity, must not take even a blade of grass or a single leaf without just cause—how much less may they steal. Yet beings, deluded by present gain, seize what is not theirs through manifold unjust means.\n\nSome breach walls or dig through barriers, waylay travelers, or plunder by force. Some default on debts, break contracts, or deceive with words and heart. Some take what is not theirs, reasoning none will know—yet the heavenly net is vast; where can they escape? Some steal from the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptures, dharma treasures, or ritual implements. Some take offerings meant for perfected sages, or the sacred tools of worship. Some plunder the three-tiered altars, the treasures of the numinous halls, or the vessels of fasting assemblies. Some steal from the materials used to sculpt sacred images, or the alms of the faithful who uphold precepts. Some take the seven treasures donated to the Three Treasures, or the jewels of jeweled thrones, jeweled canopies, jeweled chariots, jeweled banners, jeweled crowns, jeweled mirrors, jeweled trees, jeweled flowers, jeweled halls, jeweled steeds, or the sacred robes and cloud-patterned vestments. Some steal from the jeweled repositories of scriptures, the treasures of jeweled halls, or the jeweled caskets and relics. Some take the possessions of exalted perfected ones, or the oil and incense meant for lamps and offerings. Some plunder the common stores of the assembly, the tribute granaries of the state, or the precious treasures of immortals, jade maidens, vajra guardian kings, or celestial lions. Some steal from the dharma-bodies of male or female officials, or the fruits and vegetables of the Three Sages’ blessed lands. Some take sacrificial animals from spirit temples, or precious substances like giant clams, agate, lapis lazuli, amber, gold, silver, pearls, jade, copper, iron, silk, brocade, or fine linen. Even a single coin, a single thread—whether little or much—all incur grave transgression.\n\nSome break into storehouses, pick locks, alter seals, or tamper with labels and caskets. Some hoard military supplies, evade taxes, or withhold even a fraction of what is due, seeking only personal gain. Some steal the vestments or ritual implements entrusted to dharma masters, or the fresh offerings not yet presented to the spirits. Some take from loving parents, siblings, friends, or neighbors; from travelers’ luggage; from the destitute, the aged, or the infirm. Some seize goods meant for trade, the seeds and livestock of farmers, or take by deceit, coercion, or force. Some claim public authority, or take through neglect, fraud, or jest. Some take by force, subterfuge, or false pretenses; by greed, unreturned loans, or barter; by refusal to repay, by deception, or by hiding the truth. Some beg with false humility or demand with threats. All such crooked acts incur fault and blame.\n\nIf it is not one’s own, even a hair’s weight must not be coveted—all such taking is theft. Even lost items found on the road, carried by wind or birds, delivered by spirits or gods—clothing, bedding, utensils, carriages, horses, cloth, grain, or the tiniest speck—if concealed, become the karmic offense of theft. This shortens one’s lifespan, brings misfortune to nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, and offers no escape. In life, one suffers illness; in death, one falls into hell. Even if reborn, one becomes an ox or beast of burden. Without repentance, one remains forever sunk in suffering.\n\nThus, the Merciful Honored One spoke these verses:\n\n*In past lives, they stole and plundered,*\n*Taking the Three Treasures’ wealth.*\n*Alms given in faith, offerings made in devotion,*\n*Or the possessions of kings and people—*\n*None of it theirs, yet at the sight,*\n*They harbored thieving hearts,*\n*Always scheming to steal.*\n*They robbed travelers by force,*\n*Threatened, coerced, or framed the innocent.*\n*They tunneled through walls, plundered by night,*\n*Or lurked in empty places,*\n*Seizing cattle, servants, slaves,*\n*Wealth, jewels, and treasures—*\n*All by cunning means.*\n*In death, they enter the hell of fire-carts,*\n*Their bodies scorched and shattered.*\n*In later lives, they become oxen or horses,*\n*Repaying their debts to others.*\n*Yoked, their flesh and fat are torn away,*\n*Nostrils and mouths ripped apart.*\n*Hungry and thirsty, they suffer endlessly,*\n*Unable to speak.*\n*At others’ mercy, they are slaughtered,*\n*Only to be reborn as humans—*\n*Then robbed and killed in turn,*\n*Repaying the sins of past lives.*\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary must reflect deeply on these scriptural words, which inspire true dread. With utmost sincerity, they must bow in repentance, seek mercy, and pray that all beings—whether already suffering retribution or yet to face it—may, through this act of repentance, attain universal liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing themselves to the ground with utmost devotion. Bowing their head to the Merciful Honored One, they reverently pay homage to the sacred beings:\n\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at a Cry.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Equal and Vast Compassion.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Abides in the World and Delivers Beings.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Manifestations.\nWith sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends All Karmic Bonds.",

      "translated_text": "The Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Compassion Daoist Ritual Arena for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms Concludes\nThe Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Compassion Daoist Ritual Arena for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms\n\nCompiled by Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan\n\nFirst Repentance: On the Killing of Living Beings\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual arena, all present turn their minds toward the Compassionate Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of killing living beings.\n\nThe repentant master, [Name], gathers his mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll sentient beings, so long as they dwell within the human realm, remain entangled in the web of the world. Having never encountered a virtuous friend and constantly associating with the foolish, they accumulate habits that become deeply ingrained. Like the mingling of fragrant and foul, they are stained by manifold transgressions. They give free rein to reckless cruelty, perpetrating suffering without cause, never awakening a heart of compassion. They kill living beings, devouring flesh and bone.\n\nAt times, for the sake of parents, themselves, brothers, wives, children, or extended kin, they gather in villages and hamlets, slaughtering countless beings without a thought for their lives.\n\nThey kill cattle, sheep, mules, horses, pigs, dogs, and other domesticated creatures, those raised and fed by humans. They boil and butcher deer, foxes, rabbits, tigers, leopards, and wolves—those dwelling in mountains and forests—slaughtering the six kinds of livestock without a moment’s hesitation, heedless of whether they are fat or lean.\n\nSome pierce with blades until blood flows; others scald until skin peels away. Though life has yet to depart, their bellies are slit open, bones removed, sinews stripped, intestines torn out, and flesh carved away. The agony they endure is beyond measure, and the karmic retribution they incur is impossible to repay.\n\nThey kill sacred birds—phoenixes, cranes, geese, ducks, turtledoves, pigeons, crows, magpies, owls, and kites—along with all manner of flying creatures. They stretch tall nets, raise long poles with sticky paste, pluck feathers and singe wings, or maim them in treetops. Desperate for death yet unable to die, longing for life yet denied it, they sever their feet, remove their heads, cut off their wings, gouge out their eyes, all to fill the kitchen and sate their hunger.\n\nThey kill soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, snails, clams, crabs, and other armored creatures. They drain rivers and dig trenches, set bamboo traps and scatter sand, cast nets and weirs, or use baskets to ensnare scales and fins. They boil and butcher them on islands, piling bones into mountains, their stench carried on the wind. Though they have taken countless lives, their desire remains unquenched.\n\nThey kill snakes, vipers, scorpions, bees, wasps, dung beetles, midges, centipedes, locusts, ants, and all manner of crawling things. They kill mosquitoes, horseflies, lice, fleas, mayflies, moths, and other creatures born of transformation—every wriggling, flying, or submerged being.\n\nThough these may be venomous creatures, they too seek peace. They thrive in heat and dampness, perish in cold and ice, all partaking in the transformations of creation, never entering the kitchen. To kill them without cause—how can such suffering be endured?\n\nThey fly hawks and hunt with dogs, draw bows and nock arrows, their hearts stirred by greed and savagery, knowing only the taking of life. They set mountains ablaze, drain forests and rivers dry. They wield arrows and blades, grasp spears and halberds, killing living beings. They crush with hands, trample with feet, press down while sitting or lying, killing living beings. They till fields and plant crops, build walls and erect barriers, killing living beings. They construct houses, dig pits, and excavate earth, killing living beings. They dismantle fences, clear grass, and level ground, killing living beings. They gather firewood, fell trees, pluck flowers, and pull up grass, killing living beings. They light lamps and raise candles, killing living beings. They divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings. They wash their hair, bathe their bodies, drink water, and eat meals, killing living beings. They thresh grain and husk wheat, split open wombs and crush eggs, killing living beings. They swat ropes, fan away mosquitoes, open their mouths, close their eyes, raise their hands, or stamp their feet, killing living beings. They kill before sacred images, scriptures, or in the presence of the Dharma; they carry creatures home from the ritual arena to slaughter. In anger or frustration, without cause, they kill living beings. In joy or revelry, indulging their desires, they kill living beings. They slaughter for sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, or for the sick, seeking to avert unseen misfortune. They prepare medicinal decoctions using living creatures, killing them. Some die in their hands, others perish on the butcher’s block, roasted in raging fires, their lineages severed, their reproduction halted, their life roots destroyed, utterly annihilated.\n\nThey kill creditors, enemies, or good people from the four directions. They abort fetuses and crush eggs, not sparing even birds and beasts. They kill out of fear, out of dread, by their own hand, or by instructing others. They kill through cursing, poisoning, or drugging. They kill through spells, anger, or joy. They kill deliberately, accidentally, with words, hands, intent, thoughts, glances, or in combat.\n\nIn all such acts of killing, with every movement of hand or body, they cruelly harm all manner of creatures. Each bears its own sin, and none can escape retribution.\n\nThus speaks the Compassionate Honored One:\nHe who amasses boundless wealth will surely bring suffering upon himself;\nHe who accumulates excess sin will repay his past debts.\nWithout remorse, without a heart to save, he remains mired in delusion.\nCalamity flows to his ancestors, and upon death, he enters the hells of interrogation and punishment, enduring every torment.\nEven if he is reborn, his form will be that of a different species.\nWithout repentance, how can he transcend this fate?\n\nThen the Compassionate Honored One proclaimed again in lamentation:\nIn past lives, you killed living beings—\nCattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs,\nGeese, ducks, pheasants, rabbits,\nDeer, tigers, leopards, and their kin,\nOwls, crows, swallows, sparrows,\nJackals, wolves, foxes, raccoon dogs,\nMules, donkeys, horses,\nFish, turtles, cicadas, maggots,\nSnails, clams, shrimp, mussels,\nDung beetles, ants, and their like,\nLeeches, mosquitoes, fleas, lice,\nCentipedes, midges, and all manner of worms.\nYou slaughtered them all, never awakening a heart of kindness.\nWhoever you encountered, you harmed without mercy,\nAnd upon death, you fell into the hells,\nEnduring every suffering, tormented day and night.\nIn that place of unbearable agony,\nAll those cattle and sheep\nWill come to demand their lives,\nSaying, “You ate my flesh.”\nOr, “You killed my body,”\nClaiming you had no right.\nToday, we meet again—\nYou must repay your past debts.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Three: On Not Violating the Fast**\n\nToday, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled turn their minds as one, bowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of breaking the fast.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], gathers the heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: All sentient beings, from the moment they receive form until this very day, have been bound by stinginess, greed, and craving—drinking wine, eating meat, chewing without restraint, nourishing flesh and blood, fostering pus and decay. Day by day, afflictions and illnesses arise, and the roots of sin grow ever deeper.\n\nMoreover, through birth, aging, sickness, and death, through scorching heat, dampness, cold, and wind, through bitter pain and corrosive suffering, they are assailed by noxious qi, and a hundred diseases invade the body. Thought after thought, impermanence ceaselessly presses on, day and night unrelenting. The bodily form and the knowing nature differ in each, yet all revolve in endless cycles, trapped for ten thousand kalpas without escape.\n\nThese sentient beings, their minds often corrupted, treat the fasts and precepts with irreverence. As the years advance and old age approaches, as sickness and distress entwine them, in this one life, one lifetime, they toil for self-preservation, all because of their voracious consumption of impure foods. Their organs steam and ferment, offending the true and sacred ones. The winds of karma fan their bodies, causing gold and jade to dissolve, their forms to wither prematurely.\n\nYet I, who neither drink nor eat, embrace the Dao in its naturalness, transforming without limit, living forever without death. I constantly expound the scriptures and teachings, seeking to deliver all beings. If, in their ignorance and delusion, they cannot believe or follow, I am ever concerned, never at rest. Thus, I offer the fast as a means to dispel their sickness and suffering.\n\nMoreover, the hosts of the Three Clarities, who long ago realized the truth of the Dao, always observe the fasts with diligence, never growing lax. How much more so the six fasts of the lunar months, the ten days of upright conduct, the eight seasonal nodes, the three primal festivals, the jiazi and benming days, the three assemblies of the gengshen, and all other fasts and gatherings—subtle and wondrous beyond thought—all established by the Merciful Honored One to guide and receive sentient beings, enabling them to cultivate practice and escape the perils of demonic obstacles.\n\nYet you, all you sentient beings, though you know the names of these fasts, do not arouse reverent hearts. And even when you do, you often violate them. Some mix impure foods, blending the foul with the sacred, sharing the same kitchen without purifying themselves, treating all with careless disdain. Others eat after midday, their minds still stained, slandering the utmost truth, equating it with falsehood. Their words are deceitful, their hearts swayed by love and hatred. Such foolishness leads to countless violations of the fast.\n\nSome break the Fast of the Great Perfected, some the Fast of the Golden Register, some the Fast of Divine Incantations, some the Fast of the Yellow Register, some the Fast of Illuminating the True, some the Fast of Spontaneous Perfection, some the Three Primal Fasts, some the Fast of Mud and Ash, some the Fast of the Cavern Spirits—fasts such as these, whether established for the state, for the deliverance of ancestors, for the rescue of the drowning, for the sake of departed kin, or for the benefit of others. At first, they arise with faith and devotion, but later, regret takes hold. Their sins deepen, and they suffer boundless torment.\n\nIf, for the sake of the Dharma-body of ordained men and women, whether ten, a hundred, or even more, the fast is distributed according to its scale, ensuring no partiality, then all who speak of fasting must do so with a giving heart—not with ostentation, nor with meager offerings. Those who are ordained should share equally in the fast. To select or discriminate is to treat it with disdain. To fail to arouse reverence is to break the fast.\n\nFurthermore, if one takes for oneself even a single coin from the offerings of a fast, the construction of images, or any other materials, one must repay tenfold within ten years. If not repaid, the retribution is severe illness, deformity, and eternal banishment from the human realm. They will roost like birds, sleep exposed like beasts. Even if reborn as humans, they will be afflicted by the six chronic illnesses—deaf, blind, and lacking the five senses. If one uses the food of the fast to make offerings to the Dharma-body, or the banners and canopies for venerable images, yet does so without reverence, later growing remorseful, the karmic consequences are beyond description.\n\nWhen life ends, they are reborn as hungry ghosts—necks thin as bowstrings, bellies swollen like drums, bodies burdened by iron wheels, flames scorching them on all sides. To cover themselves with cloth is like touching a mountain of fire. When they eat or drink, it turns to pus and blood. If they suffer this in the present life, they lie bedridden with malignant disease, their bodies festering and foul, shunned by all. For years and months, flesh wastes away, sinews dissolve. Once cast into hell, they will scarcely be reborn in heaven. In future lives, even if born among humans, they will be deaf, blind, and afflicted by the six illnesses, bereft of beauty, inferior to others. All their kin will treat them as outcasts. If they become husband and wife, they will part midway, leaving orphaned sons and widowed daughters to depend on others. Poor, cold, and hungry, their forms will be ugly, barely clinging to human form.\n\nAll such sins arise from breaking the fast. If one does not repent, they will sink ever deeper. Thus, the Merciful Honored One, for the sake of those yet unawakened, speaks these verses:\n\nThose who break the fast in life\nAre reborn as hungry ghosts.\nHungry, they eat raging fire;\nThirsty, they drink molten bronze.\nTheir bodies char and wither,\nTreading the edge of frost and blade.\nDay and night without respite,\nTheir suffering knows no end.\nEven if a time of liberation comes,\nThey are no better than dogs and horses—\nHungry, cold, poor, and lowly,\nHow could they possess full form?\n\nI now extend my compassion,\nMy wisdom boundless through kalpas.\nI establish this great Dharma-bridge\nTo save the foolish and deaf.\nI bow my head to the Supreme Dao,\nRoaming freely in the Palace of the Great Ultimate.\n\nToday, all assembled in this sanctuary, having heard these verses, having heard this scripture, having heard this repentance, all sentient beings who have committed such deeds must undergo retribution. Today, they vow and set their minds to dedicate their merit to the Three Saints, that they may avoid such sins. Whether in the six paths of rebirth or the four modes of birth, whether they have already suffered or have yet to face retribution, all now confess openly, aspiring to attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and in offering to the ancestors, bowing fully to the ground, vowing with a mind of devotion. Bowing to the Merciful Honored One, paying homage to the true and sacred ones.",

Treasure in the northwest, all the venerable ones and sages, all the great divine immortals, all the great heavenly immortals, all the great earthly immortals, all the great water immortals, all the great Perfected, all the great youths, the immortals of the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens, the sages of rivers and ancient sites, all the assemblies of holy ones, all the wondrous forms—the forms of the Perfected, the forms of jade youths, the forms of jade maidens, the Dharmakāya forms—pervading the ten directions, filling the realms of profound emptiness, all the true and sacred ones, with minds of vast deliverance, minds of Dao-power, minds of the Perfected, minds of the youths, may enable the repentant one, [Name], and their nine generations of ancestors across three lifetimes—their past bodies, future bodies, and present bodies—possessing boundless, immeasurable karmic ties, past and present, or transgressions of breaking precepts, to repent today and, by the power of the Dao, attain universal liberation.\n\nFrom this day forward, facing the sacred and the true, with purified minds and bodies, they reverently uphold the precepts, aspiring that the merit and virtue may uplift their nine generations of ancestors, rescue those sunk in suffering, and deliver themselves, all their kin, and all beings of the six paths and four modes of birth, that all may ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\n**First Bow**\n**Chapter Four: Transgressions Against Scriptures and Precepts**\n\nToday, the assembly in this sanctuary, each with focused mind, prostrates in homage to the Merciful Honored One, repenting for transgressions against scriptures and precepts.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], gathers their mind and kneels in earnest, listening attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings possess the three karmas and the six senses. From kalpa to kalpa, in this life and today, they commit theft, sexual misconduct, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, frivolous speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech—boundless, immeasurable transgressions that entangle the body, leaving no means of liberation.\n\nThe scriptures and precepts clearly expound the Dharma gates, varying in number and differing in rank. They admonish and guide beings to diminish karmic roots. Some receive the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Seven Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twelve Acceptable Precepts, Fourteen Precepts for Upholding the Body, Twenty-Four Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, or even the Forty Precepts of the Lower Grade of the Cavernous Mystery, the Sixty Precepts of the Middle Grade, the Eighty-One Precepts of the Upper Grade, the One Hundred Eighty Precepts, or the Three Hundred Precepts of the Upper Clarity for Observing the Body, and the Seven Hundred Twenty Precepts of the Cavernous Spirit. Each has its sequence, guiding the deluded multitude.\n\nThose who uphold the precepts gain boundless, immeasurable blessings; those who do not uphold them incur boundless, immeasurable karmic retribution. Moreover, the scriptures of the Three Caverns circulate among humans. If beings cannot believe and accept them, how much less the precepts? These are the city walls and dwelling houses of beings, where jade youths and jade maidens, vajra spirit-kings, and guardians come to attend and protect, praising on all sides, dispelling calamities, delivering from misfortune, preserving life, and prolonging years. The compassionate light of the true and sacred ones brings joy to all heavens. Thus, blades and weapons, floods and fires, tigers, wolves, insects, and snakes, illnesses, prisons, ghosts, thieves, hunger, cold, and afflictions are forever eradicated. One then obtains sons when seeking sons, daughters when seeking daughters, wealth, nobility, intelligence, and dignified appearance, earning respect among people—benefits beyond conception. In past lives, they are reborn in heavenly palaces and pure lands, amidst flower terraces and jeweled trees, with natural clothing and food, wondrous offerings from celestial kitchens, cloud canopies and dragon chariots, carefree and joyous, constantly hearing the scriptures, standing in attendance to the Merciful Honored One. In future rebirths, they will encounter the true Dao.\n\nAll sentient beings, if they uphold the precepts, are like a precious sword that severs all, like a Dharma boat that ferries all, like a fierce fire that burns all, like pure water that washes all. Those who uphold the precepts guard against wrongdoing, restrain evil, discipline body and mind, subdue demonic foes, and move the numinous and sacred. Yet you, all beings, whether having received them personally or witnessed others receiving them, have failed to revere and believe, constantly harboring arrogance, committing countless transgressions, accumulating slander, treating them as mere play, neglecting to uphold them, acting contrary to their words, writing carelessly, reciting irreverently, altering the text, and deviating from the scriptures.",

Whether in the six paths of rebirth or the four modes of birth, whether they have already suffered or have yet to face retribution, all now confess openly, aspiring to attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and in offering to the ancestors, bowing fully to the ground, vowing with a mind of devotion.

They disdain the sacred words, extol the Great Dao without offering devotion, and neglect their protection with half-hearted care. Some transcribe them with poor paper and ink, binding them shoddily with crooked cords and slanted rollers, staining or losing the text. Others annotate and alter the meanings, their ignorance obstructing the principles, devoid of veneration. Such transgressions, with deep karmic roots, if left unrepented, will forever bar one from the cycles of rebirth.\n\nShould they remain in the world, they will be afflicted by malignant illnesses, their bodies frail and feeble, their breath faint and weak, their speech coarse and clumsy, ignorant of rites and music, unable to discern right from wrong. When their life ends, they will fail to ascend to the Pure Land, their sins plunging them into profound darkness, where suffering ceaselessly torments them. No rebirth awaits them—only relentless trials, each debt repaid in full, enduring agony with groans, their flesh and bones severed by karmic bonds. They will bear the torment of a single body: climbing a thousand-fathom sword-tree, grasping its branches to ascend, only to sink into a cauldron of boiling water, crushed beneath its weight until utterly consumed. Only then may they find respite—all from violating the precepts, born of disbelief.\n\nThus the Compassionate One spoke in verse:\n*Those who transgress scriptures and precepts in life*\n*Shall enter the hell of blades and needles in death.*\n*Pierced on all sides, their bodies endure*\n*Ten thousand pains beyond endurance.*\n*They traverse the blade-mountains, then plunge*\n*Into cauldrons of boiling water.*\n*Death they seek but cannot find—*\n*Only after ten thousand kalpas may they be reborn.*",

They attract filial devotion, treasuring it as a precious jewel.\n\nYet if one is unfilial, generation after generation, within a single household, all become enemies. Though they speak of parents, they treat them as foes, summoning the disobedient to be their children. Parents and siblings keep separate finances and meals, share gardens but divide vegetables, split fields and grain, hide delicacies, and eat in secret. Though in human form, they are worse than birds and beasts. Divine spirits do not protect them; all their deeds in life are inauspicious. Upon death, they enter hell, enduring every suffering. Only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn, as the *bailao* bird, whose young, upon hatching, devour their mother. Only after leaving the nest do they return to the human realm, where the unfilial gather as fathers and sons, harming one another, mutually resentful. No suffering in the world exceeds this.\n\nYet without a father, one would not be born; without a mother, one would not be raised. Thus, heaven and earth cover and nurture, entrusting life to the mother’s body. The two *qi* congeal, and for ten months she carries the child, burdened and heavy, sitting and lying uncomfortably. When the time is full, at the moment of birth, the mother is terrified, her life hanging by a thread. Her heart aches, her spirit grieves, and in an instant, she fears for her life. On the day of delivery, internal and external pains assail her, agony intertwined. She loses her voice in wailing, enduring great torment, trembling in fear, shocked and sighing.\n\nOnce born, the mother rejoices beyond measure, wrapping the child in swaddling clothes. For three months, she lies on her side, ever wary of evil spirits. When hungry, the child needs food—only the mother feeds them. When thirsty, the child needs drink—only the mother nurses them. Calculating the milk she drinks, it amounts to eight *hu* and four *sheng*. For a thousand days, the mother carries the child, washing away dirt and grime, placing them in dry spots while taking the wet, swallowing bitterness and offering sweetness. Without the father, there is no closeness; without the mother, there is no nurturing.\n\nIn the *Kaihuang* kalpa of old, there was a sentient being whose parents were aged, their strength and vitality waning. From dawn to dusk, their child never came to inquire after them. The parents dwelled alone in an empty room, like strangers. They had little clothing and scant food, hunger and cold piercing their bodies. Their hands and feet were stiff, their ears deaf and eyes dim. They slept on a single bed with a thin mat, each day feeling like a year. Their bodies were frail and emaciated, infested with ants and lice. Mosquitoes bit their flesh, and they could not sleep all night, sighing and groaning. Seeing their child’s unfilial conduct, they leaned on a staff to call out, heads bowed and breath subdued, wishing to voice their grievances but unable to finish their words. Their child raised their voice, glaring angrily, and cursed their parents. Turning away, they retreated, leaning on the wall to return home, beating their chest in sorrow, eyes swollen from weeping, crying out in misery, wishing they had died sooner.\n\nThe mother said to her elder son: When you were small, had I not raised you, fed you, and shielded you, you would not have survived. For ten months, I carried you like a heavy burden, my breath panting, more labored than running. At times, I suffered chills and fever, unable to sit or lie comfortably. My belly split, my chest felt full, my hair fell out, and I grew thin, unable to eat. A month before birth, I was constantly anxious, fearing we would not part. On the day of delivery, my life was like a flickering candle. My limbs and veins felt as if cut by knives, my five viscera and six bowels burned like fire. After you were born, joy and fear mingled; the pains and sorrows cannot be fully described. For three years, I carried you day and night, never apart. I endured filth, lost sleep, and missed meals, watching your complexion to tend to your hunger and fullness. If you fell ill, my heart ached for you. Hearing your suffering, I could not eat. My mouth and throat were parched as I sought every blessing. Gold and silver, clothes and toys—I wished for your safety and spared nothing.\n\nI remember when you were small, you followed me everywhere, never leaving my side. You ate when I ate, slept when I slept. A single day without me, and you would not eat all day; a single night without me, and you would cry without sleep. How have you grown to suddenly become my enemy? Now, though I have you, it would be better if I had never borne you. I wish I could die soon and be free of you.\n\nThus, that child truly incurred the grave sin of disobedience and unfilial impiety. Upon death, they entered the Fengdu Hell of the North, enduring every suffering, experiencing all bitterness, dying and being reborn ten thousand times—none of it can be fully recounted.\n\nThen, the Merciful Honored One, for those yet unenlightened, spoke this verse:\n\nGood naturally meets good,\nEvil returns to its evil root.\nIn life, lacking kindness and filial piety,\nIn death, one sinks forever.\nEnduring all sufferings,\nPassing through the eighteen gates.\nIf not on the day of my three pardons,\nOne will never hear of liberation.\nReborn as the *bailao* bird,\nFlesh and bone torn by one’s young.\nWhen the retribution is complete and one returns to the human path,\nOne meets again as child and grandchild.\n\nToday, the great assembly of this ritual arena, hearing these scriptural words, must awaken greatly.",

May they awaken to past transgressions and early realize the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Vowing to Repay the Kindness of Mercy**\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, each member of the great assembly directs their mind and takes refuge in the Merciful Honored One, speaking of the karmic causes and effects of repaying the kindness of mercy. The repentant one, [Name], collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All beings cycle through birth and death, revolving through the dark realms. Now, I radiate great light, penetrating the five directions and ten lands. All suffering beings are delivered, save only those guilty of disobedience, who cannot ascend. Know that the kindness and righteousness of parents is profound and weighty. The boundless heavens cannot be repaid; even grinding one’s bones to powder and carving one’s flesh cannot fully requite it. If one can cultivate steadfast resolve, outwardly practicing filial devotion and nurturing, inwardly harboring vast compassion, then not only one’s own parents, but all beings are one’s parents. All beings are one’s brothers. All beings are one’s sisters. All beings are one’s flesh and blood. All beings are one’s sons and daughters. All beings are those who nurture and raise. All beings are those one loves and protects. Do not harm their lives; do not consume their flesh. Whether in past lives, future lives, or the present life, regard all beings as kin. Through manifold expedient means, this is called repaying kindness. Should any man or woman wish to perform meritorious deeds to repay the kindness of heaven and earth, the sovereign, their teachers, and their birth parents, let them proceed in order: first for heaven and earth, second for the emperor, third for their teachers, fourth for their birth parents, fifth for all beings of the great earth, and sixth for all their own kin. Yet among worldly men and women, from the moment they emerge from their mother’s womb, through one year, ten years, a hundred years, or a hundred and twenty years, they must prepare in advance. Beginning with the first seven-day period, cycling repeatedly, even unto distant years, let the meritorious deeds they perform follow this order: first, commissioning images; second, commissioning scriptures; third, erecting long banners of forty-nine feet, establishing forty-nine Dharma bodies, providing vegetarian feasts, and constructing ritual arenas to invite scriptures and images. Let the Dharma masters’ ritual lamps number forty-nine vessels, or more as their capacity allows. Let lamps be arranged like chariot wheels, burning for three days and nights, seven days and nights, or forty-nine days and nights, dedicated to the sovereign, the emperor, their teachers, Dharma kin, parents, siblings, and all their own kin. With hearts laid bare and utmost sincerity, they pay homage to my invoked titles, repent their own transgressions, pray for blessings and grace, repay the kindness of mercy, offer wholehearted devotion, and extol with praise.",

      "translated_text": "All past transgressions, once repented, must be amended with renewed cultivation. Diligently observe fasts and precepts, turn the heart toward compassion and goodness, and extend almsgiving to the fields of merit—whether to the poor and lowly, the disabled, the sick and solitary elders, prisoners, hungry ghosts, or all sentient beings. Those who lack benevolence should be exhorted to embrace virtuous causes. For travelers from afar in dire need, provide succor, rescue them from peril, and offer clothing and food to ensure their sufficiency. Then, renew the vow to honor parents with filial piety. The wealthy should commission images and copy scriptures to deliver beings from the three wretched destinies and the five sufferings, and to liberate those sunk in the depths of torment. According to their vows, they may attain rebirth—this is the repayment of kindness.\n\nIf any man or woman, through accumulated deeds, has ever slandered the Three Treasures, been disloyal or unfilial, offended the sovereign or ruler, teachers, or parents, or committed the five grave transgressions—such deep and weighty sins that they fear falling into hell at life’s end and suffering myriad torments—let them, for the sake of the sovereign, ruler, teachers, or parents, generate resolve and make vows: transcribe scriptures and repentance texts, even a single line or verse; venerate my invoked titles, one or two or many.

Let none commit the ten evils or grave offenses, and may the sins of nine generations of ancestors, whether already suffered or yet to be, all be extinguished.

Through their unimpeded power, may the repentance master here generate resolve and turn toward all manner of good causes, thereby attaining immeasurable blessings, fulfilling every wish, and accomplishing all aspirations.

May all karmic adversaries from past kalpas, all sins great and small, along with those of their teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, their own kin, and the three generations of affinal relatives—whether from past lives, now liberated, or presently living—be enabled to establish merit and repay virtue.

      "translated_text": "One bow to the third repentance rite: *Dissolving Residual Karmic Obstructions*\n\nToday, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Compassionate Honored One to repent and release the multitude of residual karmic obstructions. The repentance master, with sincere heart and kneeling posture, listens attentively to the scriptural words:\n\nAll beings arise from the primordial qi of the undifferentiated. Through the kindness of parents—carrying, nurturing, breastfeeding—they gradually grow, yet unable to discern, they become entangled in desire, and the roots of transgression flourish. If not for repentance, if not for the expounding of scriptures and precepts, gently guiding them into the right Dao, they would forever remain bound by the ignorance of aversion and attachment, fettered to the mundane world.\n\nParents can only give birth to us; they cannot perfect us. It is our teachers who reveal the scriptures and precepts, enabling us to transcend afflictions. Thus, the kindness of teachers surpasses even that of parents.\n\nYet we see beings who, from the moment they establish themselves in the world, fail to recognize the profound debt owed to their teachers. Instead, they respond with scorn and abuse, withhold what is needed, deny sweet sustenance, refuse clothing and food, treat them as strangers, or even plot harm. Such acts align them with rebellious children, inviting karmic retribution in return.\n\nWe see beings who observe fasts and precepts—some, occupying high positions, humiliate those beneath them; others, relying on wealth and status, oppress the orphaned and impoverished...",

      "translated_text": "Some abuse their power to oppress the lowly and weak; others, holding office, make extortion their intent, inflicting cruel punishments at will, enriching themselves at public expense, and acting against the Dao/Way. They encroach upon the blessed lands of the Three Treasures, occupying their pure sanctuaries. Some commission revered images, transcribe scriptures, or establish sacred observatories, construct refectories, and hold fasts and rituals. Yet as leaders, they steal property, engage in fraudulent trade, or misappropriate the wealth of monastic endowments or donors. They live alongside parents, siblings, and kin, yet in all their dealings, they deceive and rob one another. They shift fences to encroach on others’ land, seize fields and gardens, exploit public authority to seize others’ inns and shops, cheat merchants in trade, use false weights and measures, reduce lengths and widths, conceal fractions of grain, falsify calculations, substitute coarse for fine, exchange short for long, and devise a hundred deceits to gain the slightest profit. They burn others’ homes, falsely implicate the innocent, envy others’ wealth and status, spread slander, and vent rage upon their parents. They lend capital to exact exorbitant interest, indulge in greed and desire, seize others’ property by force, refuse to repay debts, and deny their obligations. They kill without cause, engage in illicit sacrifices, defy public and private authority, file baseless accusations, act with arrogance and rudeness, deceive superiors and betray subordinates. Some strip the belongings of ordained practitioners, desecrate graves to steal coffins, or cast nets and traps to cunningly seize creatures from ponds, pools, rivers, the Huai and Ji, seas and streams, springs, lakes, and waterways. Such karmic offenses are manifold and beyond count. If beings commit even one such transgression, they incur grave retribution, burdening billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, as well as their parents, themselves, and their six relations and nine clans. The deceased and those of past lives suffer misfortune, descending into hell, where each is ground by millstones, enduring retribution for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—if reborn at all, they may not survive infancy, living out their days in solitude. Such karmic conditions are predestined. Today, in this ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the sins and blessings, good and evil of beings return in retribution, seen and heard like a turning wheel, swift as an echo. Let each gather their thoughts and cultivate in accord with the teachings. If years pass in vain, and age and illness press upon you, when body and life perish in a single day, what means remain to escape this sinking into darkness? Through this rite of repentance, may all—those present, past, and yet to incur such karmic offenses—receive the moisture of the Dharma, universally attain liberation, and be freed from bondage.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence, bowing with body, mind, and heart, to offer this text of repentance for peace and merit-transference.

With the water of cinnabar blossoms, may they cleanse the hearts and mouths of the repentant one, [Name], their billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, their parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, their sons and daughters, all their kin, and both the living and the dead. From kalpas past to the present, from this life to this very day, for all the karmic offenses and sins they have committed, and all the residual karmic burdens they have accrued in this world, whether now confined in the prisons of hell, may they repent and be swiftly purified, depart from evil paths, enter good conditions, avoid the five destinies, and universally attain carefree joy.

This is what is meant by nonexistent.”\n\n“Why is it said to be not nonexistent?”\n“If sentient beings indulge the three karmic actions and six senses, commit the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, and boundless transgressions, then upon death they will enter the nine dark hells of Fengdu, where each offense is examined and punished. They shall endure bitter agonies for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth. This is what is meant by not nonexistent.”\n\nSince it is known to be not nonexistent, one must seek repentance. A single day of self-reflection, awakening, and repentance dissolves the sins of ten thousand kalpas. How is the power of this repentance known? In ancient times, there was a man born foolish and ignorant, who committed myriad sins. One day, he reflected and awakened; witnessing the five signs of decay, he was seized with terror and took refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereupon, the roots of his decay and transgressions instantly dissolved, and his heavenly years were prolonged. Thus, all here present, with the teachings clearly expounded, know that repentance enables sentient beings to avoid hell and its manifold sufferings.\n\nIf one does not encounter a good spiritual guide, evil karma deepens. They may know only to wash away the grease and grime from the body but fail to sweep the dust from the heart. Thus, at life’s end, they enter hell and endure the weight of their transgressions. At such a time, remorse and fear come too late. Body and mind are shattered, spirit and soul scattered. The wind-knives stand before them; repentance is no longer possible. What recourse remains for their suffering?\n\nAll you sentient beings, do not rely on your prime of life, do not cling to wealth and treasure, do not become attached to family and kin. Do not indulge in fleeting pleasures, courting the agony of death. When the great limit arrives, it spares neither rich nor poor, neither old nor young, neither noble nor base—all are ground to nothingness. Like the wind’s lamp or spark from stone, what endures? Like lightning at noon or morning dew, what is firm?",

      "translated_text": "When the five celestial messengers and the death-dealing ghosts of impermanence arrive, even youth and radiant beauty cannot resist. At that moment, grand halls and secluded chambers become irrelevant; fine carriages and mighty steeds cannot follow; wives, children, and kin are no longer one’s own; the seven treasures and precious ornaments become playthings for others. The Merciful Honored One said: In the Red Clarity Kalpa of old, there was a sentient being, sharp-witted and intelligent, who subdued afflictions. Though wealthy, he refused to give alms to the poor. When his life ended, he fell into the animal realm, reborn as a red fox, enduring karmic retribution in full. All you sentient beings, be ever vigilant—lest in a single morning you be bound to such suffering, when regret comes too late.\n\nConsider this: in the world of the living, if one faces even a minor matter and must enter the public court, though the offense be slight, the heart trembles in fear. Kinfolk grow anxious, exhausting every means to seek deliverance. How much more so for the beings in hell? Compared to them, such distress is but a shadow.\n\nCountless hells, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, are all governed within this celestial realm. Located in the far north, beyond the Northern Heavens, past boundless, measureless dark abysses, there lies a world called the Five Qi Mystic Heaven, the Dark North, the Solitary, Profound, and Utmost Land. Within it, the Five Qi Five Spirits Mystic Elder Black Emperor Heavenly Lord presides over the northern quarter, restraining the yin demons.\n\nBeneath this land lies the Great Void, the Vast Wilderness, and the boundless, fathomless Black Sea. Its waters are vile, its shores unknowable. At its center rises a great mountain, piercing the azure heavens above and plunging into the windy springs below—Mount Fengdu of the North. It towers one million six hundred thousand *li* high, with a circumference of five hundred thousand *li*. Its base sinks fifteen thousand *li* into the water. At the water’s edge, where the mountain’s foot meets the sea, lies a vast cavern called the Yin Shadow Heaven, the land known as Great Yin.\n\nBeneath the Water Emperor are thirty-six lesser hells, each walled in iron, ninefold encircled. Within each hell, grasses and trees arise from the naturally venomous qi, their branches and leaves transformed into blades and swords, their edges sharp and plentiful. Fierce beasts, scorching smoke, and black winds rage ceaselessly, day and night. The darkness is profound, poisonous qi and bloody light surge, and the stench of filth and decay fills the air. The light of sun, moon, and stars cannot penetrate these hells.\n\nThirty-seven kings preside, each over one hell. Within each, seventy tiers of knife-forests stand, along with countless iron nets. Fire blazes from above, flames surge from below, intertwining like fish in a searing pan. The iron-walled cities have four gates, and at each gate stand four great bronze dogs, each body spanning forty *li*. When they roar, the iron walls tremble. Their fangs are like forests of swords, their claws sharp and forms ferocious—beyond compare.\n\nThere are also countless iron birds, each over a *zhang* in size, with beaks of bronze and claws of iron. They beat their wings in flight, eyes like shooting stars, feathers like iron arrows, each tipped with swirling flames. When they shriek, their cries shake the earth like thunderbolts. Fire spews from their beaks and feathers, and all such creatures devour the marrow of the damned. The pain of the condemned is beyond description, their suffering piercing to the liver and heart. For immeasurable ages, they seek life but find none, seek respite but receive none.\n\nToday, in this ritual assembly, as the sutras describe, such hells exist—boundless and unceasing, their torments endless. Through this rite of repentance, we extend our prayers to all hells, that those enduring suffering may attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion. With bowed head, we pay homage to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerate the true sages:\n\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Upon Hearing the Cry.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Immortals.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Wondrously Serene Golden Light Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Fulfilled Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ever-Shining Dharma Lamp.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Ferries Across on the Jeweled Boat.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ever-Pure Dharma Sea.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Commands the Registrar of Life.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Ten Sufferings.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects the Realm.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Responses.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled King.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Supreme One Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Grants Longevity.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and Realm-Protection.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Aspiration.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unified Dao.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Perfected of Azure Mystery.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Three Heavens’ Perfected.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Greatly Compassionate Perfected Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we bow to the Greatly Merciful Perfected Who Delivers from Sin.\n\nToday, the repentant one and this great assembly humbly pray to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, to all the honored ones, all the sages, all the great perfected, all the great transformers, all the great immortals, and all the youthful saviors of suffering, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and respond to every invocation of the true and sacred.\n\nMay the subtle and wondrous radiance of their hair-tips illuminate the hells of Mount Fengdu. For the repentant one, [Name], and those of the past—nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, parents of three lifetimes, uncles, brothers, and all family—who may be confined in darkness, enduring torment, may they swiftly attain liberation through the power of this repentance, the power of merit and virtue, and the inconceivable power, ascending to the Dao of non-action.",

A moment there is like an eon passed. Ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths, each agony more bitter than the last. No other hell compares.\n\nThe warden of this hell oversees all others, hence it is called the Great Central Hell.\n*Avīci* means “great,” and *bi* means “to obstruct.” *Wu jian* means “without respite.” Thus, it is called the Great Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering.\nAlternatively, *a* means “unceasing,” and *bi* means “unrelenting.” Torment and pain know no pause, no rest. Within, karmic winds blow upon the bodies and minds of the damned, shattering them into ten thousand deaths, only to revive them in an instant. Thus, in a single moment, ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths occur—so it is in all the hells.\n\nHere, the Great Emperor of Fengdu commands two hundred forty bureaus, overseeing fifty thousand minions who interrogate the damned, probing the weight of their sins, leaving no detail unexamined, and reporting all deeds, good and evil.\n\nConsider the Iron Chariot, engulfed in fierce flames, ever ablaze. A yakṣa dwells within; from afar, the damned see it as a fair maiden and long to approach. Yet upon entering, their flesh and bones turn to ash and smoke.\n\nThe Iron Ox’s body, head, fur, horns, and tail are sharp as blades. From afar, the damned see it as a golden lotus, but upon reaching it, flames and smoke consume their bodies, leaving no trace.\n\nThe Iron Horse’s form, mane, and tail are keen as sword edges. The Iron Donkey is the same. Each is led by a yakṣa to the damned. When they mount, their bodies dissolve. The Iron Rakes and other implements of torment—cruel, vicious, and venomous, with raging fires and razor edges—are beyond description.\n\nYou, all beings, may hear of these torments but must never witness them. Should you encounter such a place, escape would be impossible for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nDo not speak idly of hells and heavens. The unseen and the seen are equal; life and death are the same. It is like a man’s dream and his waking: death is as the dream, and birth as waking. What is done in dreams differs not from waking; what is done in death differs not from life. Joy in dreams is self-made; suffering in waking is self-caused.\n\nYou, all beings, should reflect deeply and seek early deliverance. The means to deliverance is none other than repentance. After repentance, abandon past wrongs and cultivate anew.\n\nMoreover, in the Middle Kingdom, it is rare to obtain a human body. Rarer still is one who cultivates good fruits. Like the sun and moon, whose light shines impartially, illuminating all, leaving no darkness unlit—you, all beings, are neither blind nor deaf. The blind see not the sun and moon; the deaf hear not of good and evil. Having heard of good and evil, having seen the sun and moon, those who do not awaken are like vines clinging to a tree: as the tree grows, so do they. When the tree falls, what will the vines cling to?\n\nToday, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures warn, trembles in fear and sorrow. Now, with diligence, we bow in repentance, seeking mercy. May we, life after life, never encounter such places. May all beings in hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms alike attain liberation.\n\nThe repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing himself to the ground with utmost sincerity. With reverence, he bows to the Merciful Honored One and venerates the true and sacred.\n\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves at the Sound of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Ascendant Immortals.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Lofty and Unsurpassed Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassion and Love.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Constant Mercy.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of No Coming and No Going.\nWith devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Shelters All.",

The bodies of the condemned are torn apart, and for ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the south is the Fire Obscuration Hell, where the condemned swallow fire and devour coals, scorched by flames. Their heads and faces are charred and rotting, fire mountains rest upon their crowns, and their skin, flesh, and bones blaze in every joint. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the west is the Vajra Hell, where the condemned are beaten with countless iron hammers and rods. Their limbs rot and disintegrate, tendons and bones scatter, iron forks pierce their bellies, and golden hammers lodge in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the north is the Dark and Cold Hell, where the condemned sink into freezing pools. Ice spears and frost blades sever their tendons and bones, and the juices of a hundred poisons are poured upon them. Their bodies disintegrate, and their hearts and bellies rupture. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the center is the Universal Torment Hell, where the condemned endure unbearable pain from beatings. Their tendons snap, blood flows, and they collapse in suffocating agony. Then, the hell wardens impale them with iron forks, forcing them to ascend blade mountains and sword trees, where winds from eight directions sway the trees. Their feet tread upon blade mountains, and their bodies are impaled upon sword edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the southeast is the Bronze Pillar Hell, where great fires rage with fierce flames. The condemned embrace and climb the pillars, their outer and inner bodies charred and rotting, their backs and bellies oozing pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the southwest is the Butchery Hell, where the condemned are hung upside down, their bodies sliced by blades. Their four limbs, tendons, veins, skin, and five viscera are all cut by knives. Blood flows from their bodies, pooling upon the ground, the pain unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the northwest is the Fire Chariot Hell, where the condemned are torn apart by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some are placed within the chariots, which drag them east and west. All wheels are edged with blades, and as they turn, they slice the condemned. Fierce fires burn their bodies to cinders. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nIn the northeast is the Boiling Cauldron Hell, where the condemned are impaled by iron forks and cast into cauldrons.",

For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.\n\nPǔjì asked, “What grave offenses condemn one to such torment? And who presides over their unceasing interrogation?”\n\nThe Compassionate One replied, “Those who commit the three karmic transgressions—slandering the Great Vehicle, disloyalty to the sovereign, maligning monastics, defiling the Dharma-body, destroying sacred images, or embezzling monastic property—fall into the Nine Dark Hells to endure this retribution. There, the Three Officials govern the Nine Bureaus, where clerks and magistrates conduct inquiries, extending even to Fengdu.”\n\nPǔjì asked, “Is each transgression met with a single punishment, or are a hundred offenses met with a hundred torments?”\n\nThe Compassionate One replied, “Iron beds and bronze pillars, agony unbearable—crushed bones and scorched sinews repay the sin of lust. Freezing cold that sears to the bone, forcing them to lie in icy rivers, repays the sin of theft. Molten copper poured into their mouths, tongues torn out and plowed, eyes pecked by vile birds. Sword trees splay their limbs, grinding mills pulverize them like grain—this repays the sin of deceitful glances. Their bodies become hungry ghosts, wandering through cauldrons of boiling liquid, forced to swallow iron pellets when hunger strikes—this repays the sin of breaking precepts. Each interrogation and torment corresponds precisely to their karma, with no discrepancy.\n\nToday, in this ritual space, the penitent, [Name], prostrates in reverence, vowing to dedicate merit with diligence.

May blade mountains and sword trees transform into jeweled forests, cauldrons and furnaces into lotus blossoms. May ox-headed jailers become benevolent companions, and all ghosts and spirits abandon malevolent thoughts.\n\nThrough this repentance ritual, may all imprisoned in the earth prisons be absolved. May the six paths and four modes of birth awaken to non-action and ascend the true Dao. One bow.\n\n**Chapter Four: Absolving Hell-Prisons, Delivering Hungry Ghosts and Animals**\n\nToday, in this ritual space, each member of the great assembly directs their mind, gazing up to the Compassionate One, arousing compassion and cultivating equanimity. May all officials of the hells be elevated, and may hungry ghosts, animals, and beings in the evil destinies be delivered.\n\nThe penitent, [Name], kneels in reverence, concentrating their thoughts, prostrating in repentance. Moreover, the ox-headed jailers, rākṣasas, yakṣas, and countless malevolent ghosts dwelling in hell have yet to transcend the cycle of rebirth. Adrift in the vast sea of suffering, confined in the dark prisons, they have no refuge, forever shrouded in gloom. There are also copper dogs, iron birds, iron horses, iron snakes, iron donkeys, iron oxen, stinking turtles, fierce beasts, venomous insects, and all manner of evil beings—each repaying past misdeeds, bound by karmic retribution.\n\nToday, through this repentance ritual, we vow to universally dedicate our thoughts, relying on the power of goodness, the power of the Dao, and the power of merit. May all officials of the hells attain liberation, escape the realm of suffering, and gradually ascend to the ranks of celestial immortals, reuniting with the supreme Dao. May their karmic fruits transform, and may they be reborn as humans. May all venomous beings self-destruct.\n\nMoreover, those in the realm of hungry ghosts endure eternal hunger and thirst. Though they crave to devour mountains, they never hear the names of broth or water, food or drink, and instead consume pus, blood, and foulness. When their bodies move, their limbs ignite with fire. Their bellies swell like drums, their necks thin as bowstrings.\n\nToday, through this repentance ritual, we vow with boundless thoughts, relying on the power of merit, the inconceivable power, and the power of deliverance. May all hungry ghosts and their kin attain rebirth, receive human form, and enjoy exquisite food and drink that arrive at their wish.\n\nMoreover, those in the animal realm—all species, devoid of knowledge and freedom—endure whipping, torture, slaughter, and butchery. Some have feet, scales, wings, or hooves; some fly, some walk; some have fur, shells, horns, or claws; some are large, some small; some are eaten by humans, others are not.

Thus, sins accumulate like mountains, summoning severe retribution. In recent years, affairs have been fraught with misfortune, entangled in illness and suffering, with unceasing calamities. Frightening dreams arise in profusion, and strange omens manifest without end. Since ancient times, the afflictions of ancestors have never ceased.\n\nWhether from the three generations of great-grandparents, seven generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or the three lifetimes of parents—both maternal and paternal—if ancestral tombs remain unsettled, they may harbor litigious spirits or malevolent ghosts, their baleful influence unbroken. Or perhaps in burial, construction, relocation, or renovation; in marriage rites or the selection of inauspicious days and hours; in violating taboos; or in excavating pits and trenches, disturbing earth spirits—such acts may subject the living and the dead to torment and punishment, binding their souls in confinement. The misfortunes thus incurred flow onward, extending even to future generations. The transgressions committed are too numerous to recount.\n\nToday, with utmost devotion, we perform this repentance rite, beseeching the Three Saints with sorrowful sincerity, that through this liberation, the repentant patron [Name] may attain deliverance.\n\nProstrating in reverence for peace and to offer this repentance text, the patron [Name] bows with body and mind, earnestly invoking the Compassionate Savior, paying homage to the True Saints:\n\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ascended Immortals.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Golden Palace and Jade Treasure.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Pristine Forces.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Divine Transformation and Dao’s Workings.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Natural Perfected Ones.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Wondrous Gathering in Golden Clouds.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Radiant Illumination, Dharma Kings.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Golden Form, Serene and Profound.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of a Hundred Billion Manifested Bodies.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Natural Golden Perfected Ones.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Mystic Penetration and Universal Awakening.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Origins, Keepers of Records.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Caverns, Profound and Still.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Supreme Mystery, Wondrous and Victorious.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Illuminating Response and True Realization.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Liberation from the Four Delusions.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Supreme Unity’s Savior of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Longevity and Life Preservation.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Boundless Extent.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Wisdom.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Great Compassionate Savior of Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, we bow to the Great Merciful Redeemer of Sins.\n\nToday, the repentant patron and all assembled in this sacred precinct humbly beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the northeast, along with all the Venerable Saints, Great Perfected Ones, and Divine Youths—spanning the ten directions, the boundless void, past and future, all hidden and manifest True Saints.\n\nThrough the power of the Great Dao-heart, the power of non-action, the power of merit, and the power of supreme goodness, may the three generations of the repentant patron [Name]’s souls—whether lost to famine, banditry, or warfare; to blades, ropes, or unjust imprisonment; to tigers, wolves, or poisonous curses; to bewitchment by trees or stones; to fire, drowning, or self-inflicted wounds; to hanging, epidemics, or the five poisons; to ulcers, leprosy, abscesses, or festering sores; to madness, starvation, or freezing; to sudden malevolent forces or murder by evil spirits; to childbirth complications or miscarriage; to attacks by birds of prey or foxes; or to injuries from livestock—those confined in celestial prisons or earthly hells, bearing sand on their backs or stones upon their shoulders, hauling mountains or filling rivers, enduring ceaseless toil and suffering—be liberated.\n\nOr perhaps their tombs and burial grounds were disturbed, graves opened, coffins desecrated, bones scattered and exposed, skulls and limbs strewn apart, left unburied in the wild, their souls adrift without refuge. Through the power of this virtuous act, may the three generations of souls, long departed, find rest: if their bones lie in water, may they be water-buried; if in fire, fire-buried; if on earth, exposed to the elements; if devoured by beasts, hidden in concealment; if upon wood or stone, entrusted to their care; if slain by blades, transformed by the sword.\n\nMay the repentant patron [Name], from this day forward, be freed from misfortune, illness, and suffering; may nightmares cease, and omens vanish. May ancestral souls and tombs forever know peace and prosperity, their households flourishing, sons and daughters thriving, receiving blessings and office, with descendants succeeding in unbroken lineage.

May you expound for all beings, teaching them to pray for the state and their households, seeking grace and blessings.\n\nThe repentant patron [Name], kneeling with hands clasped, listens attentively to the scriptural words. If the sovereign faces calamity—celestial bodies losing their course, wars erupting on all sides, winds and rains unbalanced, the hundred grains failing to ripen, the people stricken by plague, the land unsettled, armies mobilized for campaigns, or any manner of disasters and inauspicious omens—all must be reported to me.\n\nGreat merits shall be cultivated: transcribing scriptures and commissioning sacred images, establishing temples to deliver beings, and offering from the treasury precious treasures, jewels, gold, silver, pearls, coral, amber, palace gardens, silken banners, fields, gardens, and dwellings. These shall be dedicated as alms, sown into the field of the Three Treasures, to deliver sentient beings, rescue those in peril, release prisoners, establish fasts and precepts, arrange hundreds of high seats, and expound the profound and wondrous teachings of the Great Vehicle. Thus shall the people of the realm be exhorted to listen to the Dharma, practice almsgiving and repentance, and accumulate boundless, inconceivable merits of salvation and protection.\n\nIf the sovereign and ministers indulge in wrath, pursue depravity, slaughter without restraint, seek self-indulgence, and oppress all beings, bringing forth calamities upon the people—where sun and moon lose their brightness, baleful stars encroach upon the imperial throne, the land suffers floods and droughts, omens and locusts appear, the people rebel, and usurpers rise—then the sovereign and all under heaven must summon the Three Caverns’ Dharma Bodies and the assembly of the altar, countless in number, to fill sacred altars, temples, mountains, waters, grottoes, and holy sites. There, grand rituals shall be established, banners and canopies hung, flowers scattered, incense burned, lamps lit, the Dao practiced day and night, repentance offered without weariness, and the six periods observed with diligence. Treasures shall be widely dispensed to rescue all beings. Then, by my Dao-power, I shall manifest great divine transformations to assist in dispelling these disasters, causing the afflictions to dissolve at once.\n\nIf within the realm the Five Stars lose their proper course, dim luminaries stray, the Twenty-Eight Constellations deviate from their domains, sun and moon suffer eclipses, and yin and yang fall out of harmony, then the Southern Director of Destinies, Lord Han the Venerable, and the Controller of the Eight Directions of the Celestial Sphere, Sima the Longevous, shall regulate the celestial mechanism, restoring them to their rightful positions, and all calamitous omens shall be extinguished.\n\nIf great drought leaves the people parched and suffering, then the Dragon Kings shall shake thunder and summon torrential rains to end the drought’s hardship. If heavy rains pour unceasingly, floods surge to the heavens, and the people drown, then the Jade Maiden of the River, the Dark Lord of the Nine Seas, and the Officers of the True Qi shall gather the water-qi, part the clouds, and halt the rain, causing the waters to recede without harm. At this time, all dragon-spirits and ghosts shall likewise turn toward goodness.\n\nIf external demons, evil spirits, or malevolent ghosts—*chimei* and *wangliang*—enter the land to spread sickness and suffering, they shall be expelled together, allowed no respite. By the weight of my compassion and virtue, the imperial domain shall be eternally secured, the sovereign’s power ever renewed. The people shall ascend to the court of benevolence and longevity, the state placed within the realm of Huaxu. Yin and yang shall harmonize, sun and moon shine eternally, the seas and lands know peace, ministers and people enjoy well-being, the three frontiers remain tranquil, and the five grains flourish abundantly.\n\nYet, among the people of the world, though their wealth, status, and conditions differ, even if they cultivate the Dao, they may not discern the proper path. They may perform deeds yet remain beset by calamities, wavering in doubt, unable to attain clarity. They wonder: does the merit of salvation and protection vary in degree?\n\nThe Compassionate Honored One replied: Salvation and deliverance from distress depend upon utmost sincerity; the almsgiving of wealth is not measured by quantity. There are five kinds of merit:\n\nFirst, the creation of my sacred images—true, responsive, and transformative manifestations. Blessings shall flow across kalpas, and retribution shall be boundless. Why? Because sentient beings, lost in delusion, cannot fix their minds. Beholding my true form, they generate devotion. With devotion arisen, true numen descends to meet them. Focused and unwavering, they attain the fruit of non-action.\n\nSecond, the transcription of scriptural teachings—the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns. Blessings shall flow eternally, and merits shall be immeasurable. For scriptures guide the deluded, awakening boundless Dao-mind in beings, leading them from confusion to enlightenment, from enlightenment to truth. All sages who cultivate the Dao ascend to its fruition.\n\nThird, the establishment of temples to deliver beings, the construction of halls and sanctuaries. The merit is boundless, inconceivable. Why?",

      "translated_text": "Third, the deliverance of beings through monastic ordination and temple stewardship, the propagation of scriptures and icons to teach and transform sentient beings, inspiring them to awaken the Dao-mind—one realization opening myriad gates. Through the turning of karmic conditions, they aid the nation and transform the people, spreading the Dao and illuminating the Dharma, yielding the greatest benefit.\n\nFourth, the observance of purification rites and the practice of the Dao, the performance of repentance and the recitation of scriptures, the offering of praise and the burning of incense. The field of merit is boundless. Thus, purification rites cleanse the heart, the Dao enables penetrating insight, the practice of the Dao atones for transgressions, repentance invokes blessings, and the resonance of merit moves the heavens, dispelling calamities and bestowing fortune, upon which both life and death depend.\n\nFifth, the bestowal of all things in boundless fields of merit. The karmic retribution is towering, its merit profound and deep. Wealth and possessions are the lifeblood of sentient beings, clung to as if one’s own life, yet to relinquish them without hesitation, to give without stinginess, is to broadly establish merit, universally succoring sentient beings, inwardly stilling greed and avarice, outwardly eliminating plunder and theft. In life and death, they receive grace, and both humans and heavens reap the benefit.\n\nThese five Dharma-gates of merit-making are to be cultivated gradually according to one’s capacity, safeguarding the nation and securing the household, transcending rebirth and delivering from suffering. As the scriptures say, it is like a single sweet rain—all who receive it are nourished. According to their innate faculties, each attains flourishing growth. So too is the performance of repentance and the seeking of forgiveness.\n\nToday, the assembly of this Dao-field, having heard the scriptural teachings, exhorts sentient beings to establish these inconceivable merits. The repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this very kalpa and this present life, has never before encountered such merit or the analogies of these Dharma-gates. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text in ancestral veneration, they attain great awakening and understanding, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion.\n\nWith bowed heads, they pay homage to the Merciful Venerable One, reverently saluting the true sages:\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy, Bestower of Fortune.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Jade Void Radiant August Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Ultimate’s True Form.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of True Unity and Spontaneity.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Records All.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Qi.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Dragon Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Victorious Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Virtue.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Mystery.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Joyful Wandering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Poles.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Knows the True.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Five Qi.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Void.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Emptiness.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Golden Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Devotion.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Capital.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects and Responds.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Nation.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Precious Countenance.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Perfect Quiescence.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentant one of this Dao-field, together with the great assembly, surrenders and takes refuge, reverently beseeching the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Heavenly Immortals, all the Immortals of the Great Grotto-Heavens, Earth Immortals, Water Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones of Universal Salvation, Perfected Ones Who Rescue from Suffering, Youths Who Rescue from Suffering, and all true sages throughout the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the mysterious void, and all realms manifest and hidden.\n\nMay their vast and mysterious grace universally flow through the land. May the emperor’s reign be eternally prolonged, the beacon fires of war unlit, weapons stilled and sheathed, borders secured and frontiers guarded. May the imperial princes and heirs together strengthen the imperial enterprise, ministers and officials loyal and upright, assisting counselors and chancellors sharing the nation’s prosperity, jointly upholding the cosmos.\n\nMay heaven and earth be bright and pure, the celestial signs clear and mysterious, floods and droughts forever dispelled, locusts and pests never arise. May the three frontiers know perpetual peace, disasters and epidemics sink into obscurity, wind and rain arrive in season, harvests be abundant in years of plenty. May heaven bestow sweet dew, earth bring forth auspicious clouds, the nation prosper with worthy ministers, households abound with filial piety and fraternal duty.\n\nNext, may the prisons of Mount Luofeng, the eight difficulties and nine dark realms, cease their torments, and the suffering souls forever escape the three evil destinies.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this present kalpa and life, together with nine generations of ancestors, parents, and all kin, by the power of this repentance and merit, may all attain liberation and return to the true Dao.\n\nOne bow.",

      "translated_text": "**Second Scroll: The Salvation of the People**\n\nToday, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present turn their minds upward, gazing toward the Merciful Honored One, to broadly save the people and expound all virtuous benefits.\n\nThe repentant one, so-and-so, gathers their thoughts, joins their hands, and listens attentively to the scriptural words, ever mindful of sentient beings dwelling in an age of the three poisons and ten evils, beset by specters and malevolent spirits, wicked ghosts and wayward deities, venomous creatures and fierce beasts, blades and warfare, flood and fire, fetters and prisons, sickness and suffering—each affliction clinging fast, leaving none at peace.\n\nThus are the Three Caverns’ scriptures and precepts expounded, the rites of deliverance and purification performed, to universally ferry all beings across. Talismans, sacred diagrams, and divine incantations are entrusted to those who study the Dao, along with the Heavenly Emperors, the Saviors of Suffering Perfected Ones, the Three Great Demon Kings of Heaven, and the Five Demon Kings of Heaven, who spread throughout the world to rescue and protect all, granting them freedom.\n\nYet sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and blessing. They indulge the six senses, killing and stealing, engaging in debauchery and dissipation, stinginess and wrath, their natures inverted. They speak deceitfully, utter falsehoods, slander with harsh words and divisive tongues, devour living beings, break fasts and violate precepts, defy heaven and betray earth, turn from the true and embrace the perverse, curse gods and spirits—sins rampant, with not a shred of goodness.\n\nThus do poisonous winds and malignant qi, the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens, fill the world, spreading slaughter and strife. Those struck down and wounded number in the tens of thousands each day, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One dispatches the Heavenly Emperors, the Ten Ultimate Divine Kings, and the Four Administrators of the Three Realms to descend into the human realm, traversing and rescuing, delivering sentient beings, filling heaven and earth—yet who among them knows this?\n\nNow I solemnly declare to you: the methods of salvation are inconceivable, their spiritual responses swift. In universal deliverance, I proclaim with great compassion and mercy, entreating the Honored One to bestow these teachings.\n\nThe Merciful Honored One says: On the first day of the year, the eight solar terms, the Three Primes, the dark and full moons, the Five La Days, and the Ten Straight Days—on all such occasions, good men and faithful women who observe these days must abstain from meat and impurity, restrain the six senses, and banish all wayward thoughts. Thus purified, they burn incense, maintain the fast, recite the Dao, and pay homage to my transformed names.\n\nFirst, they repent for their own transgressions, openly confessing their faults, thereby transferring merit to amend their errors and escape suffering and calamity. If one cannot focus alone, they may invoke the Dharma-bodies of male or female officiants, praying earnestly with devotion, making offerings and prostrations.\n\nWhether at home or in sacred temples, with flowers, fruits, vegetarian meals, banners, blossoms, incense, lamps, and offerings of clothing, bedding, curtains, embroidered mats, fragrant oils, rice, and flour—whatever they possess—then the benevolent spirits will descend at once, delivering them from misfortune.\n\nIf one suffers from grave illness, chronic ailments, or the malevolent influence of the Ox Mansion, lingering for years without relief, their vitality drained, their wealth dissipated; if childbirth brings misfortune, or infants perish in their arms; if one leaves the household to become a monastic, only to later regret it; if nightmares and strange visions disturb the mind, or fires and alarms cause terror; if legal troubles arise unjustly, or one violates sacred prohibitions, defies divine retribution, disturbs graves, or is struck by flood, fire, entangling trees, or crushing stones—all manner of calamities, omens, and afflictions—then within the home, perform extensive rites of repentance and supplication. According to one’s means, pay homage to my transformed names, kindle lamps and burn incense day and night without cease. The Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings will descend to protect my transformed names.\n\nThe exorcised will be subdued, the sought will be granted, the presented will be conveyed, the entreated will be heeded. Transgressions will be redeemed, the living and the dead will be saved. This form of prayer and exorcism is foremost.\n\nIf emperors, kings, great ministers, and royal advisors, along with princes, consorts, imperial children, and celestial descendants, act on behalf of their parents, themselves, their kin, court relatives, and imperial kin, summoning the Dharma-bodies of male and female officiants—regardless of number—to their palaces, where they maintain the fast, practice the Dao, and perform repentance day and night without pause, their devotion unwavering, then the Ten Perfected Ones of Heaven and the Four Administrators and Five Emperors will descend to assess their merits and faults. The sick will recover, the dead will revive, the imperiled will be delivered, the imprisoned will be freed, travelers will return, and officials will be promoted. Water, fire, blades, warfare, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, malevolent spirits, and spectral entities will never assail them, nor will they suffer harm or offense.\n\nIf common folk act on behalf of emperors, kings, the people, the land, and all sentient beings, paying homage to my transformed names and true images, delivering all beings, each will attain peace and bliss—this is most inconceivable.\n\nIf warfare erupts on all four fronts, encroaching upon borders, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the weapons of war will retreat, leaving no harm or damage.\n\nIf plague and pestilence strike the people, and exorcisms bring no relief, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflicted will recover, free from lingering illness.\n\nIf floods and droughts disrupt the seasons, and the five grains fail to ripen, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the elements will harmonize, all things flourishing.\n\nIf poisonous winds and malignant qi scorch the people, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflictions will vanish at once, the body and qi restored to tranquility.\n\nIf venomous creatures and fierce beasts ravage the people and all living beings, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the insects and tigers will flee, the mountain spirits concealing them.\n\nIf a woman is pregnant and childbirth brings peril, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and mother and child will be reunited, free from danger.\n\nTen thousand disasters will vanish, a thousand transformations and myriad changes will cease. Turn to me, to my transformed names, who broadly protect all sentient beings—no wish will go unfulfilled. With sincere devotion, no peril will remain unaverted.\n\nToday, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present must turn their minds as the scriptures instruct, with utmost devotion, paying homage to all transformed names and manifestations.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Three: Unbinding the Knots of Sentient Beings**\n\nToday, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, the Boundless Dao, and all true sages, that for the sake of sentient beings, they may untie all knots and fetters.\n\nThe repentant sponsor, so-and-so, with purified body and mind, bows in profound devotion. As the scriptures declare: In the beginning, the Primordial One transformed the Three Realms with a single qi. Heaven and earth move, and the myriad things take form; humanity dwells within, receiving its nature and nurturing its form, all born of this transformation. Externally, it draws upon refined qi; internally and externally, the five virtues intermingle to take shape. Sentient beings, enveloped within, emerge from the womb after ten months, encircled by the ten qi. As qi circulates and gives life, the hundred joints unfold. Within each joint, qi forms ten knots, and within each knot resides a spirit. Habitual patterns intertwine, and transgressions coil into bonds.\n\nTo untie these knots and harmonize the hundred spirits, the ten directions are established, each bearing countless names. Each invoked name has the power to unbind the knots of sentient beings. If the knots of sentient beings are dissolved, they deeply awaken to the source of the Dao—much like in the worldly realm, where capturing a thief requires summoning a thousand soldiers, yet once the thief is seized, not a single soldier is needed.\n\nMoreover, the body of sentient beings is a temporary convergence of earth, water, fire, and wind, of yin and yang, manifest and hidden, all arising from the mutual contamination of the five viscera and six senses. The mind-king and the will-steed sow and cultivate: knots of doubt and delusion, knots of entanglement and obstruction, knots of injury and harm, knots of illness and affliction, knots of slander and strife, knots of enmity and grievance, knots of chronic ailment, knots of muteness and silence, knots of frivolity and play, knots of trade and exchange, knots of wine and gluttony, knots of killing and harm, knots of scalding and fire, knots of jealousy and envy, knots of false speech, knots of frivolity and disdain, knots of greed and desire, knots of reckless bravery, knots of breaking fasts, knots of violating precepts, knots of idle amusement, knots of mental exhaustion, knots of accumulated resentment, knots of shamelessness, knots of lust and desire, knots of deafness, knots of blindness, knots of mental confusion, knots of anger and rage, knots of heavenly nets, knots of earthly snares, knots of water and fire, knots of the bridal chamber, knots of mutual conflict, knots of mutual hindrance.\n\nAll such sentient beings, dwelling within heaven and earth, experience the flourishing and withering of form. The burning house seethes unceasingly; floating life is ever restless. With all these vexing knots obstructing and tormenting the fleshly body, knot upon knot intertwines without end.\n\nPǔjì inquired: What is meant by the mind-king and the will-steed?\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: The mind is like a sovereign king; the will is like a monkey or a horse—difficult to tame, difficult to subdue, ever-shifting and unceasing. Even if the monkey and horse are stilled, the mind-king does not rest. If one skillfully subdues the sovereign king, the will-steed cannot shift and turn. Once shifting and turning cease, karmic knots no longer arise.\n\nPǔjì inquired: By what virtuous power may sentient beings be taught to awaken and dissolve these knots?\n\nThe Merciful Honored One replied: If sentient beings seek awakening and dissolution, let them, in a place of purity, adorn and purify their homes. According to their means, whether abundant or modest, let them light incense and lamps before my image, venerate the transformed names, repent of grievances and knots, listen attentively, contemplate deeply, and advance with courage and diligence. Thus may they awaken and dissolve all knots, avoiding the depths of suffering.\n\nBy the power of this repentance, let there descend the hundredfold-refined vajra, the thousandfold-blended jade elixir, the flowing light of Venus, the dispersed radiance of primal yellow. Let these wash away lewdness and perversity, dissolve grievances and knots, dispel vexation and torment, pacify body and mind. Let goodness and evil naturally align, and malevolence be ground away. May the Four Brahma Perfected Ones and the transformative lords of the ten directions enable all sentient beings to awaken. Let evil karma not arise, and let goodness deepen, that they may attain rebirth—how could they not be delivered?\n\nFurthermore, if sentient beings skillfully dissolve even a single knot, a hundred knots will loosen. They will ascend in pure qi and descend with heavenly talismans. The fierce generals Axiū, Iron-Forehead, and Copper-Headed Dharma-Protecting Divine Kings, with jade hooks and golden locks, will instantly still the thousand knots and myriad resentments, quieting the mind-monkey. Like an orange or a pearl, the will’s knots will forever cease. The mind will be without mind, and knots without knots. Enmity and hatred will be resolved, nets and snares dissolved.\n\nMay all sentient beings forever awaken to the true Dao and attain liberation.\n\nToday, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds to listen attentively, as the scriptures declare: Sentient beings in the world are forever bound by the cage of affliction, with no means of escape—where can they flee? By venerating this repentance ritual, they may suddenly awaken from their entanglements. Now, let them contemplate deeply and advance in reverent devotion.\n\nMay the power of virtue extend to all sentient beings, that all the knots they bear may, by the power of repentance, awaken to non-action and ascend to the true Dao.\n\nThe repentant sponsor, so-and-so, further reflects: Dwelling in the floating world, one daily accumulates evil qi. The body bears the three karmic actions; the mouth commits the four transgressions. Karmic roots intertwine, and knots gather, difficult to cast off. Today, let the body be refined and purified, the dust of defilement washed away.\n\nToday, prostrating for peace and offering prayers through this repentance text, with the five limbs touching the earth and the mind single-mindedly devoted, the repentant sponsor bows to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerates the true sages.\n\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering upon hearing the cry.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity and Luminous Sovereignty.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who establishes merit universally.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who widely propagates the Dao’s allure.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy adorned with meritorious virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who compassionately expounds the Dharma.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Most High’s teachings.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of unfathomable sagely virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy with wondrous golden countenance.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who engenders the four qi.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who verifies fruition and fulfills vows.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy who opens the Dao to rebirth.\nWith sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Hall of Ten Thousand Blessings.",

May all sentient beings be delivered and saved, depart from the source of suffering, and together ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.",

May the ancestral spirits, the consciousness of departed kin, parents, and family members swiftly escape karmic entanglements, never to sink into suffering. May the living and the deceased of two generations together ascend to the fruition of the Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Four: Arousing the Heart of Praise**\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart-mind upward, gazing toward the Compassionate Venerable One, exhorting all beings to arise in praise.\n\nThe repentance master, named so-and-so, gathers their heart-mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: No one receives birth without arising from past karma. Thus, each is endowed with a divine and outstanding nature, each with its own karmic conditions. Transgressions and blessings, fortune and misfortune—all proceed from karma. Therefore, short or long lifespans, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to prior determination. If one knows they have committed the three karmic actions or the ten evils, their transgressions are grave and weighty. They should awaken to remorse, seek repentance, and perform rites of contrition. Let boundless thoughts arise from an immeasurable heart-mind. Whenever encountering good conditions, one must offer praise. The merit of praise is inconceivable.\n\nIf one sees the emperor, sovereign, empress, imperial consorts, princes, princesses, ministers, and high officials arouse a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing that blessings protect the realm and the imperial enterprise endure forever.\n\nIf one sees the construction of palaces or the establishment of vast Daoist altars, one must offer praise, wishing for swift completion and the attainment of refuge.\n\nIf one sees the imperial grace bestowing ordination upon male and female officials and Daoists, one must offer praise, wishing for liberation from suffering and purity across three lifetimes.\n\nIf one sees the adornment and casting of sacred images, the true responsive and transformative bodies, one must offer praise, arousing a heart of reverence and making offerings without cease.\n\nIf one sees the transcription of the Three Caverns’ Great Canon of sacred scriptures, one must offer praise, wishing for eternal circulation and the transformation and deliverance of all.\n\nIf one sees halls, pavilions, towers, and terraces adorned with splendor and elegance, one must offer praise, wishing that all may attain refuge and constantly behold and revere them.\n\nIf one sees bells, chimes, and Daoist implements of bronze and iron, one must offer praise, wishing to awaken the deluded masses and make their voices heard in the darkest nights.\n\nIf one sees the expounding of various scriptures and the elucidation of wondrous meanings, one must offer praise, wishing to ride the merit to liberate those imprisoned in suffering.\n\nIf one sees the recitation of scriptures and repentance texts, their upholding, and the making of offerings, one must offer praise, wishing to attain the conditions for the Dao and remain steadfast without retreat.\n\nIf one sees the performance of ritual circumambulation, hymns of praise, prayers for blessings, and petitions for fortune, one must offer praise, wishing that the power of blessings universally pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust.\n\nIf one sees men and women burning incense, lighting lamps, and diligently prostrating in reverence, one must offer praise, wishing their prayers be fulfilled.\n\nIf one sees the burning of incense, one must offer praise, universally wishing that the fragrant smoke be offered to all Perfected and Sages.\n\nIf one sees the illumination of lamps dispelling darkness, one must offer praise, wishing that karmic debts be forever dissolved and all attain equality with the sun and moon.\n\nIf one sees the observance of fasts, the upholding of precepts, and the making of offerings to the Perfected and Sages, one must offer praise, wishing that all sentient beings in the world, all creatures with consciousness, forever enter the Dharma gate and never sink into the realms of suffering.\n\nIf one sees the making of offerings to humans and gods, one must offer praise, wishing for towering blessings and longevity, and inexhaustible wealth and fortune.\n\nIf one sees diligent devotion, thought after thought of utmost sincerity, one must offer praise, wishing for no retreat and constant joy.\n\nIf one sees courageous reverence and the arousal of a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing to avoid encountering demonic obstacles and swiftly attain the true Dao.\n\nIf one sees those who dwell at home constantly reciting scriptures and repentance texts, one must offer praise, wishing that all heavenly Perfected may hear and behold them.\n\nIf one sees those who dwell in mountains to cultivate the Dao, residing in hermitages and cliffs, guarding their resolve in tranquility, seeking neither fame nor profit, one must offer praise, wishing that those who first attain the Dao may sequentially open the path to deliverance for others.\n\nIf one sees men and women of upright bearing, one must offer praise, universally wishing that they leave the household life and perpetuate the true teaching.\n\nIf one sees all good conditions in the world, one must offer praise, wishing that humans and gods attain fruition and all receive benefit.\n\nThrough such manifold praises of good deeds, exhort and inspire all beings to accomplish the heart-mind of the Dao and enter diligent practice. Thus may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, one’s own parents, uncles, brothers, oneself, one’s descendants, and all family members—from beginningless kalpas to the present kalpa, in this life and this birth, through the accumulated actions of today—all the heavy transgressions of the three karmic actions, the six sense faculties, the five rebellious acts, and the ten evils be completely dissolved.",

      "translated_text": "Those who refrain from consuming living beings will, in this life, enjoy freedom from illness and suffering and, in past lives, attain a long-lived body. Those who abstain from wine and meat will, in this life, have spirits that abide in their bodies and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of sages and worthies. Those who are free from craving and content with little will, in this life, have bodies free from foul odors and, in past lives, be reborn with pure bodies. Those who release life and ransom creatures will, in this life, be spared from premature death and, in past lives, be reborn with reverent bodies. Those who expound the teachings and transform others will, in this life, attain the dual cultivation of blessings and wisdom and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of renunciates.\n\nMoreover, the retribution of meritorious deeds is like an echo responding to sound, like a shadow following form—no difference in magnitude, purity and turbidity naturally distinct. Yet you, in your ignorance and delusion, fail to recognize causes and conditions, disbelieve in the consequences of sin and merit, and do not understand that this body arises from the seeds of past blessings. You do not know that this body is but a fleeting apparition, that it is utterly illusory, that it is momentary and impermanent. Instead, you indulge in stinginess and greed, killing living beings, stealing, engaging in illicit sex and dissipation, consuming living creatures, uttering deceitful and frivolous speech, slandering the scriptures and teachings, amassing wealth—all the while believing this life has no limit.\n\nConsider all beings: with eyes open, they commit countless sins; with eyes closed, they enter the prison of suffering. A lifetime of transgressions—when have they ever awakened? They cannot arouse a single thought of goodness to disperse the karmic deeds that bind them to past and future rebirths. Though they seek to liberate themselves, they plant the seeds of affliction, yet fret over their descendants, lamenting their lack of sustenance. I grieve for worldly people, who weep at the moment of death, yet from youth are consumed by worry for their sons and daughters, never recalling the kindness of their parents’ nurture. From time without beginning, they have imitated one another, never awakening, ever sinking deeper into ignorance.\n\nI reflect further on all of you, who follow one another in folly, never self-aware. Thus I reveal the karmic causes and conditions of past lives, that you may emerge from the river of suffering and desire. I also lament that sentient beings drift and drown, never escaping the sea of suffering. This world is called the \"Realm of Abandoned Worthies and Profit-Seeking,\" also known as the \"Realm of Mixed Retribution.\" The heavens of desire and attachment arise within it, fleeting as lightning—appearing for a moment, then vanishing; briefly gathering, then scattering. Birth, aging, sickness, death; pain, itching, soreness, aching; hunger, cold, dryness, dampness; water, fire, blades, weapons; demonic spirits, thieves, poisonous winds, malignant diseases—all these afflictions intertwine, moment by moment impermanent, never abiding for even an instant. How much suffering! Yet even as these torments bind you in the present, you remain unaware—how then could you believe in the celestial realms, the blessed lands of immortals, the Dao of eternal life, and the freedom of non-action?\n\nI observe that the lives of worldly beings are shorter than those of mayflies; their dwellings more cramped than a hair’s tip; their foulness more vile than excrement; their pleasures no different from those of dung-beetles. Yet they remain oblivious, mistaking this for happiness—is this not suffering? I further reflect that no one is born without prior karma. Thus, when examining the essence of spirit and form, each has its causes and conditions. Sin and merit, fortune and misfortune—all arise from karma. Therefore, longevity or premature death, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to its kind, even among birds, beasts, insects, fish, chickens, dogs, grasses, and trees. How much more so for human birth, which is so rarely encountered! Once this body decays, when will it be regained after ten thousand kalpas?\n\nThus I earnestly admonish and exhort you: diligently cultivate precepts, fast, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, prostrate in worship, burn incense, light lamps, give alms, and repent. Vow to deliver the living and liberate the dead; create images and copy scriptures; establish temples and build bridges; dig wells by the roadside to aid travelers and relieve the thirsty. Through countless expedient means, pave the path for all beings in the future. What do I seek in this? All sentient beings should reflect deeply.\n\nToday, in this grand assembly, as the scriptures teach and the Dharma reveals—whether in full or in part, beyond comprehension—we earnestly establish the foundation of blessings for ourselves and others, creating the path for the future. Now, as I bow in reverence and recite, let each of you be diligent. May these merits benefit all without limit, and may every sentient being receive their nourishment.\n\nThe repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, prays that these merits respond to the heart’s aspirations. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, I vow:\n\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Compassionate Venerable One.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True August and Mysterious Spirit.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Everlasting Radiance.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Perfect Dharma-Body.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Cloud Canopy.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Wisdom and Distant Illumination.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Stillness and Mysterious Essence.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Disperses Majestic Form.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Needs.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends Birth and Death.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Light.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Qi.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Origin.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Luminous Form.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Realizes the Dao.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Blessings and Longevity.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Response.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Culmen.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of True Inner Names.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Joyous Primordial Affinity.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Rescues from Suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Nation.",

May they together bestow their responsive grace to rescue and protect all beings. May the master of repentance, so-and-so, who undertakes this matter, obtain a response in accordance with their heart, all through the power of this repentance.\n\nMay the afflicted recover from illness, may calamities be averted, may those who have passed afar be reborn, may those who have recently departed attain liberation, may the living receive benefit, and may all their prayers be fulfilled. Furthermore, may the four kinds of birth and the six paths of existence all receive this grace; may the spirits of plants and trees, and the lingering souls of the forsaken, seize this auspicious opportunity to ascend together to the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Two: Repaying Kindness and Offering Merit**\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart and mind, reverently beseeching the Merciful Venerable One to universally bestow boundless merit and virtue upon all people. Now, the causes and effects of repaying kindness are expounded.\n\nThe master of repentance, so-and-so, humbly reflects and listens attentively to the scriptural words: When a person is born, Heaven and Earth serve as their model; they bear the yin and embrace the yang, receiving shelter within the womb, their life suspended by Heaven. The Heavenly Emperor then summons the Youth Who Records Lifespans to traverse the human realm, examining and measuring sins and blessings, the fortune or misfortune of men and women, the brevity or length of their lives. Every three days, a report is made; every seven days, a memorial is submitted; every hundred days, a record is finalized—unceasing even for a moment.\n\nIf one cultivates goodness and establishes merit, the Divine Youths of the Heavens, the Lords of Life and the Recorders of Deeds, will extend their years and eliminate calamities. If one commits sins and accumulates evil, the Heavenly Kings and the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens will seize their hun and po souls, bringing them before the Three Officials to have their consciousnesses collected. If one’s allotted lifespan is not fulfilled, it is due to the sins they have committed; if one completes their allotted lifespan, it is due to the goodness they have accumulated.\n\nWhen a person seeks to extend their lifespan, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Earthly Offices. The various Heavens and Emperors examine and verify according to the registers, determining life and death. They then dispatch the officials of the Three Realms and the Youth Who Observes Life to gather the spirit and soul, cutting off the breath of life. If a person is afflicted by prolonged illness, bedridden and gravely stricken, their life nearing its end, and if their family and kin, according to their means, establish a Daoist ritual, recite scriptures, and perform repentance—regardless of the number of scrolls—the family and kin may reverently face the various Heavens and Sages, confessing the karmic offenses of the sick person’s embodied existence, thereby releasing their spirit and soul, extending their lifespan, and restoring them to health.\n\nIf the great limit of life is imminent, one may still be rescued through the performance of extensive merit and virtue, dedicating it to the departed soul to spare them from suffering and distress. The living will face no hardship or terror. From the first seventh-day period after death to the three annual commemorations, during the days of ancestral remembrance, offerings of incense and lamps should be made tirelessly, day and night.\n\nWhy is this so? There are also the Youths Who Observe Life who monitor and report sins and blessings. If one enters the gate of life, blessings flow to their descendants, they do not linger in hell, and they suffer no karmic retribution. It is like a person initially entangled in a legal dispute, where the case remains unresolved—this is analogous to the situation of the newly deceased.\n\nThus, two spirits, one of good and one of evil, descend every ten days to inspect the household. For those who perform merit, the good spirit will advocate for them, enabling rebirth in Heaven. For those who do not perform merit, the evil spirit will record their deeds, leading them into confinement, causing their family to experience much fear and misfortune. If there is suffering, one may go to a Daoist abbey or remain at home, facing the image of the Venerable One, bowing to the manifest and hidden transformations, performing purification rituals and practicing the Dao, redeeming karmic offenses to attain liberation. Their names will be inscribed in the registers of immortals, and their bodies will dwell in carefree joy.\n\nSuch are the various causes and effects of repaying kindness and offering merit, which are foremost and truly worthy of praise. If there are good men and good women who, for the sake of their parents and all their kin, paint or sculpt images, construct halls, and vow with sincere faith to widely encourage and exhort others—such actions are inconceivable. All people, within the various dharmas, who arouse a single good thought or make a single vow, harboring a heart of gratitude and repayment, are called good fruits, and are inconceivable.\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, as spoken in the scriptures, reverently beseech the Merciful Venerable One to expound this Dharma gate of merit and virtue for all sentient beings, serving as a path through life and death—this is inconceivable.

May they, by the power of great compassion, the power of great mercy, the power of the Dao, and the power of the Dharma, universally illuminate the worlds below, the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu. May the master of repentance, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of descendants, teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all their kin—whether dwelling in the Three Evil Paths, yet to attain liberation, whether departed long ago or recently passed—all ascend today through sincere repentance. Regardless of the weight of their transgressions, may they together attain liberation and take refuge in the Great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Circulation of Teachings**\n\nToday, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, each with focused mind, take refuge and repent, gazing reverently upon the Compassionate Venerable One, to expound the teachings of salvation and the circulation of all dharmas.\n\nThe master of repentance, [Name], collects their thoughts and listens attentively as the scriptures are revealed: The Primordial Beginning, with one qi, transformed into three qi, dividing into the Three Heavens. The realms of the Three Clarities emerged from the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures. Thus, the Three Vehicles conjoined the soaring mystery of qi, naturally forming chapters—jade characters and golden writings, dragon scripts and phoenix seals—each a great square of one zhang, with eight corners radiating light. They taught the heavens and circulated through the worlds, turning the Dharma Wheel for five kalpas from beginning to end.\n\nThough heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all beings, guiding humans and gods across the Three Realms and ten directions, all receiving benefit.\n\nIt is asked: When did the Three Caverns descend to the world? Did they come simultaneously, or in succession?\n\nThe Compassionate Venerable One replied: At the beginning of each kalpa, the Cavern of Perfection descends to transform the world. People embraced virtue and power, dwelling in emptiness and non-being. All upheld the true and correct, attaining long life without death. Next, the Cavern of Mystery descended. The great simplicity had already declined, the pure wind had scattered, and people gradually became frivolous, losing the Dao and rebelling against virtue. Then, the Cavern of Spirit descended. People grew even more frivolous, failing to uphold the great teachings, turning from truth toward falsehood, their lifespans shortening. When the Three Caverns ceased to function, worldly wisdom flourished daily. Humans and ghosts intermingled, the kalpa’s end drew near, lifespans fell below a hundred years, impermanence prevailed in every thought, and ruin never ceased.\n\nI have descended again to proclaim the Three Caverns, spreading transformation among humanity, adapting to the capacities of each era, and propagating the scriptural teachings. Moreover, the Sacred Ancestors have manifested in the human realm to save and deliver sentient beings, expounding precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or Xia, whether sages or commoners, they pervaded the ten directions, universally enabling liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns, scattered throughout the world, exhorts sentient beings to diligently cultivate and practice.\n\nThose who accumulate transgressions and karmic burdens, sinking into evil paths, unable to believe and uphold the teachings, follow only falsehoods and various deceptive spirits. They exhaust body and mind, only to descend into hell. Those who believe in and uphold the great Dharma of the Three Caverns shall all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others escape through corpse liberation, their forms vanishing into hidden realms. Though their names and traces remain, they secretly traverse the unseen worlds, unknown to others.\n\nFurthermore, it is said: After I withdraw, demonic teachings will flourish. People will die young, wars, floods, and fires will follow one after another, diseases will linger, and suffering will persist day and night. Wealth and treasures will be exhausted in service to deceitful spirits, falsehoods will multiply daily, and the frivolous and deceitful will spread with the times. Hunger, cold, and misery will drive fathers and sons to wander, never awakening.\n\nAgain, I reflect upon you all, sunk in the depths of kalpas: I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind.\n\nMoreover, the scriptures teach sentient beings to recognize the root and origin, the causes of past lives, the retribution of sin and blessing, the auspicious and inauspicious, the gates of life and death, and the means of expedient practice. They urge turning from evil to embrace goodness, preserving life and nature, attaining long life and non-action, and taking refuge in the Great Dao. Those who preserve them shall receive blessings; those who cultivate them shall be divinely protected.\n\nThus, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, divine beings, and immortals of the heavens always desire that people diligently burn incense and repent, so that benevolent spirits will protect them and the multitude of sages will bestow their thoughts. If one bears transgressions, bound internally and externally, malevolent spirits will wreak havoc, diseases will afflict, and disasters—water, fire, blades, poisonous creatures, fierce beasts, shackles, and prisons—will bring inescapable suffering.\n\nIf one only adorns the exterior—face, clothing, hands, and feet—yet fails to inwardly cleanse the body, mind, roots of transgression, and evil karma, are they not foolish and deluded? Just as the face, hands, feet, and clothing, when diligently washed and scrubbed, must become pure.",

      "translated_text": "The Supreme Pole Perfected One spoke: When the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Accumulation World of the Heaven of Blessed Virtue, expounding the Dao amidst the assembly of celestial immortals, he thought of the Universally Beneficent Perfected One, who arose with fearless power and extended his mind of vast compassion. For the sake of all sentient beings, he inquired about karmic conditions and proclaimed the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones.\n\nAt that moment, the earth turned to the hue of refined gold, and the heavens rained down precious flowers, fragrant incense, and wondrous treasures, all drifting through the void to fill the space before the Dao, beyond count. \"All you sentient beings, you ought to believe and uphold this, exert yourselves with sincere devotion, propagate my teachings, and not allow external demons to disrupt and disturb the realm.\"\n\nWhen the Universally Beneficent Perfected One and the assembly of celestial beings heard these words, they wept in longing and admiration, choked with sorrow, as if they had lost their parents. They vowed that the Merciful Honored One would constantly admonish and instruct them, so that they might awaken and realize the supreme Dao.\n\nThereupon, the Universally Beneficent addressed the assembly of celestial immortals and sages: \"In the cities, towns, villages, and tranquil mountain forests of the lands in the ten directions, if there are diligent scholar-immortals, or pure and faithful officials and clansmen who protect and uphold the scriptures and repentances, reverently invoking the responsive titles of the transformation bodies—if they delight in paper and ink, copying and binding the scrolls with silk cords, adorning them with the seven treasures, and exhorting the people of the realm to bow in worship and make offerings as if facing the true form, unwavering day and night, circulating and proclaiming them so that those who have not heard may hear and those who have not seen may see—those who cultivate in accordance with the Dao shall be protected by the assemblies of celestial immortals, jade maidens, and the ten divisions of mighty spirits. Such persons shall forever attain peace and happiness, fulfill their aspirations, and this majestic power is inconceivable, like the boundless void, impossible to exhaust.\"\n\nToday, in this Daoist ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones are inconceivable. May all sentient beings—those who have already suffered or have yet to suffer—all attain liberation. The repentance master [Name] today prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, wholeheartedly invoking: \"We bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One, reverently paying homage to the true sages.\"\n\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering at the sound of cries.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Divine Grotto.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who harmonizes spirits and benefits beings.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who embodies the myriad virtues.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless illumination.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of perfect fulfillment in the myriad practices.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of primordial yang’s transformative measure.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who expounds the Dao and pervades transformation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the six penetrations who relieves suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of true intention.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who roams and abides.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lotus Flower.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of silent contemplation.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the lofty perfected.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of unimpeded freedom.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal moisture and non-action.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who universally ferries across like a boat and oar.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of supreme virtue and luminous countenance.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who bestows longevity and preserves life.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s wishes.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of universal compassion who protects the realm.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless expanse.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the ocean of merit and virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Universally Beneficent Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Universally Saving Perfected One.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Greatly Compassionate Perfected One who rescues from suffering.\nWith sincere devotion, we pay homage to the Greatly Merciful Perfected One who extracts transgressions.\n\nToday, the repentance master of this ritual assembly and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the lower realm, the various Honored Ones and sages, the lofty immortals of the Golden Towers, the sagely emperors of the Jade Capital, the dragon spirits and earth gods, the true officials of villages and domains, the celestial immortals and lords of the grotto-heavens, the assemblies of immortals throughout the ten directions, the entire expanse of the mysterious void, and all the manifested true sages—by their inconceivable power and boundless merit and virtue—may enable the repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, to uplift the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages, the recently departed and the long-deceased, parents and the six relations, and all kin. Through this repentance, may they transcend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss, not linger in the three evil destinies, nor tread the five sufferings. May all living kin, close and distant relatives, and all branches of the family tree attain lasting peace and be forever free from suffering.\n\nMoreover, may those who seek to avert misfortune, those who seek to repay karmic debts, those burdened by karma, and those afflicted by illness—all, by the power of this repentance, forever rely on the great Dao.\n\nOne bow.\n\nChapter Four: Manifest Verification and True Realization\n\nToday, in this ritual assembly, each person directs their mind, bows in homage, and takes refuge, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, manifesting the repentance dharma and verifying the karmic conditions. The repentance master [Name], gathering their mind and kneeling reverently, listens attentively to the scriptural words: \"The Dao gives rise to the one qi, which divides and transforms into the three powers. Responding to the world, it establishes names and manifests titles according to conditions, pervading the dharma-realm, as numerous as the grains of dust. Furthermore, there are accomplished scholar-immortals who have ascended to the highest ranks among the heavens, also beyond count.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, serving as rulers, kings, queens, consorts, dukes, and the people of the realm, as well as the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, teachers, parents, themselves, and all kin—even those in the three evil destinies, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, and the nine dark realms—who day and night practice the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, light lamps, and bow in worship to the titles of the Heavenly Worthies, then the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions and their countless assemblies will together come to witness and record their merits among the heavens. Their own blessings and longevity shall be boundless, disasters will vanish, transgressions will be extinguished, the realm will be at peace, the people will be at ease, the three evil destinies will cease their opposition, the five sufferings will halt their bitterness, and all stagnant sentient beings will attain liberation.\"",

Let all men and women copy, enshrine, and reverently recite them, and they shall invoke the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, the Vajra Warriors, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits to guard their lands and protect their people. If one establishes images wherever one dwells, the merit shall be immeasurable.\n\nIf there be male or female officials of the Dharma-body who, on the ten straight days of the first and last of the month, the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, the days of their own life-destiny and the Geng-Shen, and the assemblies of the twelfth month, wish for the peace of the realm, quiet their minds, and silently recite the titles of the Heavenly Worthy, then they shall be met by immortals descending to receive them, and cloud-cranes coming to welcome them.\n\nIf one extols and praises, exhorting all men and women to receive, uphold, and recite these sacred images, the merit is truly inconceivable.\n\nIf there be sentient beings who, upon seeing the compassionate titles of the Heavenly Worthy, harbor disbelief, slight the Dharma-treasure, and doubt or slander the sacred texts, know that such persons have, from kalpas without measure, sunk into the lower ghosts, enduring manifold sufferings and passing through strange forms, only now to be reborn into the human realm. Foolish and blind, they comprehend nothing, habituated to evil causes, unable to believe or revere.\n\nIf there be sentient beings who, upon hearing this repentance ritual—be it a single sentence, a single verse, a single title, a single bow—generate a mind of faith, know that such persons in former lives once entered the jeweled city, heard the wondrous Dharma, and entered the jeweled treasury, where they personally read and recited. Now reborn, their faith and devotion only deepen.\n\nIf one initially holds this repentance ritual in reverence but later regrets, ceasing to bow or recite, and allows the mind to grow indolent, know that such a person, though possessing a human body, has not yet severed their strange forms. After this life’s transgressions, they shall again fall into evil destinies, suffering for ten thousand kalpas without hope of liberation.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate completed the transmission of the scripture, and the Master of Mystic Words bowed his head in reverence and thanks. Then, moved by the true words, he received the seven transformative titles of the Heavenly Worthy, to be imparted to sentient beings for the salvation of the living and the deliverance of the dead. Thus, all beings shall be shown how to recite them without neglecting the sacred teachings.\n\nToday, in this ritual arena, the repentance-master [Name], prostrating for [specific matter], bows in worship to this repentance text. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he raises his thought, bows his head to the Compassionate Worthy, and reverently salutes the true sages:\n\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Titles.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades All Actions.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wisdom.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Non-Action.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Fills Empty Space.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Purity.\nWith a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Conditions.\n\nToday, the repentance-master of this ritual arena and the great assembly, looking up, vow that the Seven Transformative Titles of the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure from the ten directions shall together lend their virtuous power to shelter and protect all beings. May the repentance-master [Name] fulfill his heart’s wishes, and may all karmic retributions and opposing forces be dissolved. May all living kin be free from obstacles and calamities, their misfortunes severed. Further, may they gain keen intelligence and profound virtue, their merits complete and their conduct perfected, their official and scholarly aspirations fulfilled, their achievements towering, their honors ever-renewed. May inner and outer realms alike know well-being, with superiors and inferiors in proper order. May weapons be stilled, winds and rains timely, and longevity prolonged. May their names be inscribed on jade tablets, one act of merit repaid ten thousandfold, eternally without end. Life after life, may they forever escape sinking and drowning. May their descendants continue for a hundred million years.\"",
