  "full_translation": "**\"The Inner Landscape Classic of the Yellow Court: Chapter One of the Highest Clarity – Before the Purple Mist Sovereign of the Highest Clarity**\n\nThe Highest Dao Sovereign, Lord of the Jade Dawn,\nIn leisure dwells within the Reed-Pearl Palace,\nTransforming the Five Forms and dispersing myriad spirits—\nThis is the Yellow Court, called the Inner Classic.\n\nWith a heart like a zither, thrice resonant,\nDancing in the embryo of the Immortal—\nThe Nine Qi radiant, emerging from the celestial expanse,\nA spirit child born, veiled in purple mist.\n\nThis is the Jade Scripture, to be refined with care,\nSinging it ten thousand times ascends to the Three Heavens.\nA thousand calamities dissolve, a hundred ailments cured—\nFearless before the ferocity of tiger and wolf,\nEven old age is repelled, and eternal youth prolonged.\n\n**Chapter Two of the Highest Clarity – The Celestial Framework**\n\nAbove, the soul and spirit;\nBelow, the vital essence of the *Guān Yuán* (關元).\nTo the left, the *Shào Yáng* (少陽);\nTo the right, the *Tài Yīn* (太陰).\nBehind, the secret gate;\nBefore, the birth gate—\nInhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, preserving breath.\n\nWhere the vital essence converges, the starry hosts are divided,\nAnd the purple mist ascends and descends, the Three Pure Ones’ clouds.\nIt irrigates the Five Palaces, nurturing the spirit root,\nThe Seven Elixirs flow through the cavern, surging toward the *Lú* (庐).\nReturning to the purple, embracing the yellow, entering the *Dān Tián* (丹田),\nThe hidden chamber’s light illuminates the *Yáng Mén* (陽門).\n\n**Chapter Three on the Mouth – The Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Bureau**\n\nThe mouth is the Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Bureau,\nRinsing and swallowing the elixir, no calamity remains.\nThe body emits radiance, its qi fragrant as orchid-lantern,\nRepelling and extinguishing a hundred malevolent forces—\nThe jade refines the countenance.\n\nIf one diligently practices, one may ascend to *Guǎng Hàn* (廣寒).\nDay and night without rest, the True Way is achieved—\nThunder roars, lightning flashes, the spirit merges and dissolves.\n**Chapter Four on the Yellow Court**.\"\n\n**Chapter Five on the Central Pool**\n\nWithin the Yellow Court, the inner person wears brocade robes,\nPurple flowers fluttering skirts, clouds of qi woven fine.\nCrimson and verdant branches—emerald spirits’ willows—\nSeven jade *yuè* (玉龠) sealed, twin doors shut tight.\nDouble fans guard the golden gate, mechanisms sealed deep,\nMysterious springs in lofty halls, their grandeur sublime.\nWithin the Three Fields, vital essence grows faint—\nA graceful maiden, slender, veiled in celestial glow.\nThe Hall of Grand Splendor shines with eightfold might,\nHeaven’s Court and Earth’s Gate arrayed like cauldrons and axes.\nThe Spirit Platform, firm and unyielding, never decays.\n\n**Chapter Six on the Celestial Center**\n\nWithin the Central Pool, the spirit wears crimson pearls,\nSilken robes of cloud-dyed crimson, sashes bearing tiger talismans.\nThe Crossed Ford, three inches wide, is where the spirit dwells—\nHidden mushrooms, shadowed and dense, mutually supporting.\nThe Celestial Center’s peak: if one practices with precision,\nThe Cloud Abode clears, the Jade Emperor takes flight.\nPaths open, unending, without rest.\nBrows bear the *huàgài* (華蓋) canopy, covering bright pearls.\nNine Abysses—sun and moon—pierce the void, empty.\nWithin the dwelling lies the True Constant Robe of elixir:\nIf one sees it, no ailment shall plague them.\nCrimson pearls, luminous skirts, radiant as *huāxiān* (華茜),\nBeneath the tongue, the *yīngxián* (膺玄) generates the shore of life and death.\nEmerging from green, entering black—two breaths resplendent.\nIf you encounter this, you ascend to the Celestial River.\n\n**Chapter Seven on the Ultimate Dao**\n\nThe Ultimate Dao requires no labor—its secret lies in authenticity.\nThe *níwán* (泥丸) and hundred joints each hold spirit:\nThe spirit of hair is *Cānghuá* (苍华), named *Tàiyuán* (太元),\nThe brain’s spirit-root is named *Níwán*.\nThe spirit of eyes is *Míngshàng* (明上), named *Yīngxuán* (英玄),\nThe spirit of the nose is *Yùlóng* (玉垄), named *Língjiān* (灵坚),\nThe spirit of ears is *Kōngxián* (空闲), named *Yōutián* (幽田),\nThe spirit of the tongue is *Tōngmìng* (通命), named *Zhènglún* (正伦),\nThe spirit of teeth is *Éfēng* (峨峰), named *Luōqiān* (罗千).\nThe spirit of the face is governed by the *níwán*.\nThe *níwán* holds nine true essences, each with its chamber—\nSquare and round, one inch in measure, here they reside.\nWithin, the inner person wears purple robes, flying skirts of silk.\nBut think on this one truth, and longevity knows no end.\nNot separate dwellings—all within the brain they sit,\nRanked in order, facing outward.\nEach exists in the heart, corresponding as one.\n\n**Chapter Eight on the Heart-Spirit**\n\n**Chapter Nine on the Lungs**\nThe spirit of the heart is *Dānyuán* (丹元), named *Shǒulíng* (守灵).\nThe spirit of the lungs is *Hàohuá* (皓华), named *Xūchéng* (虚成),\nThe spirit of the liver is *Lóngyān* (龙烟), named *Táimíng* (台明)—\n*Yìyù* (翳郁) guides the *yān* (烟), mastering

exist, ensuring eternal vitality.\nThe lungs are the ninth chamber—\nTheir office resembles a *huágài* (华盖).\nBelow sits a child in *Yùquè* (玉阙).\nThe seven *yuán* (元) children regulate the *qi* (气).\nThey correspond externally to *Zhōngyuè* (中岳)—the nose and navel.\nWearing robes of white silk and a yellow cloud sash,\nTheir panting breath reveals a body unwell.\nSwiftly preserve the *Bái Yuán* (白元) and harmonize the six *qi* (气).\nThe immortals, long observing, face no calamity.\nEmploying them ceaselessly brings no stagnation.\n\n**Chapter Ten on the Heart**\nThe heart’s chamber is *Lián hán huá* (莲含华).\nBelow dwell children of the *Dānyuán* (丹元) family.\nThey govern the adaptation to cold and heat, harmonizing the *róngwèi* (荣卫).\nWearing robes of red silk, flying skirts of jade, with golden bells and crimson sashes,\nThey sit upon the *Póshā* (婆裟).\nThey regulate blood and command life, preventing bodily withering.\nExternally, they correspond to the mouth and tongue, manifesting the five *huá* (华).\nAt the brink of death, call upon them, and revival follows.\nPracticed diligently, one ascends as the *Tàixiá* (太霞).\n\n**Chapter Eleven on the Liver**\nThe liver’s chamber is *Cuìchóng lǐ* (翠重里).\nBelow sits the *Shén Gōngzǐ* (神公子), a green child.\nThey oversee all *guān* (关), mirroring wisdom and clarity.\nWearing robes of green silk, jade skirts, and golden bells,\nThey harmonize and temper the soul and spirit, balancing *jīnyè* (津液).\nExternally, they correspond to the eyes—*rìyuè* (日月) clarity.\nA hundred remedies dwell here, none lacking.\nUsed together for seven days, they become fully replenished.\nAt the brink of death, focus on the spirit, and life returns.\nCapturing the soul and restoring the spirit ensures no decline.\n\n**Chapter Twelve on the Kidneys**\nThe kidneys’ chamber is *Xuányīn pǔ* (玄阴圃).\nWithin sits the *Míngshàng Xuán* (冥上玄) child.\nThey oversee the six *fǔ* (府) and nine *yè* (液) sources.\nExternally, they correspond to the two ears and hundred *yè* (液).\nWearing robes of dark silk and cloud-patterned attire, they dance with *lóngpán* (龙潘).\nAscending, they bring forth *díxiá* (的霞)—*rìyuè* (日月) mist.\nA thousand calamities and diseases demand urgent preservation.\nThe two *shuǐwáng* (水王) face the *shēngmén* (生门).\nThey enable eternal life, ascending to the ninth heaven.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen on the Spleen**\nThe spleen’s office belongs to *Wùyǐ* (戌已).\nWithin sits the *Míngtóng* (明童), clad in yellow.\nThey dissolve grains and disperse *qi*, preserving teeth.\nThey are the *Tàicāng* (太仓) dual *míngtóng* (明童),\nSitting within the nine-layered *Jīnhéchéng* (金合城).\nSquare and round, one inch—the *mìngmén* (命门) chamber.\nThey regulate the hundred grains and five *zhǔxiāng* (朱香).\nThey repel *xūyíng* (虚赢) and prevent injury.\nExternally, they correspond to the *chǐzhái* (尺宅) and its fragrant *qìsè* (气色).\nThe luminous *huá* (华) manifests clearly.\nWearing yellow silk and jade robes with tiger-patterned sashes,\nThey reflect the *Sānlǎozǐ* (三老子) in lightness and grace.\nThe high immortals attain eternal life, far from death’s reach.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen on the Gallbladder**\nThe gallbladder’s chamber is the six *fǔ* (府) essence.\nWithin sits the *Yào Wēimíng* (曜威明) child.\nEight thunderous vibrations shake the *yùjīng* (玉旌).\nThe *lóngqí* (龙旗) waves across the sky, hurling *fǎlíng* (火铃).\nThey command all *qìlì* (气力) and control the *hǔbīng* (虎兵).\nExternally, they correspond to the *yǎn tóng* (眼童) and *bízhù* (鼻柱).\nThey support the brain’s hair, making it vibrant.\nWearing nine-colored silk robes and green *huákūn* (华裙),\nThey adorn golden sashes and jade *lónghǔwén* (龙虎文).\nThey can preserve clarity, ascending upon the *chéngyún* (庆云).\nThey command ten thousand spirits, bowing to the *Sānyuán* (三元).\n\n**Chapter Fifteen on the Length of the Spine**\nThe spine’s length is marked—\n\n**Chapter Fifteen on the Length of the Spleen**\nThe spleen stretches one *chǐ* to veil the *Tàicāng* (太倉).\nWithin its chamber, *Lǎojūn* (老君) forges the *Míngtáng* (明堂).\nIts name is *Língyuán* (靈元), *Hùnkāng* (混康) by virtue.\nIt heals a hundred maladies, consumes the grain of life.\nIn yellow robes and purple sashes, bearing *lónghǔ* (龍虎) emblems,\nIt lengthens what withers, sustains life through the sovereign’s grace.\nThree invocations of its name—spirits respond in kind.\nThree elders sit together, each with their own retinue—\nSome refined, some embryonic, each holding their own method.\n*Táohái* (桃孩) unites to prolong the *Shēnghuá* (生華).\nMale and female *Yóuyóu* (徊尤) bear the *Táokāng* (桃康).\n*Dàofù* (道父) and *Dàomǔ* (道母) face each other across.\n*Shīfù* (師父) and *Shīmǔ* (師母) dwell in the *Dānxián* (丹玄) realm.\nOne may ascend the *Xūkōng* (虚空) through contemplation.\nDivergent paths converge at the final essence.\nClose the *Sānguān* (三關), grasp firmly and pause.\nSwallow golden *jīnlì* (金醴), ingest *yùyīng* (玉英).\nThus, hunger vanishes, the *sānchóng* (三蟲) perish.\nMind and intent remain harmonious, joy unbounded.\nThe *Wǔyuè* (五岳) clouds rise, *Pénghéng* (彭亨) in might.\nThey nourish the *Yùlú* (玉庐), repaying themselves in kind.\nThe five forms remain unbroken, free from calamity.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen on Upper Vision**\nUpper vision beholds the *Sānyuán* (三元) like linked pearls,\nScattered luminous scenes illuminating the nine quarters.\nThe *Wǔlíng* (五靈) night torches blaze across the eight regions.\nThe *Nèihuáng* (內皇) abides within—let us wander together.\nClad in wind-garments, bearing the *hǔfú* (虎符),\nOne arrives swiftly, soon ascending to the void.\nWithin the *fāngcùn* (方寸), deep thoughts are concealed.\nNot square, not round—windows and shutters sealed,\nThe three spirits return essence, vigor renewed.\n*Sǔn* and *pò* (魂魄) guard internally, uncompetitive.\nSpirit is born in the abdomen, clutching a jade *yuán* (珰).\n*Sù* (靈) flows into the *yōuqù* (幽阙)—how could it be lost?\nThe *Lín* (琳) banners stretch ten thousand *zhǐ*—\nThe three *hún* (魂) rest in peace by imperial decree.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen on the Spiritual Platform**\nThe *Língtái* (靈台) is dense with mist, gazing upon the yellow wilderness.\nA three-*cùn* (寸) chamber holds high and low.\nBetween the *jiànxué* (間阙) and *yíngwèi* (營衛), the *Gāoxuān* (高玄) receives.\nThe *Dòngfáng* (洞房) stands at the *Zǐjí* (紫极), the sacred threshold.\nThis was revealed by the *Tàishàng* (太上) of old—\nTo my left, the *Shén Gōngzǐ* (神公子) speaks divine words.\nTo my right, the *Bái Yuán* (白元) stands without.\nWithin the *Míngtáng* (明堂), the *Jīnxīà* (金匮) and *Yùfáng* (玉房) lie between.\nThe *Shàngqīng* (上清) man stands before me.\nIn yellow robes, his *dānqì* (丹氣) swirls ceaselessly.\nAsked where he resides, he points to the space between the brows.\nWithin, the *Rìyuè* (日月) and *Xiù* (宿) array themselves.\nThe seven luminaries and nine *yuán* (元) crown the *Shēngmén* (生門).\n\n**Chapter Eighteen on the Three Passes**\nWithin the three passes, *jīngqì* (精氣) runs deep.\nIn the nine *Wēi* (微), darkness and obscurity dwell.\nThe mouth is the *Tiānguān* (天關), the seat of spirit-machinery.\nThe feet are the *Dìguān* (地關), where life’s vitality wanes.\nThe hands are the *Rénguān* (人關), governing flourish and decay.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen on Obtaining [the Dao]**\nIf one obtains the three officials and preserves the *Xuándān* (玄丹),\nThe *Tàiyī* (太一) flows its pearl upon *Kūnlún* (昆仑).\nLayered towers and pavilions encircle twelve times—\nAscending from high to low, all are true persons.\nThe *Yùtáng* (玉堂) deciphers characters of the *Xuánguān* (玄官).\nThe *Xuánhu* (璇玑) and *Wánghéng* (王衡) annihilate the *Lán* (蘭).\nGazing upon the child seated on the *Pánhéng* (盤恒),\nWho asks, *\"Whose child am I within my body?\"*\nThis person may depart, entering the *Nílóng* (泥龍).\nThousands upon thousands connect in unbroken lines,\nEach ten, each hundred, like towering mountains.\n*Yún Yí* (雲儀) of the five *Huá* (華) stands at the ear-gate.\nThe *Chìdì* (赤帝) and *Huánglǎo* (黃老) share my soul.\nThe three *Zhēn* (真) escort *Xūshū* (胥吏) to the *Fángjīn* (房津).\nThe five *Dǒu* (斗) shine brightly as the seven *Yuán* (元).\nThe sun and moon traverse the six *Hé* (合).\nThe imperial domain lies at the center of heaven and earth’s threshold.\nWithin the face, *hún* and *shén* (神) intertwine eternally.\n\n**Chapter Twenty on Breathing**\nBreathe the *yuángqì* (元氣) to seek immortality—\nThe *Xiāngōng* (仙公) and *Gōngzǐ* (公子) now approach.\nThe *Zhūniǎo* (朱鳥) inhales and exhales from the *Báishí* (白石) source.\nCondense essence, nurture the embryo, transform the body.\nRetain the embryo, preserve essence—thus, eternal life.\nThe three *qì* (氣) hover to the right, illuminating the nine paths.\nThe *Zhēnyī* (正一) contains the *huā* (華), filling completely.\nGazing afar, the mind is like the *Luóxīng* (羅星).\nBeneath the *Jīnshì* (金室), it may not topple.\nExtend my white hair, return to infancy.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One on the Jade Chamber**\nWithin the *Qióngshì* (琼室), the *Tàisù* (太素) gathers.\nThe *Ní* (泥) Nine Ladies stand at its center.\nThe *Chánggǔ* (長谷) *Xuánxiāng* (玄鄉) encircles the suburbs.\nThe six *lóng* (龍) scatter, flying—difficult to distinguish.\nTo prolong life, be most cautious in the *fángzhōng* (房中).\nWhy die and cause the spirits to weep?\nSudden calamity strikes the three *líng* (靈).\nBut inhale the breath, record the child-essence.\nAn inch of field, a foot of dwelling—life may be governed.\nIf one must drain the sea, read it a hundred times.\nWhen the leaf falls, the tree withers, losing its verdure.\nWhen *qì* dissipates and *yè* (液) leaks, the form is no longer one’s own.\nSeal tightly, guard the scene—thus, enduring peace.\nPreserve my *Nílóng* (泥龍) and the three *Qí* (奇) spirits.\nSerene and detached, vision turns inward, self-illuminating.\nThings do not intrude—tranquility prevails.\nAlas, if one neglects this, old age returns like a thief.\nMeditate on the *Yùshū* (玉書) of the *Tàishàngqīng* (太上清).\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Constant Meditation**\nConstantly meditate on the three chambers’ interconnectedness.\nPerceive the void—no inner, no outer.\nPreserve and rinse the five *yá* (牙), free from hunger and thirst.\n*Sùhuá* (神華) holds the towel; the six *Dīng* (丁) pay homage.\nGuard the *Jīngshì* (精室) carefully, lest essence be wasted.\nSeal it and treasure it—thus, longevity.\nRising from the body’s depths, it is never distant.\nThe three officials are near, easily concealed within the *Yì* (易).\nEmpty and still, the void within is pristine.\nIf the form is thus, it should not be defiled.\nThe nine chambers stand in perfect emptiness, the abode of spirit.\nStore thoughts, regulate actions—six *fǔ* (府) must be refined.\nThen, soaring freely, one enters the celestial path.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three on Nurturing Life**\nThe Dao of nurturing life is simple, not burdensome.\nCultivate *Dòngxuān* (洞玄) and the *Yùpiān* (玉篇).\nPractice the eight *jǐng* (景) within the form—\nTwenty-four *Zhēn* (真) emerge naturally.\nElevated and unforced, *húnpò* (魂魄) find peace.\nThe *Qīngjìng* (清靜) spirit speaks to me.\nWhere does it reside? Between the purple curtains.\nStanding or sitting outside, the three-five *Xuán* (玄) gather.\nBurning incense, extending hands before the *Yùhuá* (玉華),\nTogether, we enter the *Tàishì* (太室), the *Xuánhu* (璇玑) gate.\nHigh and serene, the *Tiǎndàn* (恬澹) garden of the Dao.\nThe inner spirit gazes deeply—truth is revealed.\nThe true person dwells within—do not seek beyond.\nWhere else would one search for causes and effects?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four on Concealing One’s Presence**\nConceal your form, differ from the world.\nRetain the breath, nourish the essence—lips like vermilion.\nCarry the *Xìngmìng* (性命), guard the void.\nThe *Dàshàngqīng* (大上清) removes death’s record.\nThe three spirits rejoice in seclusion.\nSwiftly wandering, free from sorrow.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five on the Five Phases**\nFeathered robes complete, the eight winds drive—\nReining the chariot of three silks, riding the morning’s glow.\nThe golden palanquin stands firm, following the jade carriage—\nWhy not ascend the mountain to recite my scriptures?\n\nThe *Yùyù* (郁郁) caverns conceal the true person’s ruins.\nEntering the mountain—what difficulty? Yet hesitation lingers.\nThe world’s turmoil stinks like rotten grain, swirling chaos.\n\nThe Five Phases shift yet return to One.\nThree-five *qi* converges, nine-nine rhythms align.\nOne may employ the hidden earth to restore the eight methods.\nThe *Fùniú* (伏牛) seclusion, the *Yōuqióng* (幽阙) ranks arrayed—\nThe Three Clarities bloom at life’s threshold.\nThe *Dòngfáng* (洞房) spirit-forms contend with sun and moon.\nFather is the *Níwán* (泥丸), Mother the *Cīyī* (雌一).\nThe Three Lights radiant, entering the *Zǐshì* (子室).\nPreserve the *Xuánzhēn* (玄真)—all matters complete.\nOne’s spirit-essence must not be lost.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six on High Flight**\nHigh flight—sun and moon, my Dao ascends.\n*Yùyí* (郁仪) binds the phosphorescence, well-guarded.\nThen the *Yùqīng* (玉清) Old One of void appears,\nCapable of reversing age, filling the blood-brain.\nMouth holding the spirit-beam, bearing the Five Sovereigns,\nWaist girded with the Tiger Ledger, jade pendants hung.\nSwiftly ascending, meeting life’s banquet at *Dōngméng* (东蒙).\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven on the Primordial Origin**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight on the Immortal**\n\nRefine the primordial soul and vital breath—\nOne thing, vast and mighty, now revealed.\nOnly the utmost truth allows a glance—\nBeware the deadly *qi* and filth of death.\nThe Six Spirits gather in the void, at ease.\nForm the pearl, secure the essence, nurture the spirit-root.\nJade spoon and golden key ever firm and whole.\nClose the mouth, curl the tongue, consume the fetal fluid—\nThus I attain refinement, grasp the flying immortal.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine on the True Person**\n\nThe Immortal, the Daoist—no divine essence they possess,\nBut accumulated essence and *qi* make them true.\nThe Yellow Boy’s subtle tones are hard to hear,\nJade scrolls and red tablets bear the sacred text.\nTheir name: *Zhēnrén*—golden cap, golden veil.\nShouldering armor, holding talismans, they open the Seven Gates.\nFire soldiers and talismans guard the spirit pass.\nAdvance with head high, retreat with humility, arrayed above and below.\nWielding a sword a hundred *zhang* long, they dance with silk banners.\nTen miracles swirl in empty space, their fire-bells tolling through the clouds.\nWhere are they stationed? Between the brows at the Yellow Gate—\nThis is not branch or leaf, but the true root.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine on the Purple Clarity**\n\n**Chapter Thirty on the Purple Clarity**\n\nThe Purple Clarity, the Sovereign of the High Dao,\nThe Lord of the Great Mysterious and Great Harmony stands firm and upright.\nHe transforms and gives birth to all things, making me an Immortal.\nAscending in flight to the Ten Heavens, he rides the Jade Wheel.\nDay and night, seven days without respite, he thinks without sleep.\nIf the child can practice this, they may live eternally.\nAccumulating merit and refining essence is not innate—\nIt comes from sincerity and steadfastness.\nWithin, he guards the unshakable essence, the truest of truths.\nIn emptiness, he remains tranquil and serene, attaining spirit naturally.\n**Chapter Thirty of the Hundred Grains**\n\nThe Hundred Grains are the essence of the Earth’s soil,\nFive flavors beyond, the stench of demons and spirits clings.\nFoulness disrupts the divine clarity, and the prenatal *qi* vanishes.\nHow then does one return to youth and reclaim infancy?\nThe Three *hún* spirits drift, the *pò* soul crumbles and collapses.\nWhy not eat the *qi* of the Great Harmony’s essence?\nThus, one may not die—Great Yellow is at peace.\n**Chapter Thirty-One on the Heart Canon**\n\nThe Heart Canon is one body, the sovereign of the Five *Zàng* Organs.\nIn motion and stillness, its thoughts are the Dao of virtue and power.\nPure and clean, it nurtures good *qi*, radiating natural light.\nWhether seated or standing, it is my shared foundation.\nBy day, it governs the seven orifices;

(昆仑).\nLayered towers and pavilions encircle twelve times—\nAscending from high to low, all are true persons.\nThe *Yùtáng* (玉堂) deciphers characters of the *Xuánguān* (玄官).\nThe *Xuánhu* (璇玑) and

(元氣) to seek immortality—\nThe *Xiāngōng* (仙公) and *Gōngzǐ* (公子) now approach.\nThe *Zhūniǎo* (朱鳥) inhales and exhales from the *Báishí* (白石) source.\nCondense essence, nurture the embryo, transform the body.\nRetain the embryo, preserve essence—thus, eternal life.\nThe three *qì* (氣) hover to the right, illuminating the nine paths.\nThe *Zhēnyī* (正一) contains the *huā* (華), filling completely.\nGazing afar, the mind is like the *Luóxīng* (羅星).\nBeneath the *Jīnshì* (金室), it may not topple.\nExtend my white hair, return to infancy.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One on the Jade

flying—difficult to distinguish.\nTo prolong life, be most cautious in the *fángzhōng* (房中).\nWhy die and cause the spirits to weep?\nSudden calamity strikes the three *líng* (靈).\nBut inhale the breath, record the child-essence.\nAn inch of field, a foot of dwelling—life may be governed.\nIf one must drain the sea, read it a hundred times.\nWhen the leaf falls, the tree withers, losing its verdure.\nWhen *qì* dissipates and *yè* (液) leaks, the form is no longer one’s own.\nSeal tightly, guard the scene—thus, enduring peace.\nPreserve my *Nílóng* (泥龍) and the three *Qí* (奇) spirits.\nSerene and detached, vision turns inward, self-illuminating.\nThings do not intrude—tranquility prevails.\nAlas, if one neglects this, old age returns like a thief.\nMeditate on the *Yùshū* (玉書) of the *Tàishàngqīng* (太上清).\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two on Constant Meditation**\nConstantly meditate on the three chambers’ interconnectedness.\nPerceive the void—no inner, no outer.\nPreserve and rinse the five *yá* (牙), free from hunger and thirst.\n*Sùhuá* (神華) holds the towel; the six *Dīng* (丁) pay homage.\nGuard the *Jīngshì* (精室) carefully, lest essence be wasted.\nSeal it and treasure it—thus, longevity.\nRising from the body’s depths, it is never distant.\nThe three officials are near, easily concealed within the *Yì* (易).\nEmpty and still, the void within is pristine.\nIf the form is thus, it should not be defiled.\nThe nine chambers stand in perfect emptiness, the abode of spirit.\nStore thoughts, regulate actions—six *fǔ* (府) must be refined.\nThen, soaring freely, one enters the celestial path.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three on Nurturing Life**\nThe Dao of nurturing life is simple, not burdensome.\nCultivate *Dòngxuān* (洞玄) and the *Yùpiān* (玉篇).\nPractice the eight
