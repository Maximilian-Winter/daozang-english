  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Workings of Elixir Refinement: Ultimate Principles**\n\n**Preface**\nThe *Wondrous Workings of Elixir Refinement: Ultimate Principles* (author unknown) cites Qingxiazi, Zhang Guo, Liu Haichan, and the *Lingbao Bifa*, suggesting its origins in the Northern Song. Primarily discussing *waidan* (external alchemy), it also touches upon *neidan* (internal alchemy). One scroll, sourced from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, *Methods* category.\n\n**The Wondrous Workings of Elixir Refinement: Ultimate Principles**\n\nThose who cultivate life do so for the sake of the body. When the body is preserved, spirit abides; when spirit abides, perfection is attained. This necessarily requires the ingestion of supreme medicines, thereby achieving numinous penetration. Yet the sages and worthies of antiquity were often versed in this art. Why, then, do later admirers and learners exhaust their wealth and resources, toiling to old age without ever attaining it? It is not merely that they obscure their own vision and lose the transmitted teachings, but also that they rely on limited knowledge, thus never fully grasping the ultimate principles.\n\nSome swallow saliva and guide *qi*, believing this to be cultivation. Others abandon form and stabilize wisdom, calling it the \"True One.\" Still others take the dregs of the Five Metals and Eight Stones, recklessly smelting them in hopes of success. These are all vulgar and shallow practices, far from the profound and wondrous essence of the Dao. Though this path may be expounded in many ways, the cause of transcending the mundane lies solely in the method of *huandan* (returning elixir).\n\nBorn in fortunate times, I have received the transmission from my teacher. How could I dare to keep this solely for myself? Thus, I humbly compose nine chapters, titled *The Fire Phases Formula*, compiled into one scroll to guide those who come after. Scholars of the Dao, do not lightly reveal this to others, lest you incur transgressions and implicate your nine ancestors and seven generations—be cautious, be most cautious.\n\n---\n\n**1. Hexagram Qi**\nThe Dao arises from the One, and the One is the ancestor of the medicine. Thus, it begins in the eleventh month: at the Winter Solstice, one *yang* arises as *Fu* (Return), two *yang* as *Lin* (Approach), three *yang* as *Tai* (Peace), four *yang* as *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), five *yang* as *Gua* (Decay), and six *yang* as *Qian* (Heaven). At the Summer Solstice in the fifth month, one *yin* arises as *Gou* (Encounter), two *yin* as *Dun* (Retreat), three *yin* as *Pi* (Stagnation), four *yin* as *Guan* (Contemplation), five *yin* as *Bo* (Splitting), and six *yin* as *Kun* (Earth). Beginning with one *yang* and completing its ascent and descent, the twelve hexagram qi fulfill their work.\n\nThe medicine in the crucible is like a child in the womb: water above, fire below, harmonizing *yin* and *yang*. It acquires the sour taste of Wood, the pungent taste of Metal, the bitter taste of Fire, the salty taste of Water, and in the end, returning to the Central Palace through the four seasons, it gains the sweet taste of Earth.\n\n---\n\n**2. Fire Phases**\nFrom the Winter Solstice, *yang* *qi* arises at *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring), and the hexagram *Fu* governs, culminating in *Qian*—six hexagrams form the *yang* phase. At the Summer Solstice, *yang* reaches its peak and *yin* is born; *Gou* governs, culminating in *Kun*—six hexagrams form the *yin* phase. Over twelve months, the twenty-four qi operate in concert, aligning with the celestial tally of 360 degrees. Day and night, following the clepsydra’s marks, one seizes the correct *qi* to refine mercury and lead in the divine crucible—this is the pivotal mechanism of firing.\n\nIn a year of 360 days, totaling 4,320 hours, each day and night corresponds to one hexagram. Completing 720 hexagrams, one seizes 4,320 years of correct *qi* within the golden crucible. The sage condenses this: in one month of 360 hours, corresponding to 360 hexagram lines, it aligns with the 360 days of a year’s phase. Thus, one seizes 4,320 years of correct *qi* within a single month.\n\nFurther condensing these sixty hexagram phases into the sixty hours of a *chou* day, forming a minor cycle of 360 lines, it corresponds to a year’s phase. One seizes the 4,320 years of correct *qi* from a month’s 360 lines within five days. Again, condensing a two-and-a-half-day cycle into thirty hours, corresponding to thirty days and 360 lines, it aligns with a year’s phase. One seizes 4,220 years of correct *qi* within two and a half days.\n\nDividing this into thirty hexagrams and 180 lines, it governs half a month of fifteen days. Allocating these fifteen days to the twelve positions, from *zi* to *si* (six earthly branches), 180 lines correspond to the 180 days from the Winter Solstice to the Summer Solstice, forming half a year. From *wu* to *hai* (six earthly branches), another 180 lines correspond to the 180 days from the Summer Solstice to the Winter Solstice, forming the other half-year.\n\nIn one month of 360 hours, corresponding to a year, totaling 4,320 hours, it symbolizes 4,320 years. Excluding the *mao* and *you* positions as the months of elixir bathing, one subtracts 720 hours from the year’s tally, leaving ten months for firing, totaling 3,600 hours, symbolizing 3,600 years—aligning with the celestial tally of 360 degrees. The bathing transmission is an oral formula; since antiquity, it has not been recorded in writing. Those who obtain it must guard it most secretly.\n\n---\n\n**3. Medicine Formula**\nTrue lead: eight ounces. True mercury: eight ounces. Together, these two ingredients make one *jin*. Each ounce contains twenty-four *zhu*, totaling 384, corresponding to the number of hexagram lines, aligning with a year’s 360 days and twenty-four qi to regulate the fire phases. Excluding sixty days—the *mao* and *you* months for elixir bathing—one is left with 300 days and 3,600 hours, seizing 3,600 years of darkness, forming the accumulated tally for true elixir completion. The work of the elixir’s achievement is revealed herein.\n\nThe fire phases are measured in *jin* and *liang*. In the first month: half a *jin*; the second month: one *jin*; the third month: one and a half *jin*; the fourth month: two *jin*; the fifth month: two and a half *jin*; the sixth month: two *jin*; the seventh month: one and a half *jin*; the eighth month: one *jin*; the ninth month: half a *jin*; the tenth month: four *liang*. Every ten days, the fire is incrementally adjusted until completion. When the elixir is ready, wait until the cold stabilizes before opening, lest the essence and *qi* be lost. For fire is born in *yin*, flourishes in *wu*, and is interred in *xu*. Calculating by 1,080 hours, one seizes the great tally of heaven and earth thrice over; the elixir then transforms into a crimson hue, its radiance outshining the sun—this is called the Lesser Returning Elixir. Within, it contains the five colors; without, it forms a single body. The key lies in employing the eight trigrams to correspond with the months, and in deducing the *qi* of the trigrams to exhaust the phases. As humans take ten months to complete gestation, so the elixir takes ten months to shed its matrix—human Dao and the workings of yin and yang naturally converge. The *Scripture of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"The sun and moon have their numbers, the great and small have their measures; from this arises sagely achievement, and from this emerges numinous clarity.\" This is precisely what is meant. *Zheng Yi* 4.\n\nSome may cite the *Eulogy of the Jade Flask*, which speaks of the yellow sprout ripening in ten months, or Master Haichan’s saying of the autumn stone awaiting the moon’s opening in the eighth month—how is this to be understood? The ten months refer to the count of the fire-tending; the eight months, to the direction of *qi*-circulation. The Dao of great elixir refinement and nurturance does not depart from the principle of yin and yang. Should yin and yang fall into disorder, or the *qi* of the trigrams diverge from their proper course, how could success be attained? Yet when earlier worthies spoke thus, they indeed had their deeper meaning, which cannot be sought through mere verbal explication. Thus the *Treatise on Dragon and Tiger* states: \"Three years of accumulated effort, a hundred days as the term.\" It also says: \"One must abide by *mao* and *you*, circulating fire through *kan* and *li*.\" This too conceals its intent, with inner and outer meanings mutually enfolding. Without the guidance of a master well-versed in the tradition, it is not easily spoken of.\n\nOne may ask: Can the completion of the elixir be witnessed with the eyes? It is said: Long ago, Master Yin of Eternal Life remarked, \"When old, it is purple; when tender, green; when ripe, red.\" If it were not visible, how could such descriptions arise? Another asks: Is this then an external elixir? The reply: How could it be external alone? Moreover, the five metals and eight minerals are all external, formed from impure substances and belonging to the realm of the dead—how could they hold the principle of eternal life? The essential point lies in the internal reality with external resonance, which constitutes the achievement of the Returning Elixir. One must still grasp the *qi*-phases of yin and yang without error.\n\nThe Perfected One of Great Mystery said: \"The harmonious *qi* of the human body begins at the *yongquan* at the winter solstice.\" *Yongquan* lies beneath the sole of the foot. In the eleventh month, it rises to the knees; in the twelfth, to the thighs; in the first month, to the waist—this is called the completion of the Three Yang. In the second month, it reaches the shoulders; in the third, the neck; in the fourth, the crown—here, pure yang governs. At the summer solstice, it begins again at the *yongquan*; in the fifth month, it rises to the knees; in the sixth, to the thighs; in the seventh, to the waist—this is called the completion of the Three Yin. In the eighth month, it reaches the shoulders; in the ninth, the neck; in the tenth, the crown—here, pure yin governs. Such is the yin and yang of heaven and earth, which never depart from the human body.\n\nMaster Dongping said: \"Those who study the Dao must regulate and grasp the four serpents and two rats.\" A profound saying indeed—it encompasses all, for these are the mechanisms that plunder life and destiny. Should the noble person come to know them, they may seize the *qi* of the Five Phases and the essence of yin and yang, returning to the source and reverting to the root, thus restoring the True and the One. Should the petty person obtain this knowledge, they will treat it lightly and turn it against themselves. Can one who understands this fail to be cautious?\n\n*Laozi* said: \"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice. Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\" Truly, this is what is meant.\n\nOn the fifth day of *jia* and *geng* each month, at dusk, the moon appears in *geng*. The moon belongs to water, born of metal, hence the half-catty of lead at the waxing half-moon. By the twenty-third day, it appears in *jia*, pressing near the sun’s rising—water comes to restrain fire, fire departs and metal dissolves, hence the half-catty of mercury at the waning half-moon. The two *qi* intertwine, conceiving as husband and wife; *kan* and *li* achieve mutual completion, above and below relying on one another. Meeting in the Central Palace, they enclose the *qi* of the Five Phases and emerge from the earth—this is called the yellow sprout. It is like the birth of a human, which arises from receiving *qi* to form substance. The Dao of nature cannot be known through intellect; the refinement of the great elixir is likewise in its essence.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of Primordial Sovereignty* states:\n\"Beneath the first green, moon and sun,\nTwo halves ascend and merge as one.\nForth from the jade pool, into the golden chamber they run,\nLarge as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine.\nWithin, a sweetness like honey is found,\nShould you obtain it, guard it well, never let it astray.\nPractice with care, and heaven’s favor shall be your crown.\"\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe One of Heaven generates water, which moistens and descends, becoming the Dark Warrior. Its position corresponds to the north, its hexagram governs *Kan*, its organ stores the kidneys, its color is black, its flavor is salty, and in things it is lead. This arises from the upright *qi* of *Qian*, and is called the middle son. Externally it resembles the Great Yin, yet internally it is yang—the Jade Hare. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born, thus from within lead emerges metal, called yang, which is true cinnabar.\n\nThe Two of Earth generates fire, which flames upward, becoming the Vermilion Bird. Its position corresponds to the south, its hexagram governs *Li*, its organ stores the heart, its color is red, its flavor is bitter, and in things it is cinnabar. This arises from the upright *qi* of *Kun*, and is called the middle daughter. Externally it resembles the Great Yang, yet internally it is yin—the Golden Crow. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, thus from within cinnabar emerges mercury, called yin, which is true mercury.\n\nThe Three of Heaven generates wood, which bends and straightens, becoming the Azure Dragon. Its position corresponds to the east, its hexagram governs *Zhen*, its organ stores the liver, its color is green, its flavor is sour, and in things it is mercury. This arises when *Kun* first receives the *qi* of *Qian* and is born, called the eldest son—the spark of fire, the celestial soul. All things are generated by it, and it is called the essence of wood.\n\nThe Four of Earth generates metal, which is malleable and transformative, becoming the White Tiger. Its position corresponds to the west, its hexagram governs *Dui*, its organ stores the lungs, its color is white, its flavor is pungent, and in things it is metal. This arises when *Qian* thrice pairs with the *qi* of *Kun* and is born, called the youngest daughter—the spark of water, the terrestrial soul. All things are completed by it, and it is called the head of the great elixir.\n\nThe Five of Heaven generates earth, which sows and reaps, becoming the Curved Array. It is the mother of the myriad things, its position corresponds to the Central Palace, its organ stores the spleen, its color is yellow, its flavor is sweet, and in things it is the Four Yellows. Lead and mercury rely on it for nurturance, and when they receive the fullness of the Five *qi*, the yellow sprout is born—this is the city walls of cinnabar, called the golden crucible. In refining the great medicine, without the crucible it cannot be contained. It also requires the Four Symbols to be complete, water and fire to interact, lead and mercury to unite, dragon and tiger to respond, the hexagrams’ *qi* to align, and the balance of yin and yang, so that the true elixir may be refined.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"Lone yin does not generate, lone yang does not complete; only with one yin and one yang does the Dao flourish.\"* This refers to the true Five Phases. Yet if one knows only their mutual generation and not their mutual restraint, they cannot be put to use. Only the true person can perceive the mechanism of their function, seize and refine them to perfect the elixir of ingestion, thereby escaping beyond yin and yang to stand alone in the realm of pure yang, returning to match the workings of creation.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"The sprout is metal, with metal one fells wood. Cinnabar is fire, with fire one melts metal. Lead is water, with water one extinguishes fire. When water is abundant, with earth one subdues it. They resonate with their kind and restrain their *qi*—this is called mutual opposition and restraint.\"* Such insight is far removed from the vulgar.\n\nThe seventh proof of the medicine.\n\nLead and mercury form the elixir—not the lead and mercury of the mundane world. The Four Yellows compose the crucible—not the Four Yellows of the common realm. These three all arise before Heaven and Earth, congealed by the qi of yin and yang. Through their union, the Yellow Sprout is born—this is the Three-Five-as-One.\n\nMaster Qingxia states: *\"If the sprout is lead, abandon lead by ten thousand li. If the sprout is not lead, it begins with lead. Lead is the mother of the sprout; the sprout is the child of lead. Once the golden flower is obtained, discard lead and do not employ it.\"* These words reveal the profound mechanism, yet the vulgar cannot comprehend them.\n\nThough one may obtain true lead, if mercury does not bond with it, this is called solitary yang—solitary yang cannot become the elixir. For the qi of dragon and tiger has fled, and the firing times are untimely. Thus, Master Wei also once spoke of refining silver from lead, where divine work naturally turns to ash. When lead sinks and silver floats, this is called the Yellow Sprout. Its nature is mildly warm, its flavor sweet—already the treasure of longevity. Yet the sprout of solitary yang cannot stand alone; it must be united with mercury to form the male-female Yellow Sprout—this is the meaning.\n\nSome may ask: *\"If lead and mercury are not of the mundane world, what then is their reality?\"* The answer: *\"They are the essence of Heaven and Earth, the root of sun and moon, the marrow of yin and yang, the source of water and fire. When dragon and tiger unite, hardness and softness interact—beginning with the One and Three, ending in Five, this is called the Mother of the Myriad Things. Thus, the Heavenly Perfected One states: 'Heaven possesses the Mysterious One, born of the Great Yang, named Flowing Pearl—the gate of all wonders. Whoever guards and retains it may attain longevity. Man has three selves, each dwelling differently; if one can preserve them all, one may become a King of Immortals.' This is true mercury—how could it lack reality and yet be called the medicine?\"*\n\nOthers may ask: *\"If lead and mercury are true, how can they be generated?\"* The answer: *\"The *Secret Principles of Master Liu* states: 'To attain longevity, cultivate that which gives you life.' Master Juan also says: 'Seeking the Dao and cultivating longevity is like grafting a tree. One takes one’s existing life to nurture the life to come—this is the principle of continuous generation, hence it is called the Great Medicine. If a person ingests it, how could they not transcend the world?' Yet even if a wise person finds the gate, without knowing the firing times or aligning with celestial signs, they cannot achieve mastery. Otherwise, why would the alchemical classics say: 'The Five Phases match and pair, the Eight Trigrams link in sequence'? And why would the Perfected One Taiyi state: 'Though the divine work of the golden elixir lies in lead and mercury, the Dao resides in the wondrous function of the Five Phases'? Thus, many later learners fail to attain it, for their firing times lack skill, and their Five Phases are misaligned.\"*\n\nMaster Bao Zhenjun says: *\"Refine in the eighth month, gather at the winter solstice.\"* Master Xiaoyao says: *\"In seven days, burn it into white horse’s teeth.\"* Master Qingxia says: *\"The elixir forms in ten months,\"* and again: *\"In three months, the medicine turns crimson-purple—with such firing times, what divergence could there be?\"* Some speak of three years’ work, ten months’ gestation—these are the essentials, and the various schools’ teachings merely hint at their application. Yet in their ultimate attainment, they do not differ.\n\nThe furnace is constructed with eight platforms in three tiers, using pure, fine soil free of sand, stones, or impurities as the best. Each side corresponds to the four seasons, and also to the four months when pure Qian governs. Each tier is one foot and two inches high, corresponding to the twelve months of the year and the twelve hours of the day. The furnace’s height is filled to the brim, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams. The crucible is placed atop it, three feet high, corresponding to Heaven, Earth, and Man. It has three legs, symbolizing the image of the Three Generating the Myriad Things. Above, the nine palaces correspond to the nine stars. The crucible has ten flaws—these must be examined carefully.\n\nThe furnace’s base is three *zhang* and six *chi* wide, corresponding to the thirty-six weeks. The middle is two *zhang* and four *chi* wide, corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms. The top is one *zhang* and six *chi* wide, corresponding to the weight of two times eight, one *jin*. First, one must purify oneself, burn incense, arrange mirrors and swords, hang silk banners, and display gold, silver, and ritual gifts. Then, with disciples, ascend the platform, follow the hexagram qi, observe the firing times, and complete the Great Medicine. Such care demonstrates that one must not treat this lightly.\n\nThe Nine Cycles of Nine:\nThe Nine Cycles refer to the medicine within the divine crucible, where the firing times are applied. Every hundred days, it cycles three times, corresponding to the great number of three years. This seizes the correct qi of celestial signs, equivalent to 1,200 years of work. Three threes make nine—when the ninth cycle is reached, it seizes 3,600 years of work, corresponding to the great number of nine years, and the Great Elixir is complete. Thus, the *Inner Classic* speaks of *\"a single wheel of fire, the nine-year elixir-turtle.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One Zhang Guo states:\n*\"White mercury gives birth to cinnabar,\nBlack lead transforms into the Yellow Sprout.\nThree threes make the number nine,\nWith three kinds of transformations.\"*\n\nSome hold that after the nine cycles, one further refines it into eighteen cycles, equivalent to three years’ work. The *Bi Fa* states: *\"One year is the Lesser Return, two years the Middle Return, three years the Greater Return.\"* It also says: *\"If the medicine is completed in less than a year, though it may be ingested, its qi will ultimately be insufficient.\"* Thus, the essential point lies in the three transformations as the true achievement.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *\"Open the way of Heaven and preserve the mysterious root. Even after 120 years, it is still possible—but beyond this, guarding the Dao becomes exceedingly difficult. Only by awaiting the Nine Cycles and Eight Jade Elixir, aligning the firing times with the hexagrams, can one refine the Great Elixir—this must not be undertaken without careful understanding.\"*\n\nHere ends the discourse on the wondrous workings and ultimate principles of elixir refinement.",

Scholars of the Dao, do not lightly reveal this to others, lest you incur transgressions and implicate your nine ancestors and seven generations—be cautious, be most cautious.\n\n---\n\n**1. Hexagram Qi**\nThe Dao arises from the One, and the One is the ancestor of the medicine. Thus, it begins in the eleventh month: at the Winter Solstice, one *yang* arises as *Fu* (Return), two *yang* as *Lin* (Approach), three *yang* as *Tai* (Peace), four *yang* as *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), five *yang* as *Gua* (Decay), and six *yang* as *Qian* (Heaven). At the Summer Solstice in the fifth month, one *yin* arises as *Gou* (Encounter), two *yin* as *Dun* (Retreat), three *yin* as *Pi* (Stagnation), four *yin* as *Guan* (Contemplation), five *yin* as *Bo* (Splitting), and six *yin* as *Kun* (Earth). Beginning with one *yang* and completing its ascent and descent, the twelve hexagram qi fulfill their work.\n\nThe medicine in the crucible is like a child in the womb: water above, fire below, harmonizing *yin* and *yang*. It acquires the sour taste of Wood, the pungent taste of Metal, the bitter taste of Fire, the salty taste of Water, and in the end, returning to the Central Palace through the four seasons, it gains the sweet taste of Earth.\n\n---\n\n**2. Fire Phases**\nFrom the Winter Solstice, *yang* *qi* arises at *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring), and the hexagram *Fu* governs, culminating in *Qian*—six hexagrams form the *yang* phase. At the Summer Solstice, *yang* reaches its peak and *yin* is born; *Gou* governs, culminating in *Kun*—six hexagrams form the *yin* phase. Over twelve months, the twenty-four qi operate in concert, aligning with the celestial tally of 360 degrees. Day and night, following the clepsydra’s marks, one seizes the correct *qi* to refine mercury and lead in the divine crucible—this is the pivotal mechanism of firing.\n\nIn a year of 360 days, totaling 4,320 hours, each day and night corresponds to one hexagram. Completing 720 hexagrams, one seizes 4,320 years of correct *qi* within the golden crucible. The sage condenses this: in one month of 360 hours, corresponding to 360 hexagram lines, it aligns with the 360 days of a year’s phase. Thus, one seizes 4,320 years of correct *qi* within a single month.\n\nFurther condensing these sixty hexagram phases into the sixty hours of a *chou* day, forming a minor cycle of 360 lines, it corresponds to a year’s phase. One seizes the 4,320 years of correct *qi* from a month’s 360 lines within five days. Again, condensing a two-and-a-half-day cycle into thirty hours, corresponding to thirty days and 360 lines, it aligns with a year’s phase. One seizes 4,220 years of correct *qi* within two and a half days.\n\nDividing this into thirty hexagrams and 180 lines, it governs half a month of fifteen days. Allocating these fifteen days to the twelve positions, from *zi* to *si* (six earthly branches), 180 lines correspond to the 180 days from the Winter Solstice to the Summer Solstice, forming half a year. From *wu* to *hai* (six earthly branches), another 180 lines correspond to the 180 days from the Summer Solstice to the Winter Solstice, forming the other half-year.\n\nIn one month of 360 hours, corresponding to a year, totaling 4,320 hours, it symbolizes 4,320 years. Excluding the *mao* and *you* positions as the months of elixir bathing, one subtracts 720 hours from the year’s tally, leaving ten months for firing, totaling 3,600 hours, symbolizing 3,600 years—aligning with the celestial tally of 360 degrees. The bathing transmission is an oral formula; since antiquity, it has not been recorded in writing. Those who obtain it must guard it most secretly.\n\n---\n\n**3. Medicine Formula**\nTrue lead: eight ounces. True mercury: eight ounces. Together, these two ingredients make one *jin*. Each ounce contains twenty-four *zhu*, totaling 384, corresponding to the number of hexagram lines, aligning with a year’s 360 days and twenty-four qi to regulate the fire phases. Excluding sixty days—the *mao* and *you* months for elixir bathing—one is left with 300 days and 3,600 hours, seizing 3,600 years of darkness, forming the accumulated tally for true elixir completion. The work of the elixir’s achievement is revealed herein.",

      "translated_text": "Some may cite the *Eulogy of the Jade Flask*, which speaks of the yellow sprout ripening in ten months, or Master Haichan’s saying of the autumn stone awaiting the moon’s opening in the eighth month—how is this to be understood? The ten months refer to the count of the fire-tending; the eight months, to the direction of *qi*-circulation. The Dao of great elixir refinement and nurturance does not depart from the principle of yin and yang. Should yin and yang fall into disorder, or the *qi* of the trigrams diverge from their proper course, how could success be attained? Yet when earlier worthies spoke thus, they indeed had their deeper meaning, which cannot be sought through mere verbal explication. Thus the *Treatise on Dragon and Tiger* states: \"Three years of accumulated effort, a hundred days as the term.\" It also says: \"One must abide by *mao* and *you*, circulating fire through *kan* and *li*.\" This too conceals its intent, with inner and outer meanings mutually enfolding. Without the guidance of a master well-versed in the tradition, it is not easily spoken of.\n\nOne may ask: Can the completion of the elixir be witnessed with the eyes? It is said: Long ago, Master Yin of Eternal Life remarked, \"When old, it is purple; when tender, green; when ripe, red.\" If it were not visible, how could such descriptions arise? Another asks: Is this then an external elixir? The reply: How could it be external alone? Moreover, the five metals and eight minerals are all external, formed from impure substances and belonging to the realm of the dead—how could they hold the principle of eternal life? The essential point lies in the internal reality with external resonance, which constitutes the achievement of the Returning Elixir. One must still grasp the *qi*-phases of yin and yang without error.\n\nThe Perfected One of Great Mystery said: \"The harmonious *qi* of the human body begins at the *yongquan* at the winter solstice.\" *Yongquan* lies beneath the sole of the foot. In the eleventh month, it rises to the knees; in the twelfth, to the thighs; in the first month, to the waist—this is called the completion of the Three Yang. In the second month, it reaches the shoulders; in the third, the neck; in the fourth, the crown—here, pure yang governs. At the summer solstice, it begins again at the *yongquan*; in the fifth month, it rises to the knees; in the sixth, to the thighs; in the seventh, to the waist—this is called the completion of the Three Yin. In the eighth month, it reaches the shoulders; in the ninth, the neck; in the tenth, the crown—here, pure yin governs. Such is the yin and yang of heaven and earth, which never depart from the human body.\n\nMaster Dongping said: \"Those who study the Dao must regulate and grasp the four serpents and two rats.\" A profound saying indeed—it encompasses all, for these are the mechanisms that plunder life and destiny. Should the noble person come to know them, they may seize the *qi* of the Five Phases and the essence of yin and yang, returning to the source and reverting to the root, thus restoring the True and the One. Should the petty person obtain this knowledge, they will treat it lightly and turn it against themselves. Can one who understands this fail to be cautious?\n\n*Laozi* said: \"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice. Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\" Truly, this is what is meant.\n\nOn the fifth day of *jia* and *geng* each month, at dusk, the moon appears in *geng*. The moon belongs to water, born of metal, hence the half-catty of lead at the waxing half-moon. By the twenty-third day, it appears in *jia*, pressing near the sun’s rising—water comes to restrain fire, fire departs and metal dissolves, hence the half-catty of mercury at the waning half-moon. The two *qi* intertwine, conceiving as husband and wife; *kan* and *li* achieve mutual completion, above and below relying on one another. Meeting in the Central Palace, they enclose the *qi* of the Five Phases and emerge from the earth—this is called the yellow sprout. It is like the birth of a human, which arises from receiving *qi* to form substance. The Dao of nature cannot be known through intellect; the refinement of the great elixir is likewise in its essence.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of Primordial Sovereignty* states:\n\"Beneath the first green, moon and sun,\nTwo halves ascend and merge as one.\nForth from the jade pool, into the golden chamber they run,\nLarge as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine.\nWithin, a sweetness like honey is found,\nShould you obtain it, guard it well, never let it astray.\nPractice with care, and heaven’s favor shall be your crown.\"\nThis is what is meant.",

      "translated_text": "Lead and mercury form the elixir—not the lead and mercury of the mundane world. The Four Yellows compose the crucible—not the Four Yellows of the common realm. These three all arise before Heaven and Earth, congealed by the qi of yin and yang. Through their union, the Yellow Sprout is born—this is the Three-Five-as-One.\n\nMaster Qingxia states: *\"If the sprout is lead, abandon lead by ten thousand li. If the sprout is not lead, it begins with lead. Lead is the mother of the sprout; the sprout is the child of lead. Once the golden flower is obtained, discard lead and do not employ it.\"* These words reveal the profound mechanism, yet the vulgar cannot comprehend them.\n\nThough one may obtain true lead, if mercury does not bond with it, this is called solitary yang—solitary yang cannot become the elixir. For the qi of dragon and tiger has fled, and the firing times are untimely. Thus, Master Wei also once spoke of refining silver from lead, where divine work naturally turns to ash. When lead sinks and silver floats, this is called the Yellow Sprout. Its nature is mildly warm, its flavor sweet—already the treasure of longevity. Yet the sprout of solitary yang cannot stand alone; it must be united with mercury to form the male-female Yellow Sprout—this is the meaning.\n\nSome may ask: *\"If lead and mercury are not of the mundane world, what then is their reality?\"* The answer: *\"They are the essence of Heaven and Earth, the root of sun and moon, the marrow of yin and yang, the source of water and fire. When dragon and tiger unite, hardness and softness interact—beginning with the One and Three, ending in Five, this is called the Mother of the Myriad Things. Thus, the Heavenly Perfected One states: 'Heaven possesses the Mysterious One, born of the Great Yang, named Flowing Pearl—the gate of all wonders. Whoever guards and retains it may attain longevity. Man has three selves, each dwelling differently; if one can preserve them all, one may become a King of Immortals.' This is true mercury—how could it lack reality and yet be called the medicine?\"*\n\nOthers may ask: *\"If lead and mercury are true, how can they be generated?\"* The answer: *\"The *Secret Principles of Master Liu* states: 'To attain longevity, cultivate that which gives you life.' Master Juan also says: 'Seeking the Dao and cultivating longevity is like grafting a tree. One takes one’s existing life to nurture the life to come—this is the principle of continuous generation, hence it is called the Great Medicine. If a person ingests it, how could they not transcend the world?' Yet even if a wise person finds the gate, without knowing the firing times or aligning with celestial signs, they cannot achieve mastery. Otherwise, why would the alchemical classics say: 'The Five Phases match and pair, the Eight Trigrams link in sequence'? And why would the Perfected One Taiyi state: 'Though the divine work of the golden elixir lies in lead and mercury, the Dao resides in the wondrous function of the Five Phases'? Thus, many later learners fail to attain it, for their firing times lack skill, and their Five Phases are misaligned.\"*\n\nMaster Bao Zhenjun says: *\"Refine in the eighth month, gather at the winter solstice.\"* Master Xiaoyao says: *\"In seven days, burn it into white horse’s teeth.\"* Master Qingxia says: *\"The elixir forms in ten months,\"* and again: *\"In three months, the medicine turns crimson-purple—with such firing times, what divergence could there be?\"* Some speak of three years’ work, ten months’ gestation—these are the essentials, and the various schools’ teachings merely hint at their application. Yet in their ultimate attainment, they do not differ.\n\nThe furnace is constructed with eight platforms in three tiers, using pure, fine soil free of sand, stones, or impurities as the best. Each side corresponds to the four seasons, and also to the four months when pure Qian governs. Each tier is one foot and two inches high, corresponding to the twelve months of the year and the twelve hours of the day. The furnace’s height is filled to the brim, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams. The crucible is placed atop it, three feet high, corresponding to Heaven, Earth, and Man. It has three legs, symbolizing the image of the Three Generating the Myriad Things. Above, the nine palaces correspond to the nine stars. The crucible has ten flaws—these must be examined carefully.\n\nThe furnace’s base is three *zhang* and six *chi* wide, corresponding to the thirty-six weeks. The middle is two *zhang* and four *chi* wide, corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms. The top is one *zhang* and six *chi* wide, corresponding to the weight of two times eight, one *jin*. First, one must purify oneself, burn incense, arrange mirrors and swords, hang silk banners, and display gold, silver, and ritual gifts. Then, with disciples, ascend the platform, follow the hexagram qi, observe the firing times, and complete the Great Medicine. Such care demonstrates that one must not treat this lightly.\n\nThe Nine Cycles of Nine:\nThe Nine Cycles refer to the medicine within the divine crucible, where the firing times are applied. Every hundred days, it cycles three times, corresponding to the great number of three years. This seizes the correct qi of celestial signs, equivalent to 1,200 years of work. Three threes make nine—when the ninth cycle is reached, it seizes 3,600 years of work, corresponding to the great number of nine years, and the Great Elixir is complete. Thus, the *Inner Classic* speaks of *\"a single wheel of fire, the nine-year elixir-turtle.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One Zhang Guo states:\n*\"White mercury gives birth to cinnabar,\nBlack lead transforms into the Yellow Sprout.\nThree threes make the number nine,\nWith three kinds of transformations.\"*\n\nSome hold that after the nine cycles, one further refines it into eighteen cycles, equivalent to three years’ work. The *Bi Fa* states: *\"One year is the Lesser Return, two years the Middle Return, three years the Greater Return.\"* It also says: *\"If the medicine is completed in less than a year, though it may be ingested, its qi will ultimately be insufficient.\"* Thus, the essential point lies in the three transformations as the true achievement.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *\"Open the way of Heaven and preserve the mysterious root. Even after 120 years, it is still possible—but beyond this, guarding the Dao becomes exceedingly difficult. Only by awaiting the Nine Cycles and Eight Jade Elixir, aligning the firing times with the hexagrams, can one refine the Great Elixir—this must not be undertaken without careful understanding.\"*\n\nHere ends the discourse on the wondrous workings and ultimate principles of elixir refinement.",

Cinnabar is fire, with fire one melts metal. Lead is water, with water one extinguishes fire. When water is abundant, with earth one subdues it. They resonate with their kind and restrain their *qi*—this is called mutual opposition and restraint.\"* Such insight is far removed from the vulgar.\n\nThe seventh proof of the medicine.",
