  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny and Life-Prolonging True Scripture with Commentary**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny and Life-Prolonging True Scripture with Commentary*. Composed by Xu Daoling of the Yuan dynasty, completed in the second year of the Zhitong era (1334). This work elucidates the scripture through inner alchemical practices of fasting and purification, structured into five fascicles. **Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings of the Divine Empyrean Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n### **Preface to the Northern Dipper Scripture**\nThe preface, comprising a single chapter, was authored by the Divine Lord of Zitong. Its text exhaustively expounds the profound mysteries of the Northern Dipper’s celestial wonders. All fellow aspirants who wish to recite *The Northern Dipper Scripture* must first recite this preface to grasp the scripture’s entirety—it must not be neglected.\n\nThe *Preface to the Northern Dipper* serves to title the scripture of the Northern Dipper, encapsulating the essence of the true and mysterious, and the foremost of its esoteric methods. **North** signifies position; **Dipper** is the revered honor of all phenomena. This scripture is the transformation of the Northern Dipper itself, and thus the Supreme Lord (Taishang) bestowed upon it the name *Northern Dipper*. Though calamities each bear their own names, the Northern Dipper is the Great Sage, abiding at the center of heaven and governing the Three Realms. Day and night, it revolves without rest, regulating life and death—hence, it is called *mysterious*.\n\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, yet it is the handle that serves the Dipper’s purpose, for the handle is commanded by the stars of the *Gang* (Big Dipper’s bowl). The Dipper itself is the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin. Some say the Northern Dipper is the image of the North Pole and North Star, thus it leans upon *Kan* (the Water trigram), moving and resting in its course, spanning the center. The Three Terraces (stars) cover and nurture all, enabling the Northern Dipper to fulfill its Dao. Born with original numinosity, its virtue is immeasurable. As the compassionate mother of the ten thousand phenomena and the teachings of the Three Pure Ones, it is entrusted to the Purple Radiance Consort, who embodies the Way of yin and yang, harmonizes the Five Phases, and excels in prolonging life—the origin of eternal longevity.\n\nWhen demonic paths ran rampant and heretical forces vied for dominance, encroaching upon the true and wondrous, who could devise a strategy to uphold the supreme Dharma? The great and mysterious model of governance was on the verge of collapse. Then, Lord Lao (Laozi) arose suddenly, descending to Shu (Sichuan) to deliver sentient beings and proclaim the true and wondrous. The Way is not singular: the Northern Dipper’s original destiny, its prayers for disaster or fortune, and its methods for nurturing life—all are subtly revealed, with nothing left unrecorded.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month, earth deities gathered at the Jade Bureau, and the perfected sages of the great cosmic era arrayed themselves in ranks to attend. Moved to relieve the suffering of the people, the Heavenly Master (Zhang Daoling) aligned with the Supreme Lord’s intent and stepped forward to inquire about the affairs of the Mysterious and Numinous. The Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, approved his request.\n\nThe Northern Dipper, unknown to the world, governs the celestial pivot’s records, regulates the earth’s axis in motion and stillness, establishes the year’s revolutions, and fans the harmonious spring breeze. It completes the seasons, culminating in the harsh winter of the three *La* festivals. Since the world’s inception, it has been without end. Thus, it imparts the words of the Dao to deliver later generations.\n\nThe Supreme Lord declared: “If I entrust these words to speech alone, it would not be as profound and luminous as inscribing them in true esoteric instructions.” Thereupon, the Perfected of the Dipper assembled, along with the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling and his foremost disciples, to resolve doubts and answer questions. They then composed the discourse on original destiny, compiling it into a single fascicle—a scripture that encompasses heaven and earth, measures the myriad kinds, and embraces benevolence, righteousness, morality, nature, life, misfortune, and fortune. Nothing is left unaddressed.\n\nIf emperors, kings, dukes, and marquises adhere to it, they may attain longevity and align with the celestial Dao. If ministers, scholars, and gentlemen uphold it, they may honor their sovereign and father while preserving their own lives. If aspirants and the wise practice it, they may achieve immortality and ride the flying clouds. For those with karmic affinity who cultivate the Dao, it rectifies the dual *qi*. Truly, it is mysterious and numinous, prolonging life—the great and wondrous work of the Supreme Sage of the world.\n\nAfter the Supreme Lord propagated the teachings in Shu, the orthodox Dao and its esoteric instructions each found their proper place. The scripture was divided into chapters with esoteric methods, enabling the dissolution of calamities and the attainment of prolonged life. The Northern Dipper subsequently radiated its light, embodying the Dao of the Three Pure Ones in its composition. This is the true, constant, tranquil, and luminous reality. Though a thousand centuries have passed, the Supreme Lord’s words have been transmitted as *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure). *Lingbao* is the grand assembly of the myriad Perfected and the guiding principle of the Six Directions. The *Northern Dipper Scripture* is its image and likeness.\n\nThe Han Heavenly Master received the Dipper from Lord Lao, who bestowed upon him the wondrous practices of original destiny and inquired about the Great Dao. The Primordial Beginning (Yuanshi) responded with the *Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity*. Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Dipper on Mount Zhongnan, where the Dipper Perfected personally transmitted the Mysterious and Numinous. Emperor Taizong of Tang received the Dao at Yangjiao, and the Primordial Beginning said: “You are the Son of Heaven—how could you not practice the Dao?” Such instances of shared intent are numerous.\n\nMoreover, the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (Daodejing), with its thousand words, contains profound mysteries. Thus, the *Dipper Scripture* serves as a direct path. Its text, though not as vast and profound as the *Lingbao* scriptures, is not dissimilar in essence. Therefore, later generations have imitated and misrepresented the Northern Dipper’s original truth.\n\nIf the Northern Dipper were not numinous, the Great Dao would be obstructed, its wondrous methods unheard, and the true path lost in confusion. Yet, the scripture’s title as *Original Destiny* has fortunately preserved it from extinction. The sagely court seeks worthies and honors scholars, promoting the flourishing of morality. Thus, the pure *qi* coalesces, and practitioners of refinement clarify the Dharma, annotate scriptures, transmit esoteric instructions, and deliver others—all in accordance with their kind.\n\nThere was an ancient scholar from Zhe who, though versed in the five punishments, was willing to engage with the meaning of this scripture. He specifically arranged the luminous affairs of the Northern Dipper into a commentary, excelling in analogies and explanations. His intent was not distant, yet his Dao was uniquely profound. He said: “Those who expound the *Book of Songs* do not let words harm the phrases, nor phrases harm the intent. To grasp the intent by aligning with it—this is the proper way.” This scripture aims to enable later generations to directly perceive its wonders. Thus, he elucidated its text not merely for his own sake.\n\nFormer worthies who have commented on it often gathered fragments to expound their views. Their interpretations are numerous, and the sages of each era differ. Since the time of Shu, over a thousand years have passed, and its transmission has been widespread.\n\nThe Daoist adept Xu Qing, whose age is marked by the Dao and whose nature is perfectly true without pretense, has been thus from his origins. Serving his father, Su’an, he revered the Dao and studied the Confucian classics. In his youth, he inherited a resolve for the scriptures, selecting the finest and gathering the essentials from several schools. For over a decade, he soared within the ranks of officialdom, his heart set on contributing to the greater good—how diligently he toiled! Fortunate to lay down his burdens and rest beneath the eaves of Wu and Yue, he immersed himself in revisiting the old to grasp the new, exhausting his humble insights to fulfill his aspirations and realize his ambitions. Thus, he elucidated the profound and illuminated the mysterious, hoping to offer even the slightest contribution.\n\nI oversee the Star of Literary Prosperity, where the wise and the numinous gather, and nothing remains unknown. Through the ages, its transmission in brush and ink has endured, yet only the *Northern Dipper’s Oral Instructions* has remained luminous in its teachings to this day. Those scholars who later expounded and elucidated it have done so with meticulous care. Xu Qing, cherishing the vast and subtle wonders of the Northern Dipper, opened its recitation and beheld its clarity. He further inscribed the rites of morning devotion, and thus, drawing from what he had heard and verifying it against the classics and traditions, he embroidered it upon sacred talismans, recording it fully in the original scripture. Dividing its chapters by theme and separating them into upper and lower sections, he delineated twenty-four calamities in total. Yet, in essence, none transcend the bounds of one’s own destiny. This he did to enlighten later generations, enabling them to dispel doubts and shatter delusions. I, too, have scrutinized each character to discern its correctness. Those who follow this path and devote themselves to cultivation shall all attain longevity, fulfilling the earnest intent of Xu Qing of the Mysterious Yang, and together ascend to the supreme realm of carefree wandering—is this not most fitting?\n\n---\n\n**Recitation of the *Northern Dipper Scripture and Oral Instructions***\n\nWhen reciting the scripture or performing morning rites, first compose the spirit, click the teeth, sit upright, and regulate the breath. With eyes closed, silently visualize the Nine Palaces and Nine Stars within the Mud-Pill Palace, each occupying a palace, with seven seated in the likeness of their true forms, and two in the attire of assisting attendants.\n\nThen, visualize the radiant light of the Northern Dipper in the heavens, resplendent as if seen. Press the tongue against the upper palate to form a golden bridge, from which the five viscera emit five strands of five-colored *qi*, ascending the bridge and spanning the Dipper. Call upon the Four Upright Messengers to traverse the bridge into the Dipper and convey the matter at hand. Next, behold the two messengers, Ji Yang and Tuoluo, appearing like jade maidens in azure robes, bearing swords—one holding a mandala flower, the other a willow branch. They descend from the Dipper along the bridge into the Nine Palaces within one’s body, then emerge from a chamber to conduct their inspection. Once complete, they return to the Dipper. After a while, observe the Nine Sovereigns of the Dipper, clad in the same attire as the nine within one’s own form, descending upon clouds and *qi* along the bridge into the chamber of the Mud-Pill Palace, where they sit facing you. In an instant, they merge into nine, and in the depths of obscurity, coalesce into one. From the Mud-Pill Palace, they descend upon clouds into the Yellow Court. This done, sit upright and begin the recitation.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mouth**\nThe gates of ingress and egress,\nAbove and below, are guarded by spirits.\nThe portals of fortune and

annotated by Xu Daoling, the Dark Yang Master\nCollated and corrected by Xu Daoxuan, the Qian Yang Master\n\nThe Most High: \"Greatest\" signifies utmost greatness, \"Highest\" signifies utmost elevation—this is the Supreme Ultimate, the Unsurpassed. Only the Three Clarities and the father of human sovereigns may be so addressed.\nThe Mysterious Numinous: This is the mysterious *qi* of heaven and earth, the essence and spirit of the Seven Governors, the wisdom-light of the Northern Dipper, the nature and life of humankind.\nPeople receive the clear and numinous *qi* to form this body, thus generating *hun*, *po*, blood, and *qi*.\nThe Northern Dipper: The great virtue and great transformation of heaven and earth, the true *qi* and correct Dao congeal into a mysterious image. Revolving in the central heavens, it establishes the four seasons, balances the five phases, gives life and death to the myriad beings, governs heaven and earth, examines and records good and evil—nothing exists beyond its jurisdiction.\nDestined Life: Heaven engenders water through the One—this originates from the Northern Dipper. The Dipper resides in the north, flourishes in water, and is the capital that governs life and death, nurtures beings, and aids humanity.\nPeople receive the *qi* of heaven and earth to become male or female, to live long or die young—all proceed from the Northern Dipper’s decrees.\nIf one can recognize the spirit of one’s destined life without neglecting cultivation, and reverently recite one’s destined name without vainly passing time, then calamities will be resolved, disasters dispelled, and boundless fortune attained.\nLife-Prolonging: The Northern Dipper expects people to cultivate their bodies and turn toward the Dao, enabling them to preserve their heavenly years. Those who pay homage to the Dipper and court the true thereby attain the Dao of life-prolonging.\n\nThus, if heaven remains unmoving, how can it eternally cover? If the Dipper remains unmoving, how can it perpetually revolve? If people do not seek extension, how can they attain long life?\n\nThe *True* signifies the meaning of the wondrously true—profound and unfathomable. The *Classic* is a warp, for if its transmission endures long yet becomes corrupted, it is as though the weft is woven awry, its threads disordered, and flaws arise. Moreover, the *Classic* is a path: if the path is not straight and clear, those who enter the Dao and cultivate the true will lose their way. Furthermore, the *Classic* is a network: if one’s meridians and collaterals lose their proper measure, illness arises; if the Classic is not luminous, the true and mysterious cannot be attained.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao—*that time* refers to when the Most High expounded the Classic. Lord Lao is the origin of heaven and earth, the progenitor of creation. Across the ages, he manifests without fixed birth, yet when he wished to harmonize with the world and establish teachings, he first commanded the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, who was the daughter of Tian Shui Magistrate Yin, named Yi Shou. She married the immortal Li Lingfei, a descendant of Bi Gaoyao. Inspired by his father Li Qingbin’s ascension in broad daylight, Lingfei cultivated the great Dao for over a hundred years. Before Lord Lao’s birth, he ascended to heaven in the seventeenth year of King Yang Jia’s reign during the Yin dynasty, the *gengshen* year. Thereafter, Lingfei conceived a child, refining the true for eighty-one years, until the ninth year of King Wu Ding’s reign, the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of *mao*, when he was born in Bo. The former residence in the Grand Clarity Palace remains to this day.\n\nDuring King Wu of Zhou’s reign, he served as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. In the *guichou* year of King Zhao’s reign, he passed through the Hangu Pass and transmitted the *Five Thousand Words of the True and the Virtue* to the Perfected Yin Xi, totaling two hundred seventy-four years. On the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month in the *jiayin* year, Lord Lao ascended to heaven in broad daylight. He later met the Perfected Yin Xi again beyond a thousand days at the Green Ram Market in Shu. In the *dingsi* year, he encountered Lord Lao once more in Shu, then followed the immortal chariot to traverse the Nine Heavens, teaching in accordance with the times. Confucius took him as his teacher. By the time of King Nan, nine hundred ninety-six years had passed.\n\nEmperor Ming of Wei praised: *\"As the Archivist of Zhou, he endured nine hundred years.\"*\nWu Yanghao, Academician of the Tang Imperial Academy, praised: *\"Lord Lao’s transformations are unfathomable, his numinous responses beyond measure. Born in the Shang, he served in the Zhou, spanning a thousand years from beginning to end.\"*\n\nLater, he descended to Chengdu and transmitted these scriptural instructions in the first year of Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* reign, the *yiwei* year, on the seventh day of the first month. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, he expounded the Classic of Benevolence and Love at Yangjiao Mountain. In the *Zhenghe* era of the Song dynasty, he descended to the Jade Dawn Abbey on Mount Mao and transmitted the *Extended Verses of the Heavenly Youth’s Life-Protecting Classic* to Liang Guangying. Since then, the numinous proofs have been too numerous to recount.\n\nWhen Lord Lao was born, nine dragons spouted water, transforming into nine wells to bathe his form. Born with hoary hair and beard, he bore seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. His steps were like lotus blossoms, and at the age of nine, he pointed to heaven with his left hand and to earth with his right, saying: *\"Above heaven and below heaven, I alone am revered. I shall propagate the supreme Dao and its laws, universally bestowing them upon all beings.\"* At that time, celestial robes draped his body, and in nine days, he grew to nine feet in height. The heavenly spirits acclaimed him with ten titles: Most High Lord, Perfect Spirit and Wisdom, Heavenly Honored One, Teacher of Emperors, Great Man, Great Immortal Honored One, Father of Heaven and Humanity, Supreme Person of Non-Action, Greatly Compassionate One, and Primordial Heavenly Honored One. Here, we briefly recount the Most High’s titles for those of like mind to take refuge in, each attaining blessed reward.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou*, the Most High, pitying sentient beings, repeatedly descended to Chengdu and transmitted to the Heavenly Master, the Perfected Lord of Serene Response, the *Scriptural Instructions for Life-Prolonging*, the *Numinous Writ of the Five Dippers’ Talismanic Correspondences*, and the names of the Five Dipper Perfected Lords. On the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou*, he transmitted the *True Classic of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Destiny*. On the fifteenth day, he transmitted the *Wondrous Classic of the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity*, along with the *Wondrous Daoist Classic of the Five Dippers*. By the seventh day of the first month in the second year of *Yongshou*, he expounded the *True Classic of the Eastern Dipper’s Long Life and Life-Protecting*. On the fifteenth day, he further expounded the *Western Dipper’s Great Plan Classic for Protecting the Body*. Seeing that the Heavenly Master and Perfected were able to cultivate and uphold these teachings, Lord Lao once more manifested his complete form within the Pure Void, ascending the Jade Bureau Seat to proclaim the *Mysterious Wondrous Classic of the Central Dipper for Protecting Life and Extending Life*.\n\nFirst the Northern Dipper, then the Southern, followed by the Eastern and then the Western—this is because the Northern Dipper resides in the *Kan* palace, governing the source of water. Water belongs to the north, and the north is heaven; heaven’s first emanation generates water, thus this Classic was first transmitted. The Southern Dipper resides in the *Li* palace, governing the fire emperor. Fire belongs to the south, and the south is earth; earth’s second emanation generates fire, thus the *True Classic of the Southern Dipper* was transmitted second. The scriptures of the Eastern Dipper, Western Dipper, and Central Dipper follow the sequence of creation, hence their timing.\n\nIn the Grand Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate Palace on the Grand Clarity’s border—\nThe Classic states: *\"The Primordial Supreme Great Canopy Heaven, the realm of the Three Clarities.\"* The Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm comprises twelve sacred heavens, governed by the Primordial Heavenly Honored One. Below the Jade Clarity lies the Upper Clarity’s Perfected Realm, comprising twelve perfected heavens, governed by the Jade Emperor Dao Lord. Below the Upper Clarity lies the Grand Clarity’s Immortal Realm, comprising twelve immortal heavens, governed by the Most High Lord Lao. In the human body, the upper cinnabar field’s Mud Pill Palace corresponds to the Jade Clarity Palace above; the middle cinnabar field’s Crimson Palace corresponds to the Upper Clarity Palace above; and the lower cinnabar field’s Meeting Palace corresponds to the Supreme Ultimate Palace above. The palace governed by the Most High Lord Lao in the Grand Clarity’s border is named the Three Sovereigns’ Grotto-Spirit Grand Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.\n\nBeholding the myriad beings adrift for kalpas uncounted, endlessly revolving through birth and death, the Most High responds and transforms, pervading all under heaven. Wherever his emanations manifest, there is the Grand Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Most High ever observes beings with a heart of compassion. All sounds ultimately return to the center—heaven above, earth below, and humans in between—these are the people born in the central land of the middle realm.\n\nThe word \"亿\" (hundred million) may also be pronounced as \"yì\" (in the departing tone), signifying abundance, with the character bearing two interpretations. A kalpa is a \"knot,\" or else it denotes \"time.\" In a single human lifetime, one must undergo three thousand six hundred kalpas of worldly toil, for this is the predetermined tally of karmic knots. Yet when people recklessly abandon the Dao, indulging in lust and slaughter, they cut short their lives, failing to fulfill their allotted years. Unable to complete the cycle of birth and death, the knots of past lives remain unresolved, and new knots of worldly dust accumulate, piling up into billions upon billions, never to be untied. Truly, performing good deeds knots good affinities, while committing evil knots one to the demonic path. If evil knots multiply, one drifts in the bitter sea, drowning in the cycle of birth and death without respite, forever becoming a lowly ghost.\n\nIf a person performs one good deed each day, accumulates one meritorious act, or saves a single life, they untie three knots of worldly dust, thereby passing through three kalpas. Should one perform a good deed daily, they would resolve three hundred sixty knots in a year. Further, if they save lives, aid others, benefit creatures, and diligently cultivate the Great Dao, awakening their nature to return to the real, then billions upon billions of knots of worldly toil would vanish in an instant—like a hundred-year-darkened chamber illuminated by a single lamp of wisdom. In Sanskrit, *kalpa* is rendered as *kalpa*, meaning \"time.\" Whether long or short, brief or extended, it is collectively termed a kalpa, or else a fleeting moment. As the *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"In kalpas past, when did the Heavenly Honored One ever enter a kalpa?\" This refers to the arising of the thought to aid others at that very moment.\n\nMoreover, a kalpa signifies \"rest\" or \"hibernation,\" as with creatures like tortoises, dragons, insects, and snakes, which conceal themselves when thunder withdraws its sound and emerge when thunder roars—this is the name for one kalpa. Even cattle, horses, sheep, dogs, chickens, pigs, and other livestock each have their own kalpas, though they only endure suffering. Thus, the sages established teachings for the body, with the three karmas placing the precept against killing foremost. As *Mencius* says: \"Seeing them alive, one cannot bear to see them die; hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh.\"\n\nWithin the Three Realms, kalpas also exist. Yang qi knots to form heaven and man; yin qi knots to form earth and woman. When good men take wicked wives or sages beget unworthy offspring, these are knots of affliction. When good men encounter bandits or virtuous people suffer harm, these are knots of birth and death. For those who enter the Dao, if they take the words of the Dao as their heart and moment by moment untie these knots with good deeds and expedient means, such knots will not arise. The Buddhist scriptures say: \"Untie the knots of a hundred lifetimes’ enmity.\" If left unresolved, one will meet again life after life—how can one not strive for this?\n\nSome dwell in the human realm, born in the Central Lands, or among the Yi and Di barbarians, or within the Man and Rong tribes—some rich, some noble, some lowly, some poor. The Central Lands refer to China: to the southeast lies Yangzhou, due south Jingzhou, south of the Yellow River Yuzhou, due east Qingzhou, east of the Yellow River Yanzhou, due west Yongzhou, northeast Youzhou, within the Yellow River’s bend Jizhou, and due north Bingzhou—these are the Nine Provinces of China as divided in the *Tribute of Yu*. Beyond the Nine Provinces, to the east are the Yi, to the west the Rong, to the south the Man, and to the north the Di.\n\nThe scriptures state: Those who possess the Five Constants and Ten Goodnesses, who practice filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and goodness, are reborn in the human realm within the Central Lands. The rich and noble arise from offering alms to the Three Treasures, relieving the poor and distressed, and rescuing those in peril. The poor and lowly arise from stinginess, greed, and seizing unjust wealth. Those born among border barbarians or in lowly circumstances arise from killing, sexual misconduct, and disbelief in causality. Thus, the Most High’s heavenly eye observes the sins and blessings of beings, who receive retribution according to their karma. Temporarily bound by causal conditions, they fall into hell.\n\nBorn into the world amid wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, if one does not abide therein by the Dao—if the rich are unrighteous, unkind, uncompassionate, and ungenerous; if the noble are unjust, lawless, disloyal, and cowardly; if the poor are discontent and the lowly insubordinate—then the myriad affairs and principles become inverted and chaotic, leading to calamity, harm, misfortune, and disaster, plunging one into affliction. As a verse in the Buddhist canon states: \"By the power of merit, one now enjoys much good fortune; yet with much good fortune comes indulgence. Indulgence ultimately lacks the mind to uphold precepts, and by this cause and condition, one enters hell.\" This is precisely the meaning.\n\nFor there is no constancy—constancy is the essential path to entering the Dao and the swiftest route to prolonging life. Constancy means correctness: if the body is not correct, how can one enter the Dao? If the heart is not correct, how can one prolong life? The meaning of \"prolong\" (*yan*) also derives from correctness. Furthermore, constancy means stillness, orientation, cessation, and sequence. When water is still, it does not flow; when earth is firm, it does not sink. When the heart is constant, the myriad thoughts cease; when the body is constant, the myriad affairs halt. When the nature is constant, qi becomes numinous; when the spirit is constant, qi becomes pure. Yet constancy cannot be achieved without stillness. Most people lack the power of stillness, orientation, cessation, and sequence, so they cannot fulfill righteousness or attain the Dao, nor can they cultivate the real and reach the true. Thus, their hearts are ever inconstant, and their karma follows them—how then can they prolong life and illuminate the original destiny of the mysterious and numinous?\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"To know cessation is to attain great stability and peace.\" The *Great Learning* says: \"Knowing cessation, one then has stability.\" This \"knowing cessation\" means recognizing this principle, and one must truly attain such knowledge to be so. For example, knowing that as a child one must be filial, or as a subject one must be loyal—when one personally embodies the Way of loyalty and filial piety, perceiving that this is how things ought to be, then one’s aspirations have a fixed direction, and the heart has cessation and sequence. Such is a person of great power, as *Mencius* says: \"Wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot sway, might and force cannot bend.\" If the heart is unstable, when serving parents, one may be drowned by private desires and fail to fulfill filial piety; when serving one’s lord, one may be drowned by profit and emolument and fail to fulfill loyalty.\n\nToday, some neglect filial piety toward their parents, officials act unlawfully, the wealthy and noble seek fame, those with children remarry—all because they do not know cessation, do not accept their lot, do not maintain stillness, and do not follow sequence. Their hearts lack stability, and thus calamity inevitably befalls them. If one can know cessation, accept one’s lot, maintain stillness, and follow sequence in stability, then without seeking life, one naturally attains longevity; before entering the Dao, one has already reached the Dao. How could calamity touch them?\n\nThose of superior wisdom, if they cultivate the work of stillness and stability, with the heart ceaselessly ceasing, will succeed over time. In small measure, they extend their lifespan and enter the ranks of immortals; in great measure, they ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and the Three Pure Ones. Yet those entangled by karmic transgressions, their souls bound by the courts of the unseen, suffer until their retribution is complete. When their time in the human realm is exhausted, they are reborn among beasts or birds, deviating from the human Way and struggling to regain human form.\n\nThe Daoist and Buddhist teachings both proscribe the ten evil deeds: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, greed, anger, ignorance, false speech, frivolous speech, harsh speech, and divisive speech—all to instruct people in goodness. These ten evils—deceit, theft, fraud—are strictly forbidden by law. Should one commit them, they face cangues, imprisonment, fetters, flogging, mutilation, exile, and shackles. How is this different from being a beast?\n\nThis chapter speaks of those whose past lives accumulated evil karma, filling the records of the Dipper Mansion and the Three Officials. Their souls are bound in the underworld prisons, interrogated and punished until their retribution is complete. Having been reborn, they commit further evils, thus deviating from the human Way. In their next lives, they will be born among beasts or birds, deviating from the human Way and struggling to regain human form. Sinking thus into delusion, they remain unaware, for their past lives’ ignorance of the true has led them into this cycle of rebirth.\n\n\"Awareness\" means awakening; \"true\" means uprightness, directness, transformation, sageliness, numinous penetration, and wondrous clarity. Without the true, heaven cannot bring spring to the myriad things; without the true, earth cannot root the grasses and trees; without the true, humans cannot command the spirits. Those who attain the true will not drown in water nor burn in fire; they transcend the Three Realms, transform the Ten Directions, command the myriad spirits, and merge with the primal qi. Without the true, how could this be achieved? Without the true, how could this be accomplished?\n\nThus, the Northern Dipper is called the True Lord, the Dark Emperor is called the True Warrior, and all who attain the Dao are called True Persons. Our Master Confucius’ discourse on luminous virtue—without the true, how could one know cessation, stability, and stillness? The word \"true\" is not easily spoken.\n\nThe Most High, pitying those born in the Central Lands or among barbarians, in wealth or poverty, who receive their heavenly mandate and yet, due to the lack of stability in their hearts, accumulate sins and deviate from the human Way—this chapter urges all beings to awaken and cultivate the true. Those who remain unaware do so because they are deluded by the true Way and do not enter the lineage of immortals. Thus, they do not understand the mandate of their destiny.\n\nDestiny is a fixed decree. For example, heaven bestows wealth or poverty, and if one abides in the Way, one accepts it as the heavenly mandate, rejoicing in heaven’s will. If one receives a lot that does not align with their destiny, this is delusion from the true and deviation from the mandate. Having deviated from the mandate and deluded the true, one sinks into delusion without awareness. All who uphold the true and hold to the scriptural instructions must, in the realm of awareness, seek that which transcends awareness—only then do they grasp the secret of extending life.\n\nThe Most High expounded the teachings, and the profound subtleties of the scriptures’ purport lie in every word and phrase as secret methods. How could those of shallow learning easily fathom them? If one dismisses the text as vulgar and common, merely slandering and reviling, the roots of sin will be difficult to eradicate.\n\nFor instance, if one is unaware, when the Most High transmitted the scriptures, why did He not say, \"unaware\"? The difference between \"not self-aware\" and \"unaware\" is vast, and it does not align with the scriptures’ purport. The \"not\" placed above means not personally investigating the original causes of one’s destined nobility or baseness, longevity or early death. The \"not\" placed below—\"unaware\"—means not knowing what to awaken to. \"Not self-aware\" clearly means knowing what to awaken to but failing to realize it oneself.\n\nThose who recite the scriptures with shared aspiration should savor its purport, ponder deeply, and reflect thoroughly, so as not to betray the Most High’s sagely intent in bestowing the teachings and establishing the words.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Most High divides His body to teach and transform, descending in transformed emanations. Though dwelling in the highest of the Three Realms, abiding in the innermost of the Nine Heavens, the Most High’s heart of pity for all beings never rests for a moment. The Most High descended in transformed emanation to Shu Capital, transmitting these scriptural instructions to benefit all beings and deliver them from the suffering of rebirth.\n\nAs for Shu Capital—this is present-day Chengdu Prefecture. Emperor Ming of the Han asked the monk Kāśyapa Mātaṅga: \"When the Dharma King was in the world, why did His transformation not reach this land?\" The monk replied: \"Kapilavastu is the center of the trichiliocosm. All buddhas of the Three Realms appear in that land. Those with vows and practice are all born there, receiving the Buddha’s true teaching and awakening to the Way. Beings in other lands, lacking the karmic affinity to encounter the Buddha, are not visited by Him. Though the Buddha does not go there, His light reaches all places. After five hundred years, a thousand years, or even beyond a thousand years, there are always sages who transmit the Buddha’s teachings to transform them.\"\n\nWhy did the Most High descend upon Shu Capital while not visiting other regions? Shu is the blessed land of the Kun quarter, where the Heavenly Master and Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord had at that time completed the Nine-Cauldron Elixir through cultivation on Mount Crane Cry, and was moreover able to propagate teachings and transformations. Thus did the Most High descend there to bestow scriptures and oral instructions.\n\nThe earth spirits surged forth, raising a jade platform to serve as a lofty seat. Jade is the essence of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, the congealed splendor of yin-yang and water-fire. Smooth yet warm, precious and noble, it is imperishable for ten thousand generations. The *ju* is a jade throne with curved legs, akin to the seven-jeweled tiered dais of the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation—an ornate seat adorned with seven tiers of dragon and phoenix motifs. The Most High, moved by compassion for sentient beings, descended to the world to expound the scriptures. Of the myriad numina of the Three Realms, which would not come to receive Him? Thus was it fitting that the earth spirits raised the jade platform in attendance. When the scripture’s recitation was complete, the jade platform sank back into the earth, and the site where it transformed into a grotto remains a relic of Chengdu to this day.\n\nThereupon, the Venerable Lord ascended the jade platform and conferred upon the Heavenly Master Perfected One the *Oral Instructions on the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny*, broadly proclaiming essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nAccording to the Han *Records*: The Heavenly Master’s personal name was Daoling, styled Hanfu. A native of Pei’s Fengyi County, he was the eldest son of Dashun, the eighth-generation direct descendant of the Marquis of Liu, Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang’s hidden acts of yin merit flowed fragrance to later generations. The Heavenly Master’s mother first dreamed of a celestial spirit descending from the Northern Dipper’s *Kui* star, towering over ten feet tall, clad in embroidered robes. The spirit bestowed upon her fragrant *hengwei* blossoms. Upon waking, her clothing and chamber were suffused with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for a month, and she conceived. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *jiayin* year of Emperor Guangwu’s *Jianwu* reign (10 A.D.), he was born on Mount Tianmu in Wu territory. At that time, yellow clouds blanketed the sky, purple *qi* filled the courtyard, and a radiance like the sun shone in the air for a month. The earlier fragrance was again perceived, permeating the days before gradually dispersing.\n\nBy the time he came of age, he stood nine feet and two inches tall, with fine brows, a broad forehead, green eyes, a vermilion crown, a high nose, a square head, and three-cornered eyes. A *fuxi* bone traversed his brain, and his jade-pillow peak was prominent. His hands hung past his knees, his beard and whiskers were handsome, and his bearing was like a dragon crouching or a tiger pacing. Though majestic in appearance, even his kin and friends regarded him with reverence. At seven, he read the *Dao and Virtue*’s two chapters over ten times and grasped their purport. He mastered the subtleties of astronomy, geography, the River Chart, Luo Diagram, and ritual canons, thoroughly studying the ancient classics without omission. Over a thousand disciples followed him. Thirty *li* south of Mount Tianmu and eighty *li* northwest, lecture and recitation halls stood. The Immortal’s Abode of Lin’an and the Immortal-Penetrating Abode of Yuhang occupy those sites today.\n\nLater, he was recommended for the *Xianliang Fangzheng* and *Zhiyan Jijian* examinations and passed. Though he entered officialdom, his aspiration was to refine his form and ascend lightly. After a time, he retired to seclusion on Mount Northern Mang. Three years later, a white tiger placed a talisman beside his seat. The court summoned him to serve as *Boshi*, but he claimed illness and did not rise. When Emperor He ascended the throne, he was summoned with a third-rank seal and cord, a four-horse carriage, and the title of Grand Tutor. Later, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Ji County, but he declined three imperial edicts. This was in the *renchen* year of *Yongyuan* 4 (92 A.D.).\n\nThereafter, he journeyed from the Yellow and Luo Rivers through the famous mountains of the Jiang and Huai regions, paying homage to grotto-heavens and visiting all the cavern chambers. Ascending the current into Shu, he encountered divine beings who instructed him and obtained secret oral instructions on cinnabar and talismans. Thus, on Mount Crane Cry, he refined the Nine-Cauldron Elixir to completion but dared not consume it. He told his disciple Wang Chang: \"One who would ascend to Heaven must first extend merit to living beings, aid the state and pacify families, promote benefit and eliminate harm. Only then may one ascend lightly. To serve the Three Realms without shame, one must not seek personal profit while failing to benefit the people—this is not the great Dao’s principle of vast deliverance.\"\n\nIn the *renwu* year of Emperor Shun’s *Han’an* 1 (142 A.D.), on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month at noon, he was moved by the descent of the Golden Watchtower’s Later Sage, the Mysterious and Primordial Lord of the Dao—Laozi—who bestowed upon him the Registers of Orthodox Unity’s Alliance and Might, the Sword of the Three and Five for Beheading Demons, and the credentials of the Capital Office’s tally registers. Thereupon, he consumed the elixir and battled spirits, establishing courts of governance.\n\nLater, the Most High again conferred upon him the Three Caverns’ nine hundred and thirty volumes of scriptures, seventy-two volumes of secret oral instructions on talismans, cinnabar, and lightning, along with caps and robes. By Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* 1 (155 A.D.), he had repeatedly received these scriptures along with the *True Scriptures of the Five Directions and Five Dippers*. In *Yongshou* 2 (156 A.D.), he and his wife Lady Yong simultaneously ascended to Heaven in broad daylight, attaining the position of Perfected One of the Great Mysterious Capital’s Orthodox Unity, the Heavenly Master of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma for Assisting and Supporting the Primordial.\n\nThe oral instructions bestowed by the Most High are the Dharma. Every word in the scriptures is an essential method. For those who uphold the Dao, to awaken to even a single word, phrase, method, or oral instruction is to depart from delusion and directly hasten to the Dao’s shore. The two characters *Daoling* are the Heavenly Master’s personal name. Though one need not avoid them when reciting the text, out of reverence, one should substitute \"Perfected One\" when reciting.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable Lord told the Heavenly Master: \"A human body is hard to obtain; to be born in the Middle Kingdom is hard. Even if one attains birth there, encountering the true Dharma is hard.\" According to the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, the Buddha said: \"To depart from evil destinies and become human is hard. Having become human, to be born in China is hard. Having been born in China, to encounter the Dao is hard.\" It is also said: \"Those in the world who obtain a human body are like soil on a fingernail; those who lose a human body are like the great earth’s vastness compared to the Supreme Clarity’s realm.\" The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Humans take essence as their mother and *qi* as their master. The five viscera each have essence; within essence, *qi* is born. The five viscera each have *qi*; within *qi*, spirit is born. Spirit can generate longevity. To preserve life and attain long life, refine essence into cinnabar, nurture *qi* into spirit. True immortals and sagely perfected ones cultivate truth and nurture *qi*. Naturally, the inner truth responds externally. With effort, success is assured, and one ascends from the mundane to the sagely.\"\n\nAt the birth of a male, the right kidney forms first, with external essence and internal blood—yin resides within. At the birth of a female, the left kidney forms first, with external blood and internal essence—yang resides within.\n\nThe kidneys generate the spleen, the spleen generates the liver, the liver generates the lungs, the lungs generate the heart, the heart generates the small intestine, the small intestine generates the large intestine, the large intestine generates the gallbladder, the gallbladder generates the kidneys, the kidneys generate the bladder, the bladder generates the Three Origins, the Three Origins generate the Triple Burner, the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels, the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Meridians, the Twelve Meridians generate the Fifteen Collaterals, the Fifteen Collaterals generate one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals, these generate one hundred eighty encircling collaterals, these generate thirty-six thousand thread-like collaterals, these generate the three hundred sixty-five bones, and the three hundred sixty-five bones generate the eighty-four thousand hair pores. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete and *qi* is full; the numinous radiance enters the body, and the child separates from the mother to become human.\n\nHow rare indeed is the human body! The sages respond to the turning of the ages: twenty thousand years make one kalpa, two thousand years a minor kalpa. Worthies descend into the world once every five hundred years. The Most High Lord Lao, the Great Sage, responds to the needs of beings and expounds the true scriptures—how difficult it is to encounter them! Yet those who do encounter them and fail to believe or turn toward them—what a grievous pity!\n\nAmong all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most noble; humans are the most numinous. In the upper realms, one may become a sage or perfected being—this too is within human capacity. In the lower realms, one may become a ghost or beast—this too is a transformation of the human. For the good ascend to the upper realms, while the evil descend to the lower worlds. Thus, through the mandate of heaven, *yin* and *yang* *qi* determine whether one is born male or female—like the near-impossible alignment of needle and mustard seed, or the rare encounter between sage and mortal.\n\nDao-ling received the esoteric instructions of his former master. The Most High once imparted the thirty-two characters of the true and mysterious aperture to the ancestral Celestial Master, Zhang the Perfected, saying: \"The human body is hard to obtain; true subtlety is hard to encounter. Suddenly, one is swept into the wheel of rebirth, departing without direction. For those who study the Dao, sincerity lies in guarding the center. Naturally, one becomes serene and still, in harmony with heaven and earth—this is the path by which the ancestral masters attained the Dao.\"\n\nNow, Dao-ling dares not conceal this teaching. He annotates this chapter, wishing to share even a fraction of its progress with like-minded seekers.\n\nMany stray from the true Dao, many enter heterodox sects, many plant the roots of sin, many indulge in cunning deceit, many give free rein to lust and killing, many delight in worldly attachments, many indulge in greed and anger, many sink into hell, many lose the human form.\n\nIf one loses the true Dao, one enters heterodox sects. The \"roots of sin\" refer to the ten evil deeds below. \"Cunning deceit\" is the karma of speech; \"lust and killing\" are the karma of the body; \"attachments, greed, and anger\" are the karma of the mind. Once the roots of sin are planted, all manner of evils flourish, leading one to fall into hell and lose the human form.\n\nThe repeated use of \"many\" in this chapter is meant to instruct the foolish—it is not addressed to those of superior wisdom. Yet for such reasons, beings remain deluded, unaware of the true Dao, and the confused are legion.\n\nAll the above karmic causes and effects are made clear by the Most High, who unfurls the great net of the Dao to warn beings: they must not transgress it, lest they fall into hell and lose the human form—yet people remain heedless.\n\nClothing suffices for propriety and warmth; plain food can satisfy hunger. Cultivating simplicity and virtue enriches the body; poetry and books broaden the mind. Official position allows one to apply one’s learning; craft and trade can sustain the body. Yet people do not abide by their station, do not know moderation, do not collect their scattered minds, do not seek the true Dao. They indulge their passions, give rein to desires, wallow in delusion and vain imaginings, restless and agitated, thought after thought racing, step after step falling into the net of evil karma. Whose fault is this?\n\nNow, moved by pity for such beings, I set forth the Dharma and expound the good causes, so that they may know the Dao, understand that body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao for their existence. Awakening to this truth, they may abide long in the human realm, ensuring their lineage continues unbroken, generation after generation as humans, never born in realms devoid of the Dao, never severing the root of humanity.\n\nThe Dao is the path—it is the principle that should guide daily conduct, human relations, and all affairs. All people follow it together.\n\nFrom the perspective of the teaching, the Dao exists before the Supreme Ultimate, transcending the forms and vessels of heaven and earth. It was already present before the arising of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. After the division of heaven and earth, in the heavens it becomes the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning; in humans, it becomes benevolence, righteousness, virtue, and the Dao; on earth, it becomes grasses, trees, mountains, and rivers; in the seasons, it becomes spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in time, it becomes cold, warmth, darkness, and clarity; in the teaching, it is preserving sincerity and refining nature; in the law, it is merit, reward, punishment, and penalty. Thus, the Most High said: \"The great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth; the great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon; the great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao.\"\n\nThe Buddhist tradition also holds that before the existence of heaven and earth, it was our true essence. The early Confucians traced its origins, saying: from the Great Void comes the name \"heaven\"; from the transformation of *qi* comes the name \"Dao.\" What heaven bestows is called *ming* (destiny); *ming* is the command. What humans receive is called *xing* (nature); *xing* is principle. Though heaven does not speak, how does it command? It is simply the great transformation flowing and operating—*qi* reaches a thing, and that thing is born, as if receiving a command. Nature is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Nature and destiny are never separate, yet in human endowment, there are differences in purity and turbidity, length and brevity, clarity and obscurity, thickness and thinness. Thus, there are disparities in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, long life and early death, wisdom and foolishness.\n\nIf one is endowed with *qi* of the utmost purity and refinement, one becomes a person of intelligence and divine sagacity. If one’s *qi* is pure, refined, lofty, and luminous, one becomes a sage of wealth, nobility, and long life. If one’s *qi* is deep, thick, enduring, and long, one becomes a person of intelligence, wisdom, loyalty, integrity, worthiness, and righteousness. If one’s *qi* is thin, foul, and brief, one becomes a person of perversity, violence, treachery, deceit, cruelty, malice, foolishness, poverty, and lowliness.\n\nThe goodness and evil in people, though dependent on their endowment, also arise from the *qi* they receive. The Most High, moved by compassion for the world’s people, transmitted scriptures and precepts to bestow the true teaching, expounded worldly dharmas to elucidate good affinities, and employed skillful means to harmonize and guide all beings, enabling them to know the Dao, understand the body, awaken to their nature, and realize their destiny, thereby obtaining the true seed. Once the true seed is obtained, one attains long life within the human realm; if, generation after generation, one does not turn away, the root of humanity remains unbroken.\n\nThis scripture was not transmitted by the Most High solely for the sake of guiding lesser scholars. If those of superior wisdom thoroughly investigate it, keeping their thoughts fixed on the Dipper and preserving the true with every breath, they will ascend to the ranks of the immortals in time. If they further cultivate the correct Dao in their hearts and gradually enter the lineage of immortality, they will forever escape the cycle of rebirth and transcend to achieve the Dao.\n\nThe Most High, in great compassion and mercy, most benevolent and sagely, teaches and transforms all beings with tireless earnestness. Initially moved by pity for beings whose endowment of heavenly mandate is uncertain, who stray from the human path and sink into oblivion without awareness, the Most High proclaimed essential methods, declaring that people, deluded by the true Dao, fail to awaken and instead plant the roots of sin without realizing it. Thus, they are instructed to know the Dao and understand the body, awaken to their nature and realize their destiny, all of which depend on the Dao for their arising, ensuring the true seed is never severed.\n\nThis chapter further warns that people may fail to escape the Three Realms. Since the Dao can be known, one must also cultivate and practice it, constantly upholding it without neglect, embracing it wholeheartedly. Gradually entering the initial vehicle, with long and steadfast practice, guarding it without loss, applying effort and strength, one will ultimately reach the realm of thorough awakening and rest, enter the lineage of immortality, escape the cycle of rebirth, and achieve the correct Dao.\n\nTherefore, I reveal to you this wondrous method to deliver the people of heaven and guide them to return to the true and know their destiny. On the day of your original destiny, perform a fast and hold a jiao offering.\n\nHere, \"I\" refers to the Heavenly Master, and the \"wondrous method\" points to the following instruction regarding the performance of fasts and jiao offerings on one’s original destiny day. The \"people of heaven\" are the people of the world, born of heaven, and the Heavenly Master is broadly bestowing salvation upon them. As Yi Yin said: *\"I am the first to awaken among the people of heaven; I shall use this Dao to awaken these people.\"* Though instructed to return to the true and know their destiny, they lack a starting point—this is now made clear.\n\nThe Most High, in compassionate skillful means, opens the way for all beings, designating one day within sixty days as the day of one’s original destiny. On that day, purify the heart, observe the fast, restrain the *po* and gather the *hun*, make offerings according to one’s means, submit petitions and memorials, recite the sacred names, and chant the scriptures. Thus, those in the initial stages of truth-seeking will find the practice neither too burdensome nor too lax, neither tedious nor neglectful, making it easy to enter the Dao. Through gradual and sustained cultivation, every day and every moment becomes the day of one’s original destiny. With diligent pursuit and unwavering devotion, cherishing and upholding the practice, the merit and power accumulated are beyond measure.\n\nIn performing fasts and holding jiao offerings, the Dao prioritizes fasting. As the scriptures say: *\"Even an evil person, if they observe the fast with bathing and purification, may serve the Supreme Emperor.\"* For those who study the Dao, though they may observe the fast, if they do not uphold the ten precepts governing body, speech, and mind, their adherence to dietary restrictions is empty and of no benefit—it may even invite transgressions.\n\nThe jiao offering is a summons, calling forth the true spirits of the Three Realms. It is also said: *\"It is a decree inviting each person to ignite the sincerity of their heart and await the Emperor’s edict.\"* Further, it is said: *\"The lamp that illuminates others is my own nature—this is the meaning of the jiao.\"*\n\nThere are three methods of fasting:\n1. **Offering Fast**: This is the practice of performing the fast to make offerings, which accumulates virtue and extends years.\n2. **Dietary Abstinence Fast**: Also called the sacrificial fast, it entails refraining from alcohol and meat, harmonizing the spirits and preserving longevity—this is practiced by those of middling capacity.\n3. **Mind Fast**: This involves purifying the heart, eliminating desires, cleansing the spirit, removing impurities, and severing thoughts and concerns. Without thoughts or concerns, one focuses solely on the Dao; without desires, one delights in the Dao; without impurities or burdens, one unites with the Dao. The mind fast is supreme, dietary abstinence is secondary, and the offering fast is the lowest.\n\nThe *Preface to the Seven Precepts of the Northern Dipper* states: *\"The Most High said: The human body is difficult to obtain, birth in the Middle Land is difficult to attain, and encountering the true Dharma is difficult to come by. When these three are all present, the fortune is unparalleled. Moreover, heaven is impartial and always favors the good. If one can distance oneself from evil and follow goodness, abandon delusion and return to the true, how distant is the Dao? Yet though the Dao is without fixed form, learning follows an order, and the essentials of cultivating the true begin with fasting and precepts.\"*\n\nThe precepts consist of seven articles:\n1. **First Precept**: Do not abandon right mindfulness to indulge in false thoughts, thereby forming inclinations contrary to the Dao. Always preserve the spirit within the sea of *qi* and enter that wondrous gate.\n2. **Second Precept**: Do not display or disseminate sacred texts with arrogance or carelessness. Always maintain secrecy and vigilance, protecting and upholding them day and night. After seven years of merit, transmission to later students is permitted.\n3. **Third Precept**: Do not attend funerals or mournings, or tread upon defiled places, lest external influences disturb and offend the true and upright. Always maintain purity, both internally and externally.\n4. **Fourth Precept**: Do not consume putrid or spoiled foods, the three reviled meats, or the five pungent vegetables, lest they gather corpse impurities and disturb the Three Palaces. Always swallow saliva to cleanse and purify the spiritual source.\n5. **Fifth Precept**: Do not urinate or defecate facing north, or expose oneself to the Three Luminaries, thereby offending the divine spirits and inviting misfortune. Even in seclusion, one should avoid such actions.\n6. **Sixth Precept**: Do not become drunk or overindulge in food and entertainment, lest the spirit and *qi* become confused and the spiritual gates blocked. Always practice moderation to maintain balance.\n7. **Seventh Precept**: Do not associate with improper company or recklessly follow heterodox teachings, lest the mind become divided and lose its direction. Always follow the correct teaching without doubt.\n\nThe above seven true precepts are the essence of the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* and serve as the foundation of mysterious practice and the essential path to attaining the true. Each should be observed and upheld without forsaking one’s initial resolve. If one adheres to these precepts, the seven immortal officials of the precepts will surely protect and bestow blessings, leaving grace and conferring fortune.\n\nInvoke and pray to the Northern Dipper, which resides at the center of Heaven, serving as the pivot of the celestial realm. It governs the revolutions of the four seasons, and all matters—whether of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, the five planets and constellations, the six jia and twenty-eight lunar mansions, the host of immortals and perfected beings, from the Son of Heaven to the common folk—pertaining to longevity, official rank, poverty, wealth, life, death, fortune, and misfortune, even affairs of the unseen realms, all fall under the governance of the Northern Dipper. Should one invoke it with sincere devotion, it will surely respond.\n\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors, along with the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices, as stated in the *Scripture of the Jade Pivot*: the Celestial Official resolves celestial calamities, the Terrestrial Official resolves terrestrial calamities, and the Aquatic Official resolves aquatic calamities. The Five Emperors resolve the calamities of the five directions. The Azure Emperor of the East governs Wood, oversees the liver, and guards the hun-soul; the White Emperor of the West governs Metal, oversees the lungs, and attends the po-soul; the Vermilion Emperor of the South governs Fire, oversees the heart, and regulates qi; the Black Emperor of the North governs Water and governs the blood; the Yellow Emperor of the Center governs Earth, oversees the spleen, and presides over the central palace, commanding the five viscera. As humans take form in accordance with the five phases, the Three Officials and Five Emperors are concerned with all aspects of their existence.\n\nThe Nine Bureaus consist of the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Upper Origin, the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Middle Origin, and the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Lower Origin, totaling twenty-seven bureaus. The Upper Origin has thirty-six departments, while the Middle and Lower Origins each have forty-two departments, amounting to one hundred and twenty departments in all. These collectively govern all beings—whether celestial or terrestrial, human or spirit, immortal or ghost, and all myriad creatures—linking them to the officials of the Dipper to fulfill their inner and outer duties.\n\nThe Four Offices comprise the Four Offices of the Celestial Bureau: the Office of Life, the Office of Records, the Office of Wrongdoing, and the Office of Peril; and the Four Offices of the Earthly Prison: the Office of Life, the Office of Records, the Office of Merit, and the Office of Execution. Together with the Three Officials, Five Emperors, and Nine Bureaus, they examine the sins and blessings of humanity.\n\nThe Most High has imparted these teachings to liberate beings from external conditions of form, instilling awe so that they may turn from evil and incline toward goodness. Yet if one inwardly illuminates through non-action, then all these divine offices and bureaus are already complete within one’s own body.\n\nThe human form corresponds to Heaven and Earth: the round head resides above, symbolizing Heaven; the square feet rest below, symbolizing Earth. The North Star marks the center of Heaven, yet lies in the north, thus the *Baihui* acupoint crowns the human head, while the heart faces backward. The sun and moon traverse only the southern sky, so a person’s two eyes likewise face south. The Northern Dipper revolves through the four seasons, wheeling all the luminaries, just as the human heart encompasses all principles, responds to all affairs, and governs the twelve thousand *jing*-spirits of primordial *shen*, the twelve hundred spirits of form and shadow. It circulates the blood and *qi*, activating the hundred passages, while all spirits together guard the heart.\n\nThe Three Officials are the three *hun*-souls, and also the Three Primes within the human body: the three caverns of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Five Emperors are the five viscera. The Nine Bureaus are the nine orifices. The Four Offices are the four limbs. If one can subdue and govern the nine orifices, nurture and harmonize the three *hun*, regulate and pacify the five viscera, and preserve and move the four limbs—avoiding evil realms, restraining worldly passions, severing self and others, and casting aside right and wrong—one gradually enters the true Dao. Is this not joyous indeed?\n\nTo recommend blessings and dispel calamities, one presents petitions and earnest prayers. On their life-destined day, people beseech grace and request fortune, prolong life and dissolve misfortune. Their fervent supplications are expressed in words and documents, offered in petition to the Northern Dipper and all the divine officials. This is the Most High laying a Dharma-bridge across the ford of delusion, aiding sentient beings onto the great Way. If one can awaken to this, the body encounters a rare opportunity to reach the other shore—like a prisoner long confined in prison who, by good fortune, meets with a sweeping pardon. One should then reflect deeply, reproach oneself, correct past wrongs, and recognize former errors. Wash and purify the heart to remove evil; bathe the body to avoid lingering defilement. Thus, renewing what has already been renewed, day by day renew it again, without interruption. Then one may become a good person.\n\nIf, however, relying on the path of rebirth and the gate of extension, one persists in old evils and commits new ones, this is to knowingly violate the statutes and discard life for the realm of death—sinking into delusion, falling into evil destinies, and losing the human form. Regret will come too late.\n\nWith sincere devotion, one offers various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits, and worldly observances. The altar hall is purified, modeling Heaven and Earth, whether in a Daoist abbey or at home. According to one’s capacity, one establishes merit, requests rituals, and performs Dharma services. The merit and virtue are profound and cannot be fully described.\n\nReciting the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes of True Sovereigns, one’s transgressions and karmic debts will be eradicated, calamities and misfortunes washed away, and fortune, longevity, and life-essence will be endowed, with good fruits accruing to the body. In times of urgent distress, one may burn incense and recite scriptures to secure peace within a set time.\n\nSincere offerings are the essence of sacrifice. When a noble person sacrifices, they observe seven days of abstinence and three days of fasting, ensuring their devotion is complete. Where there is sincerity, there are spirits; where there is no sincerity, there are no spirits. How can one not be reverent and earnest?\n\nObservances of dignity arise from an inner heart of reverence, awe, sincerity, and fear, outwardly manifesting in gazing upward, bowing, prostrating, kneeling, and paying homage—all in proper form. When governing the people, one’s demeanor should be worthy of observation, and one’s conduct measured. How much more so when paying homage to the true and venerating the sacred? To lack dignity is to be disrespectful.\n\n\"Establishing merit according to one’s capacity\" means arranging offerings without rigid constraints. From high-ranking lords, elders, and virtuous persons who establish fasts and offer jiao-rituals, to those of modest means, the sick, the poor, those who practice austerities, and even barbarians and lowly servants—all present flowers and pour water, each according to their strength, offering with utmost sincerity. The key is purity and cleanliness. One must not be extravagant when frugal, nor impoverished when wealthy; stinginess, carelessness, defilement, anger, and irritation will bring immediate misfortune.\n\nWhen reciting the names of the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns or venerating the True Sovereign of one’s life-destiny, one must first clear all distractions, purify body and mind, and prevent worldly thoughts from arising. Then recite them—reciting with the mouth is not as good as reciting with the heart. If one suddenly glimpses one’s original heart, this truly fulfills the intent of the Most High Lord Lao’s teachings. One will then attain timely peace, and good fruits will accrue to the body.\n\n*Commentary on the Most High Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Destiny Longevity True Scripture, Scroll One* (concludes)\n\n*Commentary on the Most High Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Destiny Longevity True Scripture, Scroll Two*\nCollected commentary by Xu Daoling, the Dark Yang Master\nCollated by Xu Daoxuan, the Qian Yang Master\n\nHerein the Great Sage of the Northern Dipper’s efficacy in resolving calamities is expounded:\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Three Disasters. The Three Disasters are stellar designations. According to the *Jade Pivot Scripture*, those who wish to avoid the calamities of the Three Disasters and Nine Perils must, on a quiet night, bow in reverence to the Northern Asterism. Furthermore, in the method of supplicating the Dipper, there are those who place the Three Disaster Stars before the Dipper’s mouth as offerings, for these stars wield the most malevolent influence among all malign forces. When one’s destiny encounters them, performing the proper rites of offering and exorcism will invariably yield response.\n\nThe Three Disasters are also understood as: thunderous wrath as the Celestial Disaster, conflagration as the Terrestrial Disaster, and drowning as the Aquatic Disaster. These afflict beginners who have not attained the true Dao, trapped within the confines of their karmic bonds. When misfortune converges, such calamities are unavoidable. Now, by fortunate encounter with exorcistic rites, these Twenty-Four Calamity-Solving Numinous Talismans—if one recites the Dipper Scripture, prostrates in repentance before the Dipper, recognizes the Star Sovereign of one’s life-destiny, and burns the numinous talismans—can avert such disasters. Those of superior wisdom who cultivate and refine themselves to perfection transcend the limits of celestial fate and qi destiny; how could they suffer these calamities or any other adversities?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Four Slayings. The \"slaying\" refers to destructive forces. The upright are endowed with upright qi, while the wicked encounter malevolent slayings. The Four Slayings are the unbalanced qi of the four seasons: in spring, it manifests as warmth; in summer, as malaria; in autumn, as dysentery; and in winter, as coughing—hence the term Four Slayings. Among the yin-yang correspondences, the Four Slayings reside in the inauspicious directions of *chou*, *wei*, *chen*, and *xu*. The Four Slayings, along with the Three Slayings and Seven Slayings, are all baleful stellar deities of the earthly branches. Should one offend them, the harm is not slight. Yet if one supplicates and exorcises according to the proper rites, all taboos are lifted.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Five Phases Calamities. The Five Phases correspond to the five viscera; once one organ is afflicted, the entire body is unsettled. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: When the Five Phases are obstructed and the Nine Luminaries are inauspicious, recite the Jade Scripture. The Celestial Worthy commands the Six Spirits of Destiny in one’s household to ascend and beseech the Northern Dipper to resolve all calamities. If such disasters arise, one must protect and exorcise them according to the proper rites.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Six Harms. The Six Harms are the six thieves of the body: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent. If left unchecked, they cause harm. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: When the Three Punishments and Six Harms intersect and entangle, one must preemptively guard against them. By venerating the Perfected and paying homage to the Dipper, they can be resolved and exorcised.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Seven Injuries. The Seven Injuries are the seven emotions of humans: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire. Any excess injures the body—hence their alternate name, the Seven Slayings. If one resolves and guards against them, no harm will ensue.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Eight Difficulties. \"Difficulty\" refers to the inescapable malignant illnesses of the world: paralysis, epilepsy, wind-consumption, and leprosy. These eight afflictions—unless one has previously revered the Dipper Perfected—cannot be fully overcome or escaped. The Eight Difficulties are also alternate names for the Eight Sceneries. The Scripture states: The August Heaven admonished the Perfected Immortals and Sages of the Three Realms, saying, \"You must guard against the Eight Leaks to transcend the Eight Difficulties. Only by transcending the Eight Difficulties can one enter the Three Clarities.\"\n\nThe Eight Leaks are:\n- Tears from the eyes, the leak of the liver; if unceasing, longevity is unattainable.\n- Mucus from the nose, the leak of the lungs; if damaged, illness arises.\n- Saliva from the mouth, the leak of the spleen; excessive loss exhausts the body’s essence.\n- Sweat from the body, the leak of the heart; if unchecked, death is inevitable.\n- Drool during sleep, the leak of the brain; if unsealed, the spirit is not numinous.\n- Leakage from the small intestine to the kidneys; if unsecured, life is cut short.\n- Nightly dreams of intercourse with ghosts; the spirit’s leakage is most evident.\n- Unrestrained lust; the body’s leakage is beyond remedy.\n\nThese Eight Leaks constitute the Eight Difficulties. If one reveres the Northern Dipper, the seven emotions will not be recklessly stirred. When emotions no longer cause harm, the Eight Difficulties become轻微. Those of superior wisdom who follow this path can transcend. If one senses the onset of illness, one must immediately cease desires, reduce diet, maintain sincere purification, supplicate the Dipper, recite scriptures, wear numinous talismans, and thereby dissolve and exorcise the afflictions.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Nine Stars Calamities. When the nine orifices are uncontrolled, they give rise to lust, greed, and wrath. These also correspond to the Nine Luminaries’ inauspicious influences. Yet if one diligently cultivates and refines the precious elixir, venerates the Dipper, and pays homage to the Perfected, what calamity cannot be eradicated?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Marital Calamities. The Scripture states: Parents give life, but nothing surpasses the continuation of lineage. The union of man and woman is the great human bond. When worldly couples err in their marital union, offending stellar deities and malevolent forces, governance falters and calamities arise. The Northern Dipper governs the Jade Pivot; for such adversities, one must maintain utmost sincerity, purify oneself, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, supplicate the Dipper, and burn talismans to dissolve and exorcise them. Then husband and wife will live in harmony, and descendants will flourish.\n\nYet some, though married with children, harbor lustful hearts, covet dowries, take multiple wives, establish separate households, contend over wealth and beauty, employ sorcery and curses—causing spouses to become estranged as Orion and Antares, and parents and children to turn against each other like wolves and tigers. Some even face punishment, lose their fortunes, or perish. Such self-inflicted suffering—how can the gods accept the prayers of the unfilial?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters. The causes of childlessness and lineage extinction are manifold. Yet if one extends the care for one’s own young to the young of others, and moreover establishes merit and sows virtue, the Dipper Perfected will resolve such calamities without need for supplication, bestow children without awaiting requests. To indulge in concubines and favoritism not only brings no benefit but invites harm.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Childbirth. If a woman does not monopolize the favor of the bedchamber nor harbor jealousy in her heart, she will be free from childbirth calamities, and her descendants will be numerous. Should she reform her ways, first offering apologies to the Dipper Bureau, performing morning rites of repentance before the precious litanies, inscribing talismans, and reciting the names of her destined Perfected Lords, she may resolve such calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Repeated Misfortune. According to the *Jade Statutes*: Though a person may possess wisdom and ability, their affairs often meet with discord, now succeeding, now failing, bearing only an empty name. Illness lingers unhealed, marriages are untimely, and there is no heir to continue the line. Even if sons and daughters are born, they cannot be raised to maturity, and in the end, nothing goes as one wishes—this is called the affliction of repeated misfortune. It arises when ancestors cannot attain liberation and remain long without anyone to deliver them. Though a hundred thousand years may pass, they will never be reborn. One should resolve this by refining and delivering them to the realm of the living, so that those presently alive may naturally flourish and their affairs proceed as desired.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* of Daoist cultivation teaches that labored suffering is caused by corpse-illnesses. The manifestations of corpse-illness vary: there are transmitted corpse-illness, lingering decay, lung atrophy, bone steaming, and repeated misfortune—all five arise from depletion and debility. The source of the illness begins in the kidneys and transmits to the heart, causing palpitations, shortness of breath, and dreams of departed ancestors. Thus, the Scripture states: \"The departed cannot attain liberation and repeatedly afflict their kin.\" Should one ask, \"How can one know if ancestors cannot attain liberation and repeatedly afflict their six relations?\" The answer is: if one suffers this calamity, they will contract this illness. Once afflicted, one should swiftly reduce desires, purify the heart, take medicinal remedies, swallow talismans, and pray to the Dipper Perfected to deliver their ancestors, so that the departed may attain a favorable rebirth and the living may have their calamities resolved and misfortunes dispelled.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Epidemics. According to the *Sutra of Disaster Dispelling*: If the Great White Fire Star enters the Southern Dipper, it will bring manifold obstacles to the state, the household, and the corresponding regions. Reciting this dhāraṇī and invoking its power will dispel the disaster, transferring it to those who defy royal commands or act with perversity. The Buddha does not shift disasters—rather, such individuals bring them upon themselves. When epidemic toxins spread, causing entire households to fall ill and perish, it is because people ordinarily act without filial piety or loyalty, without benevolence or righteousness, without reverence for Heaven and Earth, without awe for the gods, without respect for the Three Luminaries, without valuing the Five Grains, without maintaining incense offerings, without honoring their own bodies. They indulge in slaughter, abhorring the foul and rank, their evil natures gradually worsening, their wicked deeds growing ever more alike, their noxious qi converging—all of which brings about such consequences. If one reforms, such calamities will not arise. Should contagion occur, one may fast, perform rites to the Dipper, wear sacred talismans, and thereby achieve resolution and expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Illness. For chronic and stubborn ailments rooted in past transgressions, or sudden illnesses and abrupt afflictions due to lack of care, one must swiftly offer rites of apology to the True Lords, supplemented by medicinal remedies and ritual methods, to surely receive support in decline and resolution of calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Malevolent Spirits. When malevolent spirits and demonic forces cause harm, it is because the heart harbors unrighteous thoughts, attracting spectral entanglements—all due to neglecting devotion to the Perfected. If one follows the proper methods to perform rites to the Dipper and pay homage to the Perfected, displaying sacred talismans, and moreover seeking the location of the Celestial Stem, one may summon the true qi to dispel them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves. Encountering tigers, wolves, snakes, or serpents on land, or dragons, shen, and fish in the water—these are the natural calamities of movement. If one first submits to the Jade Pivot, sincerely offers to the Dipper Palace, recites the scripture’s name, and wears sacred talismans, how could such calamities befall? Should one encounter them, swiftly cast the talisman into fire or water, and the response will be as swift as an echo.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Insects and Snakes. When birds and rodents deliver omens, or snakes and insects bring misfortune, it is because in daily household management, one fails to rectify killing, theft, and licentiousness, violates taboos, and offends the gods’ wisdom. Thus, the Six Spirits depart, and serpentine spirits seize the opportunity to enter. One should recite the Dipper’s name, repent of transgressions, purify the household, burn and display sacred talismans, and naturally summon the true qi to dispel and expiate them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Bandits and Robbers. These arise from careless concealment and accumulated debts—one’s own doing. If one proactively petitions for resolution and cautiously guards against the unforeseen, one may avoid them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Cangues and Cudgels. If one is falsely accused of crimes, entangled in wrongful charges, or suffers from mistaken transgressions or false accusations, finding oneself imprisoned in fetters and enduring the suffering of cangues and cudgels—though the circumstances may be unjust, once the case is documented, officials avoid blame by calling it doubtful, and family members’ pleas of innocence go unheeded. One should wholeheartedly fast, reveal one’s true feelings, submit a petition, and pray to the Dipper Bureau. Even those imprisoned should fast in their hearts and pray silently, aligning inner and outer sincerity. This will surely move the gods, bringing hidden retribution and manifest response, ensuring fair trials and reversals of verdicts, thereby resolving the calamity. Thus, can legal punishments be resolved?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Unnatural Death. All deaths not by natural causes are called unnatural deaths. If one knows of such impending calamities, one should perform good deeds, accumulate hidden virtue, repent of past wrongs, examine oneself, and earnestly pray to the Dipper Palace, wearing sacred talismans—thereby achieving the efficacy of reviving the dead. However, if one is crushed beneath collapsing walls or executed amid extreme torture, such unnatural deaths are self-inflicted, not the work of Heaven, and prayers will be of no avail.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Curses and Oaths.\n\nAlliances broken by curses, oaths violated, sorcery of infatuation, demonic possession, and malevolent prayers—these matters take many forms. Some seek love and admiration; some sow discord among kin; some betray kindness and violate loyalty; some make vows only to break them; some quarrel over unequal shares of wealth; some suffer oppression without redress; some wish others dead or afflicted with suffering; some trust in shamans and foolishly seize others’ souls, causing them to become confused and disoriented; or some fall into silent brooding, lying bedridden for long periods. All these arise from the misalignment of body and mind, or from actions that are excessive or deficient.\n\nIf one can reflect upon the origins of these afflictions, examine one’s own faults, correct past wrongs, and cultivate future good deeds; if one further recites the names of the Great Sages and wears the sacred talismans of the Celestial Emperor, then these calamities may be resolved and averted.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Heavenly Nets.\nThe Heavenly Net represents the principles of Heaven, while the Earthly Snare represents the affairs of humanity. If one, as a person, neither violates the laws of the state above nor transgresses human ethics below, then one may traverse freely in all directions, forever free from the entanglements of nets and snares. Should one harbor such thoughts, one will inevitably fall into this calamity; should one defy this Way, one will suffer this punishment. Yet if one does not transgress the Five Constants, upholds the Three Bonds, and with sincere heart and clear mind pays homage to the true Dipper, one will forever attain longevity and enter the Dao of immortality.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Earthly Snares.\nThe preceding text has already clarified this, yet the matter remains incomplete. The Earthly Snare and Heavenly Net are none other than the statutes and ordinances of the law. People do not reflect that wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness are predetermined by fate; instead, they fail to accept their lot, know no restraint, defy the Mandate of Heaven, resist the workings of qi, and commit unlawful acts that violate state laws. They cast aside their nature and forfeit their lives—how can they escape the calamities of the Earthly Snare and Heavenly Net? Yet if one accepts one’s station, bears punishment in mind, preserves the body, and upholds the Dao; if one further pays homage to the Dipper and venerates the true, then one will naturally be free from such calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Hell.\nThe merit of this scripture extends to both the living and the dead. If one bears karmic debts from past lives and, after death, faces judgment in the courts of the underworld, filial descendants may seek to absolve their nine generations by petitioning the Dipper, performing rites of repentance, and seeking pardon for their sins—thereby guiding the deceased onto the path of the virtuous.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve all calamities.\nThe Most High, in bestowing these teachings and expounding this wondrous scripture, enables people to prolong life, preserve destiny, transcend calamities, and dispel misfortune. The calamities discussed here are but the most prominent examples. As the *Scripture of the Jade Pivot* states: \"The Northern Dipper resolves all calamities.\" When people face hardship, they need only pay homage with sincerity, perform rituals, hold fasts, recite scriptures, burn talismans, and invoke the names—then there will be no lack of response.\n\nThus, the Seven Primes, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious and spiritually attuned. This chapter serves as the path to entering the Dao and cultivating the true, the essential method for prolonging life and paying homage to the Dipper, the secret technique for resolving calamities and dispelling misfortune, and the pivotal key to reviving the dead and restoring life. The Most High places this after the discussion of calamities to urge people to cultivate and uphold these methods—thereby freeing themselves from all obstacles and naturally ascending to the true and attaining the Dao.\n\nFor those who have just begun to study the Dao, as well as for devout men and faithful women, if they arouse sincere devotion and, on the days when the Seven Primes descend, follow the prescribed methods—reciting scriptures, burning talismans, submitting memorials, and presenting petitions—then the mighty power and spiritual efficacy of the Seven Primes, the wondrous transformations of the Great Sages, and the numinous clarity of the myriad spirits will come into play. They will deliver beings from all calamities and raise them from the suffering of the multitudes.\n\nIf people wish to dispel misfortune, atone for sins, resolve calamities, and release hardships, they need only pay homage to the Dipper with reverence—then all their wishes will be fulfilled, and they will lift sentient beings from the depths of suffering. For those in urgent need, reciting these words will preserve peace.\n\nIf a household faces illness, misfortune, childbirth, disaster, the desire for descendants, or the wish to prolong life, they should swiftly compose their thoughts, focus their minds, invoke the name of their life-star sovereign, uphold this method, recite this scripture, and burn this talisman—thereby ensuring the household’s tranquility and the timely resolution of all troubles.\n\nAll may rely upon this to generate a hundred blessings, all in harmony with the Five Phases.\nAs the *Seven Precepts of the Dipper True* states: \"Do not associate with improper company, recklessly pursue heterodox paths, or waver in resolve, leaving no guiding principle. Always follow the true teachings without doubt.\" If one wholeheartedly devotes oneself to these scriptures and methods, cultivating the Dao and attaining the true, the Dipper’s administration will bestow a hundred blessings, and all one’s actions will silently align with the transformations of the Five Phases.\n\nThe three hun-souls will be secure and healthy, malevolent spirits will forever cease, and true qi will descend from the Five Directions, bringing myriad blessings to converge naturally.\nWhen the three hun-souls are secure and healthy, the nine spirits will withdraw their traces. The five viscera will naturally generate true qi; once true qi is generated, one will forever preserve integrity and uprightness, and myriad blessings will naturally unite with one’s body.\n\nLongevity transcends the Eight Difficulties, all through revering the Seven Stars.\nOnce myriad blessings converge upon one’s body, the Eight Difficulties will naturally be transcended, and the path to longevity will be complete—all attained through the mysterious efficacy of revering the Seven Stars. If one can, as previously described, stabilize the three hun-souls, regulate the five viscera, restrain the Three Corpses, restrain the Nine Spirits, and escape the Eight Difficulties, then one will have realized the merit of revering the Northern Dipper.\n\nThis will ensure that in every life, one avoids confinement and attains freedom, roaming at ease with the Dao, and in every generation, one’s spirit remains pure.\nGoodness is like a shadow in light, and response is like an echo in a valley.\nOnce one attains freedom in every life and purity of spirit in every generation, the primordial spirit will generate wisdom and light, illuminating the right and wrong of all things. Thus, what is within will inevitably manifest without.\n\nThe Three Primordials guard as one, and the eyes of the myriad sages shine in unison. Should the scholar of the Dao cultivate to this station, then the Celestial Officials shall attend his hun-souls, the Terrestrial Officials his po-souls, and the Aquatic Officials his spirit. Thus ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital, the ten thousand spirits and ten thousand eyes will naturally gaze upon him with reverence and veneration.\n\nNo calamity shall arise, nor shall any obstacle endure; the heart of the Dao shall forever remain at peace. This passage encompasses the essential purport of the scripture. If one can refine the Dipper’s oral instructions with precision and delve deeply into the Dipper’s canon, how could calamities or obstacles ever arise? Thus shall the heart of revering the Dao abide in eternal tranquility.\n\nLord Lao said: The Northern Asterism hangs its image, and the host of stars gathers around it. The *Records of Aspiration* state: The Northern Asterism is the Northern Emperor, also called the Northern Culmen, or the Great Asterism. Thus, the Culmen Asterism is the heart of heaven, rectifying the myriad things; the Northern Culmen is the Pivot of Heaven, residing at its center, unmoving as the master of qi. Therefore, the host of stars encircles and turns toward it.\n\nSome say that in the phrase \"the Northern Asterism hangs its image,\" the character \"north\" may be a scribal error for \"this,\" referring to the Northern Dipper, which would better align with the preceding and following passages. Dao-ling observed that the Northern Dipper is the sovereign of the ten thousand images. As the Dipper’s handle turns, revolving day and night, all stars follow its movement.\n\nThe Northern Asterism is none other than the Northern Dipper. The seven stars of the Northern Dipper lie north of the Supreme Subtlety, before the Northern Culmen. The four stars of the Dipper’s bowl form the Celestial Sphere, and the three stars of its handle form the Jade Balance, as it is said: \"The Celestial Sphere and Jade Balance regulate the Seven Governors.\" Our Master Confucius spoke of governance, likening it to the Northern Asterism governing through virtue—this is the Northern Dipper’s revolving operation, from which yin and yang emerge, life and death arise, the four seasons are established, and the myriad spirits are commanded. Is this not governance? Such is the discourse of the Most Sage Master.\n\nAccording to another version of the *Scripture of Prolonging Life*: The Most High said: \"Heaven’s One generates water, born from the north. Thus, the Purple Tenuity’s enclosure is exalted in the Northern Asterism. The lodgings of the Northern Asterism are arrayed as the Seven Primordials: the first is the Greedy Wolf, the last the Broken Luminary, and at the center stands the Literary Star, serving as the pivot of heaven and earth.\" Moreover, the Three Terraces stars serve as the Northern Dipper’s canopy. The *Scripture of the Jade Pivot* states: \"Above the Northern Asterism lie the Three Terraces, their stars intertwined, shaped like a pair of eyes, stacked in three tiers to cover the Dipper’s bowl.\" Thus, it is again made clear that the Northern Asterism is the Northern Dipper.\n\nNevertheless, we await the arrival of perfected beings and lofty scholars to further elucidate and verify these truths. It is the pivot of creation’s mechanism and the sovereign of human spirit, proclaiming its might across the Three Realms and governing the myriad spirits. In heaven, it is the Northern Asterism; in humans, it is the true nature. The Northern Asterism commands all stars, directing the Three Realms and operating the transformations of creation.\n\nIn the first, second, and third months, the Dipper’s handle points to the positions of yin, mao, and chen at dusk, giving birth to the myriad things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it points to si, wu, and wei, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it points to shen, you, and xu, bringing the myriad things to maturity. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it points to hai, zi, and chou, gathering and storing the myriad things. If the Dipper’s handle ceases to turn, the four seasons lose their rhythm, the Five Phases fail to respond, cold and heat deviate from their measures, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and living things cannot come to fruition. Thus, it is the pivot of creation’s mechanism. The true nature governs the myriad spirits, distinguishing good from evil and discerning right from wrong.\n\nIt judges the appointed time for good and evil among humankind. Some people, though devoted to good deeds, encounter many misfortunes—this is because their merit in goodness is not yet sufficient. Once their merit is complete, blessings will arrive. As the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one receives, upholds, reads, and recites this sutra yet is despised by others, it is because their past-life karmic offenses are thereby extinguished.\" Others, though wholly given to evil, enjoy good fortune—this is because their evil is not yet full. When their evil reaches its limit, great disaster will strike. Thus, Lord Lao said: \"Evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy the self.\" The matters of good and evil each have their appointed times—this is the virtue of the Most High’s love for life. For those who do good, the time awaits the fullness of great goodness; for those who do evil, the time awaits their repentance. Thus, the appointed time for good and evil is made clear.\n\nThe eyes of the Underworld’s judges of right and wrong—how could the sacred efficacy of the Northern Dipper remain obscure? Yet, as this passage states, the spirits below govern the straight and crooked, the meritorious and the blameworthy; the ghostly officials discern diligence from negligence; the suffering and radiant souls rise or stagnate; and the revolutions of the Four Births and Six Paths all fall under this guiding principle.\n\nThe Five Phases share a common endowment, and the Seven Governors belong to the same category. Jupiter (Wood) governs the year and the branches, corresponding to the four lodgings of Horn, Dipper, Straddler, and Well. Mars (Fire) corresponds to Tail, Room, Beak, and Wings. Venus (Metal) corresponds to Neck, Ox, Straddler, and Ghost. Mercury (Water) corresponds to Winnowing Basket, Wall, Orion’s Belt, and Chariot Platform. Saturn (Earth) corresponds to Base, Maiden, Stomach, and Willow. Additionally, the four lodgings of Chamber, Void, Mane, and Pleiades serve as the Sun’s abode, matched to it and belonging to Fire. The four lodgings of Heart, Danger, Net, and Spread serve as the Moon’s abode, matched to it and belonging to Water. These four times seven stars, paired with the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries, are also called the Seven Governors.\n\nThe Northern Dipper is the body of Heaven, while the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries are its function. Thus, one body and one function are bound to movement and stillness; one movement and one stillness are bound to yin and yang; one yin and one yang are bound to Heaven and Earth; one Heaven and one Earth are bound to water and fire. The union of water and fire is called creation and transformation. The mechanism of creation and transformation is the revolving jade armillary—this is how the Northern Dipper governs movement and stillness, body and function, yin and yang, water and fire, Heaven and Earth, and creation and transformation.\n\nThough the function of the Seven Governors shares the same category as the Northern Dipper, the meaning of the Dipper is truly vast. The character *dou* (斗) is composed of *shi* (十, ten) and *er* (二, two). The Dipper governs the center of Heaven, revolving and regulating the degrees, establishing the four seasons to govern the eight directions, harmonizing the Five Phases to align the Seven Governors. Its function encompasses the number twelve.\n\nIn the Three Clarities, it generates the nine *qi*; the nine *qi* generate the Supreme Heavenly Purple Tenuity and the Northern Culmen, forming twelve positions. In the Northern Dipper, the seven visible and two hidden stars combine with the Three Terraces, also forming twelve positions. In the human body, there are the five viscera and seven orifices; in yin and yang, there are the twelve branches; in the human form, there are twelve correspondences; in the celestial circuit, there are the twelve thunder gates. A year has twelve months, and a day has twelve hours. Extending this principle, truly nothing between Heaven and Earth is not under the Dipper’s governance.\n\nFellow students and perfected ones who daily pay homage to the Real and hourly venerate the Dipper will naturally attract the true *qi* of the Dipper’s immortals to their bodies, thereby prolonging their lives. This practice possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dispel calamities and transcend tribulations.\n\nThe Most High, in his compassion, expounded this scriptural formula precisely to dispel calamities, transcend tribulations, reverse death, and inscribe life. Though the Mandate of Heaven cannot be altered, it is also shaped by human cultivation. Thus, death may be reversed, and tribulations resolved. Heaven’s decree may overcome humanity, yet humanity’s resolve may also overcome Heaven.\n\nI, Dao Ling, have witnessed in the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Scripture of Paying Homage to Heaven and Offering Thanks to Thunder* the Most High’s proclamation of one such matter, demonstrating that the power to reverse death lies in human cultivation. In the ninth kalpa of the Dragon Han era, in the village of Yibao in Dongping Prefecture, there lived a man surnamed Zhao, whose nature was simple and unrefined. One day, while on business in the prefectural city, he encountered a diviner who said, “Your fiery complexion foretells that within three days, you will incur the wrath of thunder.” The man returned home without revealing this to anyone. On the third day, a great storm of wind, thunder, and rain darkened Heaven and Earth. The man exclaimed, “Heaven has come to execute me! I shall flee to the wilderness to spare my parents and siblings from fear.” Grasping an umbrella, he hastened to the eastern outskirts to await his fate.\n\nAt that moment, the thunder of the earth, knowing his thoughts, dispatched the fierce official Xin, judge of the Celestial Thunder Bureau, who transformed into a commoner to observe the matter. Flying beneath the umbrella, he shared its shelter with the man. The man said, “Heaven seeks to execute me, and I have come to await death. You should leave quickly and not linger here; take the umbrella with you.” Judge Xin flew back to report to the Celestial Thunder Bureau, which memorialized the Supreme Emperor. Moved by the man’s conduct, the Emperor granted him an additional thirty-six years of life, a thousand days of official salary, and pardoned three generations of his sins—all because of three good deeds: first, knowing of the thunder’s wrath yet not speaking of it, which was reverence for Heaven; second, fleeing to the wilderness to await death, which was love for his kin; third, urging the man sharing his umbrella to leave and offering him the umbrella, which was benefiting others. Because of these three deeds, he prospered, his descendants flourished, and his death was reversed to life. Is this not the result of human cultivation?\n\nFrom emperors to commoners, though their ranks differ, their destinies are no different. Heaven and Earth are but one *qi*; humans and all beings share a single path. Once, Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Seven Primal Perfected Lords on Mount Zhongnan. Clad in plain robes with unbound hair, the Emperor bowed and asked, “May I inquire which immortals and sages you are?” The Perfected Lords replied, “We are the Seven Primal Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper, descending to the human realm to inspect the fortunes of good and evil.”\n\nThe Emperor knelt and bowed again, asking, “What affairs do you immortals oversee?” The Perfected Lords said, “We govern the stellar lodgings of the various heavens above and the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, three hundred sixty famous mountains, thirty-six grotto-heavens, and earthly immortals below. The river sources and aquatic tribes are also under our jurisdiction, as are the lifespans, clothing, food, official ranks, illnesses, weapons, punishments, and prisons of the people of the lower realm, along with the rise and fall of their allotted lands. All these are recorded by us.”\n\nThe Emperor asked, “Do I, as Son of Heaven, also fall under your governance?” The Perfected Lords replied, “Though you are a ruler among men, your destiny is the same as that of the common people.” The Emperor bowed and said, “My eyes have never beheld such Perfected Ones.” He then inquired further, “May I seek the Dao of longevity and cultivate it?” The Perfected Lords said, “If you seek the supreme Dao to escape death and ascend to Heaven, you must be steadfast and diligent—how could you not attain it?”\n\nThe Emperor said, “I am fortunate to have met you, Perfected Ones. I beg you to transmit your teachings. I shall cultivate them without fail and commission paintings of your true forms to venerate throughout my life.” The Perfected Lords replied, “Since you have earnestly requested this of us, we cannot refuse. As your former destiny was that of an immortal who descended to become a ruler, we shall now impart to you the secret arts of the Mysterious Real. You must practice them in secrecy and not leak them. You must make great vows, revere Heaven and comply with humanity, cultivate a kind and harmonious nature, and strictly abstain from lust, laziness, killing, harm, and reckless thoughts. To attain the Dao and communicate with the sages, simply follow the method of stepping through the Dipper at the two times when *qi* converges, swallow talismans, recite incantations, visualize, and perform offerings. When your merit is complete, you will naturally ascend as an immortal.”\n\nThe Emperor said, “I shall follow the method and uphold the precepts.” The Perfected Lords said, “Listen carefully. Cultivate your body and refine your form. Always practice between midnight and noon. Visualize your body as a withered tree, then tightly grasp your left middle finger at the middle joint. Next, imagine your empty body as a mass of true *qi*. When this is complete, visualize the true *qi* transforming into a true person. The Azure Dragon emerges from the left of your liver, the White Tiger from the right of your lungs, the Vermilion Bird from the top of your heart, and the Dark Warrior from the feet of your kidneys. The Four Spirits will attend and guard you.”\n\nThen perform the *Step of the Dipper*. In all *Steps of the Dipper*, during spring and summer begin from the *Kui Star*, and during autumn and winter begin from the *Gang Star*. Always start with the left foot. When about to perform the *Step of the Dipper*, first tightly grasp with both hands at the middle joint of the middle fingers, silently recite □□□□□□□, then lift the left foot. Visualize the Dipper’s canopy above your head, with the *Kui Star* in front and the *Gang Star* behind. Next, visualize golden light illuminating you, then knock the left teeth seven times and recite the incantation:\n\n*“In the world above, eight thousand beings,\nIn the realm below, four generals govern.\nThe Three-Five officers expel evil spirits,\nThe Four-Six youths protect my body.\nThe Six Jia direct talismans to dispel curses,\nThe Six Ding jade maidens guard my form.\nOn the left, the Azure Dragon; on the right, the White Tiger;\nAbove, the Vermilion Bird; below, the Dark Warrior.\nBefore me, the Attendant Clerk; behind, the Recorder.\nBanish all malevolent spirits and nightmares—\nIf they do not depart at once, raise the Heavenly Axe!”*\n\nThen knock the right teeth seven times and recite the incantation:\n\n*“Great Peace of the Nine Palaces,\nThe Great One guards the chamber.\nA hundred spirits assume their positions,\nSoul and spirit harmonize as one.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nSealing away all misfortune.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the command of the Most High Lord Lao!”*\n\nThe Perfected Lords said, “This incantation was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Most High. You must uphold these two incantations, and divine generals, spirit youths, and jade maidens will naturally follow and guard you, driving away all afflictions. Epidemics, consumptive illnesses, legal punishments, and blades of war will never draw near.”\n\nThe Emperor said, “On which days do the Perfected Ones descend to the mortal realm? What do they consume? I humbly request your instruction, that I may make offerings.”\n\nThe Perfected Lords said, “On the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of the first month; the second, seventh, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days of the second month; the twenty-sixth day of the third month; the seventeenth and twenty-seventh days of the fourth month; the fifth, thirteenth, and twentieth days of the fifth month; the fourth and eighth days of the sixth month; the fourth and twenty-fourth days of the seventh month; the second, eleventh, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month; the third and eighteenth days of the ninth month; the tenth and twenty-sixth days of the tenth month; the first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of the eleventh month; the twentieth day of the twelfth month; and on every third and twenty-seventh day, as well as *Gengshen* and *Jiazi* days, we descend to wander the mortal world. Offerings should consist of freshly ripened fruits and cakes, fragrant flowers and herbs, fine wine, and jujube broth.\n\nWhen making offerings, first press your tongue against the upper palate, visualizing it as the *Bridge of Immortal Ascent*. Then imagine the five viscera emitting five-colored *qi*, forming five strands of auspicious clouds. Ride this bridge to the Five Dippers, and silently summon the spirit envoys of the current year, month, day, and hour. Ascend the bridge to our Dipper and say: ‘Disciple [your name] has [matter] to report.’\n\nIf you see within the Dipper one figure resembling a jade maiden holding a ram’s head, this is the *Lifting Ram Envoy*. Next, if you see one holding a sword in the left hand and a flower tray in the right, this is the *Dhara Envoy*. These two will first inspect your offerings. If they are impure or defiled, they will report it.\n\nIf rare fragrances and purple clouds enter the chamber, it is we, the Seven Perfected Ones, along with the Left Assistant and Right Attendant, descending. You must make offerings in a secluded room, free from anger, and always maintain joy. Do not allow women, mourners, monks, or nuns to witness this, for if they do and defile us, calamity will strike at once. If you cultivate with single-minded devotion, when disaster approaches, simply burn incense and petition us, and misfortune will be averted. Do not act recklessly.\n\nNow, having attained this true and mysterious method, I dare not keep it secret for my own benefit. Thus, I record this chapter, hoping that those of superior wisdom will cultivate according to its teachings, attain spiritual resonance, and ascend to transcendence, realizing the Dao.\n\nOrdinary people in the world are mostly deluded. They do not know their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper, nor that their lives are governed by the Celestial Bureau. When disasters and misfortunes arise, they do not know the path of expiation. To prolong life and fortune, they do not understand the way of returning to the true. The Dipper is the plumb line of Heaven and Earth, the crucible of *yin* and *yang*. It gives birth to creatures and humanity, circulates water and fire, completes the four seasons, and commands all spirits across the ten directions and three realms. Even the exalted Three Clarities and the Jade Pivot of the Vast Heaven cannot surpass the great virtue of the Northern Dipper!\n\nYet people wear the Dipper upon their heads without realizing their bodies belong to it, and they do not diligently pay homage or cultivate devotion. How can worldly people avoid disasters that befall them? Even those who study the Dao but possess shallow understanding may still suffer, let alone those entangled in worldly affairs. Their minds are enslaved by fame and profit, never knowing restraint; their essence is shaken by wine and lust, never knowing moderation. When calamity strikes, disaster is inevitable. Yet when misfortune arrives, they still do not awaken to return to the true and seek expiation. Instead, they blindly trust shamans and sorcerers, slaughtering animals and burning foul offerings in prayer. If they recover by chance, they credit the gods’ favor; if they die, they blame the gods for failing to protect them. Some even consume medicines that harm living beings.\n\nAlas! You seek life, yet they too cherish their own. How can you bear such cruelty? All these errors stem from not knowing the path of expiation. Those who know the path first seek healing through medicine. If that fails, they pray to their ancestors. If the ancestors do not respond, they then seek ritual aid. If still no effect, they have already offended Heaven’s decree and the stars’ fate, and must resolve it through virtuous deeds.\n\nHave you not heard of Duke Jing of Song in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*? When the *Yinghuo* star lingered in the Heart constellation, portending disaster for Song, Zi Wei said, ‘The calamity meant for you, my lord, can be transferred to your ministers.’ The Duke replied, ‘Ministers exist to govern the state.’ Zi Wei said, ‘It can be transferred to the people.’ The Duke said, ‘If the people die, whom shall I rule?’”\n\nDuke Jing said, “It can be transferred to the harvest.”\nThe Duke replied, “If the harvest fails, the people will surely starve to death.”\nZi Wei said, “My lord has spoken with utmost virtue. The Three Heavens will surely reward you thrice.”\nThat very night, the *Yinghuo* star retreated three celestial stations.\n\nTruly, when one faces disaster, can it not be resolved through virtuous deeds? If a person cultivates a single good thought or performs a single good deed, they can move ghosts and gods and stir Heaven and Earth. When disaster strikes according to the stars’ fate, one should seek ritual expiation, acknowledge the Star Lord governing one’s destiny, and perform rites to dissolve calamity. Further, one must reflect thrice upon oneself, examine past transgressions, repent sincerely, and wholeheartedly return body, spirit, and life to the Dipper Officials. Thus, disasters may be dispelled, and life prolonged with added years.\n\nThis is the path of expiation and return to the True. If one neither relies on skilled physicians and medicine to cure illness nor demonstrates devotion by petitioning the Dipper and sacrificing to ancestors, then disaster will deepen, illness will worsen, and death will draw near. The soul and spirit will be bound, misfortunes will entangle, grave illnesses may not heal, or malevolent spirits will inflict harm, leading to years of suffering, prolonged hardship, legal disputes, and summons. Ancestral spirits may be implicated, Heaven may send reprimands, or vengeful ghosts may lodge false accusations below.\n\nWhen such peril arises, how can one seek deliverance? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, perform rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, acknowledging the Perfected Lord of one’s destiny. Only then can peace and prosperity be attained. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully expounded.\n\nYet the foolish and deluded, driven by greed and avarice, exploit public office for private gain, harm others for personal benefit, trust in shamans for excessive sacrifices, bribe officials to oppress the good, indulge in cruelty to torture servants, and display jealousy toward their spouses. They act as if Heaven and Earth do not exist and fear no divine judgment. Failing to awaken, they sink deeper into wrongdoing, perpetuating delusion and accumulating evil until misfortune overflows. When circumstances shift and adversity strikes, illness and malevolent spirits follow. Once human desires are exhausted and Heaven’s principle shines forth, countless perils manifest in the heart.\n\nThe Most High, in boundless compassion, opens the gate of expiation and points directly to the path of return to the True. If one repents past transgressions, vows to avoid former wrongs, submits petitions, performs rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and reverently acknowledges one’s destined Star Lord—further cultivating the True and turning toward the Dao—prosperity and honor will follow. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully described. The Most High briefly reveals below the true forms, names, and sacred talismans of the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Power for Prolonging Life, with Annotations*, Scroll Two, concludes.\n\n---\n\n**The Perfected Lords of the Seven Primes of the Great Sage Northern Dipper** can resolve the sufferings of hell... and dissolve all calamities.\n\n*(The *Scripture Annotations* and *Annotated Scripture* both read: “The Seven Perfected Lords of the Great Sage can resolve the calamities of warfare... and dissolve the calamities of water and fire.”)*\n\n*(In the preceding two collated versions, this phrase reads: “and all stars pay homage to it.”)*\n\n*(In the preceding two collated versions, “return to the True” is rendered as “take refuge” or “return to refuge.”)*\n\n---\n\n**The *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Power for Prolonging Life, with Annotations*, Scroll Three**\n\nCompiled and annotated by Xu Daoling of Xuanyangzi\nCollated and corrected by Xu Daoxuan of Qianyangzi\n\nWhenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must pay reverence with utmost respect. Devotion to the Perfected must be as constant as donning one’s cap and robe—never to be set aside even for a moment. Sincerity in worship must be as if facing the sovereign or serving a noble—without the slightest negligence. Only then can one move the Perfected Spirits.\n\nThe First Star of the Northern Dipper is **Yangming, the Greedy Wolf, the Great Star Lord**, governing those born in the *zi* hour.\nThe Scripture states: All human life originates from Heaven’s *qi*. The *qi* of the true north, residing in the center, generates water, and all things arise from water. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, revolving through the four directions, governing the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of all people.\n\nThe Northern Dipper:\n1. **Greedy Wolf Star**, the Eastern Dipper, governs destiny.\n2. **Giant Gate Star**, the Western Dipper, records names.\n3. **First Assistant Star**,\n4. **Second Assistant Star**,\n6. **Military Arts Star**, residing in its proper position as the Northern Dipper, governs death.\n5. **Healthy Chastity Star**, the Southern Dipper, governs birth.\n7. **Broken Army Star**, residing in the central position as the Great Chief of the Central Dipper, oversees all spirits.\n\nAll things in creation, in life and death, are governed by the Northern Dipper.

In sustaining life, they are collectively called the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng*; in measuring death, they are collectively called the *Huoluo*.\n\nIf sentient beings encounter illness or calamity, performing expiatory rites in the appropriate direction will ensure no good deed goes unanswered.\n\nThe **Star Lord’s** name is *Kuai*, styled *Greedy Wolf*, also called *Celestial Pivot* or *Proper Star*.

The Star Lord’s name is □, styled *Breaking Army*, also called *Yaoguang*, or *Department Star*, also known as *Responding Star*, overseeing military affairs. He is also named *Shu Perfected Lord*, styled *Tai Binzi*, or *Celestial Pivot*, styled *Ziqiao*, with two additional names: first, *Celestial Peng*, styled *Ziqin*, and second, *Celestial Inner*, styled *Tiancheng*—these are his concealed radiance names. The *Breaking Army Star Lord* resides in the *Pass Meeting Palace* within the *Nine-Hued Jade Tower*, corresponding to metal and governing the sea’s origin and wives and concubines. Those born in *wu* belong to him. He oversees the *Metal Star Perfected Lord* and the four lunar lodges of *Ox*, *Girl*, *Void*, and *Danger*, regulating the *Celestial Pass* to govern the astrological divisions of the *Qi* lands and *Yuzhou*, serving as the celestial *Supreme Thearch*. He presides over the mechanisms of heaven and earth, the length of the four seasons, the prosperity and decline of heaven and earth, and the reckoning of kalpas and conjunctions—none are beyond his jurisdiction.\n\nThe Perfected Lord also appears in plain white robes with flowing hair, known as the *Mystic Upper Perfected August Lady*, residing in the *Perfected August Heaven*. As the seventh *Pass Meeting Palace*, the Emperor divides his radiance into the Dipper’s *Youngest Maiden*, named *Taiyi Yumo*, styled *Tianfan Shu*, clad in vermilion brocade and an azure luminous feathered skirt. Another stellar manifestation bears the surname *Xuan Shu*, with the taboo name *Kai Tian Tu*, wearing a seven-starred crown, vermilion robe, brocade skirt, tiger-headed patterned sash, and lion-patterned shoes. She transforms into a boar-headed human-faced figure, holding a *joyous orb*, or appears in plain white robes, exhaling crimson *qi* whose brilliance outshines the sun, standing at the Dipper’s handle. In another true form, she wears a *nine-cloud crown* and nine-hued brocade robes, wielding a *divine whip*, called the *Dragon-Riding Perfected*, titled *Jade Sovereign General Numinous Nine Origins Northern Canopy Dawn Lord*, also known as the *Yaotian Palace Great Sage □ Star Lord*. Her lantern is called *Governor of Wives and Concubines*, and her true talisman is named *Declining Support Talisman*, with a stellar domain spanning nine hundred *li*.\n\nThe Eighth Star of the Northern Dipper, the *Cavern Bright External Auxiliary Star Lord*, is the star of the *Jade Thearch of Heaven*, above presiding over the Nine Heavens and below governing the immortal officials of the Nine Lands, Five Marchmounts, and Four Waterways. He resides in the *Imperial Seat Palace* within the *Purple Qi Jade Tower*, bearing the surname *Jingchang*, with the taboo name *Shang Kai*, styled *Zhengyan*, wearing a *flying essence treasure crown* and nine-hued phoenix robes, holding a *fire bell*. He transforms into a purple-robed figure with a golden belt and *futou* hat, holding a *hu* tablet, or adopts the attire of various state ministers, called the *Roaming Three Destinies Perfected*, titled *Jade Emperor August Prime Dawn Lord*, also known as the *Imperial Grand Master August Lady*, residing in the *Grand Master Heaven*. As the eighth *Imperial Seat Palace*, the Emperor transforms into the Dipper’s *High August Left Lady*, named *Taiyi Shi Qizhu*, styled *Luoluo Maohua*, draped in a purple brocade sash and an embroidered feathered vermilion flying skirt. His domain encompasses the *Yan* lands and *Bingzhou* astrological divisions. As the Dipper’s *External Auxiliary*, he oversees all affairs, inspecting the merits, demerits, blessings, and transgressions of the great ministers governing the myriad states and nine provinces. His lantern is used to exorcise misfortunes, cure illnesses, and take medicine to discern good and ill fortune. This auxiliary star leans upon *Kaiyang*, thus serving as the Dipper’s successful prime minister.\n\nThe Ninth Star of the Northern Dipper, the *Concealed Radiance Internal Assistant Star Lord*, is the star of the *Great Thearch of Heaven*, governing boundless transformations and the merits and demerits of immortals and perfected. He resides in the *Upper Honored Palace* within the *Purple Mansion Jade Tower*, bearing the surname *Youkong*, with the taboo name *Mingyang Hui*, styled *Youliao*, wearing a *flying celestial treasure crown* and holding an *imperial decree*. He transforms into a crimson-robed figure holding a *gui* tablet, exhaling five-colored *qi*, or adopts the attire of various state ministers, called the *Pacing the Three Yang Perfected*, titled *Jade Emperor Perfected Prime Dawn Lord*, also known as the *Transforming Numinous Upper August Lady*, residing in the *Transforming Numinous Heaven*.\n\nMoreover, the *Ninth Upper Honored Palace* is the *Empress of the High Thearch Transforming Metal and Stone, Mountains and Rivers, within the Dipper*, titled *Great Unity’s Luminous Purity*, styled *Cloud-Nurtured*. She wears a dark-green brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt, her hair bound in cascading cloud-like tresses. As the Dipper’s *Internal Assistant*, she oversees all affairs, scrutinizing the merits, demerits, blessings, and transgressions of the governing ministers across the ten thousand states and nine provinces. She presides over lamp offerings, prayers for blessings, and the submission of petitions, discerning fortune in brightness and misfortune in obscurity.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace’s Radiant Essence, Opener of Virtue Star Lord*.\nThe *Middle Terrace’s Sixfold Purity, Controller of Emptiness Star Lord*.\nThe *Lower Terrace’s Curved Life, Controller of Prosperity Star Lord*.\n\nThe *Three Terraces* comprise six stars, rising in pairs to form a transverse arc before the second star of the Northern Dipper. The first pair is called the *Pillar of Heaven*, symbolizing the *Three Dukes’* positions. In heaven, they are the *Three Terraces*; in man, the *Three Dukes*. To the west, near the two stars of *Wenchang*, lies the *Upper Terrace*, the *Controller of Destiny*, governing longevity. The next pair is the *Middle Terrace*, the *Controller of the Center*, governing the imperial clan. The eastern pair is the *Lower Terrace*, the *Controller of Records*, governing military affairs.\n\nAlternatively, the *Upper Terrace’s Controller of Destiny* is the *Grand Commandant*; the *Middle Terrace’s Controller of the Center* is the *Minister of Education*; and the *Lower Terrace’s Controller of Records* is the *Minister of Works*.\n\nAnother account states: The upper star of the *Upper Terrace of the Grand Stairway* assists the Son of Heaven, while its lower star represents the Empress. The upper star of the *Middle Terrace* represents the feudal lords, and its lower star the ministers and grandees. The upper star of the *Lower Terrace* represents the scholar-officials, while its lower star governs the common people. Thus, they harmonize *yin* and *yang* and govern the myriad things.\n\nAccording to the *Jade Pivot Scripture*: Should one wish to avert the calamities of the *Three Disasters* and *Nine Accidents*, one must, on a quiet night, bow in reverence toward the *Northern Asterism*. Above the *Northern Asterism* lie the *Three Terraces*, their stars aligned in a formation resembling a pair of eyes stacked in three tiers, overarching the *Dipper’s Bowl*. This is called the *Celestial Stairway*. Whoever beholds it shall be spared the woes of imprisonment in life and the torments of perdition after death. The *Celestial Stairway* is the *Dao* by which the *Most High* ascends and descends.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of Penetrating Mystery and the Dao*, the *Lord Who Governs Generation*.\nThe *Middle Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of Benevolent Transformation, Manifest Virtue, and Extended Blessings*, the *Great Spirit Who Nurtures*.\nThe *Lower Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of the Wondrous Source and Mysterious Existence of the Cavernous Void*, the *Heavenly Elder Who Protects*.\n\n*Radiant Essence*, *Sixfold Purity*, and *Curved Life* are the *Star Lords’* inner taboo names.\n\nThose who know the *Star Lords’* names and sincerely prostrate in reverence shall have all evils dispelled and all virtues perfected. When seated upright in a quiet chamber, one should visualize the *Three Terraces* hovering above the head, then imagine the *qi* from the kidneys ascending from the chest to connect with the *Three Terraces*. After prolonged contemplation, one should tap the teeth thirty-four times, exhale gently through the nose, then close the mouth, fill the breath, and swallow. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Celestial numen, flourishing glory,\nGrant eternal life’s protection.\nGreat Mystery’s Three Terraces,\nGuard this true form.\nThe Five Viscera’s Spirit Lords,\nEach preserve peace and tranquility.\"*\n\nAfterward, tap the teeth again and bow silently before withdrawing. Thus, demonic obstacles shall be forever dispelled, and all affairs shall proceed as desired.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace Star Lord* has a crimson complexion, exhales red *qi*, wears Daoist robes, holds a *green jade gui* tablet, rides a black cloud, and bears a yellow *qi* upon his crown.\nThe *Middle Terrace Star Lord* has a white complexion, exhales white *qi* that fills the heavens, wears Daoist robes, holds a *white jade gui* tablet, rides a white cloud, and bears a white *qi* upon his crown.\nThe *Lower Terrace Star Lord* has a small visage, yet his radiance shines with a thousand beams, his *qi* like threads piercing the darkness. He stands amidst blue-green *qi*, clad in Daoist robes, holding a *blue-green jade gui* tablet.\n\nThe *Three Terraces* receive the *Three Qi of Emptiness*—the true colors of luminous blue-green, yellow, and white—and are the masters of harmonizing *yin* and *yang*, corresponding to man’s *Three Hun*. Without the *hun*, man cannot live; without the *hun*, he cannot be nurtured; without the *hun*, he cannot be protected. Thus, they are called *generation*, *nurturance*, and *protection*. For man, the presence of the *hun* ensures life; life necessitates nurturance; nurturance necessitates protection. If one is born and nurtured but not protected, one shall meet an early demise. The secret of prolonging life lies precisely in these three words. Those who cultivate the truth, having learned that the *Three Hun* generate, nurture, and protect me, should realize that since this body has received life, it must be nurtured; since it can be nurtured, it must be cherished. If one fails to cherish it, disregarding the body and life on forbidden days, the *Three Hun* shall depart, and this body shall perish.\n\nThe names of these *True Lords* are rarely heard. Whoever encounters and recites them possesses profound *Dao*-mind and karmic affinity from past lives, enabling them to hear and uphold these names. Their merit and power are beyond measure. It is said: The grain one eats this year was sown as seedlings last year. The fortune of encountering this scripture today stems from the good causes of past lives in revering the Dipper. Those born in this sagely age who encounter this wondrous scripture, recite the names, and pay homage to the true forms shall accrue merit beyond conception, and their karmic rewards shall likewise be beyond conception.\n\nIf devout men and women of true faith encounter this scripture, their wisdom-nature shall become complete, their *Dao*-mind shall blossom, they shall depart from the paths of the deluded masses, enter the gate of *Xiyi*, return to the true lineage, and attain the glorious realm of life. Those endowed with loyalty, integrity, sincerity, and faith possess a nature of wisdom and luminous clarity. With integrity, they depart from the paths of the deluded; with faith, they enter the gate of *Xiyi*. Having awakened to the true lineage and propagated the great *Dao*, how could they not transcend to the glorious realm of eternal life?\n\nOn the *Three Primes*, the *Eight Festivals*, one’s *Life Destiny Day*, and the days beneath the Northern Dipper, one should meticulously arrange an altar, recite the scripture, perform vegetarian offerings, and follow the rites in conducting the *Dao*. The blessings thus accrued shall be boundless, ensuring that through countless lives, one shall never stray from true nature or fall into heterodox views.\n\nThe *Three Primes* are the days when the *Three Officials* record and present the merits and transgressions of the world to the heavenly courts.\nThe *Eight Festivals* are the *Beginning of Spring*, *Spring Equinox*, *Beginning of Summer*, *Summer Solstice*, *Beginning of Autumn*, *Autumn Equinox*, *Beginning of Winter*, and *Winter Solstice*—these eight days when the *Five Thearchs* descend to record the sins of humanity.\n\nThe year of one’s birth is termed the *Life Destiny*, while the day of one’s birth is called the *Life Destiny Day*—the day when the myriad spirits within the body convene. As for the days beneath the Northern Dipper: in ancient times, Emperor Ming of Han encountered the *Seven Perfected*, who declared, “I dwell in the *Seven Primes Palace*, known as the *Northern Culmen*. I am ever attended by a canopy of blossoms, and the Emperor resides at its center. The stars therein are born of the *Seven Treasures*, radiant with resplendent light, and are called the *Northern Culmen Sovereign Lord*. On the third and twenty-seventh days of each lunar month, I descend to the mortal realm to receive offerings and observe the good and evil of humanity.”\n\nOn such nights, one may set up an altar in the central courtyard, offering refined delicacies, wine, and dried meats, to seek deliverance from calamities, prolong life, augment destiny, and employ methods to dispel malevolent spirits, exorcise ghosts, and extinguish demonic essences. When retiring for the night, first visualize the *Canopy of Nine Stars* above your head, with the Northern Dipper to the left, right, above, and below, and the *Three Terraces* covering the center. In the eastern chamber of your dwelling, envision the *Twenty-Eight Constellations* in the form of infants, clad in brocade skirts and purple silk robes, holding green tablets, their mouths emitting jade-like *qi* that enters your own, transforming into true *qi* that suffuses your entire body. Upon mastering this *Dao*, you become a master who commands spirits, and all demons shall tremble in fear.\n\nThose who follow the *Dao* and learn the true names of the *Perfected Lords* may, on the days of their descent, meticulously arrange an altar, recite scriptures, and perform vegetarian offerings. Those who, life after life, possess deep karmic affinities with the *Dao* and a profound devotion to its heart, and who now diligently follow its rites, shall accumulate boundless merit and power. By not straying from true nature, revering the true lineage, and avoiding heterodox views, they depart from the paths of delusion. This is the *Most High’s* compassion, earnestly and repeatedly imparting teachings to the world, guiding humanity to worship the Dipper and pay homage to the true, to turn from evil and return to rectitude, and to transcend the mundane and ascend to the real.\n\nThose who uphold the scriptures should recite the sacred titles of the *Seven Primes Perfected Lords*. When their virtuous deeds are complete, auspicious blessings shall descend. For those who study the *Dao*, setting up altars to pay homage to the true, reciting scriptures, and invoking the names of the *Perfected*, with long and unwavering practice, their thoughts never straying, and their resolve unshaken, they shall remain ever close to the true essence of the Dipper. Naturally, they shall be moved by sincerity, and the *Perfected* shall bestow upon them blessings of longevity and auspicious fortune.\n\nThe incantation of the Northern Dipper is as follows:\nThe explanation of the Northern Dipper was fully expounded in the preceding chapter. An incantation is a prayer, and also a praise of the sacred virtue of the true Dipper. Those who follow the *Dao* and recite it with utmost reverence, visualizing the forms of the *Seven Primes*, shall find their prayers invariably answered.\n\nThe preceding Sanskrit divine incantations were revealed by the *Most High* to clarify the hidden rhythms of the demon kings of the *Three Realms*, ensuring that those who pay homage to the true shall not be obstructed by demon kings and may ascend to the Dipper’s domain.\n\nThe Sanskrit divine incantation reads:\nOṃ hūḥ □nā xī xī nā, luó lóu nǎ jié dá nǎ, □jié nǎ □□nǎ □□nǎ, oṃ hōng hōng jù zhǐ dì shē sū zhà, ā ruò mì zhà wū dū zhà, jù qí zhà bō lài dì zhà, yē wēi ruò zhà, jù luó dì zhà, qí mó zhà sà pó hē.\n\nThe Nine Celestial Bodies of the Northern Dipper:\nThe Northern Dipper is the primordial spirit of Heaven and Earth, the *Life Destiny* of gods and humans. The number nine represents the *Dao* of *Qian*, the embodiment of *yang*, perpetually generating without cessation. The term *celestial body* denotes the lord of all stars and the convergence of all phenomena. Thus, the Dipper resides in the north, with two stars concealed and seven visible, forming nine positions—corresponding to the nine orifices of the human body.\n\nThe Great Spirit of the Central Heaven:\n*Central* signifies neither high nor low, and also denotes the multitude. *Heaven* refers to the *wuwei* and the *wuji*. *Great* signifies the most revered and exalted. *Spirit* denotes numinosity, luminosity, and uprightness without deviation. It also means *to extend*, rectifying the path between Heaven above and Earth below. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies of the Northern Dipper* reside within the *Central Heaven*, serving as the revered, numinous, luminous, upright, and great true spirits of all celestial phenomena. This mirrors the human heart, which resides at the center, with the *Original Spirit* as the master of the entire body.\n\nAscending to Pay Homage at the Golden Portal:\n*Ascending to pay homage* means to visit and gaze in reverence. The *Golden Portal* is the true realm of the *Jade Thearch*, transformed by the *qi* of the *Three Clarities*. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies* are the confidants of the *Three Clarities* and the *Jade Thearch*. Those who frequently pay homage fulfill the *Dao* of repaying the source. Likewise, if one can elevate the heart’s spirit into the *Mud Pill Palace*, the true numen shall not scatter, and longevity shall be attained.\n\nDescending to Cover Kunlun:\n*Kunlun* is the name of the earth that sustains the world, the transformative *qi* that generates all things. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies* cover it day and night, bestowing the grace of ceaseless generation. Similarly, if one can descend the heart’s fire into the kidney’s water, true merit shall be achieved, and the elixir shall naturally form without delay.\n\nRegulating the Fundamental Principles:\n*Regulating* means to harmonize and also to uphold.\n\n*Principles* means to order and bind. *Fundamentals* are the Five Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. *Disciplines* are the twenty-eight lunar lodges of the celestial circuit.\n\nJust as the *Nine Celestial Bodies* reside in the Central Heaven, their virtue equaling that of the *Three Clarities*, they thus uphold, order, and bind the Five Phases and the twenty-eight lodges, preventing disorder in the warp and weft of the cosmos. Thereby, *Qian* and *Kun* attain their proper positions, the sun and moon follow their courses, and gods and humans alike enjoy peace and ease. Likewise, if one can regulate the Five Viscera and harmonize the Four Great Elements, no illness shall arise, and the true *Dao* shall be attained. As the *Classic of Difficulties* states: *\"The wise regulate and harmonize the Five Viscera.\"*\n\n**Governing Qian and Kun:**\n*Governance* means to unify and also to command. *Control* means to regulate and also to master. *Qian* is Heaven, the Yang *Way*, the spirit *Way*, and the human *Way*. *Kun* is Earth, the Yin *Way*, the ghost *Way*, and the deviant *Way*—for Heaven moves while Earth remains still.\n\nThus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies* can unify and regulate the *Way* of Heaven and Earth, the *qi* of Yin and Yang, the mechanisms of ghosts and spirits, and the arising and ceasing of human deviance. Similarly, if one can gather and refine Water and Fire to nourish the heart and kidneys, the *Way* of prolonging life shall become clear and complete.\n\n**The Great Chief and the Greedy Wolf, the Gigantic Gate and the Store of Emoluments, the Literary Curve and the Incorruptible, the Martial Curve and the Breaker of Armies:**\nThe *Great Chief* is the foremost of the eldest. The *Greedy Wolf*, *Gigantic Gate*, *Store of Emoluments*, *Literary Curve*, *Incorruptible*, *Martial Curve*, and *Breaker of Armies* are the names of the Seven True Lords of the Seven Primes.\n\n**The Supreme Jade Thearch:**\n*Supreme* means that nothing can surpass it.\n\n**Supreme** signifies the most revered and noble. **Jade** is the ultimate treasure, impervious to the ravages of water or fire. **Thearch** is the most exalted title, the sovereign of the Three Realms and the myriad true sages. Thus, the Nine Primes embody the august majesty of the *Supreme Jade Thearch*—this is made clear. Just as one who pays homage to the true and reveres the Dipper, ceaseless in devotion, refines Water and Fire through cultivation, and coalesces spirit and *qi* into the embryonic immortal, may then serve as minister or emissary to the *Supreme Jade Thearch*.\n\n**The Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord:**\nThe *Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord* is the sovereign of the Northern Dipper and the father of all stars. Thus, the Purple Tenuity is invoked as the foremost of the Nine Primes and the Three Terraces. If one can dwell in office without deceit or envy of the law, ever loyal to the sovereign in thought, then Heaven shall naturally align with them, and no calamity shall befall.\n\n**The Great Circumference of Heaven:**\nThe mechanisms of these Seven True Lords’ movement and stillness are truly unfathomable. Each governs the fate of the wise and foolish in the world below according to their original destiny. Vast in scope, they encompass all within the heavens above and the earth below—nothing exists beyond the purview of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes. If one can restrain the Seven Emotions, then myriad virtues shall naturally arise. Should the heart be wholly devoted to the Dao, one may fully traverse the heavens and attain boundless joy and freedom.\n\n**Subtle as Microcosmic Dust:**\nThe divine power of the Seven Lords of the Dipper is unfathomable, their true subtlety beyond scrutiny. Vast, they pervade the heavens above and the earth below; minute, they penetrate the tiniest speck of dust—all can deliver humanity and perfect the true. Let none assume small acts of goodness are beneath them, for even within the hidden and the infinitesimal, the Dipper’s truth discerns all. As the scriptures say: *\"The noble person is vigilant in solitude.\"*\n\n**What Calamity Cannot Be Eradicated? What Blessing Cannot Be Attained?**\nSince the Dipper’s truth encompasses the great circumference of Heaven and penetrates the subtlest dust, evil is inevitably punished, and goodness inevitably rewarded. What calamity, then, cannot be eradicated? Once misfortune is dispelled, blessings shall surely converge. If one can remain steadfast in both seclusion and openness, heart ever reverent to the Dipper and mind ever guarding the spirit, then calamity shall not intrude, and fortune shall come of its own accord.\n\n**The Primordial August Upright *Qi* Comes to Merge with My Body:**\n*Primordial* signifies the great, the foremost of all virtues. *August* denotes reverence. *Upright* means impartial and unbiased. *Qi* is the primordial numen of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous transformation of Yin and Yang. The Nine Primes of the Northern Dipper are formed from the *Primordial August Upright Qi*. If one takes the Dipper as their heart and the Dipper as their spirit, then they shall unite with their original destiny as one, and the *Primordial August Upright Qi* shall come to merge with their body. What worry, then, of failing to attain longevity and enduring vision?\n\n**Where the Celestial Pivot Points, Day and Night Turn Without Cease:**\nThe *Celestial Pivot* is the upright *qi* of Heaven, the origin of the myriad spirits. Without the Celestial Pivot, Heaven and Earth would lack clarity in their upper and lower realms; without it, the true mechanism of the Dipper’s movement could not issue its luminous commands; without it, the myriad spirits could not attain their profound subtlety. Great indeed is the merit of the Celestial Pivot!\n\nThe character *pivot* (罡) is composed of *four* (四) and *upright* (正), signifying the Four Saints governing the four directions: *Heavenly Tenuity* resides in the East, *Heavenly Strategy* in the West, *Assisting Sage* in the South, and *Protecting Sage* in the North. At the center, the *Great Sage* wondrously directs the *Celestial Pivot Thearch Lord*. Thus, the Celestial Pivot guards the center of Heaven, taking generation as its virtue and movement as its merit. It receives the upright *qi* of East, West, South, and North—hence it is called the *Celestial Pivot*.\n\nThe Celestial Pivot guards the center and governs Earth, while the Northern Dipper belongs to Water. Earth restrains Water, enabling the Dipper to generate the myriad things. Yet it does not govern the Dipper alone: each month, the Dipper’s handle points to one direction, and thus the Five Dippers all follow the Celestial Pivot’s influence.\n\nWithin a single day, the Celestial Pivot revolves the Dipper’s handle through each of the twelve double-hours, aligning with one direction at a time, turning ceaselessly without pause—this is the principle of inexhaustible generation. As the *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: *\"The twelve gates of the Thunder Citadel follow wherever the Celestial Pivot points. When the Pivot star points to *Chou*, its body resides in *Wei*. The direction it points is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious.\"*\n\nWhy does this give rise to fortune and misfortune? It lies in the Celestial Pivot’s essence and function, which are none other than the *qi* of Yin and Yang. The upright *qi* of the Celestial Pivot can generate or destroy. Where it points becomes the direction of generation, imbued with vital *qi*. Drawing from it can cure illness, replenish deficiency, pacify the spirit, invigorate *qi*, avert misfortune, dispel calamity, prolong life, and deliver from peril. Where it dwells harbors destructive *qi*, which can be employed to slay ghosts, expel demons, subdue violence, restrain malevolence, and vanquish evil spirits. Thus, what it points to is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious. The virtue of the Celestial Pivot is truly not to be taken lightly, and its merit is truly not insignificant.\n\n**The Vulgar Dweller and the Petty Man Seek the Dao and Yearn for the Numinous:**\n*The Vulgar Dweller* refers to one who resides in the dusty world of the mundane. *The Petty Man* is a term for the most insignificant and lowly. This phrase expresses the humble reverence of those who recite the incantations. If one encounters these scriptural instructions, they must devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao and thereby attain the mysterious numen of their original destiny, prolonging life.\n\n**May I Behold Your August Form and Forever Preserve Longevity:**\nHaving embraced the Dao and obtained its mysterious instructions, one shall naturally behold the true form of the august presence and attain the Way of enduring life and eternal vision.\n\n**The Three Terraces’ Void Essence, the Six Pure Curves’ Generation:**\n**They Give Me Life, Nourish Me, and Guard My Form.**\nThe *Three Terraces* are the great transformations of the Central Heaven and the canopy of the Northern Dipper. The names, titles, and appearances of their true lords have been recorded in the preceding section: one is called *Heavenly Citadel*, one *Heavenly Stair*, and one *Heavenly Minister*. They are the mysterious essence of the Great Void and the true *qi* of the divine person—these Three Terraces correspond to the lung spirit and the central hub of the Three Hun in humans.\n\nIf one can recite this incantation constantly, the Seven Po shall be purified, the Three Hun shall be at peace, and true *qi* shall descend to give life, nourish, and protect, thereby attaining the immortality of the divine transcendent.\n\nIt is further said: The spirit of the *hun* is yang and gives life to my form; the spirit of the *po* is yin and nourishes my essence. When *hun* and *po* do not depart from the body, yin and yang generate and transform its essence, and the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, together with the Most Sagely Three Terraces, along with a thousand truths and ten thousand spirits, shall ever come to guard and protect my form.\n\nIf one practices and upholds this, from whence could calamities arise? Let the scholar not dismiss this Way on account of this humble one’s shallow insight and limited learning, but rather regard it as the true scripture of the Great Dao, that it may benefit posterity.\n\n**[Six characters missing]**\n...the August Emperor. Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThis is the inner taboo name of the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper. When one recites it, one must visualize the august countenance, redouble reverence and obeisance, and silently recite while clicking the teeth—never utter it aloud. For the response of fortune and misfortune is swift: how could one not stand in awe?\n\n\"Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances\" was the closing formula in official documents and dispatches of the Han dynasty, akin to modern bureaucratic decrees stating, \"Upon receipt of this document, comply accordingly.\" As the Celestial Master was a man of the Han, his teachings adopted this usage, and thus it has been transmitted as a tradition.\n\n*Commentary on the Wondrous Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity True Scripture*, Scroll Three, concludes.\n\n**[Annotations from the original text:]**\n1. \"Controller of Governance\" – According to the context below, this should read \"Governor-Controller.\"\n2. \"Not the General\" – According to the context below, this should read \"Supreme General.\"\n3. Based on the preceding and following text, a character \"resides\" appears to be missing here.\n\n*Commentary on the Wondrous Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity True Scripture*, Scroll Four\nCompiled and annotated by Xu Daoling of the Mysterious Yang\nCollated and corrected by Xu Daoxuan of the Vigorous Yang\n\nThe Lord Lao said: All people’s natures, lives, and five constituents are entirely governed by the star-officials of their original destiny. The divine generals of their original destiny and the star-officials of their natal lodge ever bestow their sheltering protection, presiding over human life to ensure the preservation of one’s Heaven-granted years. The star-official of one’s original destiny is, for example, the Star Lord Greedy Wolf for those born in the zi hour. The divine generals of one’s original destiny are, for example, the spirits of the jiazi and bingzi days. The star-officials of one’s natal lodge are, in the yang phase, the Void Lodge, and in the yin phase, the Woman Lodge.\n\nIn the beginning, the Most High commanded that the people of the world know their natures and lives are entirely dependent on the Dao for their arising. Once they have awakened to this cause, they are then to return to the true and cultivate the gate of offering, longevity, and gratitude. This chapter clarifies that the five constituents of a person are entirely governed by the star-officials of their original destiny. The five constituents are the five viscera. If a person’s five viscera are peaceful and harmonious, then the myriad evils will not invade, the hundred diseases will not enter, and they will forever preserve long life. The star-officials of their natal lodge shelter and protect their life. Knowing the body, then, ensures the five constituents are peaceful and harmonious; knowing the Dao ensures long life and enduring vision; harmonizing the nature ensures the heart of the Dao unfolds; and knowing one’s destiny ensures the preservation of one’s Heaven-granted years.\n\nYet the common people, ignorant and unknowing, pass their entire lives without awakening. The true officials of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm six times each year. The day of their descent is the limit-period of one’s original destiny. Three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound, seven thousand divine generals of the Northern Dipper, and the true officials of one’s original destiny, descending with their retinue of perfected beings, all come to surround and protect. Through this, one may eliminate calamities, repent of sins, request blessings, and extend life. According to one’s capacity, one may perform rites and offer libations, thereby increasing and exalting one’s fortune and virtue.\n\nSixty years of a person’s life constitute one great limit-period, encompassing the full span of one’s original destiny—this is the cycle of a lifetime’s renewal of the celestial stems. Sixty days constitute one small limit-period, corresponding to the six descents each year. On those days, the true lords of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm on behalf of those born under their governance, examining and recording the merits and transgressions of each person.\n\nThe messengers of the Southern Mound are the envoys of the Star Lord Breaking Army. Thus, within them, yin and yang intermingle, the Southern Dipper interlocking with the Northern Apex, the Northern Apex concealing the Southern Dipper. The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: “The Northern Dipper brings death; the Southern Dipper brings life.” This distinguishes their respective domains. Thus, in this scripture, the two characters for “Northern Dipper” are used comprehensively.\n\nThe ignorant and unenlightened common folk, indulging in evil deeds and violating prohibitions, cut short their Heaven-granted years. Their limit-periods become brief, and they die prematurely. Those of superior wisdom who cultivate the Dao accumulate merit, spread virtue, refine good deeds, and observe prohibitions, extending their Heaven-granted years. Their limit-periods become distant, their fortune and virtue increase and exalt, and they attain long life and enduring vision.\n\nWhen the limit-period of one’s original destiny approaches and one remains unaware, failing to establish vegetarian feasts or perform rites, neglecting incense and offerings, this is to treat life lightly and be deluded about one’s origin, failing to treasure the human form. The heavenly offices then seize one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to early death.\n\nThose who are deluded and erring, even when they encounter this scripture and its instructions, harbor disbelief and slander the true text. After such people die, they sink into the three wretched destinies, drifting and drowning in the various realms of existence, forever losing the human form. Deeply pitiable, they bring this suffering upon themselves.\n\nHeaven above is pure, Earth below is turbid; creation alternates between one yang and one yin. A day has its day and night; a year has its spring birth, summer growth, autumn harvest, and winter completion. Stars appear and disappear; the moon waxes and wanes. Among the constellations, the Wings and Chariot Lodges comprise twenty-two stars, while the Void and Wall Lodges contain only two. The Well Lodge spans thirty-three degrees, while the Ghost Lodge spans only four. Even the celestial patterns are not uniform. People, endowed by Heaven and Earth, the Dipper stars, yin and yang, and the five phases of creation, are born with differences in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, longevity and early death, wisdom and foolishness.\n\nYet people, failing to awaken to the fact that their allotted portions are already determined, only pursue vain desires and greedy cravings. Within their limited time, they create boundless transgressions. Each time the limit-period of their original destiny arrives, death draws nearer. They do not express gratitude for the virtue of Heaven and Earth in giving them life, nor do they feel indebted to the sheltering protection of the star-perfected. Failing to treasure their own bodies, they treat life lightly and are deluded about their origin, thereby hastening their early death.\n\nThose who are deluded and erring, upon hearing this scripture, become agitated and doubtful, refusing to believe. Even when they see others reciting it, they cannot emulate them but instead slander and malign it. After such people die, they sink into the ghostly realms, suffering bitter retributions. Only after kalpas have passed do they exhaust their punishments in hell, receiving the fruits of their transgressions. The scripture states: Those who see others holding the scripture yet cast sidelong glances, speak evil words, and slander it, or who initially accept it but later treat it with contempt—such karmic retributions are too numerous to enumerate.\n\nHow could those who cultivate the Dao dare to disrespect the words of the sages? To disrespect the scripture invites demonic afflictions; to venerate it welcomes the presence of divine sages. Having contributed no merit to the mysterious teaching, how could one dare to slander its true text? The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: “The heavenly offices record people’s merits and transgressions, not missing even the slightest fraction.” How could one not be cautious? How could one not be vigilant?\n\nIf, on the day of one’s original destiny, one performs vegetarian feasts and rites, thereby communicating with the heavenly offices, and in each lifetime during the limit-period of one’s original destiny, one recites this scripture, widely presenting offerings, then for three lives one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people. The Most High, in his compassion, provisionally establishes teachings, thus revealing the sequential gate of practice, enabling gradual attainment of the realm of flourishing life. Returning to and venerating the true lineage, such are the blessings one receives.\n\nFirst, one is commanded to recite the names, thereby eliminating transgressions. Next, one petitions the Dipper, performing rites of gratitude and reciting the scripture. Only after recognizing the true lord of one’s original destiny does one attain peace and security—this is the goodness of a single lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, reciting the names of the true lords, if one has good karmic affinities from past lives—due to the depth of one’s heart for the Dao in previous existences—this is the goodness of two lives. Now, by performing vegetarian feasts and rites, one communicates with the heavenly offices, ensuring that for three lives one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people—this is the blessing of future lives.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor* states: \"Transforming wisdom and intelligence to turn a woman into a man is among the thirty supreme and wondrous virtues.\" The *Sutra in Forty-Two Chapters* also says: \"To escape the evil destinies and be born as a human is difficult; having been born human, to leave the female form and become male is even more difficult.\" When worldly people cultivate and serve the Dao, attaining in three lives the constant rebirth as a man—intelligent, wealthy, and noble—this is the blessing of a conditioned existence. If one can transcend the realm of conditioned forms, ascend to the land of non-action, enter the gate of the subtle and imperceptible, and realize the Dao of emptiness and nothingness, only then may one become a preeminent man among men.\n\nSome are born with meager karmic fruits; though among humans, they are poor and lowly. Even if they know their original destiny, they lack the means to perform grand rites. Yet if they pour water or offer flowers, silently turn their thoughts toward the North Pole, bow in reverence, and recite the name of their original destiny’s true lord, they will not pass their allotted lifespan in vain. All shall have their lives extended and blessings recorded, remain bound to the human form, have disasters and calamities dispelled, and receive immeasurable fortune. The Heavenly Master rejoices, leaping with joy and bowing in homage, praising the rare encounter with this supreme Dharma bridge.\n\nAs the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one were to fill measureless asaṃkhyeya worlds with the seven treasures and offer them in charity, and if a good man or good woman were to arouse the mind of bodhi, take up this sutra, even a four-line verse, receive, uphold, recite, and expound it for others, the merit of the latter would surpass the former.\" For the seven treasures may be exhausted, but the four-line verse is inexhaustible. If one upholds this sutra and awakens to its meaning with one’s original mind, this surpasses the merit of offering the seven treasures in charity.\n\nThe wealthy may widely establish vegetarian feasts and rites, while the poor may pour water or offer flowers—both acts are of one intent, and their blessings are equal. Those who follow the Dao and perform vegetarian feasts and rites in pursuit of blessings may gain much merit, yet in awakening to the mind and seeing the nature, they gain nothing, only forming the causes of conditioned existence, like one who merely offers the seven treasures in charity. But if one knows the nature and destiny, understands the Dao and the body, and on the day of one’s original destiny, worships the Dipper and pays homage to the true, offering flowers and pouring water—not neglecting the allotted lifespan, nor seeking blessings—then the sagely and true will naturally extend one’s life and record one’s blessings. The merit of non-action surpasses the conditioned blessings of offering the seven treasures.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, moved and overjoyed, dances for joy, praising the encounter with this supreme and great Dharma bridge.\n\nLord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master again, saying: \"The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all belong to the heavenly offices. To repent sins and eliminate calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and service. When encountering the day of one’s original destiny, the life-registering day, the mid-year day, the post-horses, the shedding of the three disasters and nine calamities—these protect one’s present family and ensure their peace and security.\"\n\nThe Most High, in bestowing this teaching, speaks in profound and subtle terms, beyond the world’s comprehension. This scripture, out of compassion for sentient beings, proclaims essential Dharma to deliver the deluded. Its earnest admonitions fully express human sentiment, making it easy to understand and awaken, arousing faith and the mind to return to truth. Those who study the Dao and can cultivate according to this scripture should seek the sagely intent beyond the scripture’s words, thereby ascending to wondrous fruition and entering the lineage of immortals.\n\nFor example, how does one shed the disasters of the original destiny, post-horses, and calamities to protect one’s family and ensure their peace? The original destiny is the spirit of one’s body, and the post-horses are the spirit of one’s intent. The original spirit of a person is externally lodged in the eyes and internally stored in the heart. The eyes externally observe the myriad things, while internally the heart races through the myriad affairs. Where the heart and eyes roam, the spirit also rushes. If one can gather the mind and inwardly illuminate, preventing the \"horses\" from galloping, and preserve the form and spirit, the embryo-breath will naturally stabilize. Then the Three Corpses will leave the body, the Nine Worms will perish, and from where could calamities arise? Thus, one can protect the harmony of the six pulses and the smooth flow of the hundred spirits.\n\nWhenever superior practitioners uphold this true scripture on the day of their original destiny, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Their merit extends to the water and land, benefiting both the living and the dead. Through repentance and reverence, they gradually ascend to wondrous fruition, reestablish mysterious merit, and realize the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. Only then do they attain perfect sagely wisdom, becoming unfathomable in concealment and manifestation, moving freely between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds, ascending through the Golden Gate, uniting with the sagely and true, transcending the Three Realms, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth, with boundless lifespan and joyous freedom.\n\nThe existence of this body depends on the existence of this spirit. When the body is at peace, the spirit is strong; when the spirit is strong, the qi is pure; when the qi is pure, it can unite with the Dao. \"Repentance and reverence\" means repenting sins; \"gradually ascending to wondrous fruition and reestablishing mysterious merit\" means reporting to the original destiny and post-horses to shed calamities, purifying the form and spirit, and naturally extending life. \"Realizing the Dao of emptiness and nothingness\" means taking the supreme and boundless Dao of the Great Void as one’s witness. \"Perfect sagely wisdom\" means the radiance of wisdom is luminous, free from harm by the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. \"Unfathomable in concealment and manifestation\" means that when one ascends to wondrous fruition and realizes the great Dao with perfect wisdom, the myriad spirits protect and escort, the qi coalesces into true mystery, and the spirit achieves the wondrous Dao. Then one enters and exits the Golden Gate, concealed or revealed in ways beyond human comprehension.\n\nAs the *Daoist Canon* states: \"The Golden Gate is not the name of the Golden Towers or Golden Courts. The Golden Towers are the residences of the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor; the Golden Courts are the abodes of the supreme sages and lofty perfected. This Golden Gate lies beneath the Azure Heaven, formed by the condensation and transformation of qi over thirty-nine thousand three hundred and fifty kalpas. When those who initially study and diligently cultivate the Dao reach the end of their heavenly years without entering the cycle of rebirth, they fly up to the Golden Gate, receiving boundless joy and freedom.\"\n\nThis chapter contains the mysterious secrets and wondrous essentials of the scripture. If all like-minded individuals can take the heart of the Emperor Above as their heart and the words of the Dao’s age as their words, they will naturally receive boundless blessings and attain perfection in this very chapter.\n\nShould any man or woman, on their natal day or during sacred fasts, purify body and mind, burn incense, and hold this true scripture, recognizing the Star Lord to whom their natal destiny belongs beneath the Northern Pole, and offer prayers with sincere intent, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions shall dissolve, drawing the attendance of ten thousand sages and a thousand perfected, all coming to guard and protect. Wherever this scripture resides, a thousand perfected pay reverence, and ten thousand sages offer protection. Demons and ghosts vanish in concealment, spirits and numina submit in hiding. All worldly calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly extinguished.\n\nWithin the human body, the three *hun*-souls belong to yang, moving to give life, while the seven *po*-souls belong to yin, still to govern. The *hun* dwell in the body by day, hence called yang, governing movement; the *po* reside in the body by night, hence called yin, governing stillness. On one’s natal day and during sacred fasts, the three *hun* return to the body, restraining and guiding the yin *po*, preventing the encroachment of deviant paths. When the hundred spirits gather in harmony, the *hun* are at peace and the *po* aligned, yin and yang unite, and one avoids suffering and distress, the body radiating light.\n\nIf one purifies body and mind, burns incense, recites the scripture, and invokes the Northern Dipper and the Star Lord to whom their natal destiny belongs, disasters and transgressions shall dissolve, and the Dao shall swiftly be attained. Wherever this scripture resides, a thousand perfected and ten thousand sages, along with the Seven Precept Immortal Officials, respectfully uphold the Heavenly Master’s vow, offering protection. Auspicious mist shall coil around the courtyard, and felicitous clouds shall hover above the eaves—what disaster shall not be extinguished, what blessing shall not be attained?\n\nThis is called *The Northern Dipper’s Natal Destiny Scripture for Prolonging Life: The Direct Essentials*, the direct path of cultivating perfection. All who attain the Dao and roam freely do so through this scripture; all who verify sageliness and achieve perfection do so through this scripture; all who escape the cycle of birth and death do so through this scripture; all who protect men and women do so through this scripture; all who preserve life and prolong years attain freedom through it. It is an eternal treasure for the body, bestowing blessings and longevity. Guard and revere it; do not show it to the unworthy.\n\nThis scripture is vast and boundless, its merits immeasurable. How could ordinary, inferior scholars easily comprehend it? Among all great scriptures, none are as essential as *The Northern Dipper Scripture*. For instance, *The Numinous Treasure* speaks only of delivering people but does not teach how to prolong life and enter the true Dao. This scripture teaches that life depends entirely on the Dao for its existence—it instructs people to cherish their original bodies, to know their natal destiny. Knowing one’s natal destiny, one naturally prolongs life; prolonging life is impossible without the Dao. Once prolonged, one may receive the deliverance of heavenly perfected and earthly sages. Without roots, how can there be fruit? This is the direct path of prolonging life through natal destiny, the mysterious gate of cultivating perfection and entering the Dao.\n\nThus, *The Numinous Treasure* is its function, while *The Northern Dipper Scripture* is its essence. Those who study the Dao should revere and uphold it. The Most High has already transmitted the scripture’s essentials in the preceding chapter, also naming this *The Northern Dipper’s Natal Destiny Scripture for Prolonging Life: The Essentials*. Fearing that those of shallow virtue might treat it lightly and fail to treasure it, He has thus admonished them.\n\nWhen one cultivates the true Dao, verifies sageliness, achieves perfection, and escapes the cycle of birth and death, the preservation of one’s heart and kidneys is complete. With heart and kidneys whole, longevity is attained freely. As for entering the Golden Gate, embracing the treasure of mysterious numina, receiving the joy of roaming freely, obtaining natural blessings, and enjoying boundless life—without the essentials of prolonging life, how could one reach such a realm?\n\nThis scripture is not withheld by the Most High out of stinginess, unwilling to make it universally accessible. If shown to those who disrespect and disbelieve, they will surely treat it with negligence, even slander it, thereby committing the sin of careless disclosure.\n\nAs the Old Lord concluded the scripture’s discourse, dragons and crane-riding celestial immortals arrived to welcome Him back to the Jade Capital. At that time, the Heavenly Master, having received the wondrous Dharma, spoke these words, vowing to propagate it and transmit it to the virtuous. Should any man or woman receive, uphold, read, and recite it, I, along with the Seven Precept Immortal Officials, shall protect them wherever they may be.\n\nThereupon, he bowed again to the Old Lord and offered this eulogy:\n\n*Where the* Northern Dipper Scripture *dwells in a household,*\n*One’s natal destiny summons true numina.*\n\nThe Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, the pivot of the celestial realm, the balance of Heaven and Earth. Without the Dipper, Heaven does not generate; without the Dipper, it does not take form; without the Dipper, it is not bright; without the Dipper, it does not move. The Dipper is the mysterious instrument of measure.\n\nHow can a household be without it? In daily use, nothing is balanced without the Dipper, nothing moves without the Dipper, nothing is bright without the Dipper, nothing is accomplished without the Dipper.\n\nWithin the human body, without the Dipper, one does not live; without the Dipper, one is not nurtured; without the Dipper, one is not protected; without the Dipper, one is not sheltered. Above the human heart are seven apertures, corresponding to the seven stars; below are two orifices, corresponding to the Assistants; and three hairs, corresponding to the Three Terraces. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, and within the human body, it resides in the heart. The heart is the Northern Dipper, and the Northern Dipper is the heart—just as the heart is the Buddha, and the Buddha is the heart.\n\nWhy, then, does the scripture not speak of the heart but instead say, *Where the* Northern Dipper Scripture *dwells in a household*? It is because the Most High, observing that sentient beings had no gate through which to enter the path of cultivating perfection, no sincerity with which to approach the rites of revering the Dipper, took pity and greatly expounded the mysterious numina, transmitting the scripture’s essentials to the Heavenly Master for widespread dissemination. Thus, all in the world might ascend to immortality and avoid the cycle of rebirth.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, Perfected Lord of Serene Response, embodied the sagely intent above and took the benefit of living beings as his heart. Therefore, he borrowed the metaphor of fifteen kinds of worldly benefits to eulogize it. The household is the body, the dwelling of the heart. Just as a household enshrines *The Dipper Scripture*, venerates the true form, and maintains purity and reverence, so too, if one’s heart, in the twelve hours of the day, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, never ceases to contemplate the Northern Dipper, to reverently recite and burn talismans, one will surely feel the true *qi* of one’s natal destiny’s mysterious numina descend upon the body, preserving long life.\n\nThese and the following chapters contain fifteen sacred talismans. After opening the scripture, one should transcribe them according to the method, wear them, or burn them as incense—there will be no lack of spiritual response.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the dwelling attains peace and tranquility.\nThe heart is the abode of spirit; the body is the dwelling of *qi*. If one constantly holds the Northern Dipper within body and heart, one attains purity of body and heart, and externally, the household gains peace and tranquility.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, parents are preserved in long life.\nThe primal destiny of one’s natal stars averts calamities and misfortunes, safeguarding one’s longevity. If one does not neglect cultivation and reverence, one may ensure the long life of one’s parents.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all malevolent influences turn to dust.\nWhen body and heart are pure, thoughts dwell on the true and the mind on the Dao, how could defilements fail to dissolve into dust?\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all deviance naturally returns to rectitude.\nAs the scripture states: *Kan* resides in the lower position, *Li* ranks as the sovereign above. Master and servant each keep to their place—such is the enduring Way.\nThe heart is the sovereign; when the heart is upright, all deviance is rectified.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, one’s enterprises accord with one’s wishes.\nBy revering the Perfected Lord in the morning, the karmic obstructions within the body are dispelled, and one’s endeavors naturally align with one’s intentions.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the entire family enjoys health and well-being.\nWhen all orifices remain sealed and the true *qi* permeates the primal origin, the body naturally thrives in health.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, descendants are preserved in prosperity.\nThe seed of long life must not be severed; one should nurture it to ensure its flourishing.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the five pathways are naturally unimpeded.\nThe five viscera flow freely, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all evils are forever extinguished.\nWhen the true nature is awakened, all transgressions vanish.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the six livestock thrive and multiply.\nWhen the six roots are tranquil, they naturally flourish.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, illnesses are cured.\nWhen spirit and essence are not depleted, all ailments are healed.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, wealth and possessions are not squandered.\nWealth and treasures are the upright *qi* of the body. If not consumed by external deviance, the primal origin remains steadfast.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, misfortunes never arise.\nThe human body is like a sturdy house with firm walls—what harm could sudden storms or raging winds bring?\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, one perpetually preserves *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*.\nBy perpetually safeguarding the mysterious numina, one eternally attains *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: \"Excellent, excellent! You may propagate the true teaching, bringing boundless blessings and benefits to all beings, that they may forever partake in supreme goodness.\"\nThe Heavenly Master bowed his head in reverence, receiving and vowing to practice it.\n\nWhen the Lord Lao had finished expounding the scripture and the Heavenly Master had completed his eulogies, the myriad sages rejoiced in the blessings and benefits, universally bestowed upon all ranks. The heavens celebrated, and the joy of the Dharma’s transformation spread to the ten directions. A path to longevity was opened, and a gateway to the sacred was revealed. The Most High enabled all to escape the cycle of rebirth, while the Heavenly Master disseminated the wondrous Dao through the ages.\n\nNow, Dao-Ling, without presuming upon his learning, has ventured to elucidate the mysterious text—not as fabricated words, but as the true and complete original. Dao-Ling does not seek personal supplication or acclaim; rather, he desires that those who invoke and pray may attain the mysterious efficacy. All fellow aspirants should surely revere and uphold this, thereby attaining long life and peace.\n\n*Commentary on the Most High’s Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Scripture of Natal Destiny for Extending Life, Scroll Four*\n\n**Incantation**\nAn incantation is the meaning of invoking and praying. By aligning the heart with Heaven and uniting spirit with *qi*, form and sound resonate, and the true numina are moved to respond.\n\n*\"Heavenly numina, flourishing in their nodes, may they preserve long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One, guarding its true form.\nThe spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\nHasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\nHeaven is the greatness of non-action; the numinous is that which is universally responsive. \"Heavenly numina\" signifies that humans are the most noble and spiritually endowed. The crown of the head—this single aperture—is where the hundred spirits gather. When the joints flow freely and the true *qi* flourishes, no illnesses arise, and long life may be hoped for.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One is the *qi* of the Northern Dark Palace’s *Kan* abode, the true and unified *qi* of the Great Dao, the child of the Two Luminaries, and the ancestor of all things. As the *Dao De Jing* states: *\"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; humans attain the One and become numinous.\"* This is the mysterious One.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor practiced the Dao of the Three Ones. The Sovereign said: \"If you can know the One, all things are complete.\" The One is the sovereign of the body. By guarding the One, the Supreme One, the Lord Emperor, resides in the courtyard, and the thirty-six thousand spirits all remain present.\n\nThe method of guarding the One: At dusk or night, lie flat on your back, hands resting over the heart, and recite:\n*\"Heavenly numina, flourishing in their nodes, may they preserve long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One, guarding its true form.\nThe spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\nHasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*\nMen should recite it seven times; women, fourteen times. Upon completion, visualize white *qi* the size of a cartwheel surrounding the body, with red *qi* on the outside, then lie down. This brings peace to the five viscera. In minor cases, it extends life and repels evil; in major cases, it leads to immortality and ascension.\n\n*\"The spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\"*\nAccording to the *Scripture of Inner Radiance*:\n*\"The heart’s spirit, Cinnabar Origin, is named Guardian of the Numinous;\nThe lung’s spirit, Radiant Flower, is named Void Completion;\nThe liver’s spirit, Dragon Smoke, is named Containing Brightness;\nThe kidney’s spirit, Mysterious Brightness, is named Jade Infant;\nThe spleen’s spirit, Longevity, is named Soul Court—\nAll revolve the Heavenly Scripture within the heart.\nBy contemplating them day and night, one naturally attains long life.\"*\nThis means that by visualizing the spirits of the five viscera within oneself, each safeguards peace and tranquility.\n\n*\"Hasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\nSwift, swift—this means unceasing haste; *as* means resemblance; *law-decree* refers to the Supreme’s edict that all spirits obey, safeguarding the body’s gods and ensuring peace and tranquility through adherence to the law. Should cultivators of the Dao swiftly follow the Supreme’s decree and practice the Way of the Mysterious Unity of the Celestial Pivot, then the spirit will lift the body, and ascension may be awaited.\n\n**Prayer to the Long-Life and Wisdom Spirits of the Northern Dipper**\nThe Nine Perfected of the Northern Dipper, jade-true and immortal numina:\nGreedy Wolf and Great Gate preserve your servant’s longevity;\nSalary Star and Literary Curved ensure your servant’s wisdom;\nIntegrity Star and Martial Curved guard your servant’s peace;\nBreaking Army and Assisting Ministers shield your servant’s form.\nEver abide in auspiciousness, forever dwell in blessed age.\nInscribe me in the register of life, erase my name from death’s ledger.\nSpirit clear and qi radiant, I penetrate the nine nether realms.\nI command demons and seize ghosts, all malevolent spirits are overthrown.\nThose who study the Dao and cultivate the Real—may their wishes be fulfilled.\nThe Nine August Ones shelter and protect, ascending to the Purple Court.\nYour disciple, [Name], humbly prostrates, unable to contain this longing.\nGazing toward your grace, I am moved to utmost reverence and supplication.\n\n**Hymn of Praise Upon Completing the Divine Prayer**\nGreat is the Northern Culmen, ceaseless in generating beings.\nIts pivot moves, heaven and earth are established.\nThe Supreme imparts teachings, all beings receive planting.\nDisasters are dispelled, calamities resolved—divine sight reaches like lightning.\nHaving fasted and bathed, I now approach the Emperor on High.\nMay I begin and end with constancy, protecting family and state.\nReciting the true scripture, I make this my sole intent.\nThis sutra is rarely encountered—through kalpas numbering in the billions.\nHaving encountered it, one must surely gain merit.\nO numinous and benevolent ones, bear witness to this virtue.\n\n**Litany of Perfect Wishes**\nHaving now recited the scripture in full circle,\nIncense clouds rise in dance through the Three Heavens,\nSincere devotion is proclaimed to the Seven Luminaries.\nGolden Lads convey the message, Jade Maidens transmit sincerity.\nAgain, I extend the rites of ten vows, humbly offering the prayers of one heart.\nI pray that the Heavenly Perfected halt their chariots,\nThe Pivotal Palace pause its turning,\nAnd in mercy, grant my supplications.\n\nFirst, may the imperial realm stand eternal,\nExtending boundless longevity,\nThe Great Dao resplendent, unfolding the blessings of the Seven Primes.\n\nSecond, may the sovereign bestow benevolence and love,\nMinisters fulfill loyalty and integrity,\nThe eight wilds bask in the winds of harmony,\nThe four seas rejoice in governance of peace.\n\nThird, may the seasons be harmonious and harvests abundant,\nCreatures prosper and people dwell in peace,\nFathers and elder brothers show compassion,\nSons and younger brothers practice reverence.\n\nFourth, may the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Six Realms, and Four Births\nAll receive the grace of the Supreme,\nAnd equally attain the joys of humans and heavens.\n\nFifth, may my departed ancestors of seven generations\nAll ascend to realms of bliss,\nAnd my living parents\nTogether enjoy longevity and health.\n\nSixth, may my former teachers, friends, fellow students, and disciples\nBe free from karmic entanglements,\nAnd in their destiny, take steps toward ascension.\n\nSeventh, may I, in cultivating the Real, have a share,\nAdvance in the Dao without demonic obstruction,\nLife after life propagate the winds of virtue and power,\nAnd age after age uphold the teachings of the Mysterious Origin.\n\nEighth, may the spirit-officials attending the scripture\nAnd the immortals guarding the precepts\nBy this merit of oversight and protection\nAll ascend in rank and grade.\n\nNinth, may the Golden Lads bearing incense\nAnd the Jade Maidens conveying words\nCarry this heartfelt devotion\nTo the true offices of speech and tongue.\n\nTenth, may the city gods, earth spirits, and life-mandating deities\nWherever they guard the sacred text\nEver guide and welcome auspicious fortune.\nI, your servant, trembling with awe, prostrate and bow my head again,\nSincerely reciting:\nThe Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,\nThe Seven Primes of Sheltering Protection,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Realms Expounding the Teachings—\nTheir merit is boundless, beyond conception.\n\n*Commentary on the* **True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life**, *Fascicle Five*\nCompiled by Xu Daoling of the Mysterious Yang\nCollated by Xu Daoxuan of the Primordial Yang\n\nTo the August Supreme Jade Emperor of the Golden Towers in the Heavenly Vaults, I, your servant, trembling with awe, prostrate and bow my head, touching the ground in reverence:\n\nI have heard that Heaven suspends the ten thousand images, all governed by the Five Dipper-stars and the Northern Apex; that the teachings of the Three Pure Ones unfold, summoning the thousand numina to audience before the Emperor. The jade pivot is the warp of yin and yang, while the Mysterious Numinous is the root and origin of nature and destiny. The scripture has endured for fifteen hundred years, yet its order has been lost and its sequence confused; the Dao has unfolded through twelve myriad kalpas, concealing its mysteries and hiding its subtleties. Without the golden sound, how could one invoke the golden sound? Without the jade decree, how could one clarify the jade decree?\n\nXu Daoling of the lineage of Xu bears a long-standing karmic affinity, having cultivated the Numinous Treasure across generations. The subtle mechanism admits not even the slightest speck of dust. In the Shu capital, the teachings were expounded, yet the essential oral instructions and secret talismans remained wanting; in the Wu commandery, the scriptures were transmitted, the Dharma-gate opened, and the true path pointed out. Previously, I presented Daoling’s exegesis; today, I humbly receive the Emperor’s proclamation of grace. I beseech that phoenix-script and dragon-writ be bestowed, and that cloud-seals be granted alongside the lunar tablets. May all people recite them, and may they be transmitted through the ages. Overwhelmed with reverence and awe, I gaze toward Heaven and long for the sagely presence with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.\n\n**Mysterious Numinous Talismanic Methods**\nThe talisman is a command and decree, capable of summoning the myriad spirits and averting all misfortunes. For those who recite the scripture and pay homage to the Dipper: purify body and mind through fasting and ablutions, adjust your robes, and sit upright. First, knock the teeth nine times to gather the nine *qi*. Then, visualize the direction pointed by the Celestial Axe, draw in the *qi*, and blow it onto the paper. To avert calamity, use white or black *qi*; to pray for blessings, use red *qi*; to sever ghosts and expel evil, use black *qi*. Once the talisman is inscribed, rise and step into the *ding*-character stance. Stand firm, trace the Dipper’s pattern with your hand, and recite the incantation of the Northern Dipper’s nine stars. Then burn it, maintaining utmost sincerity. Any disrespect will invite unavoidable misfortune. The various true talismans are recorded below.\n\n**Incense Burner-Opening Talisman**\nInscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar. Trace the *qian* trigram.\n*Function of the talisman:* First knock the teeth and concentrate the spirit. Visualize the Eastern Heavenly Gate opening, as the sun at dawn. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, blowing onto the paper. Upon completion, recite the secret incantation:\n*\"Nine Numinous, Nine Numinous, unite with my true form. Water and fire attain their positions, inner and outer become luminously clear.

Moved by compassion for the sentient beings of the vast earth who, deluded and bewildered, sink into the sea of suffering without self-awareness, forever bound in the cycle of rebirth, he thus lowered this peerless Dharma-bridge to deliver both the living and the dead. No being is untouched by its grace, and his ceaseless, life-nurturing heart—how could the sacred virtue and mysterious merit of such a one be easily described?\n\nIn my youth, I, Daoling, resolved to devote myself to this scripture. Whenever I heard a virtuous word or witnessed a virtuous deed, I inscribed it upon bamboo slips. I gathered the explications and profound elucidations of former worthies and sages, never setting them aside, studying them day by day and month by month with unwavering devotion. Only then did I realize that our Supreme Lord’s transmission of this scripture and these oral instructions to the world was no empty gesture.\n\nReverently, the Nine August Celestial Worthies of the Northern Dipper serve as the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the molders of all beings. They govern destiny and decree life and death, revolve yin and yang, establish the seasons, divide day and night, institute cold and heat, distinguish noble and base, transform the wise and the foolish, preside over fortune and misfortune, uphold the cosmic order, open the gates of release and gratitude, and point the way to cultivation and longevity. From emperors above to commoners below, all are subject to the dominion of the Seven Stars and the nurturing of the Three Terraces.\n\nSome claim this scripture’s language is shallow and its meaning flawed, unaware that the Supreme Lord intentionally framed it in the terms of daily practice, naming the Dao to awaken the ignorant and guide them wholly toward the true path. Those of superior wisdom, when they practice it in accord with their station, will naturally attain longevity—what doubt remains?\n\nDuring my official posting in Wu, I was fortunate to complete my term. In moments of leisure, I purified my thoughts and composed my mind, trimming excess and filling gaps, distinguishing meanings and arranging chapters, to slightly clarify the residual intent of the Supreme Lord’s transmission. I dared not presume to be a master of exegesis, yet when I took up my brush to face the text, it seemed as though spirits aided me, and within a month, the compilation was complete.\n\nAlas! The Dao is not distant from humanity—it is humanity that magnifies the Dao. Is this not what is meant?\n\nMy crude words and humble phrases are unworthy to proclaim even a ten-thousandth of the sagely transformation. Thus, I have respectfully drawn upon the teachings of former worthies to provide this commentary. Where it fails to align with the scripture’s purport or loses the thread of its principles, I have verified and explicated it through the Dao of daily practice as it applies to the self: when a dwelling attains peace, I annotate it as \"cultivating the body and rectifying the mind\"; when the six livestock flourish, I annotate it as \"repelling the six thieves and purifying the six senses.\" In this way, I have not strayed from the essential facts of original destiny or the key instructions for prolonging life.\n\nThe Dao may be named, and a name may be spoken of the Dao—like needle and magnet drawing together. Now that the commentary is fortunately complete and ready for carving, it must be that the sagely and true have examined and approved it. Though its literary refinement and breadth of insight may be lacking, I dared not seek out the bizarre or hunt for the extraordinary to dazzle the eyes and ears of the lofty.\n\nWith foolish sincerity, I dedicate the power of this scripture to the sacred dynasty, praying that one person’s felicity may bring boundless longevity to the realm. May the palace chambers enjoy a thousand autumns of blessing, and may the ministers and officials emulate the transformative influence of the Three Terraces. Below, I hope for abundant harvests year after year, for the people and all beings to dwell in peace and prosperity, for the deluded to ascend to the azure heavens, and for all to rejoice in the mysterious and numinous Dao. Let all fellow cultivators not dismiss these words because of the speaker but instead hold life as paramount.\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the ninth day of the ninth month in the second year of *Yuantong*, by Xu Daoling, the *Xuan Yang* Master, after bathing and burning incense, with reverent bows.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny and Life-Prolonging True Scripture with Commentary**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny and Life-Prolonging True Scripture with Commentary*. Composed by Xu Daoling of the Yuan dynasty, completed in the second year of the Zhitong era (1334). This work elucidates the scripture through inner alchemical practices of fasting and purification, structured into five fascicles. **Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings of the Divine Empyrean Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n\n### **Preface to the Northern Dipper Scripture**\nThe preface, comprising a single chapter, was authored by the Divine Lord of Zitong. Its text exhaustively expounds the profound mysteries of the Northern Dipper’s celestial wonders. All fellow aspirants who wish to recite *The Northern Dipper Scripture* must first recite this preface to grasp the scripture’s entirety—it must not be neglected.\n\nThe *Preface to the Northern Dipper* serves to title the scripture of the Northern Dipper, encapsulating the essence of the true and mysterious, and the foremost of its esoteric methods. **North** signifies position; **Dipper** is the revered honor of all phenomena. This scripture is the transformation of the Northern Dipper itself, and thus the Supreme Lord (Taishang) bestowed upon it the name *Northern Dipper*. Though calamities each bear their own names, the Northern Dipper is the Great Sage, abiding at the center of heaven and governing the Three Realms. Day and night, it revolves without rest, regulating life and death—hence, it is called *mysterious*.\n\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, yet it is the handle that serves the Dipper’s purpose, for the handle is commanded by the stars of the *Gang* (Big Dipper’s bowl). The Dipper itself is the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin. Some say the Northern Dipper is the image of the North Pole and North Star, thus it leans upon *Kan* (the Water trigram), moving and resting in its course, spanning the center. The Three Terraces (stars) cover and nurture all, enabling the Northern Dipper to fulfill its Dao. Born with original numinosity, its virtue is immeasurable. As the compassionate mother of the ten thousand phenomena and the teachings of the Three Pure Ones, it is entrusted to the Purple Radiance Consort, who embodies the Way of yin and yang, harmonizes the Five Phases, and excels in prolonging life—the origin of eternal longevity.\n\nWhen demonic paths ran rampant and heretical forces vied for dominance, encroaching upon the true and wondrous, who could devise a strategy to uphold the supreme Dharma? The great and mysterious model of governance was on the verge of collapse. Then, Lord Lao (Laozi) arose suddenly, descending to Shu (Sichuan) to deliver sentient beings and proclaim the true and wondrous. The Way is not singular: the Northern Dipper’s original destiny, its prayers for disaster or fortune, and its methods for nurturing life—all are subtly revealed, with nothing left unrecorded.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month, earth deities gathered at the Jade Bureau, and the perfected sages of the great cosmic era arrayed themselves in ranks to attend. Moved to relieve the suffering of the people, the Heavenly Master (Zhang Daoling) aligned with the Supreme Lord’s intent and stepped forward to inquire about the affairs of the Mysterious and Numinous. The Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, approved his request.\n\nThe Northern Dipper, unknown to the world, governs the celestial pivot’s records, regulates the earth’s axis in motion and stillness, establishes the year’s revolutions, and fans the harmonious spring breeze. It completes the seasons, culminating in the harsh winter of the three *La* festivals. Since the world’s inception, it has been without end. Thus, it imparts the words of the Dao to deliver later generations.\n\nThe Supreme Lord declared: “If I entrust these words to speech alone, it would not be as profound and luminous as inscribing them in true esoteric instructions.” Thereupon, the Perfected of the Dipper assembled, along with the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling and his foremost disciples, to resolve doubts and answer questions. They then composed the discourse on original destiny, compiling it into a single fascicle—a scripture that encompasses heaven and earth, measures the myriad kinds, and embraces benevolence, righteousness, morality, nature, life, misfortune, and fortune. Nothing is left unaddressed.\n\nIf emperors, kings, dukes, and marquises adhere to it, they may attain longevity and align with the celestial Dao. If ministers, scholars, and gentlemen uphold it, they may honor their sovereign and father while preserving their own lives. If aspirants and the wise practice it, they may achieve immortality and ride the flying clouds. For those with karmic affinity who cultivate the Dao, it rectifies the dual *qi*. Truly, it is mysterious and numinous, prolonging life—the great and wondrous work of the Supreme Sage of the world.\n\nAfter the Supreme Lord propagated the teachings in Shu, the orthodox Dao and its esoteric instructions each found their proper place. The scripture was divided into chapters with esoteric methods, enabling the dissolution of calamities and the attainment of prolonged life. The Northern Dipper subsequently radiated its light, embodying the Dao of the Three Pure Ones in its composition. This is the true, constant, tranquil, and luminous reality. Though a thousand centuries have passed, the Supreme Lord’s words have been transmitted as *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure). *Lingbao* is the grand assembly of the myriad Perfected and the guiding principle of the Six Directions. The *Northern Dipper Scripture* is its image and likeness.\n\nThe Han Heavenly Master received the Dipper from Lord Lao, who bestowed upon him the wondrous practices of original destiny and inquired about the Great Dao. The Primordial Beginning (Yuanshi) responded with the *Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity*. Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Dipper on Mount Zhongnan, where the Dipper Perfected personally transmitted the Mysterious and Numinous. Emperor Taizong of Tang received the Dao at Yangjiao, and the Primordial Beginning said: “You are the Son of Heaven—how could you not practice the Dao?” Such instances of shared intent are numerous.\n\nMoreover, the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (Daodejing), with its thousand words, contains profound mysteries. Thus, the *Dipper Scripture* serves as a direct path. Its text, though not as vast and profound as the *Lingbao* scriptures, is not dissimilar in essence. Therefore, later generations have imitated and misrepresented the Northern Dipper’s original truth.\n\nIf the Northern Dipper were not numinous, the Great Dao would be obstructed, its wondrous methods unheard, and the true path lost in confusion. Yet, the scripture’s title as *Original Destiny* has fortunately preserved it from extinction. The sagely court seeks worthies and honors scholars, promoting the flourishing of morality. Thus, the pure *qi* coalesces, and practitioners of refinement clarify the Dharma, annotate scriptures, transmit esoteric instructions, and deliver others—all in accordance with their kind.\n\nThere was an ancient scholar from Zhe who, though versed in the five punishments, was willing to engage with the meaning of this scripture. He specifically arranged the luminous affairs of the Northern Dipper into a commentary, excelling in analogies and explanations. His intent was not distant, yet his Dao was uniquely profound. He said: “Those who expound the *Book of Songs* do not let words harm the phrases, nor phrases harm the intent. To grasp the intent by aligning with it—this is the proper way.” This scripture aims to enable later generations to directly perceive its wonders. Thus, he elucidated its text not merely for his own sake.\n\nFormer worthies who have commented on it often gathered fragments to expound their views. Their interpretations are numerous, and the sages of each era differ. Since the time of Shu, over a thousand years have passed, and its transmission has been widespread.",

      "translated_text": "The Daoist adept Xu Qing, whose age is marked by the Dao and whose nature is perfectly true without pretense, has been thus from his origins. Serving his father, Su’an, he revered the Dao and studied the Confucian classics. In his youth, he inherited a resolve for the scriptures, selecting the finest and gathering the essentials from several schools. For over a decade, he soared within the ranks of officialdom, his heart set on contributing to the greater good—how diligently he toiled! Fortunate to lay down his burdens and rest beneath the eaves of Wu and Yue, he immersed himself in revisiting the old to grasp the new, exhausting his humble insights to fulfill his aspirations and realize his ambitions. Thus, he elucidated the profound and illuminated the mysterious, hoping to offer even the slightest contribution.\n\nI oversee the Star of Literary Prosperity, where the wise and the numinous gather, and nothing remains unknown. Through the ages, its transmission in brush and ink has endured, yet only the *Northern Dipper’s Oral Instructions* has remained luminous in its teachings to this day. Those scholars who later expounded and elucidated it have done so with meticulous care. Xu Qing, cherishing the vast and subtle wonders of the Northern Dipper, opened its recitation and beheld its clarity. He further inscribed the rites of morning devotion, and thus, drawing from what he had heard and verifying it against the classics and traditions, he embroidered it upon sacred talismans, recording it fully in the original scripture. Dividing its chapters by theme and separating them into upper and lower sections, he delineated twenty-four calamities in total. Yet, in essence, none transcend the bounds of one’s own destiny. This he did to enlighten later generations, enabling them to dispel doubts and shatter delusions. I, too, have scrutinized each character to discern its correctness. Those who follow this path and devote themselves to cultivation shall all attain longevity, fulfilling the earnest intent of Xu Qing of the Mysterious Yang, and together ascend to the supreme realm of carefree wandering—is this not most fitting?\n\n---\n\n**Recitation of the *Northern Dipper Scripture and Oral Instructions***\n\nWhen reciting the scripture or performing morning rites, first compose the spirit, click the teeth, sit upright, and regulate the breath. With eyes closed, silently visualize the Nine Palaces and Nine Stars within the Mud-Pill Palace, each occupying a palace, with seven seated in the likeness of their true forms, and two in the attire of assisting attendants.\n\nThen, visualize the radiant light of the Northern Dipper in the heavens, resplendent as if seen. Press the tongue against the upper palate to form a golden bridge, from which the five viscera emit five strands of five-colored *qi*, ascending the bridge and spanning the Dipper. Call upon the Four Upright Messengers to traverse the bridge into the Dipper and convey the matter at hand. Next, behold the two messengers, Ji Yang and Tuoluo, appearing like jade maidens in azure robes, bearing swords—one holding a mandala flower, the other a willow branch. They descend from the Dipper along the bridge into the Nine Palaces within one’s body, then emerge from a chamber to conduct their inspection. Once complete, they return to the Dipper. After a while, observe the Nine Sovereigns of the Dipper, clad in the same attire as the nine within one’s own form, descending upon clouds and *qi* along the bridge into the chamber of the Mud-Pill Palace, where they sit facing you. In an instant, they merge into nine, and in the depths of obscurity, coalesce into one. From the Mud-Pill Palace, they descend upon clouds into the Yellow Court. This done, sit upright and begin the recitation.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mouth**\nThe gates of ingress and egress,\nAbove and below, are guarded by spirits.\nThe portals of fortune and misfortune,\nEver abide in the flow of *qi* and essence.\nThis day, as I perform my morning rites,\nI hold a single thought to preserve the true.\nGathering the myriad sages,\nI knock, and they surely hear.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Most High!*\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mind**\nHeavenly Mystery, Heavenly Mystery,\nTrue Unity, spontaneous and natural.\nBanish the perverse, return to the correct,\nFocus the thoughts, still the mind.\nMaster of this body,\nForemost of the myriad methods.\nWhen still, unfathomable;\nWhen moving, ineffable.\nNow, with inner and outer calm,\nI draw near to bow before the Emperor.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Highest Prime!*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, if heaven remains unmoving, how can it eternally cover? If the Dipper remains unmoving, how can it perpetually revolve? If people do not seek extension, how can they attain long life?\n\nThe *True* signifies the meaning of the wondrously true—profound and unfathomable. The *Classic* is a warp, for if its transmission endures long yet becomes corrupted, it is as though the weft is woven awry, its threads disordered, and flaws arise. Moreover, the *Classic* is a path: if the path is not straight and clear, those who enter the Dao and cultivate the true will lose their way. Furthermore, the *Classic* is a network: if one’s meridians and collaterals lose their proper measure, illness arises; if the Classic is not luminous, the true and mysterious cannot be attained.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao—*that time* refers to when the Most High expounded the Classic. Lord Lao is the origin of heaven and earth, the progenitor of creation. Across the ages, he manifests without fixed birth, yet when he wished to harmonize with the world and establish teachings, he first commanded the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, who was the daughter of Tian Shui Magistrate Yin, named Yi Shou. She married the immortal Li Lingfei, a descendant of Bi Gaoyao. Inspired by his father Li Qingbin’s ascension in broad daylight, Lingfei cultivated the great Dao for over a hundred years. Before Lord Lao’s birth, he ascended to heaven in the seventeenth year of King Yang Jia’s reign during the Yin dynasty, the *gengshen* year. Thereafter, Lingfei conceived a child, refining the true for eighty-one years, until the ninth year of King Wu Ding’s reign, the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of *mao*, when he was born in Bo. The former residence in the Grand Clarity Palace remains to this day.\n\nDuring King Wu of Zhou’s reign, he served as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. In the *guichou* year of King Zhao’s reign, he passed through the Hangu Pass and transmitted the *Five Thousand Words of the True and the Virtue* to the Perfected Yin Xi, totaling two hundred seventy-four years. On the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month in the *jiayin* year, Lord Lao ascended to heaven in broad daylight. He later met the Perfected Yin Xi again beyond a thousand days at the Green Ram Market in Shu. In the *dingsi* year, he encountered Lord Lao once more in Shu, then followed the immortal chariot to traverse the Nine Heavens, teaching in accordance with the times. Confucius took him as his teacher. By the time of King Nan, nine hundred ninety-six years had passed.\n\nEmperor Ming of Wei praised: *\"As the Archivist of Zhou, he endured nine hundred years.\"*\nWu Yanghao, Academician of the Tang Imperial Academy, praised: *\"Lord Lao’s transformations are unfathomable, his numinous responses beyond measure. Born in the Shang, he served in the Zhou, spanning a thousand years from beginning to end.\"*\n\nLater, he descended to Chengdu and transmitted these scriptural instructions in the first year of Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* reign, the *yiwei* year, on the seventh day of the first month. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, he expounded the Classic of Benevolence and Love at Yangjiao Mountain. In the *Zhenghe* era of the Song dynasty, he descended to the Jade Dawn Abbey on Mount Mao and transmitted the *Extended Verses of the Heavenly Youth’s Life-Protecting Classic* to Liang Guangying. Since then, the numinous proofs have been too numerous to recount.\n\nWhen Lord Lao was born, nine dragons spouted water, transforming into nine wells to bathe his form. Born with hoary hair and beard, he bore seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. His steps were like lotus blossoms, and at the age of nine, he pointed to heaven with his left hand and to earth with his right, saying: *\"Above heaven and below heaven, I alone am revered. I shall propagate the supreme Dao and its laws, universally bestowing them upon all beings.\"* At that time, celestial robes draped his body, and in nine days, he grew to nine feet in height. The heavenly spirits acclaimed him with ten titles: Most High Lord, Perfect Spirit and Wisdom, Heavenly Honored One, Teacher of Emperors, Great Man, Great Immortal Honored One, Father of Heaven and Humanity, Supreme Person of Non-Action, Greatly Compassionate One, and Primordial Heavenly Honored One. Here, we briefly recount the Most High’s titles for those of like mind to take refuge in, each attaining blessed reward.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou*, the Most High, pitying sentient beings, repeatedly descended to Chengdu and transmitted to the Heavenly Master, the Perfected Lord of Serene Response, the *Scriptural Instructions for Life-Prolonging*, the *Numinous Writ of the Five Dippers’ Talismanic Correspondences*, and the names of the Five Dipper Perfected Lords. On the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou*, he transmitted the *True Classic of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Destiny*. On the fifteenth day, he transmitted the *Wondrous Classic of the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices for Extending Life and Delivering Humanity*, along with the *Wondrous Daoist Classic of the Five Dippers*. By the seventh day of the first month in the second year of *Yongshou*, he expounded the *True Classic of the Eastern Dipper’s Long Life and Life-Protecting*. On the fifteenth day, he further expounded the *Western Dipper’s Great Plan Classic for Protecting the Body*. Seeing that the Heavenly Master and Perfected were able to cultivate and uphold these teachings, Lord Lao once more manifested his complete form within the Pure Void, ascending the Jade Bureau Seat to proclaim the *Mysterious Wondrous Classic of the Central Dipper for Protecting Life and Extending Life*.\n\nFirst the Northern Dipper, then the Southern, followed by the Eastern and then the Western—this is because the Northern Dipper resides in the *Kan* palace, governing the source of water. Water belongs to the north, and the north is heaven; heaven’s first emanation generates water, thus this Classic was first transmitted. The Southern Dipper resides in the *Li* palace, governing the fire emperor. Fire belongs to the south, and the south is earth; earth’s second emanation generates fire, thus the *True Classic of the Southern Dipper* was transmitted second. The scriptures of the Eastern Dipper, Western Dipper, and Central Dipper follow the sequence of creation, hence their timing.\n\nIn the Grand Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate Palace on the Grand Clarity’s border—\nThe Classic states: *\"The Primordial Supreme Great Canopy Heaven, the realm of the Three Clarities.\"* The Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm comprises twelve sacred heavens, governed by the Primordial Heavenly Honored One. Below the Jade Clarity lies the Upper Clarity’s Perfected Realm, comprising twelve perfected heavens, governed by the Jade Emperor Dao Lord. Below the Upper Clarity lies the Grand Clarity’s Immortal Realm, comprising twelve immortal heavens, governed by the Most High Lord Lao. In the human body, the upper cinnabar field’s Mud Pill Palace corresponds to the Jade Clarity Palace above; the middle cinnabar field’s Crimson Palace corresponds to the Upper Clarity Palace above; and the lower cinnabar field’s Meeting Palace corresponds to the Supreme Ultimate Palace above. The palace governed by the Most High Lord Lao in the Grand Clarity’s border is named the Three Sovereigns’ Grotto-Spirit Grand Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Beholding the myriad beings adrift for kalpas uncounted, endlessly revolving through birth and death, the Most High responds and transforms, pervading all under heaven. Wherever his emanations manifest, there is the Grand Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Most High ever observes beings with a heart of compassion. All sounds ultimately return to the center—heaven above, earth below, and humans in between—these are the people born in the central land of the middle realm.\n\nThe word \"亿\" (hundred million) may also be pronounced as \"yì\" (in the departing tone), signifying abundance, with the character bearing two interpretations. A kalpa is a \"knot,\" or else it denotes \"time.\" In a single human lifetime, one must undergo three thousand six hundred kalpas of worldly toil, for this is the predetermined tally of karmic knots. Yet when people recklessly abandon the Dao, indulging in lust and slaughter, they cut short their lives, failing to fulfill their allotted years. Unable to complete the cycle of birth and death, the knots of past lives remain unresolved, and new knots of worldly dust accumulate, piling up into billions upon billions, never to be untied. Truly, performing good deeds knots good affinities, while committing evil knots one to the demonic path. If evil knots multiply, one drifts in the bitter sea, drowning in the cycle of birth and death without respite, forever becoming a lowly ghost.\n\nIf a person performs one good deed each day, accumulates one meritorious act, or saves a single life, they untie three knots of worldly dust, thereby passing through three kalpas. Should one perform a good deed daily, they would resolve three hundred sixty knots in a year. Further, if they save lives, aid others, benefit creatures, and diligently cultivate the Great Dao, awakening their nature to return to the real, then billions upon billions of knots of worldly toil would vanish in an instant—like a hundred-year-darkened chamber illuminated by a single lamp of wisdom. In Sanskrit, *kalpa* is rendered as *kalpa*, meaning \"time.\" Whether long or short, brief or extended, it is collectively termed a kalpa, or else a fleeting moment. As the *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"In kalpas past, when did the Heavenly Honored One ever enter a kalpa?\" This refers to the arising of the thought to aid others at that very moment.\n\nMoreover, a kalpa signifies \"rest\" or \"hibernation,\" as with creatures like tortoises, dragons, insects, and snakes, which conceal themselves when thunder withdraws its sound and emerge when thunder roars—this is the name for one kalpa. Even cattle, horses, sheep, dogs, chickens, pigs, and other livestock each have their own kalpas, though they only endure suffering. Thus, the sages established teachings for the body, with the three karmas placing the precept against killing foremost. As *Mencius* says: \"Seeing them alive, one cannot bear to see them die; hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh.\"\n\nWithin the Three Realms, kalpas also exist. Yang qi knots to form heaven and man; yin qi knots to form earth and woman. When good men take wicked wives or sages beget unworthy offspring, these are knots of affliction. When good men encounter bandits or virtuous people suffer harm, these are knots of birth and death. For those who enter the Dao, if they take the words of the Dao as their heart and moment by moment untie these knots with good deeds and expedient means, such knots will not arise. The Buddhist scriptures say: \"Untie the knots of a hundred lifetimes’ enmity.\" If left unresolved, one will meet again life after life—how can one not strive for this?\n\nSome dwell in the human realm, born in the Central Lands, or among the Yi and Di barbarians, or within the Man and Rong tribes—some rich, some noble, some lowly, some poor. The Central Lands refer to China: to the southeast lies Yangzhou, due south Jingzhou, south of the Yellow River Yuzhou, due east Qingzhou, east of the Yellow River Yanzhou, due west Yongzhou, northeast Youzhou, within the Yellow River’s bend Jizhou, and due north Bingzhou—these are the Nine Provinces of China as divided in the *Tribute of Yu*. Beyond the Nine Provinces, to the east are the Yi, to the west the Rong, to the south the Man, and to the north the Di.\n\nThe scriptures state: Those who possess the Five Constants and Ten Goodnesses, who practice filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and goodness, are reborn in the human realm within the Central Lands. The rich and noble arise from offering alms to the Three Treasures, relieving the poor and distressed, and rescuing those in peril. The poor and lowly arise from stinginess, greed, and seizing unjust wealth. Those born among border barbarians or in lowly circumstances arise from killing, sexual misconduct, and disbelief in causality. Thus, the Most High’s heavenly eye observes the sins and blessings of beings, who receive retribution according to their karma. Temporarily bound by causal conditions, they fall into hell.\n\nBorn into the world amid wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, if one does not abide therein by the Dao—if the rich are unrighteous, unkind, uncompassionate, and ungenerous; if the noble are unjust, lawless, disloyal, and cowardly; if the poor are discontent and the lowly insubordinate—then the myriad affairs and principles become inverted and chaotic, leading to calamity, harm, misfortune, and disaster, plunging one into affliction. As a verse in the Buddhist canon states: \"By the power of merit, one now enjoys much good fortune; yet with much good fortune comes indulgence. Indulgence ultimately lacks the mind to uphold precepts, and by this cause and condition, one enters hell.\" This is precisely the meaning.\n\nFor there is no constancy—constancy is the essential path to entering the Dao and the swiftest route to prolonging life. Constancy means correctness: if the body is not correct, how can one enter the Dao? If the heart is not correct, how can one prolong life? The meaning of \"prolong\" (*yan*) also derives from correctness. Furthermore, constancy means stillness, orientation, cessation, and sequence. When water is still, it does not flow; when earth is firm, it does not sink. When the heart is constant, the myriad thoughts cease; when the body is constant, the myriad affairs halt. When the nature is constant, qi becomes numinous; when the spirit is constant, qi becomes pure. Yet constancy cannot be achieved without stillness. Most people lack the power of stillness, orientation, cessation, and sequence, so they cannot fulfill righteousness or attain the Dao, nor can they cultivate the real and reach the true. Thus, their hearts are ever inconstant, and their karma follows them—how then can they prolong life and illuminate the original destiny of the mysterious and numinous?",

      "translated_text": "The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"To know cessation is to attain great stability and peace.\" The *Great Learning* says: \"Knowing cessation, one then has stability.\" This \"knowing cessation\" means recognizing this principle, and one must truly attain such knowledge to be so. For example, knowing that as a child one must be filial, or as a subject one must be loyal—when one personally embodies the Way of loyalty and filial piety, perceiving that this is how things ought to be, then one’s aspirations have a fixed direction, and the heart has cessation and sequence. Such is a person of great power, as *Mencius* says: \"Wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot sway, might and force cannot bend.\" If the heart is unstable, when serving parents, one may be drowned by private desires and fail to fulfill filial piety; when serving one’s lord, one may be drowned by profit and emolument and fail to fulfill loyalty.\n\nToday, some neglect filial piety toward their parents, officials act unlawfully, the wealthy and noble seek fame, those with children remarry—all because they do not know cessation, do not accept their lot, do not maintain stillness, and do not follow sequence. Their hearts lack stability, and thus calamity inevitably befalls them. If one can know cessation, accept one’s lot, maintain stillness, and follow sequence in stability, then without seeking life, one naturally attains longevity; before entering the Dao, one has already reached the Dao. How could calamity touch them?\n\nThose of superior wisdom, if they cultivate the work of stillness and stability, with the heart ceaselessly ceasing, will succeed over time. In small measure, they extend their lifespan and enter the ranks of immortals; in great measure, they ascend to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and the Three Pure Ones. Yet those entangled by karmic transgressions, their souls bound by the courts of the unseen, suffer until their retribution is complete. When their time in the human realm is exhausted, they are reborn among beasts or birds, deviating from the human Way and struggling to regain human form.\n\nThe Daoist and Buddhist teachings both proscribe the ten evil deeds: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, greed, anger, ignorance, false speech, frivolous speech, harsh speech, and divisive speech—all to instruct people in goodness. These ten evils—deceit, theft, fraud—are strictly forbidden by law. Should one commit them, they face cangues, imprisonment, fetters, flogging, mutilation, exile, and shackles. How is this different from being a beast?\n\nThis chapter speaks of those whose past lives accumulated evil karma, filling the records of the Dipper Mansion and the Three Officials. Their souls are bound in the underworld prisons, interrogated and punished until their retribution is complete. Having been reborn, they commit further evils, thus deviating from the human Way. In their next lives, they will be born among beasts or birds, deviating from the human Way and struggling to regain human form. Sinking thus into delusion, they remain unaware, for their past lives’ ignorance of the true has led them into this cycle of rebirth.\n\n\"Awareness\" means awakening; \"true\" means uprightness, directness, transformation, sageliness, numinous penetration, and wondrous clarity. Without the true, heaven cannot bring spring to the myriad things; without the true, earth cannot root the grasses and trees; without the true, humans cannot command the spirits. Those who attain the true will not drown in water nor burn in fire; they transcend the Three Realms, transform the Ten Directions, command the myriad spirits, and merge with the primal qi. Without the true, how could this be achieved? Without the true, how could this be accomplished?\n\nThus, the Northern Dipper is called the True Lord, the Dark Emperor is called the True Warrior, and all who attain the Dao are called True Persons. Our Master Confucius’ discourse on luminous virtue—without the true, how could one know cessation, stability, and stillness? The word \"true\" is not easily spoken.\n\nThe Most High, pitying those born in the Central Lands or among barbarians, in wealth or poverty, who receive their heavenly mandate and yet, due to the lack of stability in their hearts, accumulate sins and deviate from the human Way—this chapter urges all beings to awaken and cultivate the true. Those who remain unaware do so because they are deluded by the true Way and do not enter the lineage of immortals. Thus, they do not understand the mandate of their destiny.\n\nDestiny is a fixed decree. For example, heaven bestows wealth or poverty, and if one abides in the Way, one accepts it as the heavenly mandate, rejoicing in heaven’s will. If one receives a lot that does not align with their destiny, this is delusion from the true and deviation from the mandate. Having deviated from the mandate and deluded the true, one sinks into delusion without awareness. All who uphold the true and hold to the scriptural instructions must, in the realm of awareness, seek that which transcends awareness—only then do they grasp the secret of extending life.\n\nThe Most High expounded the teachings, and the profound subtleties of the scriptures’ purport lie in every word and phrase as secret methods. How could those of shallow learning easily fathom them? If one dismisses the text as vulgar and common, merely slandering and reviling, the roots of sin will be difficult to eradicate.\n\nFor instance, if one is unaware, when the Most High transmitted the scriptures, why did He not say, \"unaware\"? The difference between \"not self-aware\" and \"unaware\" is vast, and it does not align with the scriptures’ purport. The \"not\" placed above means not personally investigating the original causes of one’s destined nobility or baseness, longevity or early death. The \"not\" placed below—\"unaware\"—means not knowing what to awaken to. \"Not self-aware\" clearly means knowing what to awaken to but failing to realize it oneself.\n\nThose who recite the scriptures with shared aspiration should savor its purport, ponder deeply, and reflect thoroughly, so as not to betray the Most High’s sagely intent in bestowing the teachings and establishing the words.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Most High divides His body to teach and transform, descending in transformed emanations. Though dwelling in the highest of the Three Realms, abiding in the innermost of the Nine Heavens, the Most High’s heart of pity for all beings never rests for a moment. The Most High descended in transformed emanation to Shu Capital, transmitting these scriptural instructions to benefit all beings and deliver them from the suffering of rebirth.\n\nAs for Shu Capital—this is present-day Chengdu Prefecture. Emperor Ming of the Han asked the monk Kāśyapa Mātaṅga: \"When the Dharma King was in the world, why did His transformation not reach this land?\" The monk replied: \"Kapilavastu is the center of the trichiliocosm. All buddhas of the Three Realms appear in that land. Those with vows and practice are all born there, receiving the Buddha’s true teaching and awakening to the Way. Beings in other lands, lacking the karmic affinity to encounter the Buddha, are not visited by Him. Though the Buddha does not go there, His light reaches all places. After five hundred years, a thousand years, or even beyond a thousand years, there are always sages who transmit the Buddha’s teachings to transform them.\"",

      "translated_text": "Why did the Most High descend upon Shu Capital while not visiting other regions? Shu is the blessed land of the Kun quarter, where the Heavenly Master and Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord had at that time completed the Nine-Cauldron Elixir through cultivation on Mount Crane Cry, and was moreover able to propagate teachings and transformations. Thus did the Most High descend there to bestow scriptures and oral instructions.\n\nThe earth spirits surged forth, raising a jade platform to serve as a lofty seat. Jade is the essence of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, the congealed splendor of yin-yang and water-fire. Smooth yet warm, precious and noble, it is imperishable for ten thousand generations. The *ju* is a jade throne with curved legs, akin to the seven-jeweled tiered dais of the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation—an ornate seat adorned with seven tiers of dragon and phoenix motifs. The Most High, moved by compassion for sentient beings, descended to the world to expound the scriptures. Of the myriad numina of the Three Realms, which would not come to receive Him? Thus was it fitting that the earth spirits raised the jade platform in attendance. When the scripture’s recitation was complete, the jade platform sank back into the earth, and the site where it transformed into a grotto remains a relic of Chengdu to this day.\n\nThereupon, the Venerable Lord ascended the jade platform and conferred upon the Heavenly Master Perfected One the *Oral Instructions on the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny*, broadly proclaiming essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nAccording to the Han *Records*: The Heavenly Master’s personal name was Daoling, styled Hanfu. A native of Pei’s Fengyi County, he was the eldest son of Dashun, the eighth-generation direct descendant of the Marquis of Liu, Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang’s hidden acts of yin merit flowed fragrance to later generations. The Heavenly Master’s mother first dreamed of a celestial spirit descending from the Northern Dipper’s *Kui* star, towering over ten feet tall, clad in embroidered robes. The spirit bestowed upon her fragrant *hengwei* blossoms. Upon waking, her clothing and chamber were suffused with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for a month, and she conceived. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the *jiayin* year of Emperor Guangwu’s *Jianwu* reign (10 A.D.), he was born on Mount Tianmu in Wu territory. At that time, yellow clouds blanketed the sky, purple *qi* filled the courtyard, and a radiance like the sun shone in the air for a month. The earlier fragrance was again perceived, permeating the days before gradually dispersing.\n\nBy the time he came of age, he stood nine feet and two inches tall, with fine brows, a broad forehead, green eyes, a vermilion crown, a high nose, a square head, and three-cornered eyes. A *fuxi* bone traversed his brain, and his jade-pillow peak was prominent. His hands hung past his knees, his beard and whiskers were handsome, and his bearing was like a dragon crouching or a tiger pacing. Though majestic in appearance, even his kin and friends regarded him with reverence. At seven, he read the *Dao and Virtue*’s two chapters over ten times and grasped their purport. He mastered the subtleties of astronomy, geography, the River Chart, Luo Diagram, and ritual canons, thoroughly studying the ancient classics without omission. Over a thousand disciples followed him. Thirty *li* south of Mount Tianmu and eighty *li* northwest, lecture and recitation halls stood. The Immortal’s Abode of Lin’an and the Immortal-Penetrating Abode of Yuhang occupy those sites today.\n\nLater, he was recommended for the *Xianliang Fangzheng* and *Zhiyan Jijian* examinations and passed. Though he entered officialdom, his aspiration was to refine his form and ascend lightly. After a time, he retired to seclusion on Mount Northern Mang. Three years later, a white tiger placed a talisman beside his seat. The court summoned him to serve as *Boshi*, but he claimed illness and did not rise. When Emperor He ascended the throne, he was summoned with a third-rank seal and cord, a four-horse carriage, and the title of Grand Tutor. Later, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Ji County, but he declined three imperial edicts. This was in the *renchen* year of *Yongyuan* 4 (92 A.D.).\n\nThereafter, he journeyed from the Yellow and Luo Rivers through the famous mountains of the Jiang and Huai regions, paying homage to grotto-heavens and visiting all the cavern chambers. Ascending the current into Shu, he encountered divine beings who instructed him and obtained secret oral instructions on cinnabar and talismans. Thus, on Mount Crane Cry, he refined the Nine-Cauldron Elixir to completion but dared not consume it. He told his disciple Wang Chang: \"One who would ascend to Heaven must first extend merit to living beings, aid the state and pacify families, promote benefit and eliminate harm. Only then may one ascend lightly. To serve the Three Realms without shame, one must not seek personal profit while failing to benefit the people—this is not the great Dao’s principle of vast deliverance.\"\n\nIn the *renwu* year of Emperor Shun’s *Han’an* 1 (142 A.D.), on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month at noon, he was moved by the descent of the Golden Watchtower’s Later Sage, the Mysterious and Primordial Lord of the Dao—Laozi—who bestowed upon him the Registers of Orthodox Unity’s Alliance and Might, the Sword of the Three and Five for Beheading Demons, and the credentials of the Capital Office’s tally registers. Thereupon, he consumed the elixir and battled spirits, establishing courts of governance.\n\nLater, the Most High again conferred upon him the Three Caverns’ nine hundred and thirty volumes of scriptures, seventy-two volumes of secret oral instructions on talismans, cinnabar, and lightning, along with caps and robes. By Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* 1 (155 A.D.), he had repeatedly received these scriptures along with the *True Scriptures of the Five Directions and Five Dippers*. In *Yongshou* 2 (156 A.D.), he and his wife Lady Yong simultaneously ascended to Heaven in broad daylight, attaining the position of Perfected One of the Great Mysterious Capital’s Orthodox Unity, the Heavenly Master of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma for Assisting and Supporting the Primordial.\n\nThe oral instructions bestowed by the Most High are the Dharma. Every word in the scriptures is an essential method. For those who uphold the Dao, to awaken to even a single word, phrase, method, or oral instruction is to depart from delusion and directly hasten to the Dao’s shore. The two characters *Daoling* are the Heavenly Master’s personal name. Though one need not avoid them when reciting the text, out of reverence, one should substitute \"Perfected One\" when reciting.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable Lord told the Heavenly Master: \"A human body is hard to obtain; to be born in the Middle Kingdom is hard. Even if one attains birth there, encountering the true Dharma is hard.\" According to the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, the Buddha said: \"To depart from evil destinies and become human is hard. Having become human, to be born in China is hard. Having been born in China, to encounter the Dao is hard.\" It is also said: \"Those in the world who obtain a human body are like soil on a fingernail; those who lose a human body are like the great earth’s vastness compared to the Supreme Clarity’s realm.\" The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Humans take essence as their mother and *qi* as their master. The five viscera each have essence; within essence, *qi* is born. The five viscera each have *qi*; within *qi*, spirit is born. Spirit can generate longevity. To preserve life and attain long life, refine essence into cinnabar, nurture *qi* into spirit. True immortals and sagely perfected ones cultivate truth and nurture *qi*. Naturally, the inner truth responds externally. With effort, success is assured, and one ascends from the mundane to the sagely.\"",

At the birth of a female, the left kidney forms first, with external blood and internal essence—yang resides within.\n\nThe kidneys generate the spleen, the spleen generates the liver, the liver generates the lungs, the lungs generate the heart, the heart generates the small intestine, the small intestine generates the large intestine, the large intestine generates the gallbladder, the gallbladder generates the kidneys, the kidneys generate the bladder, the bladder generates the Three Origins, the Three Origins generate the Triple Burner, the Triple Burner generates the Eight Vessels, the Eight Vessels generate the Twelve Meridians, the Twelve Meridians generate the Fifteen Collaterals, the Fifteen Collaterals generate one hundred eighty subsidiary collaterals, these generate one hundred eighty encircling collaterals, these generate thirty-six thousand thread-like collaterals, these generate the three hundred sixty-five bones, and the three hundred sixty-five bones generate the eighty-four thousand hair pores. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete and *qi* is full; the numinous radiance enters the body, and the child separates from the mother to become human.\n\nHow rare indeed is the human body! The sages respond to the turning of the ages: twenty thousand years make one kalpa, two thousand years a minor kalpa. Worthies descend into the world once every five hundred years. The Most High Lord Lao, the Great Sage, responds to the needs of beings and expounds the true scriptures—how difficult it is to encounter them! Yet those who do encounter them and fail to believe or turn toward them—what a grievous pity!\n\nAmong all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most noble; humans are the most numinous. In the upper realms, one may become a sage or perfected being—this too is within human capacity. In the lower realms, one may become a ghost or beast—this too is a transformation of the human. For the good ascend to the upper realms, while the evil descend to the lower worlds. Thus, through the mandate of heaven, *yin* and *yang* *qi* determine whether one is born male or female—like the near-impossible alignment of needle and mustard seed, or the rare encounter between sage and mortal.\n\nDao-ling received the esoteric instructions of his former master. The Most High once imparted the thirty-two characters of the true and mysterious aperture to the ancestral Celestial Master, Zhang the Perfected, saying: \"The human body is hard to obtain; true subtlety is hard to encounter. Suddenly, one is swept into the wheel of rebirth, departing without direction. For those who study the Dao, sincerity lies in guarding the center. Naturally, one becomes serene and still, in harmony with heaven and earth—this is the path by which the ancestral masters attained the Dao.\"\n\nNow, Dao-ling dares not conceal this teaching. He annotates this chapter, wishing to share even a fraction of its progress with like-minded seekers.\n\nMany stray from the true Dao, many enter heterodox sects, many plant the roots of sin, many indulge in cunning deceit, many give free rein to lust and killing, many delight in worldly attachments, many indulge in greed and anger, many sink into hell, many lose the human form.\n\nIf one loses the true Dao, one enters heterodox sects. The \"roots of sin\" refer to the ten evil deeds below. \"Cunning deceit\" is the karma of speech; \"lust and killing\" are the karma of the body; \"attachments, greed, and anger\" are the karma of the mind. Once the roots of sin are planted, all manner of evils flourish, leading one to fall into hell and lose the human form.\n\nThe repeated use of \"many\" in this chapter is meant to instruct the foolish—it is not addressed to those of superior wisdom. Yet for such reasons, beings remain deluded, unaware of the true Dao, and the confused are legion.\n\nAll the above karmic causes and effects are made clear by the Most High, who unfurls the great net of the Dao to warn beings: they must not transgress it, lest they fall into hell and lose the human form—yet people remain heedless.\n\nClothing suffices for propriety and warmth; plain food can satisfy hunger. Cultivating simplicity and virtue enriches the body; poetry and books broaden the mind. Official position allows one to apply one’s learning; craft and trade can sustain the body. Yet people do not abide by their station, do not know moderation, do not collect their scattered minds, do not seek the true Dao. They indulge their passions, give rein to desires, wallow in delusion and vain imaginings, restless and agitated, thought after thought racing, step after step falling into the net of evil karma. Whose fault is this?\n\nNow, moved by pity for such beings, I set forth the Dharma and expound the good causes, so that they may know the Dao, understand that body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao for their existence. Awakening to this truth, they may abide long in the human realm, ensuring their lineage continues unbroken, generation after generation as humans, never born in realms devoid of the Dao, never severing the root of humanity.\n\nThe Dao is the path—it is the principle that should guide daily conduct, human relations, and all affairs. All people follow it together.\n\nFrom the perspective of the teaching, the Dao exists before the Supreme Ultimate, transcending the forms and vessels of heaven and earth. It was already present before the arising of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. After the division of heaven and earth, in the heavens it becomes the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning; in humans, it becomes benevolence, righteousness, virtue, and the Dao; on earth, it becomes grasses, trees, mountains, and rivers; in the seasons, it becomes spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in time, it becomes cold, warmth, darkness, and clarity; in the teaching, it is preserving sincerity and refining nature; in the law, it is merit, reward, punishment, and penalty. Thus, the Most High said: \"The great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth; the great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon; the great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao.\"\n\nThe Buddhist tradition also holds that before the existence of heaven and earth, it was our true essence. The early Confucians traced its origins, saying: from the Great Void comes the name \"heaven\"; from the transformation of *qi* comes the name \"Dao.\" What heaven bestows is called *ming* (destiny); *ming* is the command. What humans receive is called *xing* (nature); *xing* is principle. Though heaven does not speak, how does it command? It is simply the great transformation flowing and operating—*qi* reaches a thing, and that thing is born, as if receiving a command. Nature is benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Nature and destiny are never separate, yet in human endowment, there are differences in purity and turbidity, length and brevity, clarity and obscurity, thickness and thinness. Thus, there are disparities in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, long life and early death, wisdom and foolishness.\n\nIf one is endowed with *qi* of the utmost purity and refinement, one becomes a person of intelligence and divine sagacity. If one’s *qi* is pure, refined, lofty, and luminous, one becomes a sage of wealth, nobility, and long life. If one’s *qi* is deep, thick, enduring, and long, one becomes a person of intelligence, wisdom, loyalty, integrity, worthiness, and righteousness. If one’s *qi* is thin, foul, and brief, one becomes a person of perversity, violence, treachery, deceit, cruelty, malice, foolishness, poverty, and lowliness.",

      "translated_text": "The goodness and evil in people, though dependent on their endowment, also arise from the *qi* they receive. The Most High, moved by compassion for the world’s people, transmitted scriptures and precepts to bestow the true teaching, expounded worldly dharmas to elucidate good affinities, and employed skillful means to harmonize and guide all beings, enabling them to know the Dao, understand the body, awaken to their nature, and realize their destiny, thereby obtaining the true seed. Once the true seed is obtained, one attains long life within the human realm; if, generation after generation, one does not turn away, the root of humanity remains unbroken.\n\nThis scripture was not transmitted by the Most High solely for the sake of guiding lesser scholars. If those of superior wisdom thoroughly investigate it, keeping their thoughts fixed on the Dipper and preserving the true with every breath, they will ascend to the ranks of the immortals in time. If they further cultivate the correct Dao in their hearts and gradually enter the lineage of immortality, they will forever escape the cycle of rebirth and transcend to achieve the Dao.\n\nThe Most High, in great compassion and mercy, most benevolent and sagely, teaches and transforms all beings with tireless earnestness. Initially moved by pity for beings whose endowment of heavenly mandate is uncertain, who stray from the human path and sink into oblivion without awareness, the Most High proclaimed essential methods, declaring that people, deluded by the true Dao, fail to awaken and instead plant the roots of sin without realizing it. Thus, they are instructed to know the Dao and understand the body, awaken to their nature and realize their destiny, all of which depend on the Dao for their arising, ensuring the true seed is never severed.\n\nThis chapter further warns that people may fail to escape the Three Realms. Since the Dao can be known, one must also cultivate and practice it, constantly upholding it without neglect, embracing it wholeheartedly. Gradually entering the initial vehicle, with long and steadfast practice, guarding it without loss, applying effort and strength, one will ultimately reach the realm of thorough awakening and rest, enter the lineage of immortality, escape the cycle of rebirth, and achieve the correct Dao.\n\nTherefore, I reveal to you this wondrous method to deliver the people of heaven and guide them to return to the true and know their destiny. On the day of your original destiny, perform a fast and hold a jiao offering.\n\nHere, \"I\" refers to the Heavenly Master, and the \"wondrous method\" points to the following instruction regarding the performance of fasts and jiao offerings on one’s original destiny day. The \"people of heaven\" are the people of the world, born of heaven, and the Heavenly Master is broadly bestowing salvation upon them. As Yi Yin said: *\"I am the first to awaken among the people of heaven; I shall use this Dao to awaken these people.\"* Though instructed to return to the true and know their destiny, they lack a starting point—this is now made clear.\n\nThe Most High, in compassionate skillful means, opens the way for all beings, designating one day within sixty days as the day of one’s original destiny. On that day, purify the heart, observe the fast, restrain the *po* and gather the *hun*, make offerings according to one’s means, submit petitions and memorials, recite the sacred names, and chant the scriptures. Thus, those in the initial stages of truth-seeking will find the practice neither too burdensome nor too lax, neither tedious nor neglectful, making it easy to enter the Dao. Through gradual and sustained cultivation, every day and every moment becomes the day of one’s original destiny. With diligent pursuit and unwavering devotion, cherishing and upholding the practice, the merit and power accumulated are beyond measure.\n\nIn performing fasts and holding jiao offerings, the Dao prioritizes fasting. As the scriptures say: *\"Even an evil person, if they observe the fast with bathing and purification, may serve the Supreme Emperor.\"* For those who study the Dao, though they may observe the fast, if they do not uphold the ten precepts governing body, speech, and mind, their adherence to dietary restrictions is empty and of no benefit—it may even invite transgressions.\n\nThe jiao offering is a summons, calling forth the true spirits of the Three Realms. It is also said: *\"It is a decree inviting each person to ignite the sincerity of their heart and await the Emperor’s edict.\"* Further, it is said: *\"The lamp that illuminates others is my own nature—this is the meaning of the jiao.\"*\n\nThere are three methods of fasting:\n1. **Offering Fast**: This is the practice of performing the fast to make offerings, which accumulates virtue and extends years.\n2. **Dietary Abstinence Fast**: Also called the sacrificial fast, it entails refraining from alcohol and meat, harmonizing the spirits and preserving longevity—this is practiced by those of middling capacity.\n3. **Mind Fast**: This involves purifying the heart, eliminating desires, cleansing the spirit, removing impurities, and severing thoughts and concerns. Without thoughts or concerns, one focuses solely on the Dao; without desires, one delights in the Dao; without impurities or burdens, one unites with the Dao. The mind fast is supreme, dietary abstinence is secondary, and the offering fast is the lowest.\n\nThe *Preface to the Seven Precepts of the Northern Dipper* states: *\"The Most High said: The human body is difficult to obtain, birth in the Middle Land is difficult to attain, and encountering the true Dharma is difficult to come by. When these three are all present, the fortune is unparalleled. Moreover, heaven is impartial and always favors the good. If one can distance oneself from evil and follow goodness, abandon delusion and return to the true, how distant is the Dao? Yet though the Dao is without fixed form, learning follows an order, and the essentials of cultivating the true begin with fasting and precepts.\"*\n\nThe precepts consist of seven articles:\n1. **First Precept**: Do not abandon right mindfulness to indulge in false thoughts, thereby forming inclinations contrary to the Dao. Always preserve the spirit within the sea of *qi* and enter that wondrous gate.\n2. **Second Precept**: Do not display or disseminate sacred texts with arrogance or carelessness. Always maintain secrecy and vigilance, protecting and upholding them day and night. After seven years of merit, transmission to later students is permitted.\n3. **Third Precept**: Do not attend funerals or mournings, or tread upon defiled places, lest external influences disturb and offend the true and upright. Always maintain purity, both internally and externally.\n4. **Fourth Precept**: Do not consume putrid or spoiled foods, the three reviled meats, or the five pungent vegetables, lest they gather corpse impurities and disturb the Three Palaces. Always swallow saliva to cleanse and purify the spiritual source.\n5. **Fifth Precept**: Do not urinate or defecate facing north, or expose oneself to the Three Luminaries, thereby offending the divine spirits and inviting misfortune. Even in seclusion, one should avoid such actions.\n6. **Sixth Precept**: Do not become drunk or overindulge in food and entertainment, lest the spirit and *qi* become confused and the spiritual gates blocked. Always practice moderation to maintain balance.\n7. **Seventh Precept**: Do not associate with improper company or recklessly follow heterodox teachings, lest the mind become divided and lose its direction. Always follow the correct teaching without doubt.\n\nThe above seven true precepts are the essence of the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* and serve as the foundation of mysterious practice and the essential path to attaining the true. Each should be observed and upheld without forsaking one’s initial resolve. If one adheres to these precepts, the seven immortal officials of the precepts will surely protect and bestow blessings, leaving grace and conferring fortune.",

It governs the revolutions of the four seasons, and all matters—whether of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, the five planets and constellations, the six jia and twenty-eight lunar mansions, the host of immortals and perfected beings, from the Son of Heaven to the common folk—pertaining to longevity, official rank, poverty, wealth, life, death, fortune, and misfortune, even affairs of the unseen realms, all fall under the governance of the Northern Dipper. Should one invoke it with sincere devotion, it will surely respond.\n\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors, along with the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices, as stated in the *Scripture of the Jade Pivot*: the Celestial Official resolves celestial calamities, the Terrestrial Official resolves terrestrial calamities, and the Aquatic Official resolves aquatic calamities. The Five Emperors resolve the calamities of the five directions. The Azure Emperor of the East governs Wood, oversees the liver, and guards the hun-soul; the White Emperor of the West governs Metal, oversees the lungs, and attends the po-soul; the Vermilion Emperor of the South governs Fire, oversees the heart, and regulates qi; the Black Emperor of the North governs Water and governs the blood; the Yellow Emperor of the Center governs Earth, oversees the spleen, and presides over the central palace, commanding the five viscera. As humans take form in accordance with the five phases, the Three Officials and Five Emperors are concerned with all aspects of their existence.\n\nThe Nine Bureaus consist of the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Upper Origin, the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Middle Origin, and the Nine Bureaus of the Three Officials of the Lower Origin, totaling twenty-seven bureaus. The Upper Origin has thirty-six departments, while the Middle and Lower Origins each have forty-two departments, amounting to one hundred and twenty departments in all. These collectively govern all beings—whether celestial or terrestrial, human or spirit, immortal or ghost, and all myriad creatures—linking them to the officials of the Dipper to fulfill their inner and outer duties.\n\nThe Four Offices comprise the Four Offices of the Celestial Bureau: the Office of Life, the Office of Records, the Office of Wrongdoing, and the Office of Peril; and the Four Offices of the Earthly Prison: the Office of Life, the Office of Records, the Office of Merit, and the Office of Execution. Together with the Three Officials, Five Emperors, and Nine Bureaus, they examine the sins and blessings of humanity.\n\nThe Most High has imparted these teachings to liberate beings from external conditions of form, instilling awe so that they may turn from evil and incline toward goodness.

      "translated_text": "The human form corresponds to Heaven and Earth: the round head resides above, symbolizing Heaven; the square feet rest below, symbolizing Earth. The North Star marks the center of Heaven, yet lies in the north, thus the *Baihui* acupoint crowns the human head, while the heart faces backward. The sun and moon traverse only the southern sky, so a person’s two eyes likewise face south. The Northern Dipper revolves through the four seasons, wheeling all the luminaries, just as the human heart encompasses all principles, responds to all affairs, and governs the twelve thousand *jing*-spirits of primordial *shen*, the twelve hundred spirits of form and shadow. It circulates the blood and *qi*, activating the hundred passages, while all spirits together guard the heart.\n\nThe Three Officials are the three *hun*-souls, and also the Three Primes within the human body: the three caverns of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Five Emperors are the five viscera. The Nine Bureaus are the nine orifices. The Four Offices are the four limbs. If one can subdue and govern the nine orifices, nurture and harmonize the three *hun*, regulate and pacify the five viscera, and preserve and move the four limbs—avoiding evil realms, restraining worldly passions, severing self and others, and casting aside right and wrong—one gradually enters the true Dao. Is this not joyous indeed?\n\nTo recommend blessings and dispel calamities, one presents petitions and earnest prayers. On their life-destined day, people beseech grace and request fortune, prolong life and dissolve misfortune. Their fervent supplications are expressed in words and documents, offered in petition to the Northern Dipper and all the divine officials. This is the Most High laying a Dharma-bridge across the ford of delusion, aiding sentient beings onto the great Way. If one can awaken to this, the body encounters a rare opportunity to reach the other shore—like a prisoner long confined in prison who, by good fortune, meets with a sweeping pardon. One should then reflect deeply, reproach oneself, correct past wrongs, and recognize former errors. Wash and purify the heart to remove evil; bathe the body to avoid lingering defilement. Thus, renewing what has already been renewed, day by day renew it again, without interruption. Then one may become a good person.\n\nIf, however, relying on the path of rebirth and the gate of extension, one persists in old evils and commits new ones, this is to knowingly violate the statutes and discard life for the realm of death—sinking into delusion, falling into evil destinies, and losing the human form. Regret will come too late.\n\nWith sincere devotion, one offers various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits, and worldly observances. The altar hall is purified, modeling Heaven and Earth, whether in a Daoist abbey or at home. According to one’s capacity, one establishes merit, requests rituals, and performs Dharma services. The merit and virtue are profound and cannot be fully described.\n\nReciting the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes of True Sovereigns, one’s transgressions and karmic debts will be eradicated, calamities and misfortunes washed away, and fortune, longevity, and life-essence will be endowed, with good fruits accruing to the body. In times of urgent distress, one may burn incense and recite scriptures to secure peace within a set time.\n\nSincere offerings are the essence of sacrifice. When a noble person sacrifices, they observe seven days of abstinence and three days of fasting, ensuring their devotion is complete. Where there is sincerity, there are spirits; where there is no sincerity, there are no spirits. How can one not be reverent and earnest?\n\nObservances of dignity arise from an inner heart of reverence, awe, sincerity, and fear, outwardly manifesting in gazing upward, bowing, prostrating, kneeling, and paying homage—all in proper form. When governing the people, one’s demeanor should be worthy of observation, and one’s conduct measured. How much more so when paying homage to the true and venerating the sacred? To lack dignity is to be disrespectful.\n\n\"Establishing merit according to one’s capacity\" means arranging offerings without rigid constraints. From high-ranking lords, elders, and virtuous persons who establish fasts and offer jiao-rituals, to those of modest means, the sick, the poor, those who practice austerities, and even barbarians and lowly servants—all present flowers and pour water, each according to their strength, offering with utmost sincerity. The key is purity and cleanliness. One must not be extravagant when frugal, nor impoverished when wealthy; stinginess, carelessness, defilement, anger, and irritation will bring immediate misfortune.\n\nWhen reciting the names of the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns or venerating the True Sovereign of one’s life-destiny, one must first clear all distractions, purify body and mind, and prevent worldly thoughts from arising. Then recite them—reciting with the mouth is not as good as reciting with the heart. If one suddenly glimpses one’s original heart, this truly fulfills the intent of the Most High Lord Lao’s teachings. One will then attain timely peace, and good fruits will accrue to the body.\n\n*Commentary on the Most High Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Destiny Longevity True Scripture, Scroll One* (concludes)\n\n*Commentary on the Most High Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Destiny Longevity True Scripture, Scroll Two*\nCollected commentary by Xu Daoling, the Dark Yang Master\nCollated by Xu Daoxuan, the Qian Yang Master",

      "translated_text": "Herein the Great Sage of the Northern Dipper’s efficacy in resolving calamities is expounded:\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Three Disasters. The Three Disasters are stellar designations. According to the *Jade Pivot Scripture*, those who wish to avoid the calamities of the Three Disasters and Nine Perils must, on a quiet night, bow in reverence to the Northern Asterism. Furthermore, in the method of supplicating the Dipper, there are those who place the Three Disaster Stars before the Dipper’s mouth as offerings, for these stars wield the most malevolent influence among all malign forces. When one’s destiny encounters them, performing the proper rites of offering and exorcism will invariably yield response.\n\nThe Three Disasters are also understood as: thunderous wrath as the Celestial Disaster, conflagration as the Terrestrial Disaster, and drowning as the Aquatic Disaster. These afflict beginners who have not attained the true Dao, trapped within the confines of their karmic bonds. When misfortune converges, such calamities are unavoidable. Now, by fortunate encounter with exorcistic rites, these Twenty-Four Calamity-Solving Numinous Talismans—if one recites the Dipper Scripture, prostrates in repentance before the Dipper, recognizes the Star Sovereign of one’s life-destiny, and burns the numinous talismans—can avert such disasters. Those of superior wisdom who cultivate and refine themselves to perfection transcend the limits of celestial fate and qi destiny; how could they suffer these calamities or any other adversities?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Four Slayings. The \"slaying\" refers to destructive forces. The upright are endowed with upright qi, while the wicked encounter malevolent slayings. The Four Slayings are the unbalanced qi of the four seasons: in spring, it manifests as warmth; in summer, as malaria; in autumn, as dysentery; and in winter, as coughing—hence the term Four Slayings. Among the yin-yang correspondences, the Four Slayings reside in the inauspicious directions of *chou*, *wei*, *chen*, and *xu*. The Four Slayings, along with the Three Slayings and Seven Slayings, are all baleful stellar deities of the earthly branches. Should one offend them, the harm is not slight. Yet if one supplicates and exorcises according to the proper rites, all taboos are lifted.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Five Phases Calamities. The Five Phases correspond to the five viscera; once one organ is afflicted, the entire body is unsettled. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: When the Five Phases are obstructed and the Nine Luminaries are inauspicious, recite the Jade Scripture. The Celestial Worthy commands the Six Spirits of Destiny in one’s household to ascend and beseech the Northern Dipper to resolve all calamities. If such disasters arise, one must protect and exorcise them according to the proper rites.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Six Harms. The Six Harms are the six thieves of the body: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent. If left unchecked, they cause harm. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: When the Three Punishments and Six Harms intersect and entangle, one must preemptively guard against them. By venerating the Perfected and paying homage to the Dipper, they can be resolved and exorcised.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Seven Injuries. The Seven Injuries are the seven emotions of humans: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire. Any excess injures the body—hence their alternate name, the Seven Slayings. If one resolves and guards against them, no harm will ensue.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Eight Difficulties. \"Difficulty\" refers to the inescapable malignant illnesses of the world: paralysis, epilepsy, wind-consumption, and leprosy. These eight afflictions—unless one has previously revered the Dipper Perfected—cannot be fully overcome or escaped. The Eight Difficulties are also alternate names for the Eight Sceneries. The Scripture states: The August Heaven admonished the Perfected Immortals and Sages of the Three Realms, saying, \"You must guard against the Eight Leaks to transcend the Eight Difficulties. Only by transcending the Eight Difficulties can one enter the Three Clarities.\"\n\nThe Eight Leaks are:\n- Tears from the eyes, the leak of the liver; if unceasing, longevity is unattainable.\n- Mucus from the nose, the leak of the lungs; if damaged, illness arises.\n- Saliva from the mouth, the leak of the spleen; excessive loss exhausts the body’s essence.\n- Sweat from the body, the leak of the heart; if unchecked, death is inevitable.\n- Drool during sleep, the leak of the brain; if unsealed, the spirit is not numinous.\n- Leakage from the small intestine to the kidneys; if unsecured, life is cut short.\n- Nightly dreams of intercourse with ghosts; the spirit’s leakage is most evident.\n- Unrestrained lust; the body’s leakage is beyond remedy.\n\nThese Eight Leaks constitute the Eight Difficulties. If one reveres the Northern Dipper, the seven emotions will not be recklessly stirred. When emotions no longer cause harm, the Eight Difficulties become轻微. Those of superior wisdom who follow this path can transcend. If one senses the onset of illness, one must immediately cease desires, reduce diet, maintain sincere purification, supplicate the Dipper, recite scriptures, wear numinous talismans, and thereby dissolve and exorcise the afflictions.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Nine Stars Calamities. When the nine orifices are uncontrolled, they give rise to lust, greed, and wrath. These also correspond to the Nine Luminaries’ inauspicious influences. Yet if one diligently cultivates and refines the precious elixir, venerates the Dipper, and pays homage to the Perfected, what calamity cannot be eradicated?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Marital Calamities. The Scripture states: Parents give life, but nothing surpasses the continuation of lineage. The union of man and woman is the great human bond. When worldly couples err in their marital union, offending stellar deities and malevolent forces, governance falters and calamities arise. The Northern Dipper governs the Jade Pivot; for such adversities, one must maintain utmost sincerity, purify oneself, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, supplicate the Dipper, and burn talismans to dissolve and exorcise them. Then husband and wife will live in harmony, and descendants will flourish.\n\nYet some, though married with children, harbor lustful hearts, covet dowries, take multiple wives, establish separate households, contend over wealth and beauty, employ sorcery and curses—causing spouses to become estranged as Orion and Antares, and parents and children to turn against each other like wolves and tigers. Some even face punishment, lose their fortunes, or perish. Such self-inflicted suffering—how can the gods accept the prayers of the unfilial?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters. The causes of childlessness and lineage extinction are manifold. Yet if one extends the care for one’s own young to the young of others, and moreover establishes merit and sows virtue, the Dipper Perfected will resolve such calamities without need for supplication, bestow children without awaiting requests. To indulge in concubines and favoritism not only brings no benefit but invites harm.",

      "translated_text": "The Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Childbirth. If a woman does not monopolize the favor of the bedchamber nor harbor jealousy in her heart, she will be free from childbirth calamities, and her descendants will be numerous. Should she reform her ways, first offering apologies to the Dipper Bureau, performing morning rites of repentance before the precious litanies, inscribing talismans, and reciting the names of her destined Perfected Lords, she may resolve such calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Repeated Misfortune. According to the *Jade Statutes*: Though a person may possess wisdom and ability, their affairs often meet with discord, now succeeding, now failing, bearing only an empty name. Illness lingers unhealed, marriages are untimely, and there is no heir to continue the line. Even if sons and daughters are born, they cannot be raised to maturity, and in the end, nothing goes as one wishes—this is called the affliction of repeated misfortune. It arises when ancestors cannot attain liberation and remain long without anyone to deliver them. Though a hundred thousand years may pass, they will never be reborn. One should resolve this by refining and delivering them to the realm of the living, so that those presently alive may naturally flourish and their affairs proceed as desired.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* of Daoist cultivation teaches that labored suffering is caused by corpse-illnesses. The manifestations of corpse-illness vary: there are transmitted corpse-illness, lingering decay, lung atrophy, bone steaming, and repeated misfortune—all five arise from depletion and debility. The source of the illness begins in the kidneys and transmits to the heart, causing palpitations, shortness of breath, and dreams of departed ancestors. Thus, the Scripture states: \"The departed cannot attain liberation and repeatedly afflict their kin.\" Should one ask, \"How can one know if ancestors cannot attain liberation and repeatedly afflict their six relations?\" The answer is: if one suffers this calamity, they will contract this illness. Once afflicted, one should swiftly reduce desires, purify the heart, take medicinal remedies, swallow talismans, and pray to the Dipper Perfected to deliver their ancestors, so that the departed may attain a favorable rebirth and the living may have their calamities resolved and misfortunes dispelled.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Epidemics. According to the *Sutra of Disaster Dispelling*: If the Great White Fire Star enters the Southern Dipper, it will bring manifold obstacles to the state, the household, and the corresponding regions. Reciting this dhāraṇī and invoking its power will dispel the disaster, transferring it to those who defy royal commands or act with perversity. The Buddha does not shift disasters—rather, such individuals bring them upon themselves. When epidemic toxins spread, causing entire households to fall ill and perish, it is because people ordinarily act without filial piety or loyalty, without benevolence or righteousness, without reverence for Heaven and Earth, without awe for the gods, without respect for the Three Luminaries, without valuing the Five Grains, without maintaining incense offerings, without honoring their own bodies. They indulge in slaughter, abhorring the foul and rank, their evil natures gradually worsening, their wicked deeds growing ever more alike, their noxious qi converging—all of which brings about such consequences. If one reforms, such calamities will not arise. Should contagion occur, one may fast, perform rites to the Dipper, wear sacred talismans, and thereby achieve resolution and expiation.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Illness. For chronic and stubborn ailments rooted in past transgressions, or sudden illnesses and abrupt afflictions due to lack of care, one must swiftly offer rites of apology to the True Lords, supplemented by medicinal remedies and ritual methods, to surely receive support in decline and resolution of calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Malevolent Spirits. When malevolent spirits and demonic forces cause harm, it is because the heart harbors unrighteous thoughts, attracting spectral entanglements—all due to neglecting devotion to the Perfected. If one follows the proper methods to perform rites to the Dipper and pay homage to the Perfected, displaying sacred talismans, and moreover seeking the location of the Celestial Stem, one may summon the true qi to dispel them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves. Encountering tigers, wolves, snakes, or serpents on land, or dragons, shen, and fish in the water—these are the natural calamities of movement. If one first submits to the Jade Pivot, sincerely offers to the Dipper Palace, recites the scripture’s name, and wears sacred talismans, how could such calamities befall? Should one encounter them, swiftly cast the talisman into fire or water, and the response will be as swift as an echo.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Insects and Snakes. When birds and rodents deliver omens, or snakes and insects bring misfortune, it is because in daily household management, one fails to rectify killing, theft, and licentiousness, violates taboos, and offends the gods’ wisdom. Thus, the Six Spirits depart, and serpentine spirits seize the opportunity to enter. One should recite the Dipper’s name, repent of transgressions, purify the household, burn and display sacred talismans, and naturally summon the true qi to dispel and expiate them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Bandits and Robbers. These arise from careless concealment and accumulated debts—one’s own doing. If one proactively petitions for resolution and cautiously guards against the unforeseen, one may avoid them.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Cangues and Cudgels. If one is falsely accused of crimes, entangled in wrongful charges, or suffers from mistaken transgressions or false accusations, finding oneself imprisoned in fetters and enduring the suffering of cangues and cudgels—though the circumstances may be unjust, once the case is documented, officials avoid blame by calling it doubtful, and family members’ pleas of innocence go unheeded. One should wholeheartedly fast, reveal one’s true feelings, submit a petition, and pray to the Dipper Bureau. Even those imprisoned should fast in their hearts and pray silently, aligning inner and outer sincerity. This will surely move the gods, bringing hidden retribution and manifest response, ensuring fair trials and reversals of verdicts, thereby resolving the calamity. Thus, can legal punishments be resolved?\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Unnatural Death. All deaths not by natural causes are called unnatural deaths. If one knows of such impending calamities, one should perform good deeds, accumulate hidden virtue, repent of past wrongs, examine oneself, and earnestly pray to the Dipper Palace, wearing sacred talismans—thereby achieving the efficacy of reviving the dead. However, if one is crushed beneath collapsing walls or executed amid extreme torture, such unnatural deaths are self-inflicted, not the work of Heaven, and prayers will be of no avail.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Curses and Oaths.",
      "overlap_context": " Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters. The causes of childlessness and lineage extinction are manifold. Yet if one extends the care for one’s own young to the young of others, and moreover establishes merit and sows virtue, the Dipper Perfected will resolve such calamities without need for supplication, bestow children without awaiting requests. To indulge in concubines and favoritism not only brings no benefit but invites harm.",

      "translated_text": "Alliances broken by curses, oaths violated, sorcery of infatuation, demonic possession, and malevolent prayers—these matters take many forms. Some seek love and admiration; some sow discord among kin; some betray kindness and violate loyalty; some make vows only to break them; some quarrel over unequal shares of wealth; some suffer oppression without redress; some wish others dead or afflicted with suffering; some trust in shamans and foolishly seize others’ souls, causing them to become confused and disoriented; or some fall into silent brooding, lying bedridden for long periods. All these arise from the misalignment of body and mind, or from actions that are excessive or deficient.\n\nIf one can reflect upon the origins of these afflictions, examine one’s own faults, correct past wrongs, and cultivate future good deeds; if one further recites the names of the Great Sages and wears the sacred talismans of the Celestial Emperor, then these calamities may be resolved and averted.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Heavenly Nets.\nThe Heavenly Net represents the principles of Heaven, while the Earthly Snare represents the affairs of humanity. If one, as a person, neither violates the laws of the state above nor transgresses human ethics below, then one may traverse freely in all directions, forever free from the entanglements of nets and snares. Should one harbor such thoughts, one will inevitably fall into this calamity; should one defy this Way, one will suffer this punishment. Yet if one does not transgress the Five Constants, upholds the Three Bonds, and with sincere heart and clear mind pays homage to the true Dipper, one will forever attain longevity and enter the Dao of immortality.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Earthly Snares.\nThe preceding text has already clarified this, yet the matter remains incomplete. The Earthly Snare and Heavenly Net are none other than the statutes and ordinances of the law. People do not reflect that wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness are predetermined by fate; instead, they fail to accept their lot, know no restraint, defy the Mandate of Heaven, resist the workings of qi, and commit unlawful acts that violate state laws. They cast aside their nature and forfeit their lives—how can they escape the calamities of the Earthly Snare and Heavenly Net? Yet if one accepts one’s station, bears punishment in mind, preserves the body, and upholds the Dao; if one further pays homage to the Dipper and venerates the true, then one will naturally be free from such calamities.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve the Calamities of Hell.\nThe merit of this scripture extends to both the living and the dead. If one bears karmic debts from past lives and, after death, faces judgment in the courts of the underworld, filial descendants may seek to absolve their nine generations by petitioning the Dipper, performing rites of repentance, and seeking pardon for their sins—thereby guiding the deceased onto the path of the virtuous.\n\nThe Great Sage of the Northern Dipper and the Seven Primes of True Sovereigns can resolve all calamities.\nThe Most High, in bestowing these teachings and expounding this wondrous scripture, enables people to prolong life, preserve destiny, transcend calamities, and dispel misfortune. The calamities discussed here are but the most prominent examples. As the *Scripture of the Jade Pivot* states: \"The Northern Dipper resolves all calamities.\" When people face hardship, they need only pay homage with sincerity, perform rituals, hold fasts, recite scriptures, burn talismans, and invoke the names—then there will be no lack of response.\n\nThus, the Seven Primes, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious and spiritually attuned. This chapter serves as the path to entering the Dao and cultivating the true, the essential method for prolonging life and paying homage to the Dipper, the secret technique for resolving calamities and dispelling misfortune, and the pivotal key to reviving the dead and restoring life. The Most High places this after the discussion of calamities to urge people to cultivate and uphold these methods—thereby freeing themselves from all obstacles and naturally ascending to the true and attaining the Dao.\n\nFor those who have just begun to study the Dao, as well as for devout men and faithful women, if they arouse sincere devotion and, on the days when the Seven Primes descend, follow the prescribed methods—reciting scriptures, burning talismans, submitting memorials, and presenting petitions—then the mighty power and spiritual efficacy of the Seven Primes, the wondrous transformations of the Great Sages, and the numinous clarity of the myriad spirits will come into play. They will deliver beings from all calamities and raise them from the suffering of the multitudes.\n\nIf people wish to dispel misfortune, atone for sins, resolve calamities, and release hardships, they need only pay homage to the Dipper with reverence—then all their wishes will be fulfilled, and they will lift sentient beings from the depths of suffering. For those in urgent need, reciting these words will preserve peace.\n\nIf a household faces illness, misfortune, childbirth, disaster, the desire for descendants, or the wish to prolong life, they should swiftly compose their thoughts, focus their minds, invoke the name of their life-star sovereign, uphold this method, recite this scripture, and burn this talisman—thereby ensuring the household’s tranquility and the timely resolution of all troubles.\n\nAll may rely upon this to generate a hundred blessings, all in harmony with the Five Phases.\nAs the *Seven Precepts of the Dipper True* states: \"Do not associate with improper company, recklessly pursue heterodox paths, or waver in resolve, leaving no guiding principle. Always follow the true teachings without doubt.\" If one wholeheartedly devotes oneself to these scriptures and methods, cultivating the Dao and attaining the true, the Dipper’s administration will bestow a hundred blessings, and all one’s actions will silently align with the transformations of the Five Phases.\n\nThe three hun-souls will be secure and healthy, malevolent spirits will forever cease, and true qi will descend from the Five Directions, bringing myriad blessings to converge naturally.\nWhen the three hun-souls are secure and healthy, the nine spirits will withdraw their traces. The five viscera will naturally generate true qi; once true qi is generated, one will forever preserve integrity and uprightness, and myriad blessings will naturally unite with one’s body.\n\nLongevity transcends the Eight Difficulties, all through revering the Seven Stars.\nOnce myriad blessings converge upon one’s body, the Eight Difficulties will naturally be transcended, and the path to longevity will be complete—all attained through the mysterious efficacy of revering the Seven Stars. If one can, as previously described, stabilize the three hun-souls, regulate the five viscera, restrain the Three Corpses, restrain the Nine Spirits, and escape the Eight Difficulties, then one will have realized the merit of revering the Northern Dipper.\n\nThis will ensure that in every life, one avoids confinement and attains freedom, roaming at ease with the Dao, and in every generation, one’s spirit remains pure.\nGoodness is like a shadow in light, and response is like an echo in a valley.\nOnce one attains freedom in every life and purity of spirit in every generation, the primordial spirit will generate wisdom and light, illuminating the right and wrong of all things.

The four stars of the Dipper’s bowl form the Celestial Sphere, and the three stars of its handle form the Jade Balance, as it is said: \"The Celestial Sphere and Jade Balance regulate the Seven Governors.\" Our Master Confucius spoke of governance, likening it to the Northern Asterism governing through virtue—this is the Northern Dipper’s revolving operation, from which yin and yang emerge, life and death arise, the four seasons are established, and the myriad spirits are commanded. Is this not governance? Such is the discourse of the Most Sage Master.\n\nAccording to another version of the *Scripture of Prolonging Life*: The Most High said: \"Heaven’s One generates water, born from the north. Thus, the Purple Tenuity’s enclosure is exalted in the Northern Asterism. The lodgings of the Northern Asterism are arrayed as the Seven Primordials: the first is the Greedy Wolf, the last the Broken Luminary, and at the center stands the Literary Star, serving as the pivot of heaven and earth.\" Moreover, the Three Terraces stars serve as the Northern Dipper’s canopy. The *Scripture of the Jade Pivot* states: \"Above the Northern Asterism lie the Three Terraces, their stars intertwined, shaped like a pair of eyes, stacked in three tiers to cover the Dipper’s bowl.\" Thus, it is again made clear that the Northern Asterism is the Northern Dipper.\n\nNevertheless, we await the arrival of perfected beings and lofty scholars to further elucidate and verify these truths. It is the pivot of creation’s mechanism and the sovereign of human spirit, proclaiming its might across the Three Realms and governing the myriad spirits. In heaven, it is the Northern Asterism; in humans, it is the true nature. The Northern Asterism commands all stars, directing the Three Realms and operating the transformations of creation.\n\nIn the first, second, and third months, the Dipper’s handle points to the positions of yin, mao, and chen at dusk, giving birth to the myriad things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it points to si, wu, and wei, nurturing and fostering the myriad things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it points to shen, you, and xu, bringing the myriad things to maturity. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it points to hai, zi, and chou, gathering and storing the myriad things. If the Dipper’s handle ceases to turn, the four seasons lose their rhythm, the Five Phases fail to respond, cold and heat deviate from their measures, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and living things cannot come to fruition. Thus, it is the pivot of creation’s mechanism. The true nature governs the myriad spirits, distinguishing good from evil and discerning right from wrong.\n\nIt judges the appointed time for good and evil among humankind. Some people, though devoted to good deeds, encounter many misfortunes—this is because their merit in goodness is not yet sufficient. Once their merit is complete, blessings will arrive. As the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one receives, upholds, reads, and recites this sutra yet is despised by others, it is because their past-life karmic offenses are thereby extinguished.\" Others, though wholly given to evil, enjoy good fortune—this is because their evil is not yet full. When their evil reaches its limit, great disaster will strike. Thus, Lord Lao said: \"Evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy the self.\" The matters of good and evil each have their appointed times—this is the virtue of the Most High’s love for life. For those who do good, the time awaits the fullness of great goodness; for those who do evil, the time awaits their repentance. Thus, the appointed time for good and evil is made clear.\n\nThe eyes of the Underworld’s judges of right and wrong—how could the sacred efficacy of the Northern Dipper remain obscure? Yet, as this passage states, the spirits below govern the straight and crooked, the meritorious and the blameworthy; the ghostly officials discern diligence from negligence; the suffering and radiant souls rise or stagnate; and the revolutions of the Four Births and Six Paths all fall under this guiding principle.\n\nThe Five Phases share a common endowment, and the Seven Governors belong to the same category. Jupiter (Wood) governs the year and the branches, corresponding to the four lodgings of Horn, Dipper, Straddler, and Well. Mars (Fire) corresponds to Tail, Room, Beak, and Wings. Venus (Metal) corresponds to Neck, Ox, Straddler, and Ghost. Mercury (Water) corresponds to Winnowing Basket, Wall, Orion’s Belt, and Chariot Platform. Saturn (Earth) corresponds to Base, Maiden, Stomach, and Willow. Additionally, the four lodgings of Chamber, Void, Mane, and Pleiades serve as the Sun’s abode, matched to it and belonging to Fire. The four lodgings of Heart, Danger, Net, and Spread serve as the Moon’s abode, matched to it and belonging to Water. These four times seven stars, paired with the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries, are also called the Seven Governors.",

      "translated_text": "The Northern Dipper is the body of Heaven, while the Five Phases and the Two Luminaries are its function. Thus, one body and one function are bound to movement and stillness; one movement and one stillness are bound to yin and yang; one yin and one yang are bound to Heaven and Earth; one Heaven and one Earth are bound to water and fire. The union of water and fire is called creation and transformation. The mechanism of creation and transformation is the revolving jade armillary—this is how the Northern Dipper governs movement and stillness, body and function, yin and yang, water and fire, Heaven and Earth, and creation and transformation.\n\nThough the function of the Seven Governors shares the same category as the Northern Dipper, the meaning of the Dipper is truly vast. The character *dou* (斗) is composed of *shi* (十, ten) and *er* (二, two). The Dipper governs the center of Heaven, revolving and regulating the degrees, establishing the four seasons to govern the eight directions, harmonizing the Five Phases to align the Seven Governors. Its function encompasses the number twelve.\n\nIn the Three Clarities, it generates the nine *qi*; the nine *qi* generate the Supreme Heavenly Purple Tenuity and the Northern Culmen, forming twelve positions. In the Northern Dipper, the seven visible and two hidden stars combine with the Three Terraces, also forming twelve positions. In the human body, there are the five viscera and seven orifices; in yin and yang, there are the twelve branches; in the human form, there are twelve correspondences; in the celestial circuit, there are the twelve thunder gates. A year has twelve months, and a day has twelve hours. Extending this principle, truly nothing between Heaven and Earth is not under the Dipper’s governance.\n\nFellow students and perfected ones who daily pay homage to the Real and hourly venerate the Dipper will naturally attract the true *qi* of the Dipper’s immortals to their bodies, thereby prolonging their lives. This practice possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dispel calamities and transcend tribulations.\n\nThe Most High, in his compassion, expounded this scriptural formula precisely to dispel calamities, transcend tribulations, reverse death, and inscribe life. Though the Mandate of Heaven cannot be altered, it is also shaped by human cultivation. Thus, death may be reversed, and tribulations resolved. Heaven’s decree may overcome humanity, yet humanity’s resolve may also overcome Heaven.\n\nI, Dao Ling, have witnessed in the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Scripture of Paying Homage to Heaven and Offering Thanks to Thunder* the Most High’s proclamation of one such matter, demonstrating that the power to reverse death lies in human cultivation. In the ninth kalpa of the Dragon Han era, in the village of Yibao in Dongping Prefecture, there lived a man surnamed Zhao, whose nature was simple and unrefined. One day, while on business in the prefectural city, he encountered a diviner who said, “Your fiery complexion foretells that within three days, you will incur the wrath of thunder.” The man returned home without revealing this to anyone. On the third day, a great storm of wind, thunder, and rain darkened Heaven and Earth. The man exclaimed, “Heaven has come to execute me! I shall flee to the wilderness to spare my parents and siblings from fear.” Grasping an umbrella, he hastened to the eastern outskirts to await his fate.\n\nAt that moment, the thunder of the earth, knowing his thoughts, dispatched the fierce official Xin, judge of the Celestial Thunder Bureau, who transformed into a commoner to observe the matter. Flying beneath the umbrella, he shared its shelter with the man. The man said, “Heaven seeks to execute me, and I have come to await death. You should leave quickly and not linger here; take the umbrella with you.” Judge Xin flew back to report to the Celestial Thunder Bureau, which memorialized the Supreme Emperor. Moved by the man’s conduct, the Emperor granted him an additional thirty-six years of life, a thousand days of official salary, and pardoned three generations of his sins—all because of three good deeds: first, knowing of the thunder’s wrath yet not speaking of it, which was reverence for Heaven; second, fleeing to the wilderness to await death, which was love for his kin; third, urging the man sharing his umbrella to leave and offering him the umbrella, which was benefiting others. Because of these three deeds, he prospered, his descendants flourished, and his death was reversed to life. Is this not the result of human cultivation?\n\nFrom emperors to commoners, though their ranks differ, their destinies are no different. Heaven and Earth are but one *qi*; humans and all beings share a single path. Once, Emperor Ming of Han encountered the Seven Primal Perfected Lords on Mount Zhongnan. Clad in plain robes with unbound hair, the Emperor bowed and asked, “May I inquire which immortals and sages you are?” The Perfected Lords replied, “We are the Seven Primal Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper, descending to the human realm to inspect the fortunes of good and evil.”\n\nThe Emperor knelt and bowed again, asking, “What affairs do you immortals oversee?” The Perfected Lords said, “We govern the stellar lodgings of the various heavens above and the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, three hundred sixty famous mountains, thirty-six grotto-heavens, and earthly immortals below. The river sources and aquatic tribes are also under our jurisdiction, as are the lifespans, clothing, food, official ranks, illnesses, weapons, punishments, and prisons of the people of the lower realm, along with the rise and fall of their allotted lands. All these are recorded by us.”\n\nThe Emperor asked, “Do I, as Son of Heaven, also fall under your governance?” The Perfected Lords replied, “Though you are a ruler among men, your destiny is the same as that of the common people.” The Emperor bowed and said, “My eyes have never beheld such Perfected Ones.” He then inquired further, “May I seek the Dao of longevity and cultivate it?” The Perfected Lords said, “If you seek the supreme Dao to escape death and ascend to Heaven, you must be steadfast and diligent—how could you not attain it?”\n\nThe Emperor said, “I am fortunate to have met you, Perfected Ones. I beg you to transmit your teachings. I shall cultivate them without fail and commission paintings of your true forms to venerate throughout my life.” The Perfected Lords replied, “Since you have earnestly requested this of us, we cannot refuse. As your former destiny was that of an immortal who descended to become a ruler, we shall now impart to you the secret arts of the Mysterious Real. You must practice them in secrecy and not leak them. You must make great vows, revere Heaven and comply with humanity, cultivate a kind and harmonious nature, and strictly abstain from lust, laziness, killing, harm, and reckless thoughts. To attain the Dao and communicate with the sages, simply follow the method of stepping through the Dipper at the two times when *qi* converges, swallow talismans, recite incantations, visualize, and perform offerings. When your merit is complete, you will naturally ascend as an immortal.”\n\nThe Emperor said, “I shall follow the method and uphold the precepts.” The Perfected Lords said, “Listen carefully. Cultivate your body and refine your form. Always practice between midnight and noon. Visualize your body as a withered tree, then tightly grasp your left middle finger at the middle joint. Next, imagine your empty body as a mass of true *qi*. When this is complete, visualize the true *qi* transforming into a true person. The Azure Dragon emerges from the left of your liver, the White Tiger from the right of your lungs, the Vermilion Bird from the top of your heart, and the Dark Warrior from the feet of your kidneys. The Four Spirits will attend and guard you.”",

In all *Steps of the Dipper*, during spring and summer begin from the *Kui Star*, and during autumn and winter begin from the *Gang Star*. Always start with the left foot. When about to perform the *Step of the Dipper*, first tightly grasp with both hands at the middle joint of the middle fingers, silently recite □□□□□□□, then lift the left foot. Visualize the Dipper’s canopy above your head, with the *Kui Star* in front and the *Gang Star* behind. Next, visualize golden light illuminating you, then knock the left teeth seven times and recite the incantation:\n\n*“In the world above, eight thousand beings,\nIn the realm below, four generals govern.\nThe Three-Five officers expel evil spirits,\nThe Four-Six youths protect my body.\nThe Six Jia direct talismans to dispel curses,\nThe Six Ding jade maidens guard my form.\nOn the left, the Azure Dragon; on the right, the White Tiger;\nAbove, the Vermilion Bird; below, the Dark Warrior.\nBefore me, the Attendant Clerk; behind, the Recorder.\nBanish all malevolent spirits and nightmares—\nIf they do not depart at once, raise the Heavenly Axe!”*\n\nThen knock the right teeth seven times and recite the incantation:\n\n*“Great Peace of the Nine Palaces,\nThe Great One guards the chamber.\nA hundred spirits assume their positions,\nSoul and spirit harmonize as one.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nSealing away all misfortune.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the command of the Most High Lord Lao!”*\n\nThe Perfected Lords said, “This incantation was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Most High. You must uphold these two incantations, and divine generals, spirit youths, and jade maidens will naturally follow and guard you, driving away all afflictions. Epidemics, consumptive illnesses, legal punishments, and blades of war will never draw near.”\n\nThe Emperor said, “On which days do the Perfected Ones descend to the mortal realm? What do they consume? I humbly request your instruction, that I may make offerings.”\n\nThe Perfected Lords said, “On the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of the first month; the second, seventh, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days of the second month; the twenty-sixth day of the third month; the seventeenth and twenty-seventh days of the fourth month; the fifth, thirteenth, and twentieth days of the fifth month; the fourth and eighth days of the sixth month; the fourth and twenty-fourth days of the seventh month; the second, eleventh, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month; the third and eighteenth days of the ninth month; the tenth and twenty-sixth days of the tenth month; the first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of the eleventh month; the twentieth day of the twelfth month; and on every third and twenty-seventh day, as well as *Gengshen* and *Jiazi* days, we descend to wander the mortal world. Offerings should consist of freshly ripened fruits and cakes, fragrant flowers and herbs, fine wine, and jujube broth.\n\nWhen making offerings, first press your tongue against the upper palate, visualizing it as the *Bridge of Immortal Ascent*. Then imagine the five viscera emitting five-colored *qi*, forming five strands of auspicious clouds. Ride this bridge to the Five Dippers, and silently summon the spirit envoys of the current year, month, day, and hour. Ascend the bridge to our Dipper and say: ‘Disciple [your name] has [matter] to report.’\n\nIf you see within the Dipper one figure resembling a jade maiden holding a ram’s head, this is the *Lifting Ram Envoy*. Next, if you see one holding a sword in the left hand and a flower tray in the right, this is the *Dhara Envoy*. These two will first inspect your offerings. If they are impure or defiled, they will report it.\n\nIf rare fragrances and purple clouds enter the chamber, it is we, the Seven Perfected Ones, along with the Left Assistant and Right Attendant, descending. You must make offerings in a secluded room, free from anger, and always maintain joy. Do not allow women, mourners, monks, or nuns to witness this, for if they do and defile us, calamity will strike at once. If you cultivate with single-minded devotion, when disaster approaches, simply burn incense and petition us, and misfortune will be averted. Do not act recklessly.\n\nNow, having attained this true and mysterious method, I dare not keep it secret for my own benefit. Thus, I record this chapter, hoping that those of superior wisdom will cultivate according to its teachings, attain spiritual resonance, and ascend to transcendence, realizing the Dao.\n\nOrdinary people in the world are mostly deluded. They do not know their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper, nor that their lives are governed by the Celestial Bureau. When disasters and misfortunes arise, they do not know the path of expiation. To prolong life and fortune, they do not understand the way of returning to the true. The Dipper is the plumb line of Heaven and Earth, the crucible of *yin* and *yang*. It gives birth to creatures and humanity, circulates water and fire, completes the four seasons, and commands all spirits across the ten directions and three realms. Even the exalted Three Clarities and the Jade Pivot of the Vast Heaven cannot surpass the great virtue of the Northern Dipper!\n\nYet people wear the Dipper upon their heads without realizing their bodies belong to it, and they do not diligently pay homage or cultivate devotion. How can worldly people avoid disasters that befall them? Even those who study the Dao but possess shallow understanding may still suffer, let alone those entangled in worldly affairs. Their minds are enslaved by fame and profit, never knowing restraint; their essence is shaken by wine and lust, never knowing moderation. When calamity strikes, disaster is inevitable. Yet when misfortune arrives, they still do not awaken to return to the true and seek expiation. Instead, they blindly trust shamans and sorcerers, slaughtering animals and burning foul offerings in prayer. If they recover by chance, they credit the gods’ favor; if they die, they blame the gods for failing to protect them. Some even consume medicines that harm living beings.\n\nAlas! You seek life, yet they too cherish their own. How can you bear such cruelty? All these errors stem from not knowing the path of expiation. Those who know the path first seek healing through medicine. If that fails, they pray to their ancestors. If the ancestors do not respond, they then seek ritual aid. If still no effect, they have already offended Heaven’s decree and the stars’ fate, and must resolve it through virtuous deeds.\n\nHave you not heard of Duke Jing of Song in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*? When the *Yinghuo* star lingered in the Heart constellation, portending disaster for Song, Zi Wei said, ‘The calamity meant for you, my lord, can be transferred to your ministers.’ The Duke replied, ‘Ministers exist to govern the state.’ Zi Wei said, ‘It can be transferred to the people.’ The Duke said, ‘If the people die, whom shall I rule?’”",

      "translated_text": "Duke Jing said, “It can be transferred to the harvest.”\nThe Duke replied, “If the harvest fails, the people will surely starve to death.”\nZi Wei said, “My lord has spoken with utmost virtue. The Three Heavens will surely reward you thrice.”\nThat very night, the *Yinghuo* star retreated three celestial stations.\n\nTruly, when one faces disaster, can it not be resolved through virtuous deeds? If a person cultivates a single good thought or performs a single good deed, they can move ghosts and gods and stir Heaven and Earth. When disaster strikes according to the stars’ fate, one should seek ritual expiation, acknowledge the Star Lord governing one’s destiny, and perform rites to dissolve calamity. Further, one must reflect thrice upon oneself, examine past transgressions, repent sincerely, and wholeheartedly return body, spirit, and life to the Dipper Officials. Thus, disasters may be dispelled, and life prolonged with added years.\n\nThis is the path of expiation and return to the True. If one neither relies on skilled physicians and medicine to cure illness nor demonstrates devotion by petitioning the Dipper and sacrificing to ancestors, then disaster will deepen, illness will worsen, and death will draw near. The soul and spirit will be bound, misfortunes will entangle, grave illnesses may not heal, or malevolent spirits will inflict harm, leading to years of suffering, prolonged hardship, legal disputes, and summons. Ancestral spirits may be implicated, Heaven may send reprimands, or vengeful ghosts may lodge false accusations below.\n\nWhen such peril arises, how can one seek deliverance? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, perform rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, acknowledging the Perfected Lord of one’s destiny. Only then can peace and prosperity be attained. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully expounded.\n\nYet the foolish and deluded, driven by greed and avarice, exploit public office for private gain, harm others for personal benefit, trust in shamans for excessive sacrifices, bribe officials to oppress the good, indulge in cruelty to torture servants, and display jealousy toward their spouses. They act as if Heaven and Earth do not exist and fear no divine judgment. Failing to awaken, they sink deeper into wrongdoing, perpetuating delusion and accumulating evil until misfortune overflows. When circumstances shift and adversity strikes, illness and malevolent spirits follow. Once human desires are exhausted and Heaven’s principle shines forth, countless perils manifest in the heart.\n\nThe Most High, in boundless compassion, opens the gate of expiation and points directly to the path of return to the True. If one repents past transgressions, vows to avoid former wrongs, submits petitions, performs rites to thank the Perfected Lords, and reverently acknowledges one’s destined Star Lord—further cultivating the True and turning toward the Dao—prosperity and honor will follow. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully described. The Most High briefly reveals below the true forms, names, and sacred talismans of the Northern Dipper.\n\nThe *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Power for Prolonging Life, with Annotations*, Scroll Two, concludes.\n\n---\n\n**The Perfected Lords of the Seven Primes of the Great Sage Northern Dipper** can resolve the sufferings of hell... and dissolve all calamities.\n\n*(The *Scripture Annotations* and *Annotated Scripture* both read: “The Seven Perfected Lords of the Great Sage can resolve the calamities of warfare... and dissolve the calamities of water and fire.”)*\n\n*(In the preceding two collated versions, this phrase reads: “and all stars pay homage to it.”)*\n\n*(In the preceding two collated versions, “return to the True” is rendered as “take refuge” or “return to refuge.”)*\n\n---\n\n**The *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Power for Prolonging Life, with Annotations*, Scroll Three**\n\nCompiled and annotated by Xu Daoling of Xuanyangzi\nCollated and corrected by Xu Daoxuan of Qianyangzi\n\nWhenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must pay reverence with utmost respect. Devotion to the Perfected must be as constant as donning one’s cap and robe—never to be set aside even for a moment. Sincerity in worship must be as if facing the sovereign or serving a noble—without the slightest negligence. Only then can one move the Perfected Spirits.\n\nThe First Star of the Northern Dipper is **Yangming, the Greedy Wolf, the Great Star Lord**, governing those born in the *zi* hour.\nThe Scripture states: All human life originates from Heaven’s *qi*. The *qi* of the true north, residing in the center, generates water, and all things arise from water. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, revolving through the four directions, governing the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of all people.\n\nThe Northern Dipper:\n1. **Greedy Wolf Star**, the Eastern Dipper, governs destiny.\n2. **Giant Gate Star**, the Western Dipper, records names.\n3. **First Assistant Star**,\n4. **Second Assistant Star**,\n6. **Military Arts Star**, residing in its proper position as the Northern Dipper, governs death.\n5. **Healthy Chastity Star**, the Southern Dipper, governs birth.\n7. **Broken Army Star**, residing in the central position as the Great Chief of the Central Dipper, oversees all spirits.\n\nAll things in creation, in life and death, are governed by the Northern Dipper. Beyond the visible stars lie hidden auxiliary lights, while within, the twelve celestial branches are guided by the unseen. In sustaining life, they are collectively called the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng*; in measuring death, they are collectively called the *Huoluo*.\n\nIf sentient beings encounter illness or calamity, performing expiatory rites in the appropriate direction will ensure no good deed goes unanswered.\n\nThe **Star Lord’s** name is *Kuai*, styled *Greedy Wolf*, also called *Celestial Pivot* or *Proper Star*. He governs the seven *yin* virtues of *yang* power and is titled *Lord of Supporting the True*. The *Divine Incantations Scripture of the Northern Emperor* states: His name is *Ge*, styled *Lushen Zi*, also named *Celestial Hero*, styled *Ziran*, residing in the Jade Tower of Qingcheng in the Palace of the Most High. He serves in Heaven, governing the celestial origin and the body. Those born in the *zi* hour belong to him. He oversees the *Taiyang* Perfected Lord and the four lunar lodges of *Shi*, *Bi*, *Kui*, and *Lou*, regulating the *yang* brightness of seasonal nodes and the spring birth of all things. His domain encompasses the Qin region and the *Xuzhou* astrological division. He serves as the Celestial Grand Commandant, administering governance.\n\n*(Note: The original text breaks off here, with subsequent lines marked as fragments #1 and #2, likely referring to missing or variant passages.)*\n\nThe Star Lord’s surname is *Shangling*, personal name *Yaotianchui*. He wears a nine-colored hibiscus crown, crimson robe, purple skirt, nine-colored azure cloak, and phoenix-patterned shoes. He can transform like a ghost or spirit, with unbound hair pointing upward, a red face and green eyes. In his left hand, he holds a white staff; in his right, he presses forward.\n\nThe *Nine Perfected Lords’ Nine Yin Unified Transformation Hidden Heaven Formula* states: The first star of the Northern Dipper is called the *Palace of the Great One*, the *Hidden Light Palace of the Emperor’s Transformation*. Within resides the Emperor’s inner consort, named *Taiyi Fayuan*, styled *Xingzhengfu*. She wears a yellow brocade robe and a flying skirt of cinnabar and blue, with a cloud-like topknot.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the *Ninth Upper Honored Palace* is the *Empress of the High Thearch Transforming Metal and Stone, Mountains and Rivers, within the Dipper*, titled *Great Unity’s Luminous Purity*, styled *Cloud-Nurtured*. She wears a dark-green brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt, her hair bound in cascading cloud-like tresses. As the Dipper’s *Internal Assistant*, she oversees all affairs, scrutinizing the merits, demerits, blessings, and transgressions of the governing ministers across the ten thousand states and nine provinces. She presides over lamp offerings, prayers for blessings, and the submission of petitions, discerning fortune in brightness and misfortune in obscurity.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace’s Radiant Essence, Opener of Virtue Star Lord*.\nThe *Middle Terrace’s Sixfold Purity, Controller of Emptiness Star Lord*.\nThe *Lower Terrace’s Curved Life, Controller of Prosperity Star Lord*.\n\nThe *Three Terraces* comprise six stars, rising in pairs to form a transverse arc before the second star of the Northern Dipper. The first pair is called the *Pillar of Heaven*, symbolizing the *Three Dukes’* positions. In heaven, they are the *Three Terraces*; in man, the *Three Dukes*. To the west, near the two stars of *Wenchang*, lies the *Upper Terrace*, the *Controller of Destiny*, governing longevity. The next pair is the *Middle Terrace*, the *Controller of the Center*, governing the imperial clan. The eastern pair is the *Lower Terrace*, the *Controller of Records*, governing military affairs.\n\nAlternatively, the *Upper Terrace’s Controller of Destiny* is the *Grand Commandant*; the *Middle Terrace’s Controller of the Center* is the *Minister of Education*; and the *Lower Terrace’s Controller of Records* is the *Minister of Works*.\n\nAnother account states: The upper star of the *Upper Terrace of the Grand Stairway* assists the Son of Heaven, while its lower star represents the Empress. The upper star of the *Middle Terrace* represents the feudal lords, and its lower star the ministers and grandees. The upper star of the *Lower Terrace* represents the scholar-officials, while its lower star governs the common people. Thus, they harmonize *yin* and *yang* and govern the myriad things.\n\nAccording to the *Jade Pivot Scripture*: Should one wish to avert the calamities of the *Three Disasters* and *Nine Accidents*, one must, on a quiet night, bow in reverence toward the *Northern Asterism*. Above the *Northern Asterism* lie the *Three Terraces*, their stars aligned in a formation resembling a pair of eyes stacked in three tiers, overarching the *Dipper’s Bowl*. This is called the *Celestial Stairway*. Whoever beholds it shall be spared the woes of imprisonment in life and the torments of perdition after death. The *Celestial Stairway* is the *Dao* by which the *Most High* ascends and descends.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of Penetrating Mystery and the Dao*, the *Lord Who Governs Generation*.\nThe *Middle Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of Benevolent Transformation, Manifest Virtue, and Extended Blessings*, the *Great Spirit Who Nurtures*.\nThe *Lower Terrace Star Lord* is titled *Heavenly Worthy of the Wondrous Source and Mysterious Existence of the Cavernous Void*, the *Heavenly Elder Who Protects*.\n\n*Radiant Essence*, *Sixfold Purity*, and *Curved Life* are the *Star Lords’* inner taboo names.\n\nThose who know the *Star Lords’* names and sincerely prostrate in reverence shall have all evils dispelled and all virtues perfected. When seated upright in a quiet chamber, one should visualize the *Three Terraces* hovering above the head, then imagine the *qi* from the kidneys ascending from the chest to connect with the *Three Terraces*. After prolonged contemplation, one should tap the teeth thirty-four times, exhale gently through the nose, then close the mouth, fill the breath, and swallow. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Celestial numen, flourishing glory,\nGrant eternal life’s protection.\nGreat Mystery’s Three Terraces,\nGuard this true form.\nThe Five Viscera’s Spirit Lords,\nEach preserve peace and tranquility.\"*\n\nAfterward, tap the teeth again and bow silently before withdrawing. Thus, demonic obstacles shall be forever dispelled, and all affairs shall proceed as desired.\n\nThe *Upper Terrace Star Lord* has a crimson complexion, exhales red *qi*, wears Daoist robes, holds a *green jade gui* tablet, rides a black cloud, and bears a yellow *qi* upon his crown.\nThe *Middle Terrace Star Lord* has a white complexion, exhales white *qi* that fills the heavens, wears Daoist robes, holds a *white jade gui* tablet, rides a white cloud, and bears a white *qi* upon his crown.\nThe *Lower Terrace Star Lord* has a small visage, yet his radiance shines with a thousand beams, his *qi* like threads piercing the darkness. He stands amidst blue-green *qi*, clad in Daoist robes, holding a *blue-green jade gui* tablet.\n\nThe *Three Terraces* receive the *Three Qi of Emptiness*—the true colors of luminous blue-green, yellow, and white—and are the masters of harmonizing *yin* and *yang*, corresponding to man’s *Three Hun*. Without the *hun*, man cannot live; without the *hun*, he cannot be nurtured; without the *hun*, he cannot be protected. Thus, they are called *generation*, *nurturance*, and *protection*. For man, the presence of the *hun* ensures life; life necessitates nurturance; nurturance necessitates protection. If one is born and nurtured but not protected, one shall meet an early demise. The secret of prolonging life lies precisely in these three words. Those who cultivate the truth, having learned that the *Three Hun* generate, nurture, and protect me, should realize that since this body has received life, it must be nurtured; since it can be nurtured, it must be cherished. If one fails to cherish it, disregarding the body and life on forbidden days, the *Three Hun* shall depart, and this body shall perish.\n\nThe names of these *True Lords* are rarely heard. Whoever encounters and recites them possesses profound *Dao*-mind and karmic affinity from past lives, enabling them to hear and uphold these names. Their merit and power are beyond measure. It is said: The grain one eats this year was sown as seedlings last year. The fortune of encountering this scripture today stems from the good causes of past lives in revering the Dipper. Those born in this sagely age who encounter this wondrous scripture, recite the names, and pay homage to the true forms shall accrue merit beyond conception, and their karmic rewards shall likewise be beyond conception.\n\nIf devout men and women of true faith encounter this scripture, their wisdom-nature shall become complete, their *Dao*-mind shall blossom, they shall depart from the paths of the deluded masses, enter the gate of *Xiyi*, return to the true lineage, and attain the glorious realm of life. Those endowed with loyalty, integrity, sincerity, and faith possess a nature of wisdom and luminous clarity. With integrity, they depart from the paths of the deluded; with faith, they enter the gate of *Xiyi*. Having awakened to the true lineage and propagated the great *Dao*, how could they not transcend to the glorious realm of eternal life?\n\nOn the *Three Primes*, the *Eight Festivals*, one’s *Life Destiny Day*, and the days beneath the Northern Dipper, one should meticulously arrange an altar, recite the scripture, perform vegetarian offerings, and follow the rites in conducting the *Dao*. The blessings thus accrued shall be boundless, ensuring that through countless lives, one shall never stray from true nature or fall into heterodox views.\n\nThe *Three Primes* are the days when the *Three Officials* record and present the merits and transgressions of the world to the heavenly courts.\nThe *Eight Festivals* are the *Beginning of Spring*, *Spring Equinox*, *Beginning of Summer*, *Summer Solstice*, *Beginning of Autumn*, *Autumn Equinox*, *Beginning of Winter*, and *Winter Solstice*—these eight days when the *Five Thearchs* descend to record the sins of humanity.",

On the third and twenty-seventh days of each lunar month, I descend to the mortal realm to receive offerings and observe the good and evil of humanity.”\n\nOn such nights, one may set up an altar in the central courtyard, offering refined delicacies, wine, and dried meats, to seek deliverance from calamities, prolong life, augment destiny, and employ methods to dispel malevolent spirits, exorcise ghosts, and extinguish demonic essences. When retiring for the night, first visualize the *Canopy of Nine Stars* above your head, with the Northern Dipper to the left, right, above, and below, and the *Three Terraces* covering the center. In the eastern chamber of your dwelling, envision the *Twenty-Eight Constellations* in the form of infants, clad in brocade skirts and purple silk robes, holding green tablets, their mouths emitting jade-like *qi* that enters your own, transforming into true *qi* that suffuses your entire body. Upon mastering this *Dao*, you become a master who commands spirits, and all demons shall tremble in fear.\n\nThose who follow the *Dao* and learn the true names of the *Perfected Lords* may, on the days of their descent, meticulously arrange an altar, recite scriptures, and perform vegetarian offerings. Those who, life after life, possess deep karmic affinities with the *Dao* and a profound devotion to its heart, and who now diligently follow its rites, shall accumulate boundless merit and power. By not straying from true nature, revering the true lineage, and avoiding heterodox views, they depart from the paths of delusion. This is the *Most High’s* compassion, earnestly and repeatedly imparting teachings to the world, guiding humanity to worship the Dipper and pay homage to the true, to turn from evil and return to rectitude, and to transcend the mundane and ascend to the real.\n\nThose who uphold the scriptures should recite the sacred titles of the *Seven Primes Perfected Lords*. When their virtuous deeds are complete, auspicious blessings shall descend. For those who study the *Dao*, setting up altars to pay homage to the true, reciting scriptures, and invoking the names of the *Perfected*, with long and unwavering practice, their thoughts never straying, and their resolve unshaken, they shall remain ever close to the true essence of the Dipper. Naturally, they shall be moved by sincerity, and the *Perfected* shall bestow upon them blessings of longevity and auspicious fortune.\n\nThe incantation of the Northern Dipper is as follows:\nThe explanation of the Northern Dipper was fully expounded in the preceding chapter. An incantation is a prayer, and also a praise of the sacred virtue of the true Dipper. Those who follow the *Dao* and recite it with utmost reverence, visualizing the forms of the *Seven Primes*, shall find their prayers invariably answered.\n\nThe preceding Sanskrit divine incantations were revealed by the *Most High* to clarify the hidden rhythms of the demon kings of the *Three Realms*, ensuring that those who pay homage to the true shall not be obstructed by demon kings and may ascend to the Dipper’s domain.\n\nThe Sanskrit divine incantation reads:\nOṃ hūḥ □nā xī xī nā, luó lóu nǎ jié dá nǎ, □jié nǎ □□nǎ □□nǎ, oṃ hōng hōng jù zhǐ dì shē sū zhà, ā ruò mì zhà wū dū zhà, jù qí zhà bō lài dì zhà, yē wēi ruò zhà, jù luó dì zhà, qí mó zhà sà pó hē.\n\nThe Nine Celestial Bodies of the Northern Dipper:\nThe Northern Dipper is the primordial spirit of Heaven and Earth, the *Life Destiny* of gods and humans. The number nine represents the *Dao* of *Qian*, the embodiment of *yang*, perpetually generating without cessation. The term *celestial body* denotes the lord of all stars and the convergence of all phenomena. Thus, the Dipper resides in the north, with two stars concealed and seven visible, forming nine positions—corresponding to the nine orifices of the human body.\n\nThe Great Spirit of the Central Heaven:\n*Central* signifies neither high nor low, and also denotes the multitude. *Heaven* refers to the *wuwei* and the *wuji*. *Great* signifies the most revered and exalted. *Spirit* denotes numinosity, luminosity, and uprightness without deviation. It also means *to extend*, rectifying the path between Heaven above and Earth below. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies of the Northern Dipper* reside within the *Central Heaven*, serving as the revered, numinous, luminous, upright, and great true spirits of all celestial phenomena. This mirrors the human heart, which resides at the center, with the *Original Spirit* as the master of the entire body.\n\nAscending to Pay Homage at the Golden Portal:\n*Ascending to pay homage* means to visit and gaze in reverence. The *Golden Portal* is the true realm of the *Jade Thearch*, transformed by the *qi* of the *Three Clarities*. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies* are the confidants of the *Three Clarities* and the *Jade Thearch*. Those who frequently pay homage fulfill the *Dao* of repaying the source. Likewise, if one can elevate the heart’s spirit into the *Mud Pill Palace*, the true numen shall not scatter, and longevity shall be attained.\n\nDescending to Cover Kunlun:\n*Kunlun* is the name of the earth that sustains the world, the transformative *qi* that generates all things. Thus, the *Nine Celestial Bodies* cover it day and night, bestowing the grace of ceaseless generation. Similarly, if one can descend the heart’s fire into the kidney’s water, true merit shall be achieved, and the elixir shall naturally form without delay.\n\nRegulating the Fundamental Principles:\n*Regulating* means to harmonize and also to uphold.",

      "translated_text": "**Supreme** signifies the most revered and noble. **Jade** is the ultimate treasure, impervious to the ravages of water or fire. **Thearch** is the most exalted title, the sovereign of the Three Realms and the myriad true sages. Thus, the Nine Primes embody the august majesty of the *Supreme Jade Thearch*—this is made clear. Just as one who pays homage to the true and reveres the Dipper, ceaseless in devotion, refines Water and Fire through cultivation, and coalesces spirit and *qi* into the embryonic immortal, may then serve as minister or emissary to the *Supreme Jade Thearch*.\n\n**The Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord:**\nThe *Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord* is the sovereign of the Northern Dipper and the father of all stars. Thus, the Purple Tenuity is invoked as the foremost of the Nine Primes and the Three Terraces. If one can dwell in office without deceit or envy of the law, ever loyal to the sovereign in thought, then Heaven shall naturally align with them, and no calamity shall befall.\n\n**The Great Circumference of Heaven:**\nThe mechanisms of these Seven True Lords’ movement and stillness are truly unfathomable. Each governs the fate of the wise and foolish in the world below according to their original destiny. Vast in scope, they encompass all within the heavens above and the earth below—nothing exists beyond the purview of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes. If one can restrain the Seven Emotions, then myriad virtues shall naturally arise. Should the heart be wholly devoted to the Dao, one may fully traverse the heavens and attain boundless joy and freedom.\n\n**Subtle as Microcosmic Dust:**\nThe divine power of the Seven Lords of the Dipper is unfathomable, their true subtlety beyond scrutiny. Vast, they pervade the heavens above and the earth below; minute, they penetrate the tiniest speck of dust—all can deliver humanity and perfect the true. Let none assume small acts of goodness are beneath them, for even within the hidden and the infinitesimal, the Dipper’s truth discerns all. As the scriptures say: *\"The noble person is vigilant in solitude.\"*\n\n**What Calamity Cannot Be Eradicated? What Blessing Cannot Be Attained?**\nSince the Dipper’s truth encompasses the great circumference of Heaven and penetrates the subtlest dust, evil is inevitably punished, and goodness inevitably rewarded. What calamity, then, cannot be eradicated? Once misfortune is dispelled, blessings shall surely converge. If one can remain steadfast in both seclusion and openness, heart ever reverent to the Dipper and mind ever guarding the spirit, then calamity shall not intrude, and fortune shall come of its own accord.\n\n**The Primordial August Upright *Qi* Comes to Merge with My Body:**\n*Primordial* signifies the great, the foremost of all virtues. *August* denotes reverence. *Upright* means impartial and unbiased. *Qi* is the primordial numen of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous transformation of Yin and Yang. The Nine Primes of the Northern Dipper are formed from the *Primordial August Upright Qi*. If one takes the Dipper as their heart and the Dipper as their spirit, then they shall unite with their original destiny as one, and the *Primordial August Upright Qi* shall come to merge with their body. What worry, then, of failing to attain longevity and enduring vision?\n\n**Where the Celestial Pivot Points, Day and Night Turn Without Cease:**\nThe *Celestial Pivot* is the upright *qi* of Heaven, the origin of the myriad spirits. Without the Celestial Pivot, Heaven and Earth would lack clarity in their upper and lower realms; without it, the true mechanism of the Dipper’s movement could not issue its luminous commands; without it, the myriad spirits could not attain their profound subtlety. Great indeed is the merit of the Celestial Pivot!\n\nThe character *pivot* (罡) is composed of *four* (四) and *upright* (正), signifying the Four Saints governing the four directions: *Heavenly Tenuity* resides in the East, *Heavenly Strategy* in the West, *Assisting Sage* in the South, and *Protecting Sage* in the North. At the center, the *Great Sage* wondrously directs the *Celestial Pivot Thearch Lord*. Thus, the Celestial Pivot guards the center of Heaven, taking generation as its virtue and movement as its merit. It receives the upright *qi* of East, West, South, and North—hence it is called the *Celestial Pivot*.\n\nThe Celestial Pivot guards the center and governs Earth, while the Northern Dipper belongs to Water. Earth restrains Water, enabling the Dipper to generate the myriad things. Yet it does not govern the Dipper alone: each month, the Dipper’s handle points to one direction, and thus the Five Dippers all follow the Celestial Pivot’s influence.\n\nWithin a single day, the Celestial Pivot revolves the Dipper’s handle through each of the twelve double-hours, aligning with one direction at a time, turning ceaselessly without pause—this is the principle of inexhaustible generation. As the *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: *\"The twelve gates of the Thunder Citadel follow wherever the Celestial Pivot points. When the Pivot star points to *Chou*, its body resides in *Wei*. The direction it points is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious.\"*\n\nWhy does this give rise to fortune and misfortune? It lies in the Celestial Pivot’s essence and function, which are none other than the *qi* of Yin and Yang. The upright *qi* of the Celestial Pivot can generate or destroy. Where it points becomes the direction of generation, imbued with vital *qi*. Drawing from it can cure illness, replenish deficiency, pacify the spirit, invigorate *qi*, avert misfortune, dispel calamity, prolong life, and deliver from peril. Where it dwells harbors destructive *qi*, which can be employed to slay ghosts, expel demons, subdue violence, restrain malevolence, and vanquish evil spirits. Thus, what it points to is auspicious; where it dwells is inauspicious. The virtue of the Celestial Pivot is truly not to be taken lightly, and its merit is truly not insignificant.\n\n**The Vulgar Dweller and the Petty Man Seek the Dao and Yearn for the Numinous:**\n*The Vulgar Dweller* refers to one who resides in the dusty world of the mundane. *The Petty Man* is a term for the most insignificant and lowly. This phrase expresses the humble reverence of those who recite the incantations. If one encounters these scriptural instructions, they must devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao and thereby attain the mysterious numen of their original destiny, prolonging life.\n\n**May I Behold Your August Form and Forever Preserve Longevity:**\nHaving embraced the Dao and obtained its mysterious instructions, one shall naturally behold the true form of the august presence and attain the Way of enduring life and eternal vision.\n\n**The Three Terraces’ Void Essence, the Six Pure Curves’ Generation:**\n**They Give Me Life, Nourish Me, and Guard My Form.**\nThe *Three Terraces* are the great transformations of the Central Heaven and the canopy of the Northern Dipper. The names, titles, and appearances of their true lords have been recorded in the preceding section: one is called *Heavenly Citadel*, one *Heavenly Stair*, and one *Heavenly Minister*. They are the mysterious essence of the Great Void and the true *qi* of the divine person—these Three Terraces correspond to the lung spirit and the central hub of the Three Hun in humans.\n\nIf one can recite this incantation constantly, the Seven Po shall be purified, the Three Hun shall be at peace, and true *qi* shall descend to give life, nourish, and protect, thereby attaining the immortality of the divine transcendent.",

      "translated_text": "The Lord Lao said: All people’s natures, lives, and five constituents are entirely governed by the star-officials of their original destiny. The divine generals of their original destiny and the star-officials of their natal lodge ever bestow their sheltering protection, presiding over human life to ensure the preservation of one’s Heaven-granted years. The star-official of one’s original destiny is, for example, the Star Lord Greedy Wolf for those born in the zi hour. The divine generals of one’s original destiny are, for example, the spirits of the jiazi and bingzi days. The star-officials of one’s natal lodge are, in the yang phase, the Void Lodge, and in the yin phase, the Woman Lodge.\n\nIn the beginning, the Most High commanded that the people of the world know their natures and lives are entirely dependent on the Dao for their arising. Once they have awakened to this cause, they are then to return to the true and cultivate the gate of offering, longevity, and gratitude. This chapter clarifies that the five constituents of a person are entirely governed by the star-officials of their original destiny. The five constituents are the five viscera. If a person’s five viscera are peaceful and harmonious, then the myriad evils will not invade, the hundred diseases will not enter, and they will forever preserve long life. The star-officials of their natal lodge shelter and protect their life. Knowing the body, then, ensures the five constituents are peaceful and harmonious; knowing the Dao ensures long life and enduring vision; harmonizing the nature ensures the heart of the Dao unfolds; and knowing one’s destiny ensures the preservation of one’s Heaven-granted years.\n\nYet the common people, ignorant and unknowing, pass their entire lives without awakening. The true officials of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm six times each year. The day of their descent is the limit-period of one’s original destiny. Three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound, seven thousand divine generals of the Northern Dipper, and the true officials of one’s original destiny, descending with their retinue of perfected beings, all come to surround and protect. Through this, one may eliminate calamities, repent of sins, request blessings, and extend life. According to one’s capacity, one may perform rites and offer libations, thereby increasing and exalting one’s fortune and virtue.\n\nSixty years of a person’s life constitute one great limit-period, encompassing the full span of one’s original destiny—this is the cycle of a lifetime’s renewal of the celestial stems. Sixty days constitute one small limit-period, corresponding to the six descents each year. On those days, the true lords of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm on behalf of those born under their governance, examining and recording the merits and transgressions of each person.\n\nThe messengers of the Southern Mound are the envoys of the Star Lord Breaking Army. Thus, within them, yin and yang intermingle, the Southern Dipper interlocking with the Northern Apex, the Northern Apex concealing the Southern Dipper. The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: “The Northern Dipper brings death; the Southern Dipper brings life.” This distinguishes their respective domains. Thus, in this scripture, the two characters for “Northern Dipper” are used comprehensively.\n\nThe ignorant and unenlightened common folk, indulging in evil deeds and violating prohibitions, cut short their Heaven-granted years. Their limit-periods become brief, and they die prematurely. Those of superior wisdom who cultivate the Dao accumulate merit, spread virtue, refine good deeds, and observe prohibitions, extending their Heaven-granted years. Their limit-periods become distant, their fortune and virtue increase and exalt, and they attain long life and enduring vision.\n\nWhen the limit-period of one’s original destiny approaches and one remains unaware, failing to establish vegetarian feasts or perform rites, neglecting incense and offerings, this is to treat life lightly and be deluded about one’s origin, failing to treasure the human form. The heavenly offices then seize one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to early death.\n\nThose who are deluded and erring, even when they encounter this scripture and its instructions, harbor disbelief and slander the true text. After such people die, they sink into the three wretched destinies, drifting and drowning in the various realms of existence, forever losing the human form. Deeply pitiable, they bring this suffering upon themselves.\n\nHeaven above is pure, Earth below is turbid; creation alternates between one yang and one yin. A day has its day and night; a year has its spring birth, summer growth, autumn harvest, and winter completion. Stars appear and disappear; the moon waxes and wanes. Among the constellations, the Wings and Chariot Lodges comprise twenty-two stars, while the Void and Wall Lodges contain only two. The Well Lodge spans thirty-three degrees, while the Ghost Lodge spans only four. Even the celestial patterns are not uniform. People, endowed by Heaven and Earth, the Dipper stars, yin and yang, and the five phases of creation, are born with differences in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, longevity and early death, wisdom and foolishness.\n\nYet people, failing to awaken to the fact that their allotted portions are already determined, only pursue vain desires and greedy cravings. Within their limited time, they create boundless transgressions. Each time the limit-period of their original destiny arrives, death draws nearer. They do not express gratitude for the virtue of Heaven and Earth in giving them life, nor do they feel indebted to the sheltering protection of the star-perfected. Failing to treasure their own bodies, they treat life lightly and are deluded about their origin, thereby hastening their early death.\n\nThose who are deluded and erring, upon hearing this scripture, become agitated and doubtful, refusing to believe. Even when they see others reciting it, they cannot emulate them but instead slander and malign it. After such people die, they sink into the ghostly realms, suffering bitter retributions. Only after kalpas have passed do they exhaust their punishments in hell, receiving the fruits of their transgressions. The scripture states: Those who see others holding the scripture yet cast sidelong glances, speak evil words, and slander it, or who initially accept it but later treat it with contempt—such karmic retributions are too numerous to enumerate.\n\nHow could those who cultivate the Dao dare to disrespect the words of the sages? To disrespect the scripture invites demonic afflictions; to venerate it welcomes the presence of divine sages. Having contributed no merit to the mysterious teaching, how could one dare to slander its true text? The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: “The heavenly offices record people’s merits and transgressions, not missing even the slightest fraction.” How could one not be cautious? How could one not be vigilant?\n\nIf, on the day of one’s original destiny, one performs vegetarian feasts and rites, thereby communicating with the heavenly offices, and in each lifetime during the limit-period of one’s original destiny, one recites this scripture, widely presenting offerings, then for three lives one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people. The Most High, in his compassion, provisionally establishes teachings, thus revealing the sequential gate of practice, enabling gradual attainment of the realm of flourishing life. Returning to and venerating the true lineage, such are the blessings one receives.\n\nFirst, one is commanded to recite the names, thereby eliminating transgressions. Next, one petitions the Dipper, performing rites of gratitude and reciting the scripture. Only after recognizing the true lord of one’s original destiny does one attain peace and security—this is the goodness of a single lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, reciting the names of the true lords, if one has good karmic affinities from past lives—due to the depth of one’s heart for the Dao in previous existences—this is the goodness of two lives. Now, by performing vegetarian feasts and rites, one communicates with the heavenly offices, ensuring that for three lives one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people—this is the blessing of future lives.",

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of the Original Conduct of the Jade Emperor* states: \"Transforming wisdom and intelligence to turn a woman into a man is among the thirty supreme and wondrous virtues.\" The *Sutra in Forty-Two Chapters* also says: \"To escape the evil destinies and be born as a human is difficult; having been born human, to leave the female form and become male is even more difficult.\" When worldly people cultivate and serve the Dao, attaining in three lives the constant rebirth as a man—intelligent, wealthy, and noble—this is the blessing of a conditioned existence. If one can transcend the realm of conditioned forms, ascend to the land of non-action, enter the gate of the subtle and imperceptible, and realize the Dao of emptiness and nothingness, only then may one become a preeminent man among men.\n\nSome are born with meager karmic fruits; though among humans, they are poor and lowly. Even if they know their original destiny, they lack the means to perform grand rites. Yet if they pour water or offer flowers, silently turn their thoughts toward the North Pole, bow in reverence, and recite the name of their original destiny’s true lord, they will not pass their allotted lifespan in vain. All shall have their lives extended and blessings recorded, remain bound to the human form, have disasters and calamities dispelled, and receive immeasurable fortune. The Heavenly Master rejoices, leaping with joy and bowing in homage, praising the rare encounter with this supreme Dharma bridge.\n\nAs the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one were to fill measureless asaṃkhyeya worlds with the seven treasures and offer them in charity, and if a good man or good woman were to arouse the mind of bodhi, take up this sutra, even a four-line verse, receive, uphold, recite, and expound it for others, the merit of the latter would surpass the former.\" For the seven treasures may be exhausted, but the four-line verse is inexhaustible. If one upholds this sutra and awakens to its meaning with one’s original mind, this surpasses the merit of offering the seven treasures in charity.\n\nThe wealthy may widely establish vegetarian feasts and rites, while the poor may pour water or offer flowers—both acts are of one intent, and their blessings are equal. Those who follow the Dao and perform vegetarian feasts and rites in pursuit of blessings may gain much merit, yet in awakening to the mind and seeing the nature, they gain nothing, only forming the causes of conditioned existence, like one who merely offers the seven treasures in charity. But if one knows the nature and destiny, understands the Dao and the body, and on the day of one’s original destiny, worships the Dipper and pays homage to the true, offering flowers and pouring water—not neglecting the allotted lifespan, nor seeking blessings—then the sagely and true will naturally extend one’s life and record one’s blessings. The merit of non-action surpasses the conditioned blessings of offering the seven treasures.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, moved and overjoyed, dances for joy, praising the encounter with this supreme and great Dharma bridge.\n\nLord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master again, saying: \"The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all belong to the heavenly offices. To repent sins and eliminate calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and service. When encountering the day of one’s original destiny, the life-registering day, the mid-year day, the post-horses, the shedding of the three disasters and nine calamities—these protect one’s present family and ensure their peace and security.\"\n\nThe Most High, in bestowing this teaching, speaks in profound and subtle terms, beyond the world’s comprehension. This scripture, out of compassion for sentient beings, proclaims essential Dharma to deliver the deluded. Its earnest admonitions fully express human sentiment, making it easy to understand and awaken, arousing faith and the mind to return to truth. Those who study the Dao and can cultivate according to this scripture should seek the sagely intent beyond the scripture’s words, thereby ascending to wondrous fruition and entering the lineage of immortals.\n\nFor example, how does one shed the disasters of the original destiny, post-horses, and calamities to protect one’s family and ensure their peace? The original destiny is the spirit of one’s body, and the post-horses are the spirit of one’s intent. The original spirit of a person is externally lodged in the eyes and internally stored in the heart. The eyes externally observe the myriad things, while internally the heart races through the myriad affairs. Where the heart and eyes roam, the spirit also rushes. If one can gather the mind and inwardly illuminate, preventing the \"horses\" from galloping, and preserve the form and spirit, the embryo-breath will naturally stabilize. Then the Three Corpses will leave the body, the Nine Worms will perish, and from where could calamities arise? Thus, one can protect the harmony of the six pulses and the smooth flow of the hundred spirits.\n\nWhenever superior practitioners uphold this true scripture on the day of their original destiny, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Their merit extends to the water and land, benefiting both the living and the dead. Through repentance and reverence, they gradually ascend to wondrous fruition, reestablish mysterious merit, and realize the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. Only then do they attain perfect sagely wisdom, becoming unfathomable in concealment and manifestation, moving freely between existence and non-existence, roaming the clouds, ascending through the Golden Gate, uniting with the sagely and true, transcending the Three Realms, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth, with boundless lifespan and joyous freedom.\n\nThe existence of this body depends on the existence of this spirit. When the body is at peace, the spirit is strong; when the spirit is strong, the qi is pure; when the qi is pure, it can unite with the Dao. \"Repentance and reverence\" means repenting sins; \"gradually ascending to wondrous fruition and reestablishing mysterious merit\" means reporting to the original destiny and post-horses to shed calamities, purifying the form and spirit, and naturally extending life. \"Realizing the Dao of emptiness and nothingness\" means taking the supreme and boundless Dao of the Great Void as one’s witness. \"Perfect sagely wisdom\" means the radiance of wisdom is luminous, free from harm by the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. \"Unfathomable in concealment and manifestation\" means that when one ascends to wondrous fruition and realizes the great Dao with perfect wisdom, the myriad spirits protect and escort, the qi coalesces into true mystery, and the spirit achieves the wondrous Dao. Then one enters and exits the Golden Gate, concealed or revealed in ways beyond human comprehension.\n\nAs the *Daoist Canon* states: \"The Golden Gate is not the name of the Golden Towers or Golden Courts. The Golden Towers are the residences of the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor; the Golden Courts are the abodes of the supreme sages and lofty perfected. This Golden Gate lies beneath the Azure Heaven, formed by the condensation and transformation of qi over thirty-nine thousand three hundred and fifty kalpas. When those who initially study and diligently cultivate the Dao reach the end of their heavenly years without entering the cycle of rebirth, they fly up to the Golden Gate, receiving boundless joy and freedom.\"\n\nThis chapter contains the mysterious secrets and wondrous essentials of the scripture. If all like-minded individuals can take the heart of the Emperor Above as their heart and the words of the Dao’s age as their words, they will naturally receive boundless blessings and attain perfection in this very chapter.",

Auspicious mist shall coil around the courtyard, and felicitous clouds shall hover above the eaves—what disaster shall not be extinguished, what blessing shall not be attained?\n\nThis is called *The Northern Dipper’s Natal Destiny Scripture for Prolonging Life: The Direct Essentials*, the direct path of cultivating perfection. All who attain the Dao and roam freely do so through this scripture; all who verify sageliness and achieve perfection do so through this scripture; all who escape the cycle of birth and death do so through this scripture; all who protect men and women do so through this scripture; all who preserve life and prolong years attain freedom through it. It is an eternal treasure for the body, bestowing blessings and longevity. Guard and revere it; do not show it to the unworthy.\n\nThis scripture is vast and boundless, its merits immeasurable. How could ordinary, inferior scholars easily comprehend it? Among all great scriptures, none are as essential as *The Northern Dipper Scripture*. For instance, *The Numinous Treasure* speaks only of delivering people but does not teach how to prolong life and enter the true Dao. This scripture teaches that life depends entirely on the Dao for its existence—it instructs people to cherish their original bodies, to know their natal destiny. Knowing one’s natal destiny, one naturally prolongs life; prolonging life is impossible without the Dao. Once prolonged, one may receive the deliverance of heavenly perfected and earthly sages. Without roots, how can there be fruit? This is the direct path of prolonging life through natal destiny, the mysterious gate of cultivating perfection and entering the Dao.\n\nThus, *The Numinous Treasure* is its function, while *The Northern Dipper Scripture* is its essence. Those who study the Dao should revere and uphold it. The Most High has already transmitted the scripture’s essentials in the preceding chapter, also naming this *The Northern Dipper’s Natal Destiny Scripture for Prolonging Life: The Essentials*. Fearing that those of shallow virtue might treat it lightly and fail to treasure it, He has thus admonished them.\n\nWhen one cultivates the true Dao, verifies sageliness, achieves perfection, and escapes the cycle of birth and death, the preservation of one’s heart and kidneys is complete. With heart and kidneys whole, longevity is attained freely. As for entering the Golden Gate, embracing the treasure of mysterious numina, receiving the joy of roaming freely, obtaining natural blessings, and enjoying boundless life—without the essentials of prolonging life, how could one reach such a realm?\n\nThis scripture is not withheld by the Most High out of stinginess, unwilling to make it universally accessible. If shown to those who disrespect and disbelieve, they will surely treat it with negligence, even slander it, thereby committing the sin of careless disclosure.\n\nAs the Old Lord concluded the scripture’s discourse, dragons and crane-riding celestial immortals arrived to welcome Him back to the Jade Capital. At that time, the Heavenly Master, having received the wondrous Dharma, spoke these words, vowing to propagate it and transmit it to the virtuous. Should any man or woman receive, uphold, read, and recite it, I, along with the Seven Precept Immortal Officials, shall protect them wherever they may be.\n\nThereupon, he bowed again to the Old Lord and offered this eulogy:\n\n*Where the* Northern Dipper Scripture *dwells in a household,*\n*One’s natal destiny summons true numina.*\n\nThe Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, the pivot of the celestial realm, the balance of Heaven and Earth. Without the Dipper, Heaven does not generate; without the Dipper, it does not take form; without the Dipper, it is not bright; without the Dipper, it does not move. The Dipper is the mysterious instrument of measure.\n\nHow can a household be without it? In daily use, nothing is balanced without the Dipper, nothing moves without the Dipper, nothing is bright without the Dipper, nothing is accomplished without the Dipper.\n\nWithin the human body, without the Dipper, one does not live; without the Dipper, one is not nurtured; without the Dipper, one is not protected; without the Dipper, one is not sheltered. Above the human heart are seven apertures, corresponding to the seven stars; below are two orifices, corresponding to the Assistants; and three hairs, corresponding to the Three Terraces. Thus, the Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, and within the human body, it resides in the heart. The heart is the Northern Dipper, and the Northern Dipper is the heart—just as the heart is the Buddha, and the Buddha is the heart.\n\nWhy, then, does the scripture not speak of the heart but instead say, *Where the* Northern Dipper Scripture *dwells in a household*? It is because the Most High, observing that sentient beings had no gate through which to enter the path of cultivating perfection, no sincerity with which to approach the rites of revering the Dipper, took pity and greatly expounded the mysterious numina, transmitting the scripture’s essentials to the Heavenly Master for widespread dissemination. Thus, all in the world might ascend to immortality and avoid the cycle of rebirth.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, Perfected Lord of Serene Response, embodied the sagely intent above and took the benefit of living beings as his heart. Therefore, he borrowed the metaphor of fifteen kinds of worldly benefits to eulogize it. The household is the body, the dwelling of the heart. Just as a household enshrines *The Dipper Scripture*, venerates the true form, and maintains purity and reverence, so too, if one’s heart, in the twelve hours of the day, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, never ceases to contemplate the Northern Dipper, to reverently recite and burn talismans, one will surely feel the true *qi* of one’s natal destiny’s mysterious numina descend upon the body, preserving long life.",
      "overlap_context": "y study and diligently cultivate the Dao reach the end of their heavenly years without entering the cycle of rebirth, they fly up to the Golden Gate, receiving boundless joy and freedom.\"\n\nThis chapter contains the mysterious secrets and wondrous essentials of the scripture.

If one constantly holds the Northern Dipper within body and heart, one attains purity of body and heart, and externally, the household gains peace and tranquility.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, parents are preserved in long life.\nThe primal destiny of one’s natal stars averts calamities and misfortunes, safeguarding one’s longevity. If one does not neglect cultivation and reverence, one may ensure the long life of one’s parents.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all malevolent influences turn to dust.\nWhen body and heart are pure, thoughts dwell on the true and the mind on the Dao, how could defilements fail to dissolve into dust?\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all deviance naturally returns to rectitude.\nAs the scripture states: *Kan* resides in the lower position, *Li* ranks as the sovereign above. Master and servant each keep to their place—such is the enduring Way.\nThe heart is the sovereign; when the heart is upright, all deviance is rectified.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, one’s enterprises accord with one’s wishes.\nBy revering the Perfected Lord in the morning, the karmic obstructions within the body are dispelled, and one’s endeavors naturally align with one’s intentions.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the entire family enjoys health and well-being.\nWhen all orifices remain sealed and the true *qi* permeates the primal origin, the body naturally thrives in health.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, descendants are preserved in prosperity.\nThe seed of long life must not be severed; one should nurture it to ensure its flourishing.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the five pathways are naturally unimpeded.\nThe five viscera flow freely, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, all evils are forever extinguished.\nWhen the true nature is awakened, all transgressions vanish.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, the six livestock thrive and multiply.\nWhen the six roots are tranquil, they naturally flourish.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, illnesses are cured.\nWhen spirit and essence are not depleted, all ailments are healed.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, wealth and possessions are not squandered.\nWealth and treasures are the upright *qi* of the body. If not consumed by external deviance, the primal origin remains steadfast.\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, misfortunes never arise.\nThe human body is like a sturdy house with firm walls—what harm could sudden storms or raging winds bring?\n\nWith *The Northern Dipper Scripture* in the household, one perpetually preserves *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*.\nBy perpetually safeguarding the mysterious numina, one eternally attains *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: \"Excellent, excellent! You may propagate the true teaching, bringing boundless blessings and benefits to all beings, that they may forever partake in supreme goodness.\"\nThe Heavenly Master bowed his head in reverence, receiving and vowing to practice it.\n\nWhen the Lord Lao had finished expounding the scripture and the Heavenly Master had completed his eulogies, the myriad sages rejoiced in the blessings and benefits, universally bestowed upon all ranks. The heavens celebrated, and the joy of the Dharma’s transformation spread to the ten directions. A path to longevity was opened, and a gateway to the sacred was revealed. The Most High enabled all to escape the cycle of rebirth, while the Heavenly Master disseminated the wondrous Dao through the ages.\n\nNow, Dao-Ling, without presuming upon his learning, has ventured to elucidate the mysterious text—not as fabricated words, but as the true and complete original. Dao-Ling does not seek personal supplication or acclaim; rather, he desires that those who invoke and pray may attain the mysterious efficacy. All fellow aspirants should surely revere and uphold this, thereby attaining long life and peace.\n\n*Commentary on the Most High’s Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Scripture of Natal Destiny for Extending Life, Scroll Four*\n\n**Incantation**\nAn incantation is the meaning of invoking and praying. By aligning the heart with Heaven and uniting spirit with *qi*, form and sound resonate, and the true numina are moved to respond.\n\n*\"Heavenly numina, flourishing in their nodes, may they preserve long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One, guarding its true form.\nThe spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\nHasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\nHeaven is the greatness of non-action; the numinous is that which is universally responsive. \"Heavenly numina\" signifies that humans are the most noble and spiritually endowed. The crown of the head—this single aperture—is where the hundred spirits gather. When the joints flow freely and the true *qi* flourishes, no illnesses arise, and long life may be hoped for.\n\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One is the *qi* of the Northern Dark Palace’s *Kan* abode, the true and unified *qi* of the Great Dao, the child of the Two Luminaries, and the ancestor of all things. As the *Dao De Jing* states: *\"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; humans attain the One and become numinous.\"* This is the mysterious One.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor practiced the Dao of the Three Ones. The Sovereign said: \"If you can know the One, all things are complete.\" The One is the sovereign of the body. By guarding the One, the Supreme One, the Lord Emperor, resides in the courtyard, and the thirty-six thousand spirits all remain present.\n\nThe method of guarding the One: At dusk or night, lie flat on your back, hands resting over the heart, and recite:\n*\"Heavenly numina, flourishing in their nodes, may they preserve long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One, guarding its true form.\nThe spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\nHasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*\nMen should recite it seven times; women, fourteen times. Upon completion, visualize white *qi* the size of a cartwheel surrounding the body, with red *qi* on the outside, then lie down. This brings peace to the five viscera. In minor cases, it extends life and repels evil; in major cases, it leads to immortality and ascension.\n\n*\"The spirit-lords of the five viscera, each safeguarding peace and tranquility.\"*\nAccording to the *Scripture of Inner Radiance*:\n*\"The heart’s spirit, Cinnabar Origin, is named Guardian of the Numinous;\nThe lung’s spirit, Radiant Flower, is named Void Completion;\nThe liver’s spirit, Dragon Smoke, is named Containing Brightness;\nThe kidney’s spirit, Mysterious Brightness, is named Jade Infant;\nThe spleen’s spirit, Longevity, is named Soul Court—\nAll revolve the Heavenly Scripture within the heart.\nBy contemplating them day and night, one naturally attains long life.\"*\nThis means that by visualizing the spirits of the five viscera within oneself, each safeguards peace and tranquility.\n\n*\"Hasten, hasten, as decreed by the law!\"*",

      "translated_text": "To the August Supreme Jade Emperor of the Golden Towers in the Heavenly Vaults, I, your servant, trembling with awe, prostrate and bow my head, touching the ground in reverence:\n\nI have heard that Heaven suspends the ten thousand images, all governed by the Five Dipper-stars and the Northern Apex; that the teachings of the Three Pure Ones unfold, summoning the thousand numina to audience before the Emperor. The jade pivot is the warp of yin and yang, while the Mysterious Numinous is the root and origin of nature and destiny. The scripture has endured for fifteen hundred years, yet its order has been lost and its sequence confused; the Dao has unfolded through twelve myriad kalpas, concealing its mysteries and hiding its subtleties. Without the golden sound, how could one invoke the golden sound? Without the jade decree, how could one clarify the jade decree?\n\nXu Daoling of the lineage of Xu bears a long-standing karmic affinity, having cultivated the Numinous Treasure across generations. The subtle mechanism admits not even the slightest speck of dust. In the Shu capital, the teachings were expounded, yet the essential oral instructions and secret talismans remained wanting; in the Wu commandery, the scriptures were transmitted, the Dharma-gate opened, and the true path pointed out. Previously, I presented Daoling’s exegesis; today, I humbly receive the Emperor’s proclamation of grace. I beseech that phoenix-script and dragon-writ be bestowed, and that cloud-seals be granted alongside the lunar tablets. May all people recite them, and may they be transmitted through the ages. Overwhelmed with reverence and awe, I gaze toward Heaven and long for the sagely presence with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.\n\n**Mysterious Numinous Talismanic Methods**\nThe talisman is a command and decree, capable of summoning the myriad spirits and averting all misfortunes. For those who recite the scripture and pay homage to the Dipper: purify body and mind through fasting and ablutions, adjust your robes, and sit upright. First, knock the teeth nine times to gather the nine *qi*. Then, visualize the direction pointed by the Celestial Axe, draw in the *qi*, and blow it onto the paper. To avert calamity, use white or black *qi*; to pray for blessings, use red *qi*; to sever ghosts and expel evil, use black *qi*. Once the talisman is inscribed, rise and step into the *ding*-character stance. Stand firm, trace the Dipper’s pattern with your hand, and recite the incantation of the Northern Dipper’s nine stars. Then burn it, maintaining utmost sincerity. Any disrespect will invite unavoidable misfortune. The various true talismans are recorded below.\n\n**Incense Burner-Opening Talisman**\nInscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar. Trace the *qian* trigram.\n*Function of the talisman:* First knock the teeth and concentrate the spirit. Visualize the Eastern Heavenly Gate opening, as the sun at dawn. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, blowing onto the paper. Upon completion, recite the secret incantation:\n*\"Nine Numinous, Nine Numinous, unite with my true form. Water and fire attain their positions, inner and outer become luminously clear. Swift as the celestial decree: Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen.\"*\n\n**Incense Burner-Closing Talisman**\nFor this talisman, visualize the two honorable stars of the August Emperor and the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, radiant with golden light. Draw in the *qi* and blow it onto the paper. Within the talismanic space, inscribe the three characters *Xuan*, *Yuan*, *Shi*, and trace nine revolutions of the fire-brush upward.\n\n**Precious Chapter of the August Star of the Northern Apex**\n**Precious Chapter of the August Emperor Star**",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Mystery: The Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny and Life-Prolonging True Scripture with Commentary, Scroll Five – Concluded**\n\n**Postface**\n\nThe Dao may be named, yet the Dao is not a name—constantly practice this Dao.\nA name may be spoken, yet a name is not the Dao—constantly employ this name.\n\nIn the first year of *Yongshou*, on the seventh day of the first month, the Supreme Daoist Ancestor, Lord Lao, descended upon Shu’s capital and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master Zhang the *True Scripture and Oral Instructions of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny*. Moved by compassion for the sentient beings of the vast earth who, deluded and bewildered, sink into the sea of suffering without self-awareness, forever bound in the cycle of rebirth, he thus lowered this peerless Dharma-bridge to deliver both the living and the dead. No being is untouched by its grace, and his ceaseless, life-nurturing heart—how could the sacred virtue and mysterious merit of such a one be easily described?\n\nIn my youth, I, Daoling, resolved to devote myself to this scripture. Whenever I heard a virtuous word or witnessed a virtuous deed, I inscribed it upon bamboo slips. I gathered the explications and profound elucidations of former worthies and sages, never setting them aside, studying them day by day and month by month with unwavering devotion. Only then did I realize that our Supreme Lord’s transmission of this scripture and these oral instructions to the world was no empty gesture.\n\nReverently, the Nine August Celestial Worthies of the Northern Dipper serve as the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the molders of all beings. They govern destiny and decree life and death, revolve yin and yang, establish the seasons, divide day and night, institute cold and heat, distinguish noble and base, transform the wise and the foolish, preside over fortune and misfortune, uphold the cosmic order, open the gates of release and gratitude, and point the way to cultivation and longevity. From emperors above to commoners below, all are subject to the dominion of the Seven Stars and the nurturing of the Three Terraces.\n\nSome claim this scripture’s language is shallow and its meaning flawed, unaware that the Supreme Lord intentionally framed it in the terms of daily practice, naming the Dao to awaken the ignorant and guide them wholly toward the true path. Those of superior wisdom, when they practice it in accord with their station, will naturally attain longevity—what doubt remains?\n\nDuring my official posting in Wu, I was fortunate to complete my term. In moments of leisure, I purified my thoughts and composed my mind, trimming excess and filling gaps, distinguishing meanings and arranging chapters, to slightly clarify the residual intent of the Supreme Lord’s transmission. I dared not presume to be a master of exegesis, yet when I took up my brush to face the text, it seemed as though spirits aided me, and within a month, the compilation was complete.\n\nAlas! The Dao is not distant from humanity—it is humanity that magnifies the Dao. Is this not what is meant?\n\nMy crude words and humble phrases are unworthy to proclaim even a ten-thousandth of the sagely transformation. Thus, I have respectfully drawn upon the teachings of former worthies to provide this commentary. Where it fails to align with the scripture’s purport or loses the thread of its principles, I have verified and explicated it through the Dao of daily practice as it applies to the self: when a dwelling attains peace, I annotate it as \"cultivating the body and rectifying the mind\"; when the six livestock flourish, I annotate it as \"repelling the six thieves and purifying the six senses.\" In this way, I have not strayed from the essential facts of original destiny or the key instructions for prolonging life.\n\nThe Dao may be named, and a name may be spoken of the Dao—like needle and magnet drawing together. Now that the commentary is fortunately complete and ready for carving, it must be that the sagely and true have examined and approved it. Though its literary refinement and breadth of insight may be lacking, I dared not seek out the bizarre or hunt for the extraordinary to dazzle the eyes and ears of the lofty.\n\nWith foolish sincerity, I dedicate the power of this scripture to the sacred dynasty, praying that one person’s felicity may bring boundless longevity to the realm. May the palace chambers enjoy a thousand autumns of blessing, and may the ministers and officials emulate the transformative influence of the Three Terraces. Below, I hope for abundant harvests year after year, for the people and all beings to dwell in peace and prosperity, for the deluded to ascend to the azure heavens, and for all to rejoice in the mysterious and numinous Dao. Let all fellow cultivators not dismiss these words because of the speaker but instead hold life as paramount.\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the ninth day of the ninth month in the second year of *Yuantong*, by Xu Daoling, the *Xuan Yang* Master, after bathing and burning incense, with reverent bows.",
