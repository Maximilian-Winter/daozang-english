Author unknown, approximately composed between the late Han and Wei-Jin periods. Recorded in the *Baopuzi’s* \"Far-Off Glimpses\" chapter. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture of Great Simplicity**\n\nGreat Simplicity, radiant and bright, is named the Dao.\nIn the time of Great Simplicity, spirits came to cultivate it, and the Dao thus gave it life.\nHaving given it life and form, the Dao then endowed it with destiny, and the Dao brought it to completion.\nThus, heaven and earth took shape, and the Dao and virtue became scripture.\n\nNo Dao is greater than spontaneity; no virtue is greater than longevity.\nThe Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth fill to abundance, and when full, they diminish; when diminished, they return to their root.\nThus, the One of heaven covers all without exception; the One of earth bears all without exception; the One of sun and moon illuminates all without exception.\n\nTherefore, to know the One is to be without knowledge.\nTo not unify the One is to have no knowledge of the One.\nThe Dao’s marvel lies in this: the worthy comprehend it, the sages practice it—it cannot be left unknown.\n\nThe Dao is vast yet formless, concealed yet nameless.\nThat which lies beyond heaven and earth is profound and obscure; that which lies within heaven and earth is full and flourishing.\nThus, between heaven and earth, the Dao is complete—it is not mine alone. The Dao does not desire; it is not mine to differ.\n\nIt is further said:\nLife may be hoped for; death may be feared.\nThe roots of plants and trees live, yet they die when removed from the earth.\nFish and turtles live submerged, yet they die when removed from water.\nHumans live through form, yet they die when qi departs.\nThus, the sage knows where qi resides and treasures it as the body’s essence.\n\nIt is further said:\nThe great Dao unfolds the greatest efficacy under heaven; the great scripture sets forth the greatest strategy under heaven—this is sufficient for the great person.\nWhat others cherish, I regard as peril; what others cling to, I relinquish.\nOnly the sage understands the reason for these two.\n\nIt is further said:\nGreat virtue endures the greatest adversity under heaven; the great person bears the greatest humiliation under heaven.\nOne who can endure the greatest adversity under heaven may consume the most honored emoluments under heaven;\none who can bear the greatest humiliation under heaven may become uniquely noble under heaven.\n\nIt is further said:\nThe heart in humans is like water in a vessel:\nwhen still, it is level; when disturbed, it spills; when agitated, it turns turbid; when settled, it becomes clear.\nIs governing the heart not like water?\nWhen dammed, it halts; when unobstructed, it flows; if breached to the west, it flows west; if breached to the east, it flows east.\nThe human heart cannot be left unchecked, just as water cannot be left without embankments.\n\nIt is further said:\nThus, the *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Supreme Ultimate is called the Supreme Change.\n\nThe *Taiyi* is the great dawning of change, without anything preceding it—it is called the radiant white *qi*. Then there is *Taichu*. *Chu* is the beginning of *qi*. There is *Taishi*. *Taishi* is the beginning of form. There is *Taisu*. *Taisu* is the beginning of substance. Thus it is called *Yi* (Change). Change transforms into the One; the One transforms into the Three; the Three transforms into the Five; the Five transforms into the Seven; the Seven transforms into the Nine. Nine is the ultimate. After reaching the extreme, it transforms back into the One. The One is called Heaven. Thus, the light and pure ascends to become Heaven; the heavy and turbid descends to become Earth; the harmonious *qi* in between becomes Human. Therefore, when Heaven and Earth unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born. Here ends the *Taishang Laojun Taisu Jing*.",
