  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Pure Numen Upper Scroll**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Pure Numen Upper Scroll*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. Compiled as an excerpt from *The Scripture of Great Mystery and Wondrousness*. Textual source: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Pure Numen Upper Scroll**\n\nThe *Mysterious Cinnabar Upper Scripture* of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch, the Celestial Thearch, and the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch Lord was first transmitted by the Great Lord of the Azure Youth.\n\nIn former times, the Three Lords—the Heavenly Thearch Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Thearch Lord, and the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch Lord—received the *Mysterious Cinnabar Upper Scripture* from the Supreme Dao Lord. Through cultivation and attainment of the Dao, they ascended to supplement the perfected ones of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascent into the empyrean, the Heavenly Thearch Lord transmitted the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Supreme Heavenly Thearch Lord transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen; and the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch Lord transmitted it to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portals. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Portals then transmitted it to the Prime Minister, the Lord of the Azure Youth, who in turn transmitted it to Master Juan.\n\nThis scripture is the *Pure Numen Upper Scroll*. Its Dao is lofty and wondrous, not something that middling immortals may hear. Only those whose names are inscribed on vermilion tablets with green characters of the Great Ultimate may encounter and behold the *Mysterious Cinnabar Upper Scripture*.\n\nIf a Daoist fully cultivates the *Three Perfected Ones of the Supreme* scriptures, their rank shall be that of the supreme duke and high minister above emperors and kings. If one’s encounter and reception are partial, and their hearing of the Dao limited, their rank shall be that of a king in the Lesser Numina Palaces, a minister of the Divine Continent, or a grand master of the Great Ultimate’s middle or lower ranks. Even so, they may ride dragons and drive clouds, mount the flying void, be escorted by divine attendants, and scatter their radiance to the eight directions.\n\nSubtle and profoundly mysterious, it is not to be lightly disclosed. The titles of these scriptures emerge from the *Eight Pure Scrolls of the Supreme’s Hidden Writings*, governed by the protocols of reverence and restraint.\n\nThe Three Ones of the Mud-Pill Heavenly Thearch are the spiritual essence of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the wellspring of fluids and humors, and the jade chamber of the ethereal soul. Thus, the stomach’s reservoir is square to receive things, while the brain’s palace is round and empty to accommodate the true. Myriad hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit mist, virtue fills heaven and earth, and all merges with the Great Mystery. Hence, it is called the Mud-Pill: the spirit above the corporeal form.\n\nThose who merely know how to swallow saliva and inhale qi, to click their teeth and absorb fluids, yet do not understand their origin, grasp only the overflow of the Mud-Pill and the peripheral branches of the brain’s palace. Now, I shall instruct you in the secret method of aiding and abiding in the One, enabling you to become a perfected one among the upper immortals.\n\nDisciples who receive this scripture must purify themselves for forty-five days before transmission. Use forty bolts of azure silk, five luminous mirrors of red clarity, and three pairs of golden rings as the covenant of the Cavernous One. Do not disclose it; swear a solemn oath.\n\nOne *cun* above the space between the eyebrows is the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward is the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward is the Cinnabar Field. Directly upward, one *cun* square is the Mysterious Cinnabar, the palace of the ethereal soul within the brain’s Mud-Pill.\n\nWithin the Hall of Light, to the left resides the Perfected Lord of Luminous Youth, to the right the Perfected Lady of Luminous Maidenhood, and at the center the Perfected Lord of the Luminous Mirror. The Perfected Lord of Luminous Youth is named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Azure. The Perfected Lady of Luminous Maidenhood is named Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Primordial. The Perfected Lord of the Luminous Mirror is named Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Clarity. These three lords jointly govern the Hall of Light, all clad in green brocade robes, girdled with four jade bells, their mouths holding jade mirrors—both mirrors and bells made of red jade. Their heads resemble those of infants, as does their form. They sit facing outward or toward one another.\n\nThis is the Dao of the Hall of Light, practiced by immortals and cultivated through virtue and power. If a Daoist feels fear, they should visualize the three spirits, causing the jade bells to chime. The sound reaches the Great Ultimate, and the mirrors emit red light for ten thousand *zhang*. Once the visualization is complete, call out the names of the three lords thrice, and strike the celestial drum nine times. Then, a thousand demons will submit, and ten thousand ghosts will vanish.\n\nIf a Daoist is hungry or thirsty, they should visualize the three lords, who will exhale red qi to fill their mouth. Inhaling and swallowing it will sate them in an instant. If a Daoist travels at night and cannot see the path, they should visualize the three lords, who will emit three flames from their mouths to illuminate the way, making the road bright and clear.\n\nIf one encounters perilous terrain, danger, or a place of weapons and crisis, they should swiftly visualize the three lords, causing the jade bells to chime. Concentrating intently, the enemy will naturally be struck with terror and awe, no longer harboring malicious or hostile intent.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life, avoid death, or be rescued from illness and distress, they should lie calmly and visualize the three lords of the Hall of Light, all kneeling outward. The lords exhale red qi, which first envelops the body, then surrounds the mouth. The Daoist should inhale and swallow the red qi repeatedly, closing their eyes to gently ingest it. Soon, the red qi will coil around the body, transforming into fire. The fire entwines the body, merging with it into one. Inside and out, all becomes radiant light. After a long while, cease the practice—this is called *Refining the Form with Sun and Moon*, reviving the dead. Performing this regularly before sleep ensures longevity and immortality.\n\nThose who frequently visualize and swallow red qi will regain youthful complexions, their faces like those of children. This is the Dao of immortality, practiced by immortals, the essential method of the Hall of Light.\n\nUpon rising each morning, swallow saliva thirty times, and use your hands to wipe your face and massage your eyes as a daily practice. Visualize the saliva as red fluid.\n\nWithin the Cavern Chamber reside three perfected lords: to the left, the Lad of Non-Duality; to the right, the Lord of White Primordial; and at the center, the Yellow Elder Lord. These three perfected ones jointly govern the Cavern Chamber—this is the Dao of Flying Perfection, detailed in separate scriptures.\n\nWithin the Cinnabar Field resides the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, the Thearch Lord. Together with his three ministers, they govern the Cinnabar Field, guarding the Dao of the Three Primordial Ones.\n\nThis is the essential path of the Earthly Perfected, the thoroughfare for riding the dragon carriage. The Heavenly Perfected often delight in becoming Earthly Perfected Ones, who withdraw from official positions, free from the toils and dissipations of court banquets. Thus, they move with ease and follow their inclinations, roaming as they please, striking the seven chariots to ascend, and pacing the four *qi* within the Great Primordial. Though the Heavenly and Earthly Perfected differ slightly in rank, they are equally of the One Perfected. Each Earthly Perfected abides in their proper place and no longer aspires to the offices of the Cloud Palace.\n\nWithin the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace resides the Mud-Pill Palace’s Supreme Unity Perfected Lord. One *cun* behind the Cinnabar Field lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the true spirits are governed by separate scriptures—this is the domain of the Controller of Destiny. Its Way is most exalted; only after swearing oaths with pearls and silk may it be transmitted. This is passed down once every three hundred years, and transmission ceases after five recipients. No further dissemination is permitted—this is the Way of the Supreme Ultimate’s Ministers and the Controller of Destiny.\n\nThe human head contains nine palaces; let us first speak of them. Above the space between the eyebrows lies the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber, which together form a one-*cun* guardian space within, flanking the ears. To the left of this guardian space stands the Crimson Terrace, and to the right, the Yellow Gate. The Perfected Ones of the nine palaces all enter and exit through the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace, which is why the terrace and gate are placed to either side. The terrace and gate serve to observe extraordinary signs and welcome the comings and goings of the Perfected Ones.\n\nThe great spirit of the Purple Portal is named Tranquil Peace, styled Dharma King. The great spirit of the Azure Chamber is named Upright Heart, styled Primordial Square. Both take the form of infants, each clad in robes matching the color of their respective chamber or portal, and each holds a flowing golden bell.\n\nThe guardian space, set three *fen* inward, is called the *cun*-Guardian. When retiring at night or engaging in visualization, first visualize the two great spirits as if they appear before your eyes. Then call their names thrice, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Purple Portal, Azure Chamber,\nTwo great spirits stand therein,\nHands that hold the flowing bells,\nBodies wreathed in wind and cloud.\nFlanking guard the true Dao’s path,\nBarring all that lies without.\nGrant my thoughts swift resonance,\nSmooth the passage of the numinous gate.\nMay my exits and entries be upright and free,\nAscending the nine portals to meet the nine Perfected,\nThe Most High’s exalted ones.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chamber, the nine Perfected, and all essential methods.\n\nThe two great spirits of the *cun*-Guardian only permit the passage of the Perfected Officers within the nine palaces. From the Emperor’s trustworthy decrees to the Jade Lads and Numinous Perfected, the worthies and immortals who come to the imperial chariot are allowed entry. All others who are not true are barred by these two great spirits.\n\nThis is the law and measure of the Central Yellow Supreme Unity. Thereupon, the Infant Thearch Lord commands the two ear spirits, Lovely Maiden and Cloud Ornament, to guide and usher them in. Thus, when one perceives ringing in the ears, it is an external spirit seeking entry. Depending on whether the visitor is auspicious or inauspicious, Cloud Ornament strikes the chime and bell to alert the nine palaces, warning of an outsider’s approach so that vigilance may be maintained. The chime and bell are the sounds one hears as ringing in the ears.\n\nUpon hearing this, cross your hands to cover your ears and recite the prayer:\n\n*\"The Red Child abides in the palace,\nThe nine Perfected dwell in the chambers.\nHearken to the divine command,\nDiscern the inauspicious.\nThe Supreme Unity’s flowing fire\nSubdues the myriad ills.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, clap your hands over your ears seven times. If you then feel warmth in your face, it is a favorable sign. If you sense a chill spreading across your head, it indicates the entry of malign *qi*. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, who hurls the flowing fire bell to expel the malign *qi* from your ears. The firelight follows behind, blazing brightly to illuminate your entire body. After a long while, equilibrium is restored.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sound of rushing water or thunderous drumming in your ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion and internal depletion, the heart’s storehouse severely debilitated. Unable to refine the true essence and infuse life, dissipation and disorder prevail, causing the six palaces to lose their alignment and the hun and po souls to wail in sorrow—this foreshadows the onset of illness and the approach of death. Thus, the Mud-Pill Palace’s methods falter, the nine palaces lose their regularity, sorrow and disturbance arise in confusion, the drumming sounds in disarray, and the spirits seek to abandon their dwelling and forsake the body. Upon hearing this, concentrate your mind on the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord and return your focus entirely to the One. If your transgressions are not yet grave, you may still heed the warning and reform.\n\nIf you experience deafness, it is because the ear spirits have departed. The ears are the hearing gates of the Thearch Lord. The eyes are the sun and moon of the Supreme Unity. The nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primordials. The mouth is the Crimson Palace’s vermilion abyss. The eyebrows are the flowering canopy of the White Primordial. The hair is the radiant essence of the Hall of Light. The tongue is the dragon carriage of the Lad of Non-Duality. The teeth are the mighty power of the Stomach Palace. The hands are the external allies of the Gallbladder Spirit. The feet are the numinous gates of the Kidney Primordial. The utmost yin is the true mechanism of the Cavern Chamber.\n\nThe hundred spirits of the body each have their proper affiliations; one cannot afford to be unaware or careless. If you suddenly hear the sounds of gold and jade in your ears, it signifies the arrival of true *qi* and the imminent fruition of the Dao. If you hear the strains of stringed music, it means the Six Ding Jade Maidens have come to protect you—this too portends the Dao’s fulfillment. You should withdraw into seclusion, focus on your practice, and cultivate diligence with even greater resolve than before. Through this, the Perfected One gradually begins to manifest in visible form. Unless your master instructs otherwise, do not speak of this to others.\n\nIf you hear the sounds of flutes and horns in your ears, it is an auspicious omen heralding the arrival of nobility. If you hear cries, shouts, or wailing, it is an inauspicious omen foretelling the approach of misfortune. If you perceive foul odors, it signifies the presence of impurity or uncleanness—a sign of insufficient purity. Thus, the foul odor serves as a warning; you should immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep your bedchamber in response. This is the Thearch Lord’s way of admonishing and exhorting you. If you perceive fragrant aromas, it means divine officers, numinous beings, or immortals are at your side, observing your state.\n\nAt such times, you should perform all manner of good deeds: practice virtue and kindness, relieve the destitute, spread hidden merits, and extend benevolence. The divine officers and numinous beings will then report your conduct to the Most High, informing the Dao of your goodness or its absence.\n\nThe subtleties of the Dao are not to be overlooked, for all such signs are of this nature. If you perceive fragrant *qi*, do not speak of it to others unless your master instructs otherwise. If you perceive foul *qi*, you should disclose it, for it reveals the transgression of omens and the defilement of impurity. Should you smell the *qi* of blood or unexpectedly encounter pools of blood, it portends military strife. Flee at once to the mortal realm, seek refuge with the Three Primordial Thearch Lords, and observe a three-month retreat in seclusion—thus may the calamity be averted. All these are the Thearch Lord’s way of forewarning mortals of fortune and misfortune, urging vigilance and caution.\n\nWhen you perceive inauspicious omens, you must practice hidden virtues, extend kindness and relief, and perform deeds beyond the capacity of others—only then may you escape the fate of certain death. Take heed and abide by these principles, maintaining constancy in all things.\n\nAbove the space between the eyebrows, three *fen* inward lies the *Shuangtian* of the *Cun* Guard; one *cun* inward lies the *Mingtang* Palace; two *cun* inward lies the *Dongfang* Palace; three *cun* inward lies the *Dantian* Palace; four *cun* inward lies the *Liuzhu* Palace; and five *cun* inward lies the *Yudi* Palace. One *cun* above the *Mingtang* is the *Tiangting* Palace; one *cun* above the *Dongfang* is the *Jizhen* Palace; one *cun* above the *Dantian* is the *Xuandan* Palace; and one *cun* above the *Liuzhu* is the *Taihuang* Palace. In all, there are nine palaces within the head.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Mingtang*, *Dongfang*, *Dantian*, and *Liuzhu*—the four palaces—are the Way by which divine immortals become Perfected Ones, a transmission of the Dao to the world. The *Xuandan* scripture is also the essential teaching of the Perfected Officers and the Controller of Destinies, presiding over the four palaces. This scripture may only be conferred when the Supreme Ultimate Thearch Lord grants permission; it is then bestowed upon the disciple.\n\nThose who unite the Way of the five palaces and practice it in the world, if their true name is recorded, shall encounter it. Without the destined bone and fate, one will not hear of these teachings. There is also the *Yudi* Palace, where the Divine Mother of Jade Purity resides; the *Tiangting* Palace, where the Perfected Maiden of Highest Purity dwells; the *Jizhen* Palace, where the Consort of the Supreme Ultimate Thearch resides; and the *Taihuang* Palace, where the Queen of the Most High Lord abides. These four palaces are the abodes of the Feminine Perfected Unity, whose Dao surpasses that of the Masculine Perfected Unity.\n\nEach palace possesses its sacred scriptures, transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not yet achieved Perfection are unworthy to hear of them. The essentials of the Feminine Perfection are likewise not conferred lightly. The reason the Most High emerges amidst the Eight Radiant Scenes, enters the Jasper Terrace, is attended by three thousand Jade Maidens who serve the Perfected and steady the chariot, with divine consorts singing in harmony and spirit queens holding towels, is precisely to uphold the Way of the Feminine Unity and convene the sublime assembly of the Mystic Dawn. This is the root and lineage of the Most High, transmitted by the Sovereign of the Void.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Dao find their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the nine palaces likewise leave their palaces vacant—not merely the four palaces of the Feminine Perfection. Within the *Dantian* Palace, the Thearch Lord is ever present; within the *Cun* Guard, mighty spirits reside. Without cultivation, they remain unseen in their palaces. Those who cultivate become immortals; those who do not meet their end in due time.\n\nThe Way of the Masculine and Feminine Unity may be cultivated by both men and women, for it is universally accessible. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance may its benefits be attained.\n\nTo guard the Way of the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Elixir: at dusk, retire in stillness, banish all distracting thoughts, and sit or recline as you wish. First, visualize the purple *qi* descending from the Northern Culmen star, entering the *Xuandan* Palace until it fills the chamber, overflowing beyond the body and permeating both within and without, merging with the purple *qi* as one. When this is complete, visualize the sun entering the *Xuandan* Palace, filling it so that it rests at the center of the purple *qi*, appearing like a fiery pearl seen in darkness.\n\nThen, visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Central Yellow descending from the purple *qi* of the Northern Culmen, entering the *Xuandan* Palace to take his seat. His name is *Guiying*, styled *Huaxuan*, and his attire and countenance are as described above. Next, visualize your own body suddenly ascending into the *Xuandan* Palace, sitting before the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord in whatever attire you wish. Bow in reverence, prostrate yourself before him, and inquire of the Way, seeking divine immortality and longevity—speak as your heart desires.\n\nThen, visualize swallowing the purple *qi* thirty times, followed by swallowing saliva thirty times. Next, visualize a crimson *qi* within the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight into the *Xuandan* Palace. Thereupon, both the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord and yourself mount the sun and travel along the path of the crimson *qi*, ascending directly to the *Kui* of the Northern Dipper, where you rest for a long while. Through this meditation, true responses will manifest. After fourteen years of practice, you will wander with the Supreme Unity and together reach the Web of the Seven Primordials. After sixteen years, you will ascend to the Palace of Highest Purity, receive scriptures and talismans, and command eighteen Jade Lads and eighteen Jade Maidens.\n\nPerform this visualization each night without fail. It may also be practiced exclusively, without the need to guard the Three Ones. Combining practices accelerates the refinement of essence and hastens spiritual resonance.\n\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord in the *Xuandan* Palace facing outward and exhaling green *qi* into your mouth. Swallow it fifty times, then swallow saliva fifty times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Perfected Sovereign, Central Yellow Purple Lord, whose name is* Guiying*, styled* Huaxuan*, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, adorned with purple embroidered robes, girded with a belt bearing tinkling fire-bells to sever evil and destroy treachery, holding the essence of stars, his head crowned with the sun’s perfection. As he sits upright and exhales* qi*, I swallow it, converse with him, and feast in the* Xuandan*. He refines my seven po, harmonizes my three hun, and divine spirits guard and protect me, enabling my ascent as an immortal. My five viscera regenerate, my youthful countenance returns, I receive scriptures in the Highest Purity, and the Thearch Lord of Destiny grants my wishes. May all my desires be fulfilled, and may a hundred blessings renew.\"*\n\nUpon completion, visualize yourself ascending into the palace to rest before the Supreme One. As you draw in *qi* and sleep, you shall dream of wondrous responses. Through repeated practice, a path to encountering the divine gradually unfolds.\n\nThe *Dragon Script of the Supreme* states: *\"Sit upright in the Mysterious Cinnabar, neither slanted nor deviant\"*—such is the essence of this Way. You must constantly visualize the Supreme One’s purple *qi* encircling your body and swallow it. You must also constantly visualize the Supreme Perfected Sovereign dwelling within the Mysterious Cinnabar. Thus shall you attain boundless longevity, and no misfortune shall assail you. Here ends the Way of the Mysterious Cinnabar.\n\n*The Upper Scripture of the Plain and Numinous of the Highest Purity concludes.*",

Directly upward, one *cun* square is the Mysterious Cinnabar, the palace of the ethereal soul within the brain’s Mud-Pill.\n\nWithin the Hall of Light, to the left resides the Perfected Lord of Luminous Youth, to the right the Perfected Lady of Luminous Maidenhood, and at the center the Perfected Lord of the Luminous Mirror. The Perfected Lord of Luminous Youth is named Mysterious Yang, styled Lesser Azure. The Perfected Lady of Luminous Maidenhood is named Subtle Yin, styled Lesser Primordial.

Concentrating intently, the enemy will naturally be struck with terror and awe, no longer harboring malicious or hostile intent.\n\nIf a Daoist seeks to prolong life, avoid death, or be rescued from illness and distress, they should lie calmly and visualize the three lords of the Hall of Light, all kneeling outward. The lords exhale red qi, which first envelops the body, then surrounds the mouth. The Daoist should inhale and swallow the red qi repeatedly, closing their eyes to gently ingest it. Soon, the red qi will coil around the body, transforming into fire. The fire entwines the body, merging with it into one. Inside and out, all becomes radiant light. After a long while, cease the practice—this is called *Refining the Form with Sun and Moon*, reviving the dead. Performing this regularly before sleep ensures longevity and immortality.\n\nThose who frequently visualize and swallow red qi will regain youthful complexions, their faces like those of children. This is the Dao of immortality, practiced by immortals, the essential method of the Hall of Light.\n\nUpon rising each morning, swallow saliva thirty times, and use your hands to wipe your face and massage your eyes as a daily practice. Visualize the saliva as red fluid.\n\nWithin the Cavern Chamber reside three perfected lords: to the left, the Lad of Non-Duality; to the right, the Lord of White Primordial; and at the center, the Yellow Elder Lord. These three perfected ones jointly govern the Cavern Chamber—this is the Dao of Flying Perfection, detailed in separate scriptures.\n\nWithin the Cinnabar Field resides the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, the Thearch Lord. Together with his three ministers, they govern the Cinnabar Field, guarding the Dao of the Three Primordial Ones.",

      "translated_text": "This is the essential path of the Earthly Perfected, the thoroughfare for riding the dragon carriage. The Heavenly Perfected often delight in becoming Earthly Perfected Ones, who withdraw from official positions, free from the toils and dissipations of court banquets. Thus, they move with ease and follow their inclinations, roaming as they please, striking the seven chariots to ascend, and pacing the four *qi* within the Great Primordial. Though the Heavenly and Earthly Perfected differ slightly in rank, they are equally of the One Perfected. Each Earthly Perfected abides in their proper place and no longer aspires to the offices of the Cloud Palace.\n\nWithin the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace resides the Mud-Pill Palace’s Supreme Unity Perfected Lord. One *cun* behind the Cinnabar Field lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the true spirits are governed by separate scriptures—this is the domain of the Controller of Destiny. Its Way is most exalted; only after swearing oaths with pearls and silk may it be transmitted. This is passed down once every three hundred years, and transmission ceases after five recipients. No further dissemination is permitted—this is the Way of the Supreme Ultimate’s Ministers and the Controller of Destiny.\n\nThe human head contains nine palaces; let us first speak of them. Above the space between the eyebrows lies the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber, which together form a one-*cun* guardian space within, flanking the ears. To the left of this guardian space stands the Crimson Terrace, and to the right, the Yellow Gate. The Perfected Ones of the nine palaces all enter and exit through the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace, which is why the terrace and gate are placed to either side. The terrace and gate serve to observe extraordinary signs and welcome the comings and goings of the Perfected Ones.\n\nThe great spirit of the Purple Portal is named Tranquil Peace, styled Dharma King. The great spirit of the Azure Chamber is named Upright Heart, styled Primordial Square. Both take the form of infants, each clad in robes matching the color of their respective chamber or portal, and each holds a flowing golden bell.\n\nThe guardian space, set three *fen* inward, is called the *cun*-Guardian. When retiring at night or engaging in visualization, first visualize the two great spirits as if they appear before your eyes. Then call their names thrice, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Purple Portal, Azure Chamber,\nTwo great spirits stand therein,\nHands that hold the flowing bells,\nBodies wreathed in wind and cloud.\nFlanking guard the true Dao’s path,\nBarring all that lies without.\nGrant my thoughts swift resonance,\nSmooth the passage of the numinous gate.\nMay my exits and entries be upright and free,\nAscending the nine portals to meet the nine Perfected,\nThe Most High’s exalted ones.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the Cavern Chamber, the nine Perfected, and all essential methods.\n\nThe two great spirits of the *cun*-Guardian only permit the passage of the Perfected Officers within the nine palaces. From the Emperor’s trustworthy decrees to the Jade Lads and Numinous Perfected, the worthies and immortals who come to the imperial chariot are allowed entry. All others who are not true are barred by these two great spirits.\n\nThis is the law and measure of the Central Yellow Supreme Unity. Thereupon, the Infant Thearch Lord commands the two ear spirits, Lovely Maiden and Cloud Ornament, to guide and usher them in. Thus, when one perceives ringing in the ears, it is an external spirit seeking entry. Depending on whether the visitor is auspicious or inauspicious, Cloud Ornament strikes the chime and bell to alert the nine palaces, warning of an outsider’s approach so that vigilance may be maintained. The chime and bell are the sounds one hears as ringing in the ears.\n\nUpon hearing this, cross your hands to cover your ears and recite the prayer:\n\n*\"The Red Child abides in the palace,\nThe nine Perfected dwell in the chambers.\nHearken to the divine command,\nDiscern the inauspicious.\nThe Supreme Unity’s flowing fire\nSubdues the myriad ills.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, clap your hands over your ears seven times. If you then feel warmth in your face, it is a favorable sign. If you sense a chill spreading across your head, it indicates the entry of malign *qi*. Immediately lie down, close your eyes, and visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, who hurls the flowing fire bell to expel the malign *qi* from your ears. The firelight follows behind, blazing brightly to illuminate your entire body. After a long while, equilibrium is restored.\n\nIf you suddenly hear the sound of rushing water or thunderous drumming in your ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion and internal depletion, the heart’s storehouse severely debilitated. Unable to refine the true essence and infuse life, dissipation and disorder prevail, causing the six palaces to lose their alignment and the hun and po souls to wail in sorrow—this foreshadows the onset of illness and the approach of death. Thus, the Mud-Pill Palace’s methods falter, the nine palaces lose their regularity, sorrow and disturbance arise in confusion, the drumming sounds in disarray, and the spirits seek to abandon their dwelling and forsake the body. Upon hearing this, concentrate your mind on the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord and return your focus entirely to the One. If your transgressions are not yet grave, you may still heed the warning and reform.\n\nIf you experience deafness, it is because the ear spirits have departed. The ears are the hearing gates of the Thearch Lord. The eyes are the sun and moon of the Supreme Unity. The nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primordials. The mouth is the Crimson Palace’s vermilion abyss. The eyebrows are the flowering canopy of the White Primordial. The hair is the radiant essence of the Hall of Light. The tongue is the dragon carriage of the Lad of Non-Duality. The teeth are the mighty power of the Stomach Palace. The hands are the external allies of the Gallbladder Spirit. The feet are the numinous gates of the Kidney Primordial. The utmost yin is the true mechanism of the Cavern Chamber.\n\nThe hundred spirits of the body each have their proper affiliations; one cannot afford to be unaware or careless. If you suddenly hear the sounds of gold and jade in your ears, it signifies the arrival of true *qi* and the imminent fruition of the Dao. If you hear the strains of stringed music, it means the Six Ding Jade Maidens have come to protect you—this too portends the Dao’s fulfillment. You should withdraw into seclusion, focus on your practice, and cultivate diligence with even greater resolve than before. Through this, the Perfected One gradually begins to manifest in visible form. Unless your master instructs otherwise, do not speak of this to others.\n\nIf you hear the sounds of flutes and horns in your ears, it is an auspicious omen heralding the arrival of nobility. If you hear cries, shouts, or wailing, it is an inauspicious omen foretelling the approach of misfortune. If you perceive foul odors, it signifies the presence of impurity or uncleanness—a sign of insufficient purity. Thus, the foul odor serves as a warning; you should immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep your bedchamber in response. This is the Thearch Lord’s way of admonishing and exhorting you. If you perceive fragrant aromas, it means divine officers, numinous beings, or immortals are at your side, observing your state.",

      "translated_text": "At such times, you should perform all manner of good deeds: practice virtue and kindness, relieve the destitute, spread hidden merits, and extend benevolence. The divine officers and numinous beings will then report your conduct to the Most High, informing the Dao of your goodness or its absence.\n\nThe subtleties of the Dao are not to be overlooked, for all such signs are of this nature. If you perceive fragrant *qi*, do not speak of it to others unless your master instructs otherwise. If you perceive foul *qi*, you should disclose it, for it reveals the transgression of omens and the defilement of impurity. Should you smell the *qi* of blood or unexpectedly encounter pools of blood, it portends military strife. Flee at once to the mortal realm, seek refuge with the Three Primordial Thearch Lords, and observe a three-month retreat in seclusion—thus may the calamity be averted. All these are the Thearch Lord’s way of forewarning mortals of fortune and misfortune, urging vigilance and caution.\n\nWhen you perceive inauspicious omens, you must practice hidden virtues, extend kindness and relief, and perform deeds beyond the capacity of others—only then may you escape the fate of certain death. Take heed and abide by these principles, maintaining constancy in all things.\n\nAbove the space between the eyebrows, three *fen* inward lies the *Shuangtian* of the *Cun* Guard; one *cun* inward lies the *Mingtang* Palace; two *cun* inward lies the *Dongfang* Palace; three *cun* inward lies the *Dantian* Palace; four *cun* inward lies the *Liuzhu* Palace; and five *cun* inward lies the *Yudi* Palace. One *cun* above the *Mingtang* is the *Tiangting* Palace; one *cun* above the *Dongfang* is the *Jizhen* Palace; one *cun* above the *Dantian* is the *Xuandan* Palace; and one *cun* above the *Liuzhu* is the *Taihuang* Palace. In all, there are nine palaces within the head.\n\nThe scriptures of the *Mingtang*, *Dongfang*, *Dantian*, and *Liuzhu*—the four palaces—are the Way by which divine immortals become Perfected Ones, a transmission of the Dao to the world. The *Xuandan* scripture is also the essential teaching of the Perfected Officers and the Controller of Destinies, presiding over the four palaces. This scripture may only be conferred when the Supreme Ultimate Thearch Lord grants permission; it is then bestowed upon the disciple.\n\nThose who unite the Way of the five palaces and practice it in the world, if their true name is recorded, shall encounter it. Without the destined bone and fate, one will not hear of these teachings. There is also the *Yudi* Palace, where the Divine Mother of Jade Purity resides; the *Tiangting* Palace, where the Perfected Maiden of Highest Purity dwells; the *Jizhen* Palace, where the Consort of the Supreme Ultimate Thearch resides; and the *Taihuang* Palace, where the Queen of the Most High Lord abides. These four palaces are the abodes of the Feminine Perfected Unity, whose Dao surpasses that of the Masculine Perfected Unity.\n\nEach palace possesses its sacred scriptures, transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not yet achieved Perfection are unworthy to hear of them. The essentials of the Feminine Perfection are likewise not conferred lightly. The reason the Most High emerges amidst the Eight Radiant Scenes, enters the Jasper Terrace, is attended by three thousand Jade Maidens who serve the Perfected and steady the chariot, with divine consorts singing in harmony and spirit queens holding towels, is precisely to uphold the Way of the Feminine Unity and convene the sublime assembly of the Mystic Dawn. This is the root and lineage of the Most High, transmitted by the Sovereign of the Void.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people, but those who do not cultivate this Dao find their palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the nine palaces likewise leave their palaces vacant—not merely the four palaces of the Feminine Perfection. Within the *Dantian* Palace, the Thearch Lord is ever present; within the *Cun* Guard, mighty spirits reside. Without cultivation, they remain unseen in their palaces. Those who cultivate become immortals; those who do not meet their end in due time.\n\nThe Way of the Masculine and Feminine Unity may be cultivated by both men and women, for it is universally accessible. Only through utmost dedication and perseverance may its benefits be attained.\n\nTo guard the Way of the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Elixir: at dusk, retire in stillness, banish all distracting thoughts, and sit or recline as you wish. First, visualize the purple *qi* descending from the Northern Culmen star, entering the *Xuandan* Palace until it fills the chamber, overflowing beyond the body and permeating both within and without, merging with the purple *qi* as one. When this is complete, visualize the sun entering the *Xuandan* Palace, filling it so that it rests at the center of the purple *qi*, appearing like a fiery pearl seen in darkness.\n\nThen, visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Central Yellow descending from the purple *qi* of the Northern Culmen, entering the *Xuandan* Palace to take his seat. His name is *Guiying*, styled *Huaxuan*, and his attire and countenance are as described above. Next, visualize your own body suddenly ascending into the *Xuandan* Palace, sitting before the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord in whatever attire you wish. Bow in reverence, prostrate yourself before him, and inquire of the Way, seeking divine immortality and longevity—speak as your heart desires.\n\nThen, visualize swallowing the purple *qi* thirty times, followed by swallowing saliva thirty times. Next, visualize a crimson *qi* within the Northern Dipper, as thick as a bowstring, descending straight into the *Xuandan* Palace. Thereupon, both the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord and yourself mount the sun and travel along the path of the crimson *qi*, ascending directly to the *Kui* of the Northern Dipper, where you rest for a long while. Through this meditation, true responses will manifest. After fourteen years of practice, you will wander with the Supreme Unity and together reach the Web of the Seven Primordials. After sixteen years, you will ascend to the Palace of Highest Purity, receive scriptures and talismans, and command eighteen Jade Lads and eighteen Jade Maidens.\n\nPerform this visualization each night without fail. It may also be practiced exclusively, without the need to guard the Three Ones. Combining practices accelerates the refinement of essence and hastens spiritual resonance.\n\nOn the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, at midnight, visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord in the *Xuandan* Palace facing outward and exhaling green *qi* into your mouth. Swallow it fifty times, then swallow saliva fifty times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Perfected Sovereign, Central Yellow Purple Lord, whose name is* Guiying*, styled* Huaxuan*, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, adorned with purple embroidered robes, girded with a belt bearing tinkling fire-bells to sever evil and destroy treachery, holding the essence of stars, his head crowned with the sun’s perfection. As he sits upright and exhales* qi*, I swallow it, converse with him, and feast in the* Xuandan*. He refines my seven po, harmonizes my three hun, and divine spirits guard and protect me, enabling my ascent as an immortal. My five viscera regenerate, my youthful countenance returns, I receive scriptures in the Highest Purity, and the Thearch Lord of Destiny grants my wishes. May all my desires be fulfilled, and may a hundred blessings renew.\"*",
