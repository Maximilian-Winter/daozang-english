Through seven returns and nine reversions, does it become the medicine of transformation and ascension?\n\nWithin the red appears the yellow; knowing the white, one guards the qi—these are the lead and mercury of the Golden Elixir. The wind atop Mount Hua, the waves beneath the Fusang Sea—these are the Dragon and Tiger of the Golden Elixir. The luan and phoenix within the spirit-chamber, the clouds and rain within the elixir-house—these are the husband and wife of the Golden Elixir. The sun’s essence leaking celestial marrow, the moon’s spirit moving earthly fat—these are the Crow and Hare of the Golden Elixir. The circulation of the two qi, the revolving of the primordial unity—these are the Tortoise and Serpent of the Golden Elixir. The civil fire for gentle nurturing, the martial fire for forging refinement—these are the fire-timing of the Golden Elixir.\n\nAs for the bathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the water of Kun, the water of Kan. The blowing and breathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the wind of Xun, the wind of Li.\n\nAlas, the wonders of the Golden Elixir are not transmitted! Drawing and adding according to the sun and moon, waxing and waning in imitation of heaven and earth, punishment and virtue modeled on Mao and You, conjunctions uniting metal and wood. Moreover, the clarity or turbidity of the water source, the slowness or swiftness of the fire-timing, the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal materials, the beginning and end of the union, the transformations of the embryonic immortal—these too must be known.\n\nKnowing these, one reads *The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals* and suddenly awakens, as if released, like orchids in the spring breeze, like parasol trees in the first autumn rain, like night snow in the pine forest, like evening sunlight on the bamboo path—such is the flavor of the Golden Elixir. Serene as white clouds in the spring sky, bright as the pale moon in the autumn pool, obscure as an infant yet unborn, dim as an elder on the verge of senility—such is the attainment of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThus is the Golden Elixir cultivated, thus are the medicinal substances gathered, thus are water and fire employed, thus does the Dao of the Elixir unite and thus is it accomplished.\n\n*The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals*—a work unparalleled in ancient or modern times. Who was Hu Taixian? A man who abandoned Confucianism and transcended the common world, yet his immortality remains unverified. His intent was thus—he was a man of old.\n\n**On the Golden Elixir**\n\nI have heard that before the Supreme Ultimate divided, all was a chaotic void, undifferentiated in clarity or turbidity, formless as a hen’s egg. Once the primordial qi split, the Two Modes arose. Thus, the pure and numinous qi floated to become heaven, the heavy and turbid qi descended to become earth, and the harmonious qi congealed to become humanity. The Three Powers were established, and the myriad things were born.\n\nThe sages of antiquity looked up to observe the patterns of heaven, looked down to examine the principles of earth, and inwardly grasped the norms of human relations. Thus, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams to exhaustively investigate the forms of heaven and earth and illuminate the source and flow of creation. He paired Qian and Kun with the movement and stillness of heaven and earth, aligned Kan and Li with the circulation of the sun and moon. The five viscera were divided into the five phases, corresponding above to the five stars in their celestial procession and inwardly clarifying the mutual restraint of the five qi.\n\nThus, the liver stores the ethereal soul, dwelling in the east, and is called the Azure Dragon; the lungs store the corporeal soul, dwelling in the west, and are named the White Tiger; the heart stores the spirit, dwelling in the south, and is titled the Vermilion Bird; the kidneys store the essence, dwelling in the north, and are likened to the Dark Warrior; the spleen stores the will, dwelling in the center, and is honored as the virtue of earth.\n\nTherefore, water, when met with earth, conceals its form; fire, when met with earth, veils its brightness; metal, when met with earth, enhances its luster; wood, when met with earth, overflows with moisture. Thus, the Dragon and Tiger unite in the jade crucible, water and fire achieve balance in the golden tripod. The true essence soars behind the elbow, the river chariot revolves in the Jade Capital, the mysterious pearl descends in the Flowery Pond, the yellow sprout grows in the Numinous Valley. The Three Corpses flee, the Six Bandits escape, the yang spirit gathers to form an immortal, and the golden mercury coalesces into treasure. Only then can one transcend the mundane and enter sainthood, attaining an age equal to heaven.\n\nI have seen Master Bai compile alchemical texts, illustrating inner images of creation, distinguishing the five phases, arranging the Eight Trigrams, pointing out the elixir’s cauldron, clarifying the fire-timing, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, the galloping of Dragon and Tiger, the unfolding of phenomena, all rendered into diagrams to guide those who love the Dao. With a single glance, all becomes clear and doubt vanishes, allowing one to enter by a smooth path. If one follows the diagrams in practice, what confusion could remain?\n\n**Treatise on Cultivating the True**\n\nIt has often been said that the Great Dao is subtle and obscure, difficult for people to comprehend. Therefore, the sages concealed its profound principles within the classics, hid them among the myriad things, and employed parables and images—all to deliver the deluded.\n\nIn former times, the *Baopuzi* stated: \"Water with a source flows far; trees with roots grow lush; houses with foundations stand firm; and those who preserve their essence live long.\" The *Ninefold Elixir Classic* says: \"What one may preserve is life; what is lamentable is the body; what may be stored is qi; and what is most precious is essence.\" The *Supreme Mysterious Mirror* states: \"Pure yang ascending is called qi; pure yin descending is called fluid. When qi and fluid merge within the bone marrow, it is called marrow. When qi and marrow unite beyond the bladder, it is called essence. When heart-qi resides in the liver and liver-essence is unstable, the eyes grow dim and lose their luster. When heart-qi resides in the lungs and lung-essence is weak, the flesh withers. When heart-qi resides in the kidneys and kidney-essence is unstable, spirit and qi diminish. When heart-qi resides in the spleen and spleen-essence is unsteady, teeth and hair loosen and fall. Among the five viscera, the kidneys govern essence, and the heart is the abode of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower elixir field; true qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally returns to the primordial palace. Thus, a person’s qi measures eight hundred and ten *zhang*, corresponding to the eighty-one yang numbers of nine nines. Beyond this, essence scatters, primordial qi dissipates, illness arises, and death follows.\n\nMoreover, Guangchengzi transmitted the Dao to the Yellow Emperor, teaching the art of longevity: \"In all going out and coming in, do not depart from the Mysterious Female; in all movement and stillness, abide only in the Valley Spirit. In the profound and obscure, there is essence; in the vague and indistinct, there is substance. Know the white, guard the black, and you may attain long life.\" I have also observed Master Xujing’s words: \"The Great Dao is not distant—it lies within the body. Though things are empty, nature is not. If nature remains unobstructed, harmonious qi abides; when qi returns to the primordial sea, life knows no end. To keep the spirit within the body, do not cling to a single thing in the numinous terrace. If things linger in the heart, the spirit grows clouded, essence scatters, and sinews and bones weaken.\"\n\nThe Dao is easy to know yet hard to encounter; easy to encounter yet hard to perfect. Recently, I sought teachers and friends, inquiring into the great medicine of the golden elixir and the methods of fire-timing, withdrawal, and addition. Yet none spoke of the foundational work. Without a path to enter, one remains lost. Now, beholding Master Bai of Hainan’s *Diagrams of Cultivating the True and Nurturing Life*, which employs images to reveal the mysteries of the Great Dao, I hope that those of like aspiration may follow these diagrams in practice—this is truly the swiftest path. Let none neglect this.\n\nWritten in the summer month of the *chunyou* year, *jiachen*, by Liao Zhengjing.\n\n---\n\n**Colophon to the *Miscellaneous Writings on Pointing to the Mysterious*, Volume One of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True***\n\n**Preface to the *Returning to the Source***\n\nBy Shi Tai of Apricot Grove, the Perfected One\n\nTai has long revered the true teaching, traversed sacred sites, and sought transmission of the orthodox method. With a heart set on benefiting the world, he focused solely on the Three Treasures, prizing longevity above all. For the path to immortality is easily walked, yet people make it difficult; shedding the dust is not hard, yet people find it so. How lamentable!\n\nAs the ancients said: \"Deluded clouds veil the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\" In former years, while serving in the postal relay, I encountered my late teacher, Master Zhang Ziyang. His concise words—no more than half a phrase—yielded verification in but a moment. Knowing that immortality could be learned, I rejoiced inwardly. When the golden liquid congealed and the sacred embryo formed, Tai composed the *Returning to the Source*, eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, to instruct later learners. Awaken early to the true root—do not wait until old age, when lead is exhausted and mercury scarce. Urgently reflect, seek a teacher, and inquire into the cultivation of the golden elixir. Together, may we attain the fruit of immortality, transform, and ascend in flight. This is my deepest wish.\n\nThe eighty-one chapters of *Returning to the Source* correspond to the pure yang number.\n\n---\n\n1.\nLead and mercury form the true body,\nYin and yang supply the Great Primal.\nSimply know to practice the two eights—\nThen you may refine the golden elixir.\n\n2.\nMercury is the marrow of the Green Dragon,\nLead is the fat of the White Tiger.\nReturn them to the

expanse.\nThe embryo immortal transforms—\nOnly then is the ninefold turning known.\n\n7.\nWhere the dragon conceals its pearl,\nWhen the hen broods her egg—\nLead and mercury unite,\nJust then may one partake of the knife-round.\n\n8.\nBathing relies on the water of Kun,\nBreathing depends on the wind of Xun.\nWith nothing to do,\nAbide alone in the Grand Tenuity Palace.\n\n9.\nSeek the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court,\nPair the Man of Kan with the Vermilion Mound.\nWhere the Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,\nThe Supreme Ultimate naturally enfolds the Three.\n\n10.\nThe Qian horse gallops to the golden gate,\nThe Kun ox enters the wooden palace.\nWho is the general that startles the maiden,\nMarrying her off to the Metal Elder?\n\n11.\nThe startled maiden is just sixteen,\nThe Metal Elder is precisely twenty-seven.\nIn the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises—\nTheir joyous union bears a firstborn son.\n\n12.\nLast night by the western riverbank,\nThe toad’s light shone on the azure waves.\nGathered and brought to the jade chamber,\nWithin the crucible, it refines itself.\n\n13.\nLi and Kan do not copulate—\nQian and Kun transform of themselves.\nOne who understands this principle\nPoints and fills the Yellow Court.\n\n14.\nThe Elixir Valley births divine water,\nThe Yellow Court holds the great granary.\nNo longer hungering or thirsting,\nOne enters the immortal realm.\n\n15.\nThe horse of intent returns to the spirit chamber,\nThe ape of the heart guards the grotto room.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and will—\nAll transform into purple gold frost.\n\n16.\n\nOne aperture, the Mysterious Pass,\nThree barriers at the vital crossroads.\nWith sudden, gentle movement,\nDivine water flows of itself.\n\n17.\nThe po is not restrained by the heart,\nNor is the hun bound by intent.\nOnly spirit and qi remain—\nIn an instant, the Mysterious Pearl congeals.\n\n18.\nThe oral instructions are few,\nThe Elixir’s refinement takes but a moment.\nGently regulate the fire’s timing,\nIn ten months, the infant is born.\n\n19.\nAt first, the couple’s joyful union,\nWith passing years, their affection deepens.\nIn the bridal chamber where they meet,\nEvery day is spring’s breeze.\n\n20.\nSudden rain on paper butterflies,\nA great furnace’s jade peony.\nAt midnight, the red sun blazes,\nIn the sixth month, pristine frost chills.\n\n21.\nWhen union is complete,\nThe jade crucible emits azure smoke.\n\n22.\nBreak open the Mysterious Origin’s aperture,\nPierce through the Gate of Chaos.\nSimply know how to refine water and fire,\nLet tiger and dragon coil freely.\n\n23.\nFire within the sea of Śakradeva,\nWaves upon Kunlun’s peak.\nWho can master their operation?\nThe great key lies with the Yellow Dame.\n\n24.\nThe medicine is drawn from primordial qi,\nThe fire seeks the essence of the Great Simplicity.\nOne who knows how to gather medicine and fire\nWill surely witness the Elixir’s completion.\n\n25.\nHow is primordial qi ingested?\nTrue essence need not be moved.\nTrue essence and primordial qi—\nThese are the Great Elixir’s foundation.\n\n26.\nConfucians clarify illusory principles,\nBuddhists strike at stubborn emptiness.\nUnacquainted with the immortal arts,\nThe Golden Elixir’s work is instantaneous.\n\n27.\nMercury in the crescent-moon furnace,\nLead within the cinnabar crucible.\nTortoise and serpent, one true qi—\nTheir offspring is born of the prior heaven.\n\n28.\nFrom new moon to full, from crescent to dark,\nWithdraw and add, emulating wax and wane.\nWithout knowing true creation,\nWhat substance is true lead?\n\n29.\nQi is life within form,\nThe heart is spirit within nature.\nOne who knows the cavity of spirit and qi\nIs precisely the one who attains immortality.\n\n30.\nWood’s marrow refines the golden crucible,\nSpring flows into the jade furnace.\nWho will devote three hundred days\nTo slowly apply their effort?\n\n31.\nJade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,\nThe golden embryo forms at the qi’s pivot.\nSeek only the medicine within the body,\nNo need to pore over alchemical texts.\n\n32.\nThe jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,\nThe golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.\nNine returns become nine revolutions,\nGentle nurturing follows the cycle of stars.\n\n33.\nThe fire jujube has no pit,\nThe intertwined pear bears no core.\nAll day without fire’s timing,\nDivine water irrigates the golden blossom.\n\n34.\nTo refine primordial qi,\nFirst dry the living mercury.\nWhen the sacred embryo takes form,\nBreaking through the crown, thunder roars.\n\n35.\nRefining qi is labor in vain,\nPreserving spirit is effort wasted.\nHow could one know the Elixir’s wondrous secret?\nAll day long, one feasts on true emptiness.\n\n36.\nQi is not produced by the kidneys,\nSpirit does not dwell in the heart.\nQi and spirit are elusive—\nThey transform into a mass of gold.\n\n37.\nOne aperture is called the Mysterious Female,\nWithin it, qi and spirit reside.\nWho knows this aperture?\nSeek no further—do not search outside for truth.\n\n38.\nThe spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,\nThe bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.\nDo not cling to these—\nThis is not the Elixir’s pivot.\n\n39.\nA thousand verses on inner visions,\nA goblet of Central Yellow wine.\nCarefree, unburdened by things,\nBeyond the body lies the cosmos.\n\n40.\nCrow and hare refine each other,\nTortoise and serpent coil naturally.\nThey transform into a single Elixir grain,\nGently nurtured into an embryonic immortal.\n\n41.\nAll things undergo birth and death,\nThe primordial spirit dies and revives.\nWhen the embryo returns to qi,\nThe Dao of the Elixir naturally achieves completion.\n\n42.\nWhere spirit and qi return to their root,\nWhen body and mind revert to their mandate—\nSuch is the true aperture,\nFew indeed comprehend it.\n\n43.\nWithin the body lies the Mysterious Female,\nWithin the heart, no dust or stain.\nWho can recognize this?\nOne aperture contains all truth.\n\n44.\nLi and Kan are true dragon and tiger,\nQian and Kun are proper horse and ox.\nEvery person possesses them fully—\nWhy then do so few know to cultivate?\n\n45.\nHun and po govern the heart,\nSpirit and essence are enveloped by intent.\nSteadily regulate the fire’s timing,\nSilently move the initial line.\n\n46.\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nWest of the liver, left of the lungs.\nNeither intestines nor stomach,\nA single qi flows freely.\n\n47.\nThe wondrous function is not tied to intent,\nThe true mechanism requires no timing.\nWho can know this aperture?\nDo not simply indulge in non-action.\n\n48.\nThere is something, yet not nothing,\nNon-action unites with action.\nThe power of transformation lies in your hands—\nCrow and hare congeal golden fat.\n\n49.\nThe tiger roars on the western mountain,\nThe dragon intones east of the northern sea.\nCapture them—wild battle is required,\nEntrust them to the palace of Gen and Kun.\n\n50.\nFu and Shen govern brightness and darkness,\nZhun and Meng align with dawn and dusk.\nThe Elixir furnace congeals white snow,\nNowhere to find the heart’s ape.\n\n51.\nBlack mercury sprouts yellow leaves,\nRed lead blooms purple flowers.\nFurther regulate the fire’s timing,\nWithin the crucible, cinnabar forms.\n\n52.\nWood’s essence must guard against the hare,\nMetal’s essence must shun the rooster.\nWithdraw and add—this is bathing,\nPrecisely when the moon is full.\n\n53.\nWhen the wind first stirs myriad sounds,\nWhen the moon first rounds a thousand peaks—\nHasten to issue the true command,\nThen you may circulate the Microcosmic Orbit.\n\n54.\nDistinguish the medicine’s age and tenderness,\nApply fire’s timing with withdrawal and addition.\nWhen the Elixir’s light arises,\nThe cold toad’s rays pierce the jade curtain.\n\n55.\nThe clam’s belly once split for its pearl,\nThe hen’s nest yields eggs with ease.\nLife has its substance—\nSpirit and qi naturally contend.\n\n56.\nSpirit and qi are not parent and child,\nBody and mind are not husband and wife.\nAlign with heaven’s mechanism—\nWho knows where the Elixir congeals?\n\n57.\nWhere the Elixir’s head first forms,\nWhen the medicine has already congealed—\nIn their fierce battle,\nEven the sovereign remains unaware.\n\n58.\nSide doors and minor methods,\nStrange arts and idle words—\nThe Elixir’s secret\nHas no second path.\n\n59.\nNoble and base, high and low,\nHusband and wife, brothers—\nIf they have the destiny,\nAll may study the Elixir’s classic.\n\n60.\nA broken house is easily repaired,\nA withered medicine is not hard to revive.\nThe method of return—\nGold and treasure accumulate like mountains.\n\n61.\nHun and po form the three natures,\nSpirit and essence harmonize the five phases.\nWithin them, the four images divide,\nGathering to form the embryo’s essence.\n\n62.\n\nWith resolve seek lead and mercury,\nWith stillness seek earth and gold.\nOnly then know the true single aperture—\nWho can fathom this profound depth?\n\n63.\nCreation has no root or stem,\nYin and yang possess their origin.\nThese true wonders—\nEven father and son cannot transmit them.\n\n64.\nRetain mercury in the golden crucible,\nGuide lead into the jade pool.\nHost and guest know no left or right,\nOnly recognize the infant.\n\n65.\nThe Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,\nElder Ding’s heart is kind.\nIn nurturing, no other guard is needed—\nWithin nothingness, the child is reared.\n\n66.\nCrimson towers see the green phoenix soar,\nThe cinnabar field nurtures the royal toad.\nWithin the gourd, heaven knows no night—\nWhite snow falls, delicate and fine.\n\n67.\nWhen zither and lute harmonize,\nThe legacy is complete.\nNo need to tend the fire’s timing—\nLest the infant be harmed.\n\n68.\nThe eldest son enters *dui*,\nThe youngest daughter returns to *qian*.\nThe *xun* palace and earth’s position—\nThe gates and locks complete the celestial cycle.\n\n69.\nAt the moments before and after the crescent,\nWhen the moon waxes full or wanes.\nWithdraw and replenish, mirroring punishment and virtue—\nBathe according to its waxing and waning.\n\n70.\nOld mercury, three pounds of white,\nTrue lead, a single point of red.\nSeize the marrow of heaven and earth—\nIn a moment’s union.\n\n71.\nWhere fire and timing reach the mysterious,\nWho through the ages has dared transmit it?\nBefore knowing how to gather the medicine,\nDo not ask of the celestial cycle.\n\n72.\nClouds scatter the crabapple moon,\nSpring deepens with willow winds.\nWho understands this meaning?\nRaising one’s gaze to empty space.\n\n73.\nAmong men, no worldly burdens,\nIn heaven, there are immortal steps.\nAlready knowing how to ride the clouds,\nTogether they come with the white crane.\n\n74.\nThe field of the heart bears no weeds,\nThe land of nature is free of dust.\nIn the stillness of a moonlit night,\nA spring crow calls once.\n\n75.\nWhite gold refines the six trigrams,\nBlack tin passes the three barriers.\nIn the depths of midnight,\nThe golden crow enters the vast cold.\n\n76.\nWhen the elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger,\nWhen the fire ends, mercury and lead cease.\nHaving shed the embryo, already spirit-transformed—\nBecome a jade-pure immortal.\n\n77.\nSeal the road to the Yellow Springs,\nBreak open the gate of the Purple Palace.\nThe Sea Toad’s child—\nTransforms into a crane, emerging from the muddy pellet.\n\n78.\nWhere do rivers and seas return?\nTo whom do mountains and cliffs belong?\nWhen the work is complete—\nAll are treasures within the house.\n\n79.\nLü received the oral transmission from Zhong,\nGe imparted the heart-mind teaching to Zheng.\nIdle words—\nAll return to mercury and lead.\n\n80.\nMercury and lead return to one crucible,\nSun and moon must share the furnace.\nBe wary of taboos—\nThat you may congeal the jade nectar.\n\n81.\nGather the medicine and unite,\nAdvance the fire and bathe.\n\nAt the moment of shedding the embryo, the nine-by-nine Yang number is complete.\n\n*Supplementary Writings on Cultivating the True: Pointers to the

sun and moon meet in union.\nThe void naturally shatters into myriad fragments,\nChew through chaos, light as silk floss.\nKneaded back and forth, it forms a single coin,\nThe body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.\nRed blood is replaced by white blood’s flow,\nGolden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.\nA pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,\nA golden flower blooms like a red lotus.\nAt this time, the body’s spirit and qi are whole—\nNo need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.\nNow I know your worthiness,\nThat you are destined to become an immortal.\nClearly instructed, with few words,\nSilently operate, adding and withdrawing.\nWithin a year, gather the moon—no need for years;\nWithin a month, seize the sun—months are in vain.\nWithin a day, grasp the hour—days are easily lost;\nWithin an hour, there are moments, profoundly mysterious.\nMysterious beyond mystery, inexpressible—\nIt is the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.\nThe Golden Elder and Maiden seize creation,\nGhosts and spirits weep in alarm.\nClouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—\nA single grain of the Mysterious Pearl sown in the Jade Field.\nAfter ten months of firing, the sacred embryo rounds,\nNine revolutions, seven returns, cycling in turn.\nFirst, the spine’s pass opens,\nNext, the bladder blazes like fire.\nWithin, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,\nTimely stirred, they surge toward the heart’s origin.\nHeart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally interact—\nWho causes the separation of metal and wood?\nThe Yellow Court’s qi resides in the Central Palace,\nGoverning all phenomena, the heart holds sway.\nThe water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—\nWho sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,\nThe crow’s soul and hare’s spirit scatter like dust.\nThus, silently seek the true root—\nA single path leads to the numinous true.\nClearly, essence is enveloped by qi,\nGradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.\nThis spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,\nPure Yang, undying—the true person.\nKnowing this, you should cultivate immortality;\nTo cultivate immortality, only the Golden Elixir’s gate remains.\nThe Golden Elixir has no second formula—\nA single acre within the body is your homestead.\nSaliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—\nThese seven yin substances—what use are they?\nWithin Kan, it is not the kidney but the numinous root;\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red, the mare gallops.\nSeven returns, nine revolutions—achieved in a moment,\nAll things in creation are thus born.\nOnly this true operation of Qian and Kun—\nNo need for vain, wordless striving.\nWithout thought or念, the spirit is already dull—\nHow can it congeal into the embryo immortal?\nThe embryo immortal is but the union’s fruition,\nThis union occurs in but a fleeting instant.\nDo you yet know of the great intestine’s return,\nJust before the Winter Solstice’s few days?\nIt is said when the golden essence descends,\nWith what is the golden essence restored?\nThe golden essence is but the medicine of Kun Palace,\nKun rules the southwest, the river’s source.\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—\nThis is the root of the medicine.\nExchange hours for days, moments for hours—\nA single drop of sweet dew, the numinous spring.\nSwallowed, it surges through the heart meridian, piercing the lung’s transport point,\nFalling into the bladder, it forms the elixir.\nThe elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—\nThough it enters the bladder, it resides in the liver.\nThe liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence;\nEncountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.\nDo not say this is deliberate effort,\nLest it become attachment to form.\nFrom attachment to form, one reaches formlessness—\nRefine essence into qi, qi returns to the root.\nThe root of qi congeals into spirit,\nOnly then is it called effortless and spiritually efficacious.\nLike husband and wife in union,\nA single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.\nTheir union, stirred by emotion, produces essence—\nEven so, the infant matures in ten months.\nHow much more so when the cosmos is in your hands,\nThe body’s tiger roars, the dragon sings.\nThough the dragon’s song is unseen,\nWaves surge high, thousands of fathoms.\nThough the tiger’s roar is unheard,\nDeep in the night, winds howl through myriad forests.\nFrom the moment the elixir’s path congeals,\nThrough the firing’s completion,\nUntil the tenth month, when frost descends—\nGhosts and spirits flee, daring not contend.\nA year comprises twelve months,\nWho dares bathe at Mao and You?\nThus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,\nThe golden crucible brims with dragon’s essence.\nThe mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—\nWith the formula, cultivation is no difficulty.\nIf you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,\nAnd grasp the moon’s soul—\nUnderstanding these words, you follow the ancients—\nWhat worry is there that your body will not ascend?\nThe body’s hub, the heart’s flesh—\nWithin the heart lies a priceless treasure.\nIt can give me life or bring me death,\nIt can starve or satiate.\nSeek the true, trace the path to its origin—\nCarefree and joyful, free from hunger and cold.\nSuch states and proofs—\nAll lie within a day’s work.\n\nThe work seems leisurely, yet the medicine is not distant—gathering it is no difficulty.\nWho knows the crimson blaze of ten thousand fathoms?\nIt sears the Three Worms, chilling the jade crucible.\nThe cinnabar field, too, can yield purple mushrooms;\nThe Yellow Court, in turn, engenders crimson essence.\nOne taste of crimson essence—hunger never returns;\nOne dose of purple mushrooms—youth’s face remains.\nThe body brims with white milk-flowers,\nGolden sinews and jade bones—death will not come.\nFrom deathlessness comes the completion of merit;\nWith merit fulfilled and conduct perfected, cranes arrive—\nOne leap, and you ascend the clouds.\n\n**The Marrow of the Yin Talisman**\nThe Way of embracing the One—this is what the immortals practice, and Heaven protects them.\nThe world cannot attain it, for it is the primordial essence of the Great Unity.\nThe Great Unity is the source of the Supreme Ultimate and the Great Abyss, the Dao of refining spirit through emptiness.\nThe One is qi.\nIf one can harmonize the true qi of the Great Unity with one’s own true qi, enveloping them in supreme harmony, and refine them over time, this becomes the Great Elixir.\nThe Elixir is pure yang.\nYang is the Way of Heaven.\nThus, when spirit unites with the Dao and gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it becomes wind—therefore, it communicates with the Dao.\nCommunication means the Dao nourishes qi.\nTo nourish qi is to preserve spirit.\nSpirit is the Way of Heaven.\nThus, when essence and qi harmonize over time and fire is applied, true qi takes form.\nThis is called refining pure yang, using the body as the nation, the heart as the ruler, and essence as the people.\nExpel the yin demons—\nThe body is the furnace,\nThe head is the crucible.\nWhen essence fills the brain, fire is used to refine it.\nFire is yang;\nBreath is wind.\nWith wind fanning the fire, refine form and spirit—\nWhen both are wondrous, this is called refining form.\nTo refine form, first stabilize the heart within, so true qi surges in harmony.\nFire is the qi of cinnabar yang, the pure essence of the Elixir.\nCirculating without cease, rising and sinking in ceaseless return, encompassing all things—thus it is cinnabar yang.\nHeaven and Earth are the essence of yin and yang.\nHeaven’s qi descends and then ascends; Earth’s qi ascends and then descends.\nHeaven’s yang essence crystallizes as the sun; Earth’s yin essence crystallizes as the moon.\nIf one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, naturally it turns the movement of sun and moon without rest—this is the Dao of refining spirit with pure yang.\nAbove the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Heaven pours in; below the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Earth pours in.\nWithin the Celestial Pivot, yin and yang intermingle—\nIf one can merge them, above and below become boundless, and one’s years equal Heaven’s.\nYet people today cannot comprehend this, for greed and desire deplete their essence, the heart loses its spirit, the body labors and scatters qi—\nThus they die in darkness, undone by the Five Thieves.\nThose who perceive this thrive; those who do not perish.\nThe Five Thieves are the upright qi of the Five Phases.\nHeavenly perfection is the origin of the Dao.\nIt nurtures the myriad things, holds the power of life and death, and is the root of creation.\nWhen it fills the body over time, essence harmonizes with heavenly perfection.\nHeaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth’s qi receives it without parting.\nIf one can recognize this, one will not die.\nMaster Guangcheng said: “I have lived twelve thousand years, all due to the upright principle of the Five Phases.”\nThe Five Phases are the Five Viscera.\nWater receives the qi of the One—\nIn humans, the kidneys belong to Water.\nBefore a person is born, the Dao is their foundation.\nThe Gate of Life corresponds above to the primordial source of the Great Unity in the north, the root of creation.\nNext, the left kidney generates the pulse of life, surging upward to greet the origin.\nDescending to Xun and Kun, within lies the primordial foundation.\nGathering the qi of the four seasons, it enters the Central Palace and ascends to the crown of the head—thus it enacts Heaven’s work.\nThe head is round, symbolizing Heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing Earth.\nWithin, the upright qi of the Five Phases gathers.\nEntering the Crimson Palace, it disperses to reach the sinews and bones, rising and descending in ceaseless return, merging with the Bubbling Spring to unite the myriad spirits.\nThus, when green yang reaches the head, all yin scatters.\nFurther employing the Five Phases’ upright qi of Heaven, which descends within—\nWhen the Five Phases dwell together, entering the crucible to refine the Elixir, one does not die.\nHeaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism; humans use the heart as theirs.\nHeaven’s mechanism operates through yin and yang; the human mechanism perfects the Great Dao.\nThe Great Dao is non-action.\nIn non-action, nature is not disordered; when nature is not disordered, spirit does not stray; when spirit does not stray, essence does not scatter; when essence does not scatter, qi does not drift; when qi does not drift, essence and fire follow one another.\nWhen essence and fire do not scatter, the myriad spirits gather in the homeland of spirit, within the Kunlun Mountains, ascending to the crown of the head—\nOnly then does one attain the creation of the primordial qi.\nThus, the Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe One is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of yin and yang.\nThe myriad things rely on it to be born and completed; the thousand spirits depend on it for flourishing or withering.\nFrom the lofty heavens to the deep earth, from grotto-heavens to immortal palaces, from mysterious constellations to sacred images of divine perfected—\nNot a single thing is born without the primordial qi.\nBefore birth, one first receives Heaven’s qi, which becomes human nature.\nThen, the two qi unite to form the body.\nIf one can still the heart like an unmoving Heaven, one becomes one with Heaven and Earth.\nThe human heart is the root of the mechanism.\nIf one can preserve the heart and guard the spirit, taking the heart as nature and qi as life—\nYet if one cannot practice this, qi is cut off and life perishes, all due to disordered nature and scattered spirit.\nThe Way of Heaven is the pure qi.\nHumans receive the One qi, embodying the principle of nurturing the myriad spirits with pure yang—thus it is called the Way of Heaven.\nThe mechanism of creation is transformation.\nThe dragon is qi;\nThe serpent is fire.\nIf one circulates essence and qi in ceaseless ascent and descent, seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth—this is called the mechanism.\nIf one abandons the Five Desires and moves with the mechanism’s power—\nLike Heaven’s work, the true green yang within the human kidneys, the tortoise and serpent, ascends to communicate with the primordial qi of Heaven.\nThrough breath, above and below respond, rising to leave the earth.\n\nGuangchengzi said:\nWithin the qi sea one cun and three fen below the navel lies a measure of true essence. Inside are two meridians—on the left, the Cinnabar Yang Meridian; on the right, the Numinous Yang Meridian. These two meridians ascend to connect with the brain. Therein lies a palace called the Numinous Yang Palace, which contains two cavities: on the left, the Supreme Ultimate Cavity; on the right, the Penetrating Emptiness Cavity. Above, they communicate with the qi of Heaven; below, they reach the primordial sea—thus, through breath, the qi of Heaven descends to nourish the true essence. The ascending force is the dragon, the root of green yang; the descending force is the serpent, the origin of primordial qi. When these two qi intersect, they form the Great Medicine. With prolonged refinement, the elixir is completed—thus, one does not die. Through prolonged refinement, the spirit transcends the material world—thus, one rises from the earth.\n\nWhen humans harbor the mechanism of destruction and guard the yang spirit, yin and yang ascend and descend. Heaven does so through the winter and summer solstices; humans do so through each inhalation and exhalation. On exhalation, qi reaches the root; on inhalation, it reaches the stem. With each inhalation, the qi of Heaven descends; with each exhalation, the qi of Earth ascends. When I circulate true qi to guide the qi of Earth below upward to Heaven—this is called the reversal of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeavenly nature must not be disordered; spirit and qi must not be displaced. When one can unite with essence and qi to generate the myriad spirits, it is as if Heaven and Earth are harmonious and nurture all things. The sage inwardly refines clarity while outwardly restraining desires, dwelling in stillness before the Great Beginning, where no distinction of skill or clumsiness yet exists.\n\nThe Three Essentials are the Mysterious Female, the Jade Gate, and the Golden Barrier. Above, they connect to Heaven; below, to Earth. One must never let the eyes observe and the heart stir, the ears listen and the spirit wander, or the mouth speak and the qi scatter—for if the Three Essentials are disturbed, the spirit disperses.\n\nWithin the human heart are two apertures: on the left, the Mysterious; on the right, the Female. Below, they enter the qi sea; above, they connect to the Mud Pill Palace. This is the true interconnection of the Jade Gate and Golden Barrier, which flank the spine, pass through the Three Barriers, and pay homage to the Northern Culmen. When the yang cavity stirs, it nurtures the true.\n\nGuangchengzi said: Wood without fire does not turn to ash; humans without nature do not die. Fire scatters the spirit; when the spirit scatters, qi departs; when qi departs, the body perishes. A state with long-standing treachery will collapse; a body with long-standing evil will die. Remove treachery, and there is peace; remove evil, and there is tranquility.\n\nHeaven and Earth plunder the Great Void; humans, in turn, plunder Heaven and Earth. The *dieluo* are worms in the human abdomen that consume my soul and spirit, dissipate my qi and essence, and scatter my blood. Yet if one can restore the mechanism of yin-yang creation, they cannot cause harm.\n\nThe sage employs the mechanism to emulate the transformative power of creation, cultivating thus to ascend to the celestial realm. Heaven uses one qi to nurture the myriad things; humans receive one qi to generate the myriad spirits. To dissipate this one qi is to invite death.\n\nThe ancient sages consumed the qi of Heaven at appointed times, regulating the hundred vessels. By drinking deeply of the true qi of Grand Harmony and focusing intention on the field of the body, the five viscera become cool and clear, the six bowels harmonious and at peace, the joints filled with primordial qi, and the spirit settled.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The softness and weakness of qi penetrate the sinews and bones, settle the spirit, and ensure the free flow of the joints—how can this not be the principle?\n\nWhen the numinous mechanism is employed internally, it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations. Heaven operates the mechanism to nurture the myriad things; humans operate the mechanism to achieve boundless transformation. People perceive external omens of fortune and misfortune and respond accordingly, yet they do not realize that within themselves lies the divine—this is what makes one an immortal, what defines the divine.\n\nThe sun and moon are the purest essences of yin and yang. They traverse the eight directions, with cold and heat alternating, fulfilling the intent of Heaven and Earth, established in the path of the sun and moon’s circuit. The sun rises and the moon sets—all within the realm of number. Number is one; one is qi. The sage who attains this comprehends the principles of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and geography, firmly cultivating qi and nurturing the spirit without straying from the Dao—thus, the myriad transformations begin.\n\nThe noble one can endure hardship; the petty person, upon hearing this, scoffs and treats life lightly. The Three Returns reside in the Three Origins: the true qi of Heavenly Origin dwells at the head, the true qi of Numinous Origin at the center, and the true qi of Root Origin below.\n\nEssence is the teacher; the heart is the sovereign; the body is the form. When the three yang circulate within for a long time, the spirit naturally pays homage to the origin—thus, one does not die. By means of the Dao of Heaven, one transforms the myriad things below, receiving the life bestowed by the Dao, naturally and spontaneously.\n\nThis is the great kindness of life—not indulging the heart in sensual desires. Calm the heart and preserve the qi, and the transformative power of creation will naturally bestow kindness. Curb desires, rectify the heart, stabilize the qi, guard the spirit and embrace the One. In utmost stillness, daily renewal leads to the source, to the divine—this is the root of yin and yang.\n\nIf the eyes do not gaze upon sensual forms, the spirit does not wander; when the spirit does not wander, qi is stored within. In the supreme joy of celestial truth, there is no disturbance to the end.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The *qin* is the bird of the southern direction. If one can subdue and preserve true essence and strength for a long time, one will soar like the *qin* into the Great Void. Yet this is nothing more than becoming a flying immortal through qi, reducing excess to supplement deficiency. The excess lies in the heart; the deficiency, in essence. If one cannot reduce the excess, one cannot supplement the deficiency. To supplement deficiency is to cause harm. Restraining desires, concealing the form, and binding the material world may seem tasteless, yet kindness resides within—harm contains kindness.\n\nThe principle of Heaven and Earth, the mechanism of the sage, the sprout of the supreme Dao, the root of the myriad things, the origin of yin and yang—thus, creation is inexhaustible. The sage, in the essence of the supreme Dao, possesses what is mine. The Dao’s vitality is such that the myriad things are themselves, yet I alone am wise.\n\nYin and yang do not prevail—what prevails is my use of them, my spirit, my numinosity. When yin and yang equally prevail in Heaven and Earth, the two qi conjoin, and the myriad things are as one. When wisdom and spirit are as one with qi, this is the sage—distinct from ordinary people, thus becoming an immortal.\n\nThe Three Essentials are derived from the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Consecration Classic*. The first essential is the head, the Great Abyss—this is the position where the Valley Spirit resides.\n\nThe upper corresponds to the Dark Capital, the realm where the ten thousand spirits gather. If one can open this, the Valley Spirit will naturally reside there, true breath will settle of itself, and hunger and thirst will vanish of themselves.\n\nThe second essential is the heart, the Crimson Palace. If one can empty the heart and concentrate the spirit, achieving the union of spirit and qi, with breath ceasing its movement—this is called the Great Stillness. Now, the spirit is the origin of Heaven and Earth, the root of nature and life, the ancestor of sun and moon, the chief of dragon and tiger, the foundation of yin and yang. With each breath, four beats occur. The Most High said: twenty-four beats make one *dao*, two hundred forty beats make one *gui*—thus the sage calls it the *dao-gui*.\n\nThe third essential lies between the two kidneys, at the boundary of water and fire—this is called the Earth Gate. There is a spirit here named Peach Prosperity, which connects upward to the Nine Heavens and downward to the Bubbling Spring. The gathering and dispersal of true qi all pass through this gate. Thus the sage says: the Gate of Heaven is ever open, the Earth Gate forever closed.\n\nIf one can master these Three Essentials, spirit and qi will naturally intermingle. The *Yin Consecration Classic* states: \"The deviance of the nine apertures lies here.\" The Three Essentials correct precisely this.\n\n**The Outer Three Essentials**\nThe Outer Three Essentials are the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The mouth connects to the five viscera; what issues forth is heavy and turbid qi, belonging to yin. All the hundred grains and various flavors are the essence of Earth, entering through the mouth and joining with Earth—this is called the Earth Root. The nose connects to the six bowels; what issues forth is light and pure qi, belonging to yang, joining with Heaven—this is called the Heaven Root. The Most High said: \"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the Heaven Root.\" The nose has two apertures, the mouth one aperture—together, three apertures. This is the gate through which spirit and qi come and go. The yang spirit is the mysterious, the yin breath is the female. Within this gate dwell the celestial soul and earthly soul, merging with my spirit and qi as one—thus it is forcibly named the Mysterious Female, though it is two things.\n\n*Collected Writings on Pointing to the Dao in the Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection, \"Miscellaneous Notes\" Chapter 3*\n*(Originally titled \"Court Classic,\" should be \"Purple Court Classic.\")*\n*Collected Writings on Pointing to the Dao in the Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection, \"On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation\" Chapter 4*\n\nBai Yuchan of Hainan, from youth, served Master Chen Niyuan for nine years. One day, beneath the pines in a secluded crag, with wind clear and moon bright, the night still and mist cold, he pondered the great matter of life and death, the swiftness of impermanence. Bowing twice in reverence, he asked: \"Though I have served you but briefly, I fear my blessings are shallow and my karma slight. Dare I ask—is there a share of immortality for me in this life?\"\n\nChen Niyuan replied: \"Every person may attain it—how much more so you?\"\n\nBai Yuchan said: \"Not shirking the weight of your dignity, I venture an overbold question: How many gates are there in immortal cultivation? How many methods in elixir refinement? My understanding remains as unpolished jade—pray, grant me a single word of enlightenment.\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"Come, and I will tell you. There are three ranks in immortal cultivation, three grades in elixir refinement.\n\nThe Dao of Heavenly Immortals enables transformation and ascension—superior scholars may study it. Take the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, wisdom as fire. In a single moment, coagulation may occur; in ten months, the embryo forms. This is the superior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has no hexagrams or trigrams, no weights or measures. Its method is simple and direct, transmitted mind-to-mind—easily accomplished.\n\nThe Dao of Water Immortals enables concealment and manifestation—middling scholars may study it. Take qi as lead, spirit as mercury, noon as fire, midnight as water. In a hundred days, union may occur; in three years, the image forms. This is the middle-grade method of elixir refinement. Though it has hexagrams and trigrams, it has no weights or measures. Its method is subtle and wondrous, transmitted orally—surely attainable.\n\nThe Dao of Earthly Immortals enables the preservation of form and dwelling in the world—common scholars may study it. Take essence as lead, blood as mercury, the kidneys as water, the heart as fire. In a year, fusion may occur; in nine years, success is achieved. This is the inferior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has both hexagrams and trigrams, as well as weights and measures. Its method is complex and difficult, transmitted through texts—hard to accomplish.\n\nThe superior-grade elixir method takes spirit, qi, celestial soul, earthly soul, intent, and will as medicinal ingredients; waking, dwelling, sitting, and lying as firing times; purity and spontaneity as application.\n\nThe middle-grade elixir method takes the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as medicinal ingredients; years, months, days, and hours as firing times; embracing the One and guarding unity as application.\n\nThe inferior-grade elixir method takes essence, blood, marrow, qi, and fluids as medicinal ingredients; swallowing breath and rubbing the body as firing times; visualization of ascent and descent as application.\n\nIn general, the subtlety does not lie in following diagrams to seek a steed. Those who cling to images and adhere to texts, vainly proud and arrogant, will reach old age without achievement.\"\n\nBai Yuchan said: \"For many years, I read elixir texts as though walking through thorns. Today, the dusty mirror is bright, clouds part and the moon shines clear. All myriad methods return to the One; all illusions return to reality. Yet I still do not know—where to begin the work?\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"Excellent question! The essentials of elixir refinement: take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and cauldron; the heart as the chamber of spirit; upright sitting and cultivating stillness as gathering and extraction; vigilant attention as firing; action and cessation as advance and retreat; interruption and distraction as guarding the embankment; application as drawing and adding; true qi steaming as bathing; calming thoughts as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing deliberation as life and death; the arising of thought as the Mysterious Female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as elixir completion; transferring spirit as changing the tripod; having a body beyond the body as shedding the embryo; returning to the origin and reverting to the source as true emptiness; shattering the void as fulfillment.\n\nThus one may gather to form shape, scatter to become qi, coming and going without hindrance, carefree and natural.\"\n\nBai Yuchan asked: \"Diligent yet unmet, one must meet a perfected being; met yet indolent, one ends as a lowly ghost. What verification is there for this method of elixir refinement?\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"At the outset of elixir refinement, spirit is clear and qi is fresh, body and mind harmonious and joyful. Chronic illnesses vanish entirely; dreams cease. One may fast for a hundred days, drink wine without intoxication. At this stage, red blood is transmuted into white blood, yin qi refined into yang qi. The body becomes fiery-hot, steps swift as flight. The mouth can dry water, breath can cook meat. Facing scenes without attachment, unmoving as suchness. One may command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and rain, hear the Nine Heavens, see ten thousand miles. The body becomes purely yang, sinews of gold and bones of jade. The yang spirit manifests its form, coming and going naturally—this is the Dao of eternal life and deathlessness complete.\n\nYet I fear worldly people cling to theories of medicinal ingredients and firing times, taking them as tangible and deliberate, unable to awaken suddenly. How could they know that before the separation of primordial chaos, there were no years, months, days, or hours; before the birth of father and mother, there were no essence, blood, qi, or fluids? The Dao is originally formless—metaphorically called dragon and tiger. The Dao is originally nameless—compared to lead and mercury.\n\nIf one studies the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, one must perfect both form and spirit, merging with the Dao in true union. How can one be bound by yin and yang, fettered within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a master of the Dao.\n\nSome may doubt, saying this method resembles Chan practice. Yet know this: all day discoursing and questioning is but dry wisdom; years of withered sitting in dullness is but stubborn emptiness. The study of Heavenly Immortals is like a pearl in a crystal dish—rolling freely, lively and vibrant, naturally round and luminous. Such a Heavenly Immortal is truly a Golden Immortal.\"\n\nThis is the ineffable mystery—who knows it, who practices it? If one understands the *Vajracchedikā* and *Yuanjue* sutras, the meaning of the Golden Elixir becomes self-evident. Why distinguish between the differences of Lao and Śākya? There is no second Dao in the world, no dual mind in the sage. Moreover, each person is complete, each is perfectly realized—just as everywhere the green willows can tether a horse, every household’s gate opens onto Chang’an. One need only take the swiftest path.\n\nYu Chan says: Those who study immortality in the world are many, yet most study without encountering the Way, encounter it without practicing, practice without diligence, and in old age willingly descend to death beneath the Nine Springs. Is this not tragic? Now I set down the master’s oral instructions, carving them into wood to transmit to the world. Yet in doing so, I reveal the celestial mechanism—will I not incur blame? Niwan says: I shall transform all under heaven into immortals. If I am punished for this, would Heaven not be Heaven? The sutra says: My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. What blame could there be?\n\nYu Chan asks: Why was Ancestor Zhang Pingshu, though thrice transmitting to the unworthy, thrice afflicted with misfortune? Niwan replies: At that time, he lacked discernment, and moreover, his intent was not universal. Alas! The master may be at the edge of the sky, the disciple at the corner of the sea—how much harder is it to recognize a person amid worldly dust? Now I publish this to circulate throughout the world, so that those who cultivate immortality may seek meaning in the text, and the subtle principles will shine forth. This is truly a gift from Heaven—why rely on brush and tongue to transmit it?\n\nOne must settle into stillness, thought within no-thought, the work pure and unified, forged into a single whole. All day, silently like a hen brooding her eggs—then spirit returns to qi, and naturally the Mysterious Pass appears. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, this is the gathering of primordial qi, the mother of the Golden Elixir. Practice diligently, and in days you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. This is a proven effect, offered as guidance to those who study immortality.\n\nI have carefully compiled the essentials of these questions and answers, naming it *On Resolving Doubts in the Cultivation of Immortality*.\n\n**Discourse on the Valley Spirit That Does Not Die**\n\nThe \"valley\" is the Celestial Valley. The \"spirit\" is the original spirit of the body. The valley of Heaven harbors creation, contains emptiness; the valley of Earth holds the ten thousand things, bears mountains and rivers. Humans, sharing the same endowment as Heaven and Earth, also possess a valley. This valley stores the True One and houses the original spirit. Thus, the head has nine palaces, corresponding to the nine heavens. The central palace is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Yellow Court, Kunlun, or Celestial Valley—its names are many. It is the palace where the original spirit resides, hollow like a valley, and the spirit dwells within, hence called the Valley Spirit.\n\nWhen the spirit abides, there is life; when it departs, there is death. By day, it engages with things; by night, it meets in dreams. The spirit cannot rest in its dwelling. Before the yellow millet ripens, before waking from the Southern Branch dream, a lifetime of honor and disgrace, wealth and poverty, a century of sorrow and joy are all tasted in an instant. If it departs and does not return, wanders and does not come back, then the paths of life and death are sundered, the roads of darkness and light cut off.\n\nFrom this, we see that humans cannot give themselves life—the spirit gives them life. Humans cannot bring about their own death—the spirit brings about their death. If the spirit dwells in its valley and does not die, how can a person die? Yet the Valley Spirit does not die because of the Mysterious Female. The \"mysterious\" is yang, Heaven; the \"female\" is yin, Earth. Thus, the Mysterious Female’s two qi each have profound meanings, which cannot be known without receiving oral instructions from a perfected one.\n\nThe *Spiritual Pivot* says: The Celestial Valley’s original spirit, guarded, remains true. It speaks of the human body: above is the Celestial Valley, the Mud Pill, the palace that stores the spirit; in the middle is the Crimson Palace, the palace that stores qi; below is the Spirit Valley, the Pass of Origin, the palace that stores essence. The Celestial Valley is the primordial palace, the chamber of the original spirit, the abode of numinous nature—it is the essence of spirit.\n\nThe sage grasps the essentials of Heaven and Earth, knows the source of transformation. The spirit guards the primordial palace, qi ascends to the female’s mansion. Spirit and qi interact, naturally becoming true, uniting with the Dao, entering into neither death nor life. Thus it is said: The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe sage operates within the Mysterious Female, creating in the midst of vagueness. When the qi of the Mysterious Female enters its root, excessive restraint leads to tension, while indulgence leads to dissipation. One must make it continuous, unbroken. If one preserves it, following its natural course, the spirit will naturally calm, breath will naturally settle, nature will enter spontaneity, and the wondrous function of non-action will never reach exhaustion. Thus it is said: Use it without exertion.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the Mysterious Female is the true path of ascent and descent for the two sources of yin and yang. Worldly people, not delving into its root or investigating its source, take the nose as the mysterious and the mouth as the female. If the nose and mouth are the Mysterious Female, then what shall we call the gate of the Mysterious Female? These are all failures to reach its subtlety. Without being a great sage, how can one thoroughly investigate this principle?\n\n**Discourse on the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang**\n\nHeaven, by the Dao of qian, is light and pure, thus above. Earth, by the Dao of kun, is heavy and turbid, thus below. The primordial qi circulates between them without cease. That which is above employs yang—after the Winter Solstice, the qi of the single yang rises from Earth, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Heaven. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. That which is below employs yin, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Earth. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.\n\nA single ascent and a single descent—thus their coming and going are endless. Humans receive the harmonious qi to be born between Heaven and Earth, sharing the same body with them from the very beginning. The qi of Heaven and Earth completes one cycle in a year; the qi of the human body completes one cycle in a day. From *zi* to *si* is the time of yang’s ascent, so *zi* is regarded as the Winter Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Fu*. From *wu* to *hai* is the time of yin’s descent, so *wu* is regarded as the Summer Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Gou*. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Their alternation between day and night is just like the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s hinge, maintaining emptiness and tranquility so that the single qi circulates through the hundred bones, then when it opens, qi issues forth; when it closes, qi enters in. Qi issuing forth is like the ascent of Earth’s qi; qi entering in is like the descent of Heaven’s qi. Thus one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth. But if one rushes about in the realm of splendor or gallops in the arena of right and wrong, true qi will dissipate and no longer belong to oneself. It is better to guard the center with emptiness and stillness to nurture it.\n\nThe center is where the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Mysterious Female converges. If one can focus the mind on it without scattering, true essence will naturally arrive at dawn, primordial qi will naturally gather, the Valley Spirit will naturally connect, the Three Corpses will naturally depart, and the Nine Worms will naturally perish—this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. From this we know that true breathing and primordial qi are the root of the human body’s nature and life. Deep roots and firm stems are the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nHuman life is endowed with the single primordial qi of the great Dao. While in the mother’s womb, one shares breath with her; after birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single spark of primordial yang abides in the cinnabar field. True breathing enters and exits through the Heavenly Gate, connecting with Heaven above, ascending into the Mud Pill, meeting with the primordial spirit, and descending into the cinnabar field, communicating with primordial qi. *Zhuangzi* said: “The breath of the multitude reaches the throat; the breathing of the sage reaches the heels.” The heels represent the Dao of deep roots and firm stems. If one can banish all thoughts, true breathing will naturally settle, the body will enter the formless, and one will unite with the Dao, living long in the world. From this perspective, how can the Dao within the body not be revered? How can it not be prized?\n\nWithin the Alchemical Chamber: Discourses of Master Bai and Immortal Hu\n\nMaster Lü, crane-necked and tortoise-cheeked, chanced upon an encounter with Zhongli; Scholar Shi, deer-nosed and mouse-eared, fortuitously met the arrival of Pingshu. Alas, how rare are the seasons of hidden verdure—how can they compare to the pursuit of fame, profit, right, or wrong?\n\nThe great elixir of golden cinnabar, passed down but once in ten thousand kalpas by the ancients; the numinous scriptures of jade bamboo, wherein ten scholars are lost in nine delusions. The crow within the moon, the hare within the sun—reversing Kan and Li; the tiger in water, the dragon in fire—circulating and re-embryonating. Gathering the primordial qi of pre-heaven to serve as the marrow within lead, seizing the myriad transformations of stellar configurations to refine the essence within mercury.\n\nOnly in the moments before and after the crescent moon—at the juncture of waxing and waning—does one know: when *gui* arises, one must swiftly gather; those who remain ignorant may gaze afar but never taste. Half a catty of essence, half a catty of qi, all reside in the southwest position; one tael of cinnabar, one tael of medicine, truly dwell in the northeast quarter. Drawing the golden essence and wooden fluid into the Yellow Court, refining white snow and yellow sprouts into purple powder.\n\nAs *The Understanding Reality* says: “The divine water of the Flowery Pond knows fate’s discourse,” and further: “Gather and refine the earthly *po* and heavenly *hun*—then it is conjoined, then it is accomplished.” Like the first spark between husband and wife, ten months form the embryo; like the sovereign and minister meeting myriad affairs, the hundred officials assume their posts.\n\nAt winter solstice when the sun reaches its zenith, engage in field battle; at summer solstice when the season reaches its peak, hold the city fast. All this requires but a moment’s effort—verification comes in a single day. Calculating the nine-three and two-eight, it lies solely in the Maiden’s search for gold; reckoning the seven-six and one-three, it rests entirely with the Yellow Dame and Elder Ding. No need to peruse ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics—just a single oral formula suffices.\n\nYour coming here is earnest; I know you have sought this for years, for unless you possessed such noble bones from a former life, how could you devote body and mind to this in a single day? From gathering the medicine to forming the embryo, from firing the process to shedding the body—it encompasses the subtleties of withdrawal and addition, depicts the mechanism of bathing. No worry of separation between metal and wood, but the joy of water and earth sharing the same homeland. Only nurturing is needed—no hardship remains.\n\nWithin the twelve hours, only one hour matters; within three hundred days, only half a day. When the Elixir Field holds its substance, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, there is no sorrow. When the Purple Palace records your name, life and death become mere exchanges, no longer a burden. Joy and clarity arise—henceforth, leisure. Even amidst bustle, this work can be practiced.\n\nIn discussing the profound, all connections are made in an instant—gathered yet never scattered, refined to ever greater firmness. The cinnabar tripod and crescent moon furnace—what difficulty is there in finding them? Guard the cauldron at the center of the altar, and seek only within yourself.\n\nOne must recognize yin and yang, understand the Mysterious Female. When dragon essence fills the tripod, dispatch the Golden Lad down the twelve-story tower; when phoenix marrow overflows the vessel, command the Jade Maiden to announce it across the three thousand worlds. At this moment, the elixir is ripe—then, like a loving mother cherishing her infant, soon the clouds will ascend, and the True Person will appear before the Emperor on High.\n\n*Miscellaneous Writings on Cultivating the True: Pointers to the Mysterious, Scroll Four concludes*\n*Miscellaneous Writings on Cultivating the True: Pointers to the Mysterious, Scroll Five*\n*The Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir, with Preface*\n*By Perfected Zhang Ziyang*\n\nThe Seven Returns and Nine Reversions Great Elixir of Golden Liquor refers to seven as the number of fire and nine as the number of metal. Refining metal with fire to return to the root and revert to the source is called the Golden Elixir. Divide body and mind into the upper and lower arcs, distinguish spirit and qi by the winter and summer solstices, and unite form and spirit with the Kan and Li trigrams. With the wood that restrains the hun-soul, the metal of the west’s po-soul, the fire of the south’s spirit, the water of the north’s essence, and the earth of the central intent, this is called the interpenetration of the Five Phases. By containing the light of the eyes and condensing the resonance of the ears, regulating the breath of the nose and sealing the qi of the tongue, this is called the harmonization of the Four Images. When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul abides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence abides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, the spirit abides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul abides in the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, the intent abides in the spleen—this is called the Five Qi Returning to the Origin. Refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness, the qi abides in the spleen without leaking from the four limbs or orifices—this is called \"non-leakage.\" As essence is refined, it is called the \"Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown.\" When the hun-soul abides in the liver without leaking from the eyes, the po-soul in the lungs without leaking from the nose, the spirit in the heart without leaking from the mouth, and the essence in the kidneys without leaking from the ears, intent, spirit, hun-soul, and po-soul blend and merge, transforming into a single qi—imperceptible, formless, and nameless—this is called \"emptiness and non-being.\"\n\nTo refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence aroused by lust. To refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose. To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and concerns. Thus, this spirit, qi, and essence share the same root as heaven and earth and the same body as the myriad things. Obtaining them brings life; losing them brings death. Refining them with yang fire transforms them into yang qi; nurturing them with yin talismans transforms them into golden essence—thus, \"what is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen.\"\n\nThe body is the dwelling of the heart; the heart is the master of the body. The heart’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger. Within the body resides a single point of true yang qi; within the heart resides a single point of true yin essence—these are called the \"Two Things.\" The heart belongs to Qian; the body belongs to Kun—thus, they are the cauldron and vessel of Qian and Kun. Yang qi belongs to Li; yin essence belongs to Kan—thus, they are the medicine of the Crow and Hare. Embracing the One and guarding the center, refining the primordial and nurturing simplicity—this is called \"gathering the primordial qi of pre-heaven.\" From dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, from noon’s yang to midnight’s yin—this is called \"circulating the fire times of the celestial cycle.\" Wood fluid flourishes at *mao*; metal essence flourishes at *you*—thus, one must bathe. The Zhen male drinks the wine of the west; the Dui female plucks the flower of the north. The Xun wind stirs the six yangs; the Kun earth stores their number—thus, one must withdraw and replenish.\n\nAt the outset of gathering the medicine, one moves the key of Qian and Kun and takes the *daogui* of Li and Kan. At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains; next, like the moon cradling ten thousand waters. Naturally, it resembles the union of tortoise and snake, the pacing of horse and ox. Yet one does not realize: the dragon contends for the hun-soul, the tiger for the po-soul, the crow for essence, the hare for spirit. Within the indistinct, true lead appears; within the profound darkness, true mercury exists. With the Yellow Dame as matchmaker, guard the Central Palace. Lead flees at the sight of fire; mercury scatters at the sight of fire. Thus, blend them with the oil of non-action and stabilize them with the uncarved jade. Lead returns to the Kun palace; mercury returns to the Qian position. True earth blends them, containing light in silence.\n\nWhen the fire’s number is excessive, it scorches; when the water’s measure is too great, it overflows. The scorching of fire and the overflow of water must be balanced—thus, there are the methods of weights and measures. At this stage of refinement, wind arises in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and waves settle in the Valley Sea. The spine turns like a wheel; the four limbs become like mountain stone. The pores feel as if just risen from a bath; bones and channels are as if in deep slumber. Spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy; hun-soul and po-soul cling like mother and child. This is the true realm, not a metaphor.\n\nRefining with method gathers without scattering; refining with weights and measures binds ever more firmly. The hun-soul is stored; the po-soul is extinguished. Essence congeals; spirit solidifies. A single intent of harmonious qi pervades, and the skin becomes radiant. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers. From formlessness, form arises—thus, the Sacred Embryo is formed.\n\nA year has twelve months; a month has thirty days; a day has one hundred *ke*. A month totals three thousand *ke*; ten months total thirty thousand *ke*. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying, one continuously abides in it. Once the fetal qi congeals, the infant manifests; the Mysterious Pearl takes form; the Great One contains the true. Thus, within these thirty thousand *ke*, one can seize the thirty thousand years of heaven. Why? Because each *ke* of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal cycle—thus, thirty thousand *ke* can seize thirty thousand years. A year has twelve months, totaling thirty-six thousand *ke*. Even the dullest and most ignorant person, by practicing this, can ascend to the sacred realm. Yet how is it that the common people daily neglect it?\n\nThe loss of the primordial, the exhaustion of primordial qi, the impurity of primordial spirit—thus, in these thirty thousand *ke*, each *ke* must be harmonized. If even a single *ke* deviates, the medicinal materials dissipate, and the fire times falter. Thus, it is said: \"A hair’s difference, and the elixir will not form.\" One must act in every *ke*, yet the effort is not laborious. True qi congeals; primordial spirit expands. Internally, one refines the elixir of thirty thousand *ke* in a year; externally, one seizes the thirty thousand years of a lifetime. In greatness, one forms the embryo of thirteen thousand five hundred breaths in a day; in smallness, one circulates the qi of eighty-four thousand *li* in twelve hours. Thus, it is said: \"Seize the single yang of heaven and earth, gather the dual qi of sun and moon, circulate true water in the lead furnace, and move true fire in the mercury cauldron.\"\n\nWhen lead encounters mercury, it is called the Flowery Pond; when mercury enters lead, it is called divine water. One must not cling to non-action, nor manifest in forced effort; one must not be rigid in visualization, nor attached to holding and guarding; one must not sit in lifeless stillness, nor practice blindly and recklessly. The greatest fear is not knowing the source of the medicinal materials, or being ignorant of the methods and measures of fire times. One must know the single aperture within the body, called the Mysterious Female. This aperture is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nTo know this single aperture is to know where the winter solstice resides, where the medicinal materials lie, where the fire times are found, where bathing occurs, where the embryo forms, and where the body is shed. This aperture has no boundaries, no inside or outside; it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness. Seek it within the body—it cannot be sought elsewhere. This aperture of essence cannot be conjectured by private speculation; it must be transmitted heart-to-mouth. Without such transmission, all efforts are in vain.\n\nHerein lies this *Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir*, encompassing the root of creation and transformation, threading through the marrow of yin and yang. It guides those who refine the elixir to trace the stream and know the source, to abandon delusion and follow truth, lest they forget the root and chase the branches.\n\nThe golden elixir arises from nothingness and is nurtured along its path. Yet its birth from nothingness must not be forced into the form of an infant; how can one cling to images and texts and drown in crooked byways and empty spaces? Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, and that within nothingness there is indeed something—this is true emptiness.\n\nNow, as Ma Ziran departs, he speaks these words for your reflection:\n\nTrue earth captures true lead,\nTrue lead restrains true mercury.\nLead and mercury return to true earth,\nBody and mind still and unmoving.\n\nTrue earth is the earth within the body. Lead and mercury are the water and fire within the body. With earth restraining water, lead may be captured; with water restraining fire, mercury may be controlled. Why are lead-water and mercury-fire both subdued by true earth? Only when body and mind unite in stillness can earth, water, and wood merge as one—this is the method of gathering medicinal materials into the furnace and cauldron.\n\nFrom emptiness, white snow is born;\nFrom stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.\nThe jade furnace’s fire glows warmly,\nAbove the cauldron, purple mist soars.\n\nWhite snow must arise from emptiness, for it is born from nothingness. The yellow sprout must be nurtured by fire, for fire gives birth to earth. Just as in the months of *zi* and *chou*, when yang qi has yet to stir and all things vanish into nothingness, white snow descends from heaven. By the months of *yin* and *mao*, when yang qi gradually flourishes and stillness holds movement within, the yellow sprout emerges from the earth. Once white snow and yellow sprout appear, the fire of the jade furnace need only be warmly nurtured, and naturally, purple mist will rise above the cauldron. If the fire is too fierce, it will scatter all.\n\nThe lotus of the Flowery Pond blooms,\nDivine water’s golden waves grow still.\nDeep in the night, the moon shines bright,\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\n\nThe *hua* is the flower, akin to fire. The *shen* is the heart, which belongs to fire. The essence of the golden elixir lies in divine water, for the Flowery Pond embodies the principle of water and fire in harmony. When waves within water become clear and serene, fire gives birth to the lotus, and the flower naturally blooms. At midnight, the hour of *zi*, when the first yang stirs, the moon shines fully, its golden light illuminating heaven and earth as a single bright mirror.\n\nCinnabar refines yang qi,\nQuicksilver cooks gold essence.\nGold essence and yang qi—\nCinnabar and quicksilver.\n\nYang qi is the single spark of true yang within the body. Gold essence is the single drop of true yin within the heart. Refined with yang fire, it becomes like cinnabar; nurtured with yin tally, it becomes like quicksilver. Cinnabar and quicksilver are external substances; using external medicines to describe the inner elixir is a last resort for immortals.\n\nThe sun’s soul is the jade hare’s marrow,\nThe moon’s spirit is the golden crow’s essence.\nGathered into the cauldron,\nThey transform into a pool of water.\n\nThe soul governs wood, and wood gives birth to fire, so spirit is stored in the soul. The spirit governs metal, and metal gives birth to water, so essence is stored in the spirit. If one can nourish spirit by absorbing wind and nurture essence by absorbing qi, then spirit and essence merge and harmonize within the cauldron, transforming into a pool of water.\n\nMedicinal materials arise in the mysterious aperture,\nFire times ignite the yang furnace.\nWhen dragon and tiger meet,\nThe precious cauldron yields the mysterious pearl.\n\nThe medicinal materials—crow’s liver, hare’s marrow, red mercury, black lead—all arise within the mysterious aperture. If one can rouse the fire of samadhi within the yang furnace, then dragon and tiger will meet, refining metal and wood to give birth to the yellow sprout, and finally producing a single grain of the mysterious pearl.\n\nThis aperture is no ordinary thing,\nFormed by the union of heaven and earth.\nCalled the cavity of spirit and qi,\nWithin it lies the essence of *kan* and *li*.\n\nThe aperture of the Mysterious Female is no common object. Before this body existed, this aperture was already present. It is neither above nor below, neither within nor without—it is the primordial aperture. At the moment of the body’s conception, the father’s essence and the mother’s blood joined to form it, becoming the cavity of spirit and qi, which holds the essence of water and fire.\n\nA single red drop of wood-mercury,\nThree pounds of black metal-lead.\nLead and mercury congeal into cinnabar,\nGlowing with the radiant hue of purple gold.\n\nThe homestead’s scenery is fair,\nWind and rain deepen spring’s care.\nNo plow nor hoe labors in vain,\nFor all the earth turns gold again.\n\nThe \"homestead\" is the true soil within the body,\nThe \"scenery\" the medicinal substances therein.\nWhen the first yang revives,\nWind stirs it, rain nourishes it.\nBy the time the three yangs harmonize in *Tai*,\nThough plow and hoe spare no effort,\nGolden sprouts burst forth from the soil—\nCalled \"gold\" for the hue of the yellow sprout.\n\nTrue lead is born in *Kan*,\nIts function lies in *Li*.\nFrom black it transforms to red,\nA single cauldron thick with cloudy qi.\nTrue mercury arises in *Li*,\nIts function returns to *Kan*.\nThe old woman crosses the southern garden,\nHolding a jade olive in hand.\n\nTrue lead is the northern essence of water,\nAscending to the palace of *Li*.\nTrue mercury is the southern spirit of fire,\nDescending to the gate of *Kan*.\nWhen lead and mercury unite as one,\nSeen closely, they show red and black;\nFrom afar, they resemble a jade olive.\nThe old woman crosses the southern garden riding a dragon,\nThe infant travels northward astride a tiger.\nThe dragon coils in the golden cauldron,\nThe tiger dwells in the cinnabar field.\nClouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger—\nWithin the cauldron, misty vapors rise in swirling steam.\n\n*Zhen* and *Dui* are not east and west,\n*Kan* and *Li* not south and north.\nThe Dipper’s handle circles the heavens,\nOne must grasp its convergence.\n*Zhen* and *Dui*, *Kan* and *Li*—\nNot mere directions of east, west, south, or north,\nBut the trigrams’ qi of heaven and earth.\nLike the Dipper’s handle pointing to the lunar station,\nCircling the heavens in a single day,\nThe fire-sign within the body completes its cycle in an instant.\nIf one cannot fuse the Five Phases,\nHow can one match the Dipper’s revolution?\n\nThe firing times do not rely on seasons,\nWinter solstice is not confined to *Zi*.\nWhen it comes to the bathing method,\n*Mao* and *You* are likened to emptiness.\nThe great firing schedule is not bound to winter solstice at *Zi* or summer solstice at *Wu*.\nNor is bathing fixed to spring equinox at *Mao* or autumn equinox at *You*.\nOnce the fire is kindled within the body,\nThe celestial cycle naturally includes withdrawal and bathing—\nNo need to cling to the four seasons.\n\nCrow’s liver and hare’s marrow,\nSeized and brought to one place.\nGrain by grain they accumulate,\nFrom subtle to substantial.\nThe crow’s liver is the sun’s soul,\nThe hare’s marrow the moon’s essence.\nRefined together by fire,\nEach day a grain the size of millet forms,\nGrowing from subtle to substantial.\nAfter thirty days, it weighs thirty-eight *zhū* and four *sù*;\nAfter three hundred days, three hundred eighty-four *zhū*,\nRound and one *cùn* in size, weighing one *jīn*.\n\nChaos embraces the void,\nThe void encompasses the Three Realms.\nYet trace it to its root—\nA single grain the size of millet.\nChaos is the union of yin and yang,\nThe convergence of the Five Phases and harmony of the Four Images.\nIts measure equals the void, and the void contains it;\nIt roams the Three Realms, and the Three Realms contain it.\nYet seek its origin,\nAnd it begins at the Gate of the Mysterious Female,\nAs small as a grain of millet.\n\nHeaven and earth exchange true fluids,\nSun and moon hold true essence.\nGrasp the foundation of *Kan* and *Li*,\nAnd the Three Realms return to one body.\nWhen the heart’s fluid descends and the kidney’s fluid ascends,\nHeaven and earth exchange true fluids.\nThe soul is the crow’s essence,\nThe spirit the hare’s marrow—\nThus sun and moon contain true essence.\nIf one understands the union of *Kan* and *Li*,\nThe Gate of Heaven opens, the Earth’s Door closes,\nThe sun shines on Kunlun, the moon rises from the sea—\nAnd the Three Realms reside within this single body.\n\nThe dragon comes from the Eastern Sea,\nThe tiger rises from the Western Mountains.\nThe two beasts battle fiercely,\nTransforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.\n*Zhen* is the Azure Dragon, coming from the Eastern Sea.\n*Dui* is the White Tiger, rising from the Western Mountains.\nWhen the dragon’s roar summons clouds to descend,\nAnd the tiger’s howl stirs winds to ascend,\nThe two beasts meet and clash before the Yellow Chamber—\nWind and cloud rejoice in union,\nMerging into a single marrow.\n\nGolden blossoms open mercury leaves,\nJade buds grow lead branches.\n*Kan* and *Li* never rest,\nHow long until *Qian* and *Kun*?\nThe golden blossom is the essence of metal,\nAbove, it opens mercury leaves.\nThe jade bud is the fluid of jade,\nBelow, it grows lead branches.\nIf one ensures *Kan* and *Li* never idle,\nA moment’s work can steal a year’s time from heaven and earth—\nHow much time is truly needed?\n\nBathing guards against peril,\nWithdrawal and addition must be carefully maintained.\nIn all, thirty thousand moments—\nA hair’s breadth of error brings failure.\nBathing is the method of transcendence,\nLike ascending a seven-tiered pagoda or a three-story pavilion,\nOne must guard against danger.\nWithdrawal and addition are the path to primordial unity—\nYang rises at the start of *Zi*, yin begins after *Wu*.\nWithout vigilance, loss is inevitable.\nA day has one hundred moments,\nA month three thousand.\nMoment by moment, the work proceeds without weariness.\nIn ten months, thirty thousand moments can seize thirty thousand cycles.\nBut the slightest deviation—\nAnd the elixir will not form.\n\nWhen husband and wife unite,\nTheir chamber fills with clouds and rain.\nAfter a year, a child is born,\nEach one able to ride a crane.\nThe infant of *Kan* and the maiden of *Li*,\nIf the Yellow Matchmaker unites them as husband and wife,\nTheir chamber joins in union,\nClouds disperse, rain ceases—\nAnd the sacred embryo forms.\nAfter a year, the child is born,\nRiding a crane forth from the Niwan Palace.\nTen months of gestation,\nTwo months of bathing—\nTogether, a full year.\n\nAfter annotating *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*,\nFive regulated verses were composed.\nThe first four on metal, wood, water, fire, and earth speak of the foundation of life;\nThe last speaks of the foundation of nature.\nNature is the substance of life,\nLife is the function of nature—\nFor the Four Images and Five Phases all rely on earth.\n\nWithin it lie the crucible, the medicinal ingredients, the talismanic fire, the method and measure, the extraction and addition, the bathing, the embryo’s formation, and the liberation of the body.\n\nThough these lines borrow from the worn and flawed,\nThey still await the refining hand of a master—\nThus do I place my hopes in those who have gone before.\n\nA Postscript in Verse\n\nI.\nWhat in the human body is the Golden Elixir?\nIn the dim and indistinct, true yang turns inward to observe.\nWind from the heavens stirs the clear waves to a boil,\nThunder from the earth coils purple clouds in its wake.\nNight after night, the jade crucible smelts lead to submission,\nHour after hour, the golden tripod tempers mercury to dryness.\nHold the fire steady for seven hundred and twenty breaths—\nA thunderclap in Niwan Palace, and a chill of awakening arises.\n\nII.\nA path through the Magpie Bridge leads to the Mysterious Pass,\nErecting the crucible and setting the furnace is not arduous.\nThe Four Images harmonize, relying on earth,\nThe Three Flowers converge, returning to the mountain.\nAt midnight, it enters Kunlun’s realm,\nAfter noon, it circulates to inquire of the vast sea.\nWait until the jade flask’s transmutation is complete—\nThen, from the crown of the head, a transformed immortal emerges.\n\nIII.\nTo know the inversion of the Five Phases:\nThe dragon dwells in the mountains, the tiger in the fields.\nFrom the Xun Palace, the fire of Qian’s heaven is blown forth,\nAt Li’s position, the spring of Kun’s earth is unsealed.\nIn *Fu* and *Shen*, extraction and addition must be cautious,\nIn *Zhun* and *Meng*, bathing demands diligence.\nIf one can recognize the place of one’s own birth,\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, and a celestial being emerges.\n\nIV.\nFor years uncounted, the Dao has been attained,\nAbove the Mysterious Pass, one swings like a pendulum.\nThe golden crow prefers to roost on mountain peaks,\nThe jade hare often slumbers in the depths of the sea.\nA single qi steams upward from the north,\nThe three armies transport it toward the east.\nI do not reveal the secrets of heaven lightly—\nOnly fear that the deluded will spread chaos in their zeal.\n\nV.\nBeyond the teachings of Caoxi, a separate transmission flows,\nFor the awakened, what matter if it comes before or after?\nThe field of nature blends into a single expanse,\nThe pearl of the heart shines clearly, illuminating the Three Fields.\nŚākyamuni’s extinction was not true death,\nBodhidharma’s western return was also that of an immortal.\nIf only the world could grasp this principle,\nTogether we would transcend the other shore, needing no boat.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Works on Pointing to the Mystery, Scroll Five* concludes.\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the True: Miscellaneous Works on Pointing to the Mystery, Scroll Six*\nIn gratitude to Zhang Ziyang’s writings,\nBy Bai Yuchan.\n\nI bow my head a hundred times in reverent reply to the Venerable Master of Tiantai, the Perfected One of Realizing the True, the True Man Zhang of Purple Yang’s gate. On this day, as spring’s winds and rains awaken, all things grow verdant and chill. I humbly pray that the celestial spirits of water, grass, and valley, the divine soldiers of heaven and earth, left and right, may overflow with dragon essence, that the fire-tending remains serene and still, that golden flowers fill the chamber, and that root and destiny be restored.\n\nI have heard it said: “There is no second Dao in the world, no dual heart in the sage.” The greatness of the Dao cannot be captured in form or description; if one were to describe this Dao, it would be emptiness, stillness, and void—subtly profound, deep, and silent. The vastness of the heart cannot be compared or likened; if one were to liken this heart, it would be purity, clarity, spiritual luminosity—harmonious, warm, and refined.\n\nWhen the myriad transformations return to the one Dao, then all under heaven transforms itself, and the ten thousand things are naturally as they are. When the hundred deeds return to the one heart, then the sage naturally acts without acting, and all things arise without attachment. Extend this heart to merge with the Dao, and this heart is the Dao; embody this Dao to unite with the heart, and this Dao is the heart. The Dao fuses with the heart, the heart fuses with the Dao. Beyond the heart, there is no separate Dao; beyond the Dao, there is no separate thing.\n\nThus, heaven and earth were never originally Qian and Kun, yet the ten thousand things naturally embody Qian and Kun. The sun and moon were never originally separated from Kan, yet the ten thousand things naturally partake of Kan’s departure. Reflecting on our Dao Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao, who enlightened the world with this Dao and clarified the heart for the sage: this Dao in the world cannot be objectified or transformed by things. Therefore, the principles of objectification and transformation exist in the world but not in this Dao. This Dao is thusness itself; to unite this heart with this Dao is fitting.\n\nThis heart in the sage cannot be known by knowledge or recognized by recognition; such principles exist in the sage but not in this heart. This heart is thusness itself; to unite this Dao with this heart is fitting. The Dao pulses through this heart, the heart marrowizes this Dao. I know not which is Dao and which is heart. I only perceive the indistinct and vague, the dim and obscure—something like a thing yet not a thing, something like an image yet not an image. If one listens with the ears, the eyes hear; if one looks with the eyes, the ears see. I fear this can only be named the marrow of yin and yang, the essence of chaos, the root of emptiness, the stem of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe ancients, not knowing, forcibly named it the Dao. From today’s perspective, calling a rainbow a rainbow is but deluded refinement; pointing to jade as jade is but empty rhetoric. Is this not the Golden Elixir? Now, to know the wonder of the Golden Elixir, why fabricate the illusion of a furnace or cling to the form of a crucible? The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are not the visible Yellow Sprout and White Snow; the Divine Water and Flower Pool are not the usable Divine Water and Flower Pool. If likened to lead essence and mercury marrow, or compared to gold essence and wood liquid—where is the furnace for refining the crescent moon? Where is the crucible for smelting cinnabar? Knowing this, one says: the sun’s crow and moon’s hare, the heavenly horse and earthly ox.\n\nQian and Kun originally have no use for departing Kan, just as Kan has no substance of Qian and Kun. Red lead and black mercury—are these not the mating of dragon and tiger? White gold and black tin—are these not the union of tortoise and snake? The numbers two, eight, nine, and three are all variant meanings of yin and yang; the measures of jin, zhu, and liang are but remnants of chaos. In essence, they are harmonized and balanced, drawn out and applied. Thus, these medicinal substances are not materials of metal, stone, herbs, or wood; this fire-tending is not measured by years, months, days, or hours.\n\nBefore father and mother were born, there were already endless living paths. After body and mind cease movement, the infinite true mechanism of the limitless remains. Formerly, by long-standing karmic affinity, a withered bone was revived by a needle’s touch. Having long attended the master’s side, I have fortunately tasted the Dharma-milk. It is said: the essence of refining the Golden Elixir is to gather medicinal substances within stillness and conduct the fire-tending within non-action. It is to bathe in the union of spirit and qi, to match form and spirit. Only then does one realize that within the heart lies boundless medicinal material, and within the body lies boundless fire symbols.\n\nAwakening to this, one refines the Elixir thus; cultivating the Dao thus, one carves stone to seek jade, refines sand to obtain gold, tempers the form to nurture spirit, and clarifies the mind to merge with the Dao—all are of one intent. This is the principle of extracting mercury from lead and cinnabar from sand. Proceeding accordingly, husband and wife unite.\n\nApplying this principle to the Confucian classics, it is one; applying it to the Buddhist scriptures, it is one. Thus, there is no second Dao in the world. Since the Dao of heaven has no dual principles, how could the heart of the sage have two uses? Within form, spirit is sovereign, for spirit is the destiny of form; within spirit, nature is the ultimate, for nature is the destiny of spirit. From the spirit within form uniting with the nature within spirit—this is called returning to the root and restoring destiny.\n\nThis Dao is most clear, this heart no longer deluded. The secret of the seven returns and nine reversions is not transmitted in the world. The seven returns and nine reversions signify returning to the origin and reverting to the source. The numbers seven and nine are both yang numbers. If one can be without heart in the heart, without thought in thought, utterly pure and without blemish—this is called pure yang. At this time, the Three Corpses vanish, the Six Thieves surrender, and even if a body exists outside the body, it is not yet extraordinary. Only when emptiness is pulverized does the whole body fully appear.\n\nThe shallow understanding of the vulgar, the superficial learning of common folk—how could they know that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the celestial and terrestrial immortals daily gather medicinal substances without cease, and that the more they gather, the more inexhaustible the medicinal substances become? How could they know that the mountains, rivers, and great earth, along with the dull and the sentient, constantly tend the fire without pause, and that the more the fire is tended, the more it does not rest?\n\nOnly this fire-tending and these medicinal substances—follow them and you remain mortal; reverse them and you become a sage. As the ancient saying goes: *\"When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields its seven treasures; when the Five Phases flow in order, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit.\"* Such is the principle.\n\nThe former masters Master Niyuan and Perfected One Cuixu emerged from the lineage of the Venerable Master Piling, Master Xue. Yet the thread of Piling’s transmission truly originated with the Venerable Master Xinglin, Master Shi. Master Shi inherited the Dao of Ancestral Master Ziyang. Viewing the single transmission of today, one might say that the nightlong dream of Xihua at Tiantai in former times was nothing other than a blessing for later generations—a boon to the myriad spirits.\n\nIn recent years, Master Niyuan led me to the immortal cavern of Huodong, where we burned incense and bowed reverently. The ancestral masters Xinglin and Piling responded to our fervent invocations, touching our bodies and grasping our ears to return with us, deepening our resolve to embrace the feminine and hold fast to the One. When I arrived at Wuyi and met Ma Ziran, he spoke earnestly, presenting a sacred scroll of four hundred words. Each character was a healing stone; gazing upon it, I recognized the nurturing love, as sweet dew bathed my heart, and my very bones and marrow felt suddenly clear.\n\nSince the wondrous Dao has become manifest, I have long dwelled at Zhiti. Now, as he prepares to depart like an infant torn from its mother, he wishes to visit Qingcheng Mountain. Passing by chance through Shiwu Cavern, I was moved to send this brief letter. Here, I have described only the essence of the great elixir of golden cinnabar. As for the mechanism of the plantain flower in spring wind, the secret of the parasol tree in autumn rain, the midnight moon over the emerald pool, and the evening clouds above the green mountains—such profound mysteries dare not be openly revealed, for they pertain to the celestial workings.\n\nHas the ancestral master nodded in approval?\n\nThe three masters—Xinglin, Piling, and Niyuan—must now soar like cranes on paired wings. Ashamed that the path of immortals and mortals remains divided, I wonder when my work of refinement will be complete, when I may ride the spirit and command the qi, to stand beneath their soaring sandals and serve in the calling of phoenixes and cranes. As I write, my longing overflows, tears staining the brush, leaving me disoriented and at a loss.\n\nI humbly beseech you to send a purple raft or ascend a cinnabar ladder, to store up golden sand and extend your hand to the multitude of creatures. I dare not elaborate further.\n\n**A Letter in Gratitude to the Immortal Master**\n\nThe golden elixir is forged by gathering the medicine of two eights and nurturing the embryo for three hundred days. The work of the heart lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling qi; the primordial creation requires gathering qi and congealing spirit. To practice this, one must rely on oral instructions—utterly simple, utterly easy, neither form nor emptiness.\n\nWithin the formless, nurture the infant; within yin, refine yang qi. Let the Metal Lord capture the living tiger; let the Maiden of Cinnabar ride the crimson dragon alone. The Heavenly Husband and Earthly Wife, with the Yellow Dame as matchmaker; the Maiden of Li and the Lad of Kan, uniting to form the crimson child. A single furnace’s flame refines emptiness into motes of dust; a vast ice-pot reflects the world as a grain of millet.\n\nWhen spirit returns to the four great elements, it is the moment of the tortoise and serpent’s union; when qi enters the four limbs, it is the place where the crow and hare gather. The jade gourd yields golden liquid; the golden sprout blossoms into a white jade flower. At the hour when wind chimes tinkle and the moon shines bright—who grasps the meaning of green mountains and flowing waters?\n\nThe sagely masters, mouth to mouth, have transmitted this through the ages, heart to heart. Even if one were to thread together ten thousand immortal classics, a single moment’s work brings boundless ease. First, clarify the Three-Five-One, and refine it with the true fire of the nine yangs. Later, when it reaches ten thousand, a hundred, a thousand, the infant’s treasure is complete.\n\nA mountain of silver, a wall of iron—a single thrust of the awl pierces the golden lock and jade gate, and each step becomes naturally unimpeded. One sees a realm of ten thousand miles without a speck of dust and becomes a person of a thousand years, never to die. The seas turn to mulberry fields, yet I wander in carefree realms; my robe wears away the stone of kalpas, and together we return to the land of Nothing Whatsoever.\n\nThe white toad’s original vow remains unfulfilled, my initial sincerity and past reverence unshaken. I sigh at my reed-like nature, now nearing the twilight years. Yet my aged cheeks still flush red, as if destined for immortality; my youthful beard darkens again, returning at last to the source of virtue and the Dao.\n\nI lament that the ancients spoke of sixty-four as the age of retirement, yet I have received the eighty-one chapters of the former sages to enjoy. My village breast weeps tears; I seal my lips and press my hand to my heart. All my past efforts and labors were like grasping at shadows—today, in the realm of the formless, the alchemical method turns iron into gold.\n\nI revere the sagely masters Niyuan Nie and Perfected One Cuixu—heroes of the age, with the skill to mend the heavens. Their hearts transmit the profound intent of clouds and rain; their hands wield the mighty power of thunder. I, Yu Chan, am indebted to three generations of masters, awaiting the true chariot for a thousand years. I spoke of the medicinal spoon on an autumn evening in *guiyou*, and exhausted the workings of Kan and Li in the spring rains of *yihai*.\n\n**Miscellaneous Writings on the Pointers to the Mysteries

Above and the immortals,\nWhose secret mysteries lift one from the mortal coil.\nIn the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, incense is added;\nDaily, a pure breeze sweeps the ancient altar.\n\nThe cypress, tender and supple, coils like a dragon;\nThe withered wutong cannot mend a broken zither.\nWisteria vines spread into a canopy of blossoms;\nThe jade’s laughter bears not a single flaw.\n\nOn the

the west, Yin Xi watches.\n\nThe master chants the *Dao and Virtue*, teaching enlightenment;\nThe alchemical classics must be passed mouth to mouth.\nWhen will the craving for fame and profit ever

its bones;\nThe cicada transforms by drinking dew.\n\nThe crane, with its crimson crown, lives three thousand years;\nThe tortoise, drinking from the pearl pond, knows no count of years.\nThe dew’s nectar, brewed, is offered for others to drink;\nThe immortal’s herbs are ever served to wandering guests.\n\nAll things return to their root and restore their mandate—\nYet those who study the Dao

kinship—\nIn the depths of the bridal chamber, true clouds and rain.\n\n**XXXIII**\nTrue *ding*-elder, true yellow matron.\nThe *ding*-elder moves the fire to refine the golden flower;\nThe yellow matron nurtures the golden goose within the bottle.\n\n**XXXIV**\nTrue infant, true red child.\nNine revolutions refine it into a ten-month embryo—\nPure yang without yin, life never dies.\n\n**XXXV**\nTrue yin-yang, true yin-yang.\nYin and yang are but two words,\nYet they illustrate the elixir texts of myriad chapters.\n\n**Postscript**\nThose who refine the golden elixir must know:\nThe winter solstice is not at the *zi* hour, nor is bathing at *mao* or *you*.\nLead and mercury are neither saliva, nor essence, nor *qi*, nor blood, nor fluid.\n\nThe seven returns are the return to the root;\nThe nine refinements are the restoration of the source.\nWhen gold essence and wood liquid meet earth, they unite—\nDragon, tiger, horse, and ox are all without form.\n\nThe former master’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:\nThe essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond—\nThat is, lead and mercury.\nIf one knows the source of lead, then one knows where mercury is produced.\nOnce lead and mercury are known, then the divine water and flowery pond are known.\nOnce the divine water and flowery pond are known, then the golden elixir may be refined.\nThe golden elixir’s work is accomplished in an instant—\nDo not cling to the nine-year, three-year timeline,\nNor rigidly adhere to years, months, days, or hours in its operation.\n\nZhongli Quan said:\nThe four great elements of the body all belong to yin.\nThus, one cannot seek within the body—\nOne may only pursue the single spark of yang essence within.\nYet this yang essence resides in an aperture,\nWhich ordinary people cannot fathom.\nThis single aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,\nThe very flowery pond of spirit.\nKnowing this, one may then gather and refine,\nThen unite and congeal, then refine and bathe,\nAnd finally nurture to form the elixir.\nHow can the elixir be completed without discerning the source,\nKnowing the weight, or recognizing the time?\n\nSince receiving the master’s transmission,\nI have known this body cannot die,\nAnd that this elixir must be achieved.\nNow that the great work is underway,\nI proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.\n\n—Preface by Yao Lin Shi Tai\n\n**The Ten Precepts of Cultivating the Dao**\n\n1.

Do not overindulge in wine or consume forbidden meats.\n   Instead, regulate your qi and temperament, and devote yourself to purity and emptiness.\n\n7. Do not be insatiably greedy, hoarding wealth without sharing.\n   Instead, practice frugality and relieve the poor and needy.\n\n8.

Do not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or untrustworthy.\n   Instead, fulfill your duties to ruler and teacher, and extend sincerity to all things.\n\n10. Do not treat speech and laughter lightly or act without authenticity.\n    Instead, always maintain integrity and modesty, and make the Dao and virtue your foremost concern.\n\nThose who uphold these Ten Precepts shall ascend as immortals.\n\n*Song of Guarding Life* by Master Shuxi of the Western Mountains\n\nIn this world, tales abound of those who consume elixirs or feast on immortal fruits to ascend in broad daylight—yet such wonders remain unseen. As for the arts of cultivating qi, they closely align with the Way of nurturing life. Humans are born with qi and blood, and as the *Treatise on Nurturing Life* states: \"The essence of nurturing life lies in removing what harms it.\" This is a clear truth.\n\nThe *Song of Dispelling Illness* I have compiled distills the essentials of nurturing life from various schools. Those who follow it shall attain peace and joy; if its profound subtleties are fully realized, longevity may also be within reach.\n\nThe song says:\nOf all things, humans are most noble,\nA hundred years of life but a fleeting sojourn.\nWithout intent to cultivate and nurture,\nIllness and suffering shall weigh upon the heart.\n\nExamine your diet and desires,\nRemove excesses to find ease.\nWhy chase cloud-gazing or alchemical pills,\nFalsely seeking to extend life like tortoises or cranes?\n\nAfter eating, walk a hundred steps at a leisurely pace,\nRub your hands together and massage your abdomen.\nThen turn your hands to stroke the kidneys,\nThis is called \"moving Water and Earth.\"\n\nLook up and exhale three or four times,\nNaturally dispelling the toxins of food.\nDrunken slumber and overfull reclining bring no benefit,\nWhile excessive thirst or hunger must also be avoided.\n\nDo not eat too coarsely or hastily,\nBetter to eat lightly in succession.\nA single heavy meal to fill the stomach\nHarms the qi and injures the spleen—no blessing for you.\n\nAvoid raw, tough, or greasy foods,\nAs well as the flesh of dead or trapped animals.\nSteamed buns obstruct the qi and are unfit,\nRaw fish readily invite spleen and stomach ailments.\n\nFresh sauces, fertilized eggs, and oily foods,\nAlong with aged, spoiled, or pickled items, all belong to the yin category.\nThe elderly and infirm should not consume them,\nFor it is no different from inviting bandits to arm themselves.\n\nGrilled and roasted foods should be eaten sparingly,\nLest they harm the teeth and damage the blood vessels.\nDine before the hours of *shen* and *you*,\nFor late-night eating burdens the stomach and diaphragm.\n\n*Note: The spleen delights in music; eating at night prevents the spleen’s qi from grinding, as the sounds of music cease. The* Rites of Zhou *states: \"Music accompanies meals,\" for the spleen rejoices in the sounds of strings and bamboo. At the first note, the spleen begins to grind. Thus, all sounds originate from the spleen. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided, lest digestion falter.*\n\nDo not drink to the point of drunkenness,\nFor excess harms the spirit and impairs the mind.\nWhen thirsty, drink water or tea,\nYet this may cause swelling in the waist and legs.\n\n*Note: While wine can gladden the temperament and circulate the blood, it naturally invites wind and harms the kidneys, rotting the intestines and corroding the knees—nothing is more damaging. After a full meal, it is especially to be avoided. Drink slowly, lest you injure the lungs. The lungs are the bloom of the five viscera and must not be harmed. When wine has not yet worn off and thirst is great, avoid drinking water or tea, for the wine will draw them into the kidneys, creating stagnant toxic water. This leads to heavy, aching legs, cold pain in the bladder, and ailments like edema, wasting-thirst, and spasms.*\n\n*Generally, tea is not to be consumed in any season, as it chills the lower burner. Only after a meal may one or two cups be taken without harm, for it aids digestion. When hungry, it is especially to be avoided.*\n\nI have often heard: \"Avoid wind as you would an arrow.\"\nIn sitting or lying, take care to guard against harm.\nAfter drinking, the pores open,\nAnd the slightest breeze may cause paralysis.\n\n*Note: If you sense wind while sitting outdoors, avoid it promptly—do not endure it. The elderly, whose bodies are depleted and defenses weak, are easily invaded by wind. At first, they may not notice, but over time, it harms them. Thus, even in summer, do not seek coolness in the wind or fan yourself while drunk. There was once a man who learned the Way of longevity from Peng Zu but suffered from chronic headaches. Peng Zu examined his sleeping quarters and found a hole directly above his head. He promptly had it sealed, and the ailment vanished.*\n\nWarm wine in all seasons,\nFor if it is too hot, it will be hard to drink.\nExcess of any of the five flavors harms the body,\nLest they bring misfortune to the organs.\n\n*Note: A moderate amount of the five flavors refreshes, but excess harms the corresponding organs. Too much sourness injures the spleen, too much pungency harms the liver, too much salt damages the heart, too much bitterness injures the lungs, and too much sweetness harms the kidneys. This is the natural principle of the Five Phases. At first, the harm is imperceptible, but over time, it becomes chronic.*\n\nDo not engage in prolonged seeing, hearing, walking, or sitting,\nFor the five labors and seven injuries arise from this.\n\n*Note: Prolonged seeing harms the heart and depletes the blood; prolonged sitting injures the spleen and wastes the flesh; prolonged exposure harms the lungs and depletes the qi; prolonged walking injures the liver and damages the sinews; prolonged standing harms the kidneys and weakens the bones. This is why Confucius said: \"Move when it is time to move, sit when it is time to sit.\"*\n\nThe limbs should be gently exercised,\nLike a door hinge that never rusts.\n\n*Note: Fatigue may arise from inactivity. Do not always carry heavy burdens or grasp light objects, idling away the days. Yet it is the idle who often suffer from this ailment. Those who live in leisure do not exert themselves, and after eating, they sit outdoors. Their meridians become blocked, and their blood stagnates—this is the cause. Thus, the noble appear at ease but labor in mind, while the humble are carefree in heart but toil in body.*\n\nThe noble, indulging in untimely desires or unaware of taboos, may feast on delicacies before lying down outdoors—thus, they must engage in physical exertion, though not to the point of exhaustion. What matters is that *rong* and *wei* circulate freely, blood and vessels flow smoothly, like running water that never stagnates or a door hinge that never rusts. Outdoors, do not loathe stretching and relaxing; after a full meal, bathe; when hungry, comb your hair. Frequent combing and infrequent bathing benefit the heart and eyes; silent rest and dim sleep keep the spirit serene.\n\n*Note: Lying on one’s side with knees bent strengthens the heart and qi. Upon waking, stretch fully to preserve the spirit. Stretching outdoors may invite demons and spirits—Confucius did not sleep like a corpse, and this is likely why. Frequent combing dispels wind and brightens the eyes, so Daoists comb their hair one hundred and twenty times each morning. Excessive bathing harms the heart and abdomen, causing fatigue. One should not speak while lying down, for the five viscera are like bells and chimes—unsuspended, they cannot sound. Sleeping with a lamp or candle disturbs the spirit.*\n\nOf the four seasons, summer is the most difficult to manage, for *yin* lies hidden within, and the abdomen grows cold. Tonics for the kidneys and intestines must not be lacking, and cold foods should be avoided. *Note: Summer is the season when one’s essence and spirit are depleted. The heart flourishes while the kidneys wane, their essence transforming into water, which only congeals in autumn and hardens by winter—thus, one must be especially vigilant. In summer, regardless of age, all should consume warming foods; by autumn, this prevents cholera and vomiting. A consistently warm abdomen keeps all illnesses at bay, for robust blood and qi naturally resist disease. When the heart flourishes and the kidneys wane, what must one avoid? Above all, avoid draining the essence and qi. Sleeping quarters should be secluded and quiet, with tranquil repose and a harmonious mind.*\n\n*Note: The \"Monthly Commands\" for mid-summer decree that the noble fast, dwell in stillness, cover their bodies, and avoid restlessness; they must abstain from music and sensuality, moderate their diet, and refrain from indulgence to calm the heart and qi. Bathing, washing, and rinsing should all be done with warm water. Even in sweltering heat, washing the face or hands with cold water dries the five viscera, depleting their fluids—how much worse is bathing? Pillows made of cold materials severely harm the eyes. Melons, raw vegetables, and uncooked greens should not be eaten—not only do they cause autumnal malaria and dysentery.*\n\n*Note: Raw vegetables are inherently cold; melons may regulate qi but dull the ears and eyes. Donkeys and horses that eat them go blind the same day. Such foods should generally be avoided in all seasons, not just summer, and the elderly must be especially cautious.*\n\nWhen *yang* lies hidden within during the three winter months, take care not to sweat excessively, lest the *yang* qi be drained. *Note: Heaven and earth are closed, blood and qi are stored—even if ill, one should not induce sweating. Do not travel far in misty conditions or linger in violent storms and thunder. Note: Once, three men ventured out early in the fog—one fasting, one having eaten porridge, and one having drunk wine. The fasting man died, the porridge-eater fell ill, and the wine-drinker remained healthy, for wine repels frost, dew, and malevolent qi. If you suddenly encounter whirlwinds, thunder, or dark mists on the road, seek shelter indoors; otherwise, you will be harmed. The damage may not be apparent at first, but over time, it will manifest as illness.*\n\nThe Daoists have further principles for nurturing life, the foremost being to restrain one’s will. In autumn and winter, dress only after sunrise; in spring and summer, rise at cock’s crow. *Note: Rise early in spring and summer, and sleep late in autumn and winter. Late rising should not extend past sunrise, and early rising should not precede cock’s crow. Awaken between midnight and dawn, close your eyes, and click your teeth thirty-four times. Inhale the new and exhale the old without error, then swallow the Jade Spring to nourish the embryo.*\n\n*Note: The fluid in the mouth is called the \"Flowery Pool\" or \"Jade Spring.\" The* Huangting Jing *states: \"The Jade Spring’s pure water irrigates the numinous root; cultivate this, and your life will endure.\" Damo’s* Taixi Lun *says: \"For ingestion, one should sit cross-legged facing east after midnight, exhale the old qi from the abdomen three or two times, then pause and gently inhale fresh qi through the nose. Beneath the tongue lie two cavities connected to the kidney orifices; press the tongue against the upper palate, hold the breath briefly, and saliva will flow. Rinse the mouth until full, then swallow slowly, allowing it to naturally irrigate the five viscera—this is called 'qi returning to the cinnabar field.' If midnight is missed, dawn will suffice; even midday is acceptable. The pillow should not be too high.\"*\n\nHan Xijing lived to one hundred and twenty, yet remained robust, claiming that daily ingestion of the Jade Spring and thirty-four tooth-clicks—called \"refining the essence\"—was his secret. The Later Han adept Wang Zhen often rinsed his mouth with the Jade Spring beneath his tongue and swallowed it, calling it \"embryonic breathing.\" Sun Simiao said: \"Hair should be frequently combed, hands often rubbed over the face, teeth regularly clicked, saliva constantly swallowed, and qi refined with precision. These five practices are what the* Huangting Jing *means by: 'If you wish not to die, cultivate the Kunlun.'\"*\n\nWarm your palms by rubbing them and press them over your eyes—*Note: Do this thirty-four times to naturally clear obstructions from the eyes, dispel wind, and brighten the vision. No method surpasses this for supplementing kidney qi.* Then rub your forehead and face. *Note: Frequently wiping the forehead—called \"cultivating the Heavenly Court\"—twenty to thirty-four times from the hairline will naturally lend the face a lustrous glow. Those with dim vision should do this often.* Occasionally massage the sides of your nose with your middle fingers. *Note: Rub the sides of the nose twenty to thirty times until both inside and out are warm—this is called \"irrigating the Central Peak to moisten the lungs.\"* Knead your ears and the corners of your eyes repeatedly. *Note: Kneading the ears means massaging the ear lobes. Do this without counting, for it is called \"cultivating the city walls to supplement kidney qi and prevent deafness and tinnitus.\"*\n\nFurther dry-bathe the whole body in inquiry,\nWhen pressing the meridians, twist both shoulders in turn.\nThough wind-fatigue and all manner of qi afflictions arise,\nWhat fear of waist and back once more stiffening and cramping?\n\n*Note: Most people, when seated, should often press the thighs with both hands and twist the shoulders left and right dozens of times.*\n\nThe six healing sounds—xu, he, hu, xi, chui, and si—\nAre the oral formulas for those who practice qi-cultivation.\nIf one can truly follow and apply them,\nNew and old illnesses alike may all be cured.\n\nThough sensual pleasures are said to belong to youth,\nA little restraint and moderation will prevent transgression.\nSeal the essence, still the breath—best to learn this early,\nLest the feather-wrapped flame burn in the fire.\n\n*Note: The ancients likened the affairs of sensual desire to holding the sun in an ice cup or storing fire in a feather bundle.*\n\nIf one’s conduct is ever upright and proper,\nNeither coveting fame nor contending for profit,\nEven if not all the hundred practices are fully observed,\nThe whole body will still be free of illness.\n\n*Note: Laozi said, \"Those who skillfully nurture life on land do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers—such is the aid of virtue and the Dao.\"*\n\n*End of Scroll Eight of the Miscellaneous Writings in the Ten Books on Cultivating the True*",

      "translated_text": "**Diagram of the River Source Producing the Medicine**\n**Diagram of the True Earth of Medicinal Substances and Fire-Timing**\n**Diagram of the Four Images**\n**Diagram of the Dragon and Tiger**\n**Golden Liquor Returning as Cinnabar**\n**Shortcut to the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe Golden Elixir is refined from inner lead and outer mercury—it is not of metals, stones, herbs, or trees. Through seven returns and nine reversions, does it become the medicine of transformation and ascension?\n\nWithin the red appears the yellow; knowing the white, one guards the qi—these are the lead and mercury of the Golden Elixir. The wind atop Mount Hua, the waves beneath the Fusang Sea—these are the Dragon and Tiger of the Golden Elixir. The luan and phoenix within the spirit-chamber, the clouds and rain within the elixir-house—these are the husband and wife of the Golden Elixir. The sun’s essence leaking celestial marrow, the moon’s spirit moving earthly fat—these are the Crow and Hare of the Golden Elixir. The circulation of the two qi, the revolving of the primordial unity—these are the Tortoise and Serpent of the Golden Elixir. The civil fire for gentle nurturing, the martial fire for forging refinement—these are the fire-timing of the Golden Elixir.\n\nAs for the bathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the water of Kun, the water of Kan. The blowing and breathing in the Dao of the Elixir: the wind of Xun, the wind of Li.\n\nAlas, the wonders of the Golden Elixir are not transmitted! Drawing and adding according to the sun and moon, waxing and waning in imitation of heaven and earth, punishment and virtue modeled on Mao and You, conjunctions uniting metal and wood. Moreover, the clarity or turbidity of the water source, the slowness or swiftness of the fire-timing, the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal materials, the beginning and end of the union, the transformations of the embryonic immortal—these too must be known.\n\nKnowing these, one reads *The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals* and suddenly awakens, as if released, like orchids in the spring breeze, like parasol trees in the first autumn rain, like night snow in the pine forest, like evening sunlight on the bamboo path—such is the flavor of the Golden Elixir. Serene as white clouds in the spring sky, bright as the pale moon in the autumn pool, obscure as an infant yet unborn, dim as an elder on the verge of senility—such is the attainment of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThus is the Golden Elixir cultivated, thus are the medicinal substances gathered, thus are water and fire employed, thus does the Dao of the Elixir unite and thus is it accomplished.\n\n*The Pearl and Jade of the Immortals*—a work unparalleled in ancient or modern times. Who was Hu Taixian? A man who abandoned Confucianism and transcended the common world, yet his immortality remains unverified. His intent was thus—he was a man of old.\n\n**On the Golden Elixir**\n\nI have heard that before the Supreme Ultimate divided, all was a chaotic void, undifferentiated in clarity or turbidity, formless as a hen’s egg. Once the primordial qi split, the Two Modes arose. Thus, the pure and numinous qi floated to become heaven, the heavy and turbid qi descended to become earth, and the harmonious qi congealed to become humanity. The Three Powers were established, and the myriad things were born.\n\nThe sages of antiquity looked up to observe the patterns of heaven, looked down to examine the principles of earth, and inwardly grasped the norms of human relations. Thus, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams to exhaustively investigate the forms of heaven and earth and illuminate the source and flow of creation. He paired Qian and Kun with the movement and stillness of heaven and earth, aligned Kan and Li with the circulation of the sun and moon. The five viscera were divided into the five phases, corresponding above to the five stars in their celestial procession and inwardly clarifying the mutual restraint of the five qi.\n\nThus, the liver stores the ethereal soul, dwelling in the east, and is called the Azure Dragon; the lungs store the corporeal soul, dwelling in the west, and are named the White Tiger; the heart stores the spirit, dwelling in the south, and is titled the Vermilion Bird; the kidneys store the essence, dwelling in the north, and are likened to the Dark Warrior; the spleen stores the will, dwelling in the center, and is honored as the virtue of earth.\n\nTherefore, water, when met with earth, conceals its form; fire, when met with earth, veils its brightness; metal, when met with earth, enhances its luster; wood, when met with earth, overflows with moisture. Thus, the Dragon and Tiger unite in the jade crucible, water and fire achieve balance in the golden tripod. The true essence soars behind the elbow, the river chariot revolves in the Jade Capital, the mysterious pearl descends in the Flowery Pond, the yellow sprout grows in the Numinous Valley. The Three Corpses flee, the Six Bandits escape, the yang spirit gathers to form an immortal, and the golden mercury coalesces into treasure. Only then can one transcend the mundane and enter sainthood, attaining an age equal to heaven.\n\nI have seen Master Bai compile alchemical texts, illustrating inner images of creation, distinguishing the five phases, arranging the Eight Trigrams, pointing out the elixir’s cauldron, clarifying the fire-timing, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, the galloping of Dragon and Tiger, the unfolding of phenomena, all rendered into diagrams to guide those who love the Dao. With a single glance, all becomes clear and doubt vanishes, allowing one to enter by a smooth path. If one follows the diagrams in practice, what confusion could remain?",

      "translated_text": "**Treatise on Cultivating the True**\n\nIt has often been said that the Great Dao is subtle and obscure, difficult for people to comprehend. Therefore, the sages concealed its profound principles within the classics, hid them among the myriad things, and employed parables and images—all to deliver the deluded.\n\nIn former times, the *Baopuzi* stated: \"Water with a source flows far; trees with roots grow lush; houses with foundations stand firm; and those who preserve their essence live long.\" The *Ninefold Elixir Classic* says: \"What one may preserve is life; what is lamentable is the body; what may be stored is qi; and what is most precious is essence.\" The *Supreme Mysterious Mirror* states: \"Pure yang ascending is called qi; pure yin descending is called fluid. When qi and fluid merge within the bone marrow, it is called marrow. When qi and marrow unite beyond the bladder, it is called essence. When heart-qi resides in the liver and liver-essence is unstable, the eyes grow dim and lose their luster. When heart-qi resides in the lungs and lung-essence is weak, the flesh withers. When heart-qi resides in the kidneys and kidney-essence is unstable, spirit and qi diminish. When heart-qi resides in the spleen and spleen-essence is unsteady, teeth and hair loosen and fall. Among the five viscera, the kidneys govern essence, and the heart is the abode of qi. True essence resides in the kidneys, while surplus essence naturally returns to the lower elixir field; true qi resides in the heart, while surplus qi naturally returns to the primordial palace. Thus, a person’s qi measures eight hundred and ten *zhang*, corresponding to the eighty-one yang numbers of nine nines. Beyond this, essence scatters, primordial qi dissipates, illness arises, and death follows.\n\nMoreover, Guangchengzi transmitted the Dao to the Yellow Emperor, teaching the art of longevity: \"In all going out and coming in, do not depart from the Mysterious Female; in all movement and stillness, abide only in the Valley Spirit. In the profound and obscure, there is essence; in the vague and indistinct, there is substance. Know the white, guard the black, and you may attain long life.\" I have also observed Master Xujing’s words: \"The Great Dao is not distant—it lies within the body. Though things are empty, nature is not. If nature remains unobstructed, harmonious qi abides; when qi returns to the primordial sea, life knows no end. To keep the spirit within the body, do not cling to a single thing in the numinous terrace. If things linger in the heart, the spirit grows clouded, essence scatters, and sinews and bones weaken.\"\n\nThe Dao is easy to know yet hard to encounter; easy to encounter yet hard to perfect. Recently, I sought teachers and friends, inquiring into the great medicine of the golden elixir and the methods of fire-timing, withdrawal, and addition. Yet none spoke of the foundational work. Without a path to enter, one remains lost. Now, beholding Master Bai of Hainan’s *Diagrams of Cultivating the True and Nurturing Life*, which employs images to reveal the mysteries of the Great Dao, I hope that those of like aspiration may follow these diagrams in practice—this is truly the swiftest path. Let none neglect this.\n\nWritten in the summer month of the *chunyou* year, *jiachen*, by Liao Zhengjing.\n\n---\n\n**Colophon to the *Miscellaneous Writings on Pointing to the Mysterious*, Volume One of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True***\n\n**Preface to the *Returning to the Source***\n\nBy Shi Tai of Apricot Grove, the Perfected One\n\nTai has long revered the true teaching, traversed sacred sites, and sought transmission of the orthodox method. With a heart set on benefiting the world, he focused solely on the Three Treasures, prizing longevity above all. For the path to immortality is easily walked, yet people make it difficult; shedding the dust is not hard, yet people find it so. How lamentable!\n\nAs the ancients said: \"Deluded clouds veil the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\" In former years, while serving in the postal relay, I encountered my late teacher, Master Zhang Ziyang. His concise words—no more than half a phrase—yielded verification in but a moment. Knowing that immortality could be learned, I rejoiced inwardly. When the golden liquid congealed and the sacred embryo formed, Tai composed the *Returning to the Source*, eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, to instruct later learners. Awaken early to the true root—do not wait until old age, when lead is exhausted and mercury scarce. Urgently reflect, seek a teacher, and inquire into the cultivation of the golden elixir. Together, may we attain the fruit of immortality, transform, and ascend in flight. This is my deepest wish.\n\nThe eighty-one chapters of *Returning to the Source* correspond to the pure yang number.\n\n---\n\n1.\nLead and mercury form the true body,\nYin and yang supply the Great Primal.\nSimply know to practice the two eights—\nThen you may refine the golden elixir.\n\n2.\nMercury is the marrow of the Green Dragon,\nLead is the fat of the White Tiger.\nReturn them to the cauldron—\nGather them, knowing the proper time.\n\n3.\nThe Maiden rides the lead tiger,\nThe Metal Lord mounts the mercury dragon.\nIllumine the correct decree—\nRefine until the furnace glows red.\n\n4.\nThe snake-soul seizes the dragon’s marrow,\nThe turtle-spirit restrains the tiger’s essence.\nWithin the divine water,\nA jade mushroom blooms.\n\n5.\nWhite snow flies in the jasper garden,\nYellow sprouts burgeon in the jade park.\nKnow the crescent moon—\nWhere to refine the red lead?\n\n6.\nThe medicinal materials open the primordial chaos,\nThe fire-timing smelts the vast expanse.\nThe embryo immortal transforms—\nOnly then is the ninefold turning known.\n\n7.\nWhere the dragon conceals its pearl,\nWhen the hen broods her egg—\nLead and mercury unite,\nJust then may one partake of the knife-round.\n\n8.\nBathing relies on the water of Kun,\nBreathing depends on the wind of Xun.\nWith nothing to do,\nAbide alone in the Grand Tenuity Palace.\n\n9.\nSeek the Maiden of Li in the Purple Court,\nPair the Man of Kan with the Vermilion Mound.\nWhere the Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,\nThe Supreme Ultimate naturally enfolds the Three.\n\n10.\nThe Qian horse gallops to the golden gate,\nThe Kun ox enters the wooden palace.\nWho is the general that startles the maiden,\nMarrying her off to the Metal Elder?\n\n11.\nThe startled maiden is just sixteen,\nThe Metal Elder is precisely twenty-seven.\nIn the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises—\nTheir joyous union bears a firstborn son.\n\n12.\nLast night by the western riverbank,\nThe toad’s light shone on the azure waves.\nGathered and brought to the jade chamber,\nWithin the crucible, it refines itself.\n\n13.\nLi and Kan do not copulate—\nQian and Kun transform of themselves.\nOne who understands this principle\nPoints and fills the Yellow Court.\n\n14.\nThe Elixir Valley births divine water,\nThe Yellow Court holds the great granary.\nNo longer hungering or thirsting,\nOne enters the immortal realm.\n\n15.\nThe horse of intent returns to the spirit chamber,\nThe ape of the heart guards the grotto room.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and will—\nAll transform into purple gold frost.\n\n16.",

Nine-Flowered Heaven.\nWithin the heavens lies the wondrous, boundless palace,\nWhere myriad scrolls of *Pointers to the Mysterious* reside.\nEach scroll reveals the purport of the Golden Elixir,\nA thousand phrases, ten thousand words—all converge in one.\nIt teaches one but to seek mercury and lead,\nTo gather these two and refine them within the crucible.\nAt night, fire erupts upon Kunlun Mountain,\nIts flames aglow, the moon’s light grows cold.\nAbove the Winding River, the Golden Crow takes flight;\nChang’e rejoices with the Dipper and Ox.\nGather and refine them in but a moment,\nA single qi, vast and subtle, traverses the Three Passes.\nThrough the Three Passes, qi flows endlessly,\nA white meridian ascends to the Muddy Pellet.\nAbove the Muddy Pellet rests the Purple Gold Crucible,\nWithin the crucible, a lump of purple gold,\nTransformed into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth,\nFragrant, sweet, and refreshing upon the tongue.\nSwallowed and ingested, it enters the abdomen,\nThe viscera rejoice, the body at ease.\nWhen the red serpent and azure tortoise unite,\nWind calms, waves still—tiger and dragon coil.\nDivine water, serene; the Flowery Pond at peace,\nWhite snow flurries drift on all sides.\nA seven-jeweled tower of twelve stories,\nBefore it, yellow blossoms in profound splendor.\nThis is the essence of lead and mercury,\nTransmuted into marrow, filling the gates and sources.\nSimply seek the Celestial Cycle within the body,\nAfter the waxing crescent, before the waning.\nThe medicine is balanced, the qi ample,\nHeaven and earth, sun and moon meet in union.\nThe void naturally shatters into myriad fragments,\nChew through chaos, light as silk floss.\nKneaded back and forth, it forms a single coin,\nThe body suffused with jade’s luster and gold’s firmness.\nRed blood is replaced by white blood’s flow,\nGolden light fills the chamber, dense and resplendent.\nA pool of autumn water cradles the bright moon,\nA golden flower blooms like a red lotus.\nAt this time, the body’s spirit and qi are whole—\nNo need to seek the Dao or delve into Chan.\nNow I know your worthiness,\nThat you are destined to become an immortal.\nClearly instructed, with few words,\nSilently operate, adding and withdrawing.\nWithin a year, gather the moon—no need for years;\nWithin a month, seize the sun—months are in vain.\nWithin a day, grasp the hour—days are easily lost;\nWithin an hour, there are moments, profoundly mysterious.\nMysterious beyond mystery, inexpressible—\nIt is the new moon, full moon, dark moon, and crescent.\nThe Golden Elder and Maiden seize creation,\nGhosts and spirits weep in alarm.\nClouds disperse, rain scatters, all sounds stilled—\nA single grain of the Mysterious Pearl sown in the Jade Field.\nAfter ten months of firing, the sacred embryo rounds,\nNine revolutions, seven returns, cycling in turn.\nFirst, the spine’s pass opens,\nNext, the bladder blazes like fire.\nWithin, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water,\nTimely stirred, they surge toward the heart’s origin.\nHeart and kidneys, water and fire, naturally interact—\nWho causes the separation of metal and wood?\nThe Yellow Court’s qi resides in the Central Palace,\nGoverning all phenomena, the heart holds sway.\nThe water’s source, clear as a jade mirror—\nWho sets the river chariot sailing like a boat?\nIn an instant, flames soar, scorching the heavens,\nThe crow’s soul and hare’s spirit scatter like dust.\nThus, silently seek the true root—\nA single path leads to the numinous true.\nClearly, essence is enveloped by qi,\nGradually, qi accumulates to generate spirit.\nThis spirit is the essence of heaven and earth,\nPure Yang, undying—the true person.\nKnowing this, you should cultivate immortality;\nTo cultivate immortality, only the Golden Elixir’s gate remains.\nThe Golden Elixir has no second formula—\nA single acre within the body is your homestead.\nSaliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—\nThese seven yin substances—what use are they?\nWithin Kan, it is not the kidney but the numinous root;\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun glows red, the mare gallops.\nSeven returns, nine revolutions—achieved in a moment,\nAll things in creation are thus born.\nOnly this true operation of Qian and Kun—\nNo need for vain, wordless striving.\nWithout thought or念, the spirit is already dull—\nHow can it congeal into the embryo immortal?\nThe embryo immortal is but the union’s fruition,\nThis union occurs in but a fleeting instant.\nDo you yet know of the great intestine’s return,\nJust before the Winter Solstice’s few days?\nIt is said when the golden essence descends,\nWith what is the golden essence restored?\nThe golden essence is but the medicine of Kun Palace,\nKun rules the southwest, the river’s source.\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River—\nThis is the root of the medicine.\nExchange hours for days, moments for hours—\nA single drop of sweet dew, the numinous spring.\nSwallowed, it surges through the heart meridian, piercing the lung’s transport point,\nFalling into the bladder, it forms the elixir.\nThe elixir’s head does not congeal in the bladder—\nThough it enters the bladder, it resides in the liver.\nThe liver, wood’s fluid, meets the golden essence;\nEncountering earth, they unite to complete the Great Return.\nDo not say this is deliberate effort,\nLest it become attachment to form.\nFrom attachment to form, one reaches formlessness—\nRefine essence into qi, qi returns to the root.\nThe root of qi congeals into spirit,\nOnly then is it called effortless and spiritually efficacious.\nLike husband and wife in union,\nA single drop of essence and blood forms the infant.\nTheir union, stirred by emotion, produces essence—\nEven so, the infant matures in ten months.\nHow much more so when the cosmos is in your hands,\nThe body’s tiger roars, the dragon sings.\nThough the dragon’s song is unseen,\nWaves surge high, thousands of fathoms.\nThough the tiger’s roar is unheard,\nDeep in the night, winds howl through myriad forests.\nFrom the moment the elixir’s path congeals,\nThrough the firing’s completion,\nUntil the tenth month, when frost descends—\nGhosts and spirits flee, daring not contend.\nA year comprises twelve months,\nWho dares bathe at Mao and You?\nThus, in the tenth month, enter the spirit chamber,\nThe golden crucible brims with dragon’s essence.\nThe mechanism of binding clouds and seizing the moon—\nWith the formula, cultivation is no difficulty.\nIf you truly bind the clouds upon the mountain,\nAnd grasp the moon’s soul—\nUnderstanding these words, you follow the ancients—\nWhat worry is there that your body will not ascend?\nThe body’s hub, the heart’s flesh—\nWithin the heart lies a priceless treasure.\nIt can give me life or bring me death,\nIt can starve or satiate.\nSeek the true, trace the path to its origin—\nCarefree and joyful, free from hunger and cold.\nSuch states and proofs—\nAll lie within a day’s work.",

when it scatters, it becomes wind—therefore, it communicates with the Dao.\nCommunication means the Dao nourishes qi.\nTo nourish qi is to preserve spirit.\nSpirit is the Way of Heaven.\nThus, when essence and qi harmonize over time and fire is applied, true qi takes form.\nThis is called refining pure yang, using the body as the nation, the heart as the ruler, and essence as the people.\nExpel the yin demons—\nThe body is the furnace,\nThe head is the crucible.\nWhen essence fills the brain, fire is used to refine it.\nFire is yang;\nBreath is wind.\nWith wind fanning the fire, refine form and spirit—\nWhen both are wondrous, this is called refining form.\nTo refine form, first stabilize the heart within, so true qi surges in harmony.\nFire is the qi of cinnabar yang, the pure essence of the Elixir.\nCirculating without cease, rising and sinking in ceaseless return, encompassing all things—thus it is cinnabar yang.\nHeaven and Earth are the essence of yin and yang.\nHeaven’s qi descends and then ascends; Earth’s qi ascends and then descends.\nHeaven’s yang essence crystallizes as the sun; Earth’s yin essence crystallizes as the moon.\nIf one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, naturally it turns the movement of sun and moon without rest—this is the Dao of refining spirit with pure yang.\nAbove the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Heaven pours in; below the Celestial Pivot, the primordial qi of Earth pours in.\nWithin the Celestial Pivot, yin and yang intermingle—\nIf one can merge them, above and below become boundless, and one’s years equal Heaven’s.\nYet people today cannot comprehend this, for greed and desire deplete their essence, the heart loses its spirit, the body labors and scatters qi—\nThus they die in darkness, undone by the Five Thieves.\nThose who perceive this thrive; those who do not perish.\nThe Five Thieves are the upright qi of the Five Phases.\nHeavenly perfection is the origin of the Dao.\nIt nurtures the myriad things, holds the power of life and death, and is the root of creation.\nWhen it fills the body over time, essence harmonizes with heavenly perfection.\nHeaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth’s qi receives it without parting.\nIf one can recognize this, one will not die.\nMaster Guangcheng said: “I have lived twelve thousand years, all due to the upright principle of the Five Phases.”\nThe Five Phases are the Five Viscera.\nWater receives the qi of the One—\nIn humans, the kidneys belong to Water.\nBefore a person is born, the Dao is their foundation.\nThe Gate of Life corresponds above to the primordial source of the Great Unity in the north, the root of creation.\nNext, the left kidney generates the pulse of life, surging upward to greet the origin.\nDescending to Xun and Kun, within lies the primordial foundation.\nGathering the qi of the four seasons, it enters the Central Palace and ascends to the crown of the head—thus it enacts Heaven’s work.\nThe head is round, symbolizing Heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing Earth.\nWithin, the upright qi of the Five Phases gathers.\nEntering the Crimson Palace, it disperses to reach the sinews and bones, rising and descending in ceaseless return, merging with the Bubbling Spring to unite the myriad spirits.\nThus, when green yang reaches the head, all yin scatters.\nFurther employing the Five Phases’ upright qi of Heaven, which descends within—\nWhen the Five Phases dwell together, entering the crucible to refine the Elixir, one does not die.\nHeaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism; humans use the heart as theirs.\nHeaven’s mechanism operates through yin and yang; the human mechanism perfects the Great Dao.\nThe Great Dao is non-action.\nIn non-action, nature is not disordered; when nature is not disordered, spirit does not stray; when spirit does not stray, essence does not scatter; when essence does not scatter, qi does not drift; when qi does not drift, essence and fire follow one another.\nWhen essence and fire do not scatter, the myriad spirits gather in the homeland of spirit, within the Kunlun Mountains, ascending to the crown of the head—\nOnly then does one attain the creation of the primordial qi.\nThus, the Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe One is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of yin and yang.\nThe myriad things rely on it to be born and completed; the thousand spirits depend on it for flourishing or withering.\nFrom the lofty heavens to the deep earth, from grotto-heavens to immortal palaces, from mysterious constellations to sacred images of divine perfected—\nNot a single thing is born without the primordial qi.\nBefore birth, one first receives Heaven’s qi, which becomes human nature.\nThen, the two qi unite to form the body.\nIf one can still the heart like an unmoving Heaven, one becomes one with Heaven and Earth.\nThe human heart is the root of the mechanism.\nIf one can preserve the heart and guard the spirit, taking the heart as nature and qi as life—\nYet if one cannot practice this, qi is cut off and life perishes, all due to disordered nature and scattered spirit.\nThe Way of Heaven is the pure qi.\nHumans receive the One qi, embodying the principle of nurturing the myriad spirits with pure yang—thus it is called the Way of Heaven.\nThe mechanism of creation is transformation.\nThe dragon is qi;\nThe serpent is fire.\nIf one circulates essence and qi in ceaseless ascent and descent, seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth—this is called the mechanism.\nIf one abandons the Five Desires and moves with the mechanism’s power—\nLike Heaven’s work, the true green yang within the human kidneys, the tortoise and serpent, ascends to communicate with the primordial qi of Heaven.\nThrough breath, above and below respond, rising to leave the earth.",

      "translated_text": "Guangchengzi said:\nWithin the qi sea one cun and three fen below the navel lies a measure of true essence. Inside are two meridians—on the left, the Cinnabar Yang Meridian; on the right, the Numinous Yang Meridian. These two meridians ascend to connect with the brain. Therein lies a palace called the Numinous Yang Palace, which contains two cavities: on the left, the Supreme Ultimate Cavity; on the right, the Penetrating Emptiness Cavity. Above, they communicate with the qi of Heaven; below, they reach the primordial sea—thus, through breath, the qi of Heaven descends to nourish the true essence. The ascending force is the dragon, the root of green yang; the descending force is the serpent, the origin of primordial qi. When these two qi intersect, they form the Great Medicine. With prolonged refinement, the elixir is completed—thus, one does not die. Through prolonged refinement, the spirit transcends the material world—thus, one rises from the earth.\n\nWhen humans harbor the mechanism of destruction and guard the yang spirit, yin and yang ascend and descend. Heaven does so through the winter and summer solstices; humans do so through each inhalation and exhalation. On exhalation, qi reaches the root; on inhalation, it reaches the stem. With each inhalation, the qi of Heaven descends; with each exhalation, the qi of Earth ascends. When I circulate true qi to guide the qi of Earth below upward to Heaven—this is called the reversal of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeavenly nature must not be disordered; spirit and qi must not be displaced. When one can unite with essence and qi to generate the myriad spirits, it is as if Heaven and Earth are harmonious and nurture all things. The sage inwardly refines clarity while outwardly restraining desires, dwelling in stillness before the Great Beginning, where no distinction of skill or clumsiness yet exists.\n\nThe Three Essentials are the Mysterious Female, the Jade Gate, and the Golden Barrier. Above, they connect to Heaven; below, to Earth. One must never let the eyes observe and the heart stir, the ears listen and the spirit wander, or the mouth speak and the qi scatter—for if the Three Essentials are disturbed, the spirit disperses.\n\nWithin the human heart are two apertures: on the left, the Mysterious; on the right, the Female. Below, they enter the qi sea; above, they connect to the Mud Pill Palace. This is the true interconnection of the Jade Gate and Golden Barrier, which flank the spine, pass through the Three Barriers, and pay homage to the Northern Culmen. When the yang cavity stirs, it nurtures the true.\n\nGuangchengzi said: Wood without fire does not turn to ash; humans without nature do not die. Fire scatters the spirit; when the spirit scatters, qi departs; when qi departs, the body perishes. A state with long-standing treachery will collapse; a body with long-standing evil will die. Remove treachery, and there is peace; remove evil, and there is tranquility.\n\nHeaven and Earth plunder the Great Void; humans, in turn, plunder Heaven and Earth. The *dieluo* are worms in the human abdomen that consume my soul and spirit, dissipate my qi and essence, and scatter my blood. Yet if one can restore the mechanism of yin-yang creation, they cannot cause harm.\n\nThe sage employs the mechanism to emulate the transformative power of creation, cultivating thus to ascend to the celestial realm. Heaven uses one qi to nurture the myriad things; humans receive one qi to generate the myriad spirits. To dissipate this one qi is to invite death.\n\nThe ancient sages consumed the qi of Heaven at appointed times, regulating the hundred vessels. By drinking deeply of the true qi of Grand Harmony and focusing intention on the field of the body, the five viscera become cool and clear, the six bowels harmonious and at peace, the joints filled with primordial qi, and the spirit settled.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The softness and weakness of qi penetrate the sinews and bones, settle the spirit, and ensure the free flow of the joints—how can this not be the principle?\n\nWhen the numinous mechanism is employed internally, it undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations. Heaven operates the mechanism to nurture the myriad things; humans operate the mechanism to achieve boundless transformation. People perceive external omens of fortune and misfortune and respond accordingly, yet they do not realize that within themselves lies the divine—this is what makes one an immortal, what defines the divine.\n\nThe sun and moon are the purest essences of yin and yang. They traverse the eight directions, with cold and heat alternating, fulfilling the intent of Heaven and Earth, established in the path of the sun and moon’s circuit. The sun rises and the moon sets—all within the realm of number. Number is one; one is qi. The sage who attains this comprehends the principles of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and geography, firmly cultivating qi and nurturing the spirit without straying from the Dao—thus, the myriad transformations begin.\n\nThe noble one can endure hardship; the petty person, upon hearing this, scoffs and treats life lightly. The Three Returns reside in the Three Origins: the true qi of Heavenly Origin dwells at the head, the true qi of Numinous Origin at the center, and the true qi of Root Origin below.\n\nEssence is the teacher; the heart is the sovereign; the body is the form. When the three yang circulate within for a long time, the spirit naturally pays homage to the origin—thus, one does not die. By means of the Dao of Heaven, one transforms the myriad things below, receiving the life bestowed by the Dao, naturally and spontaneously.\n\nThis is the great kindness of life—not indulging the heart in sensual desires. Calm the heart and preserve the qi, and the transformative power of creation will naturally bestow kindness. Curb desires, rectify the heart, stabilize the qi, guard the spirit and embrace the One. In utmost stillness, daily renewal leads to the source, to the divine—this is the root of yin and yang.\n\nIf the eyes do not gaze upon sensual forms, the spirit does not wander; when the spirit does not wander, qi is stored within. In the supreme joy of celestial truth, there is no disturbance to the end.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The *qin* is the bird of the southern direction. If one can subdue and preserve true essence and strength for a long time, one will soar like the *qin* into the Great Void. Yet this is nothing more than becoming a flying immortal through qi, reducing excess to supplement deficiency. The excess lies in the heart; the deficiency, in essence. If one cannot reduce the excess, one cannot supplement the deficiency. To supplement deficiency is to cause harm. Restraining desires, concealing the form, and binding the material world may seem tasteless, yet kindness resides within—harm contains kindness.\n\nThe principle of Heaven and Earth, the mechanism of the sage, the sprout of the supreme Dao, the root of the myriad things, the origin of yin and yang—thus, creation is inexhaustible. The sage, in the essence of the supreme Dao, possesses what is mine. The Dao’s vitality is such that the myriad things are themselves, yet I alone am wise.\n\nYin and yang do not prevail—what prevails is my use of them, my spirit, my numinosity. When yin and yang equally prevail in Heaven and Earth, the two qi conjoin, and the myriad things are as one. When wisdom and spirit are as one with qi, this is the sage—distinct from ordinary people, thus becoming an immortal.\n\nThe Three Essentials are derived from the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Consecration Classic*. The first essential is the head, the Great Abyss—this is the position where the Valley Spirit resides.",
      "overlap_context": "anism of creation is transformation.\nThe dragon is qi;\nThe serpent is fire.\nIf one circulates essence and qi in ceaseless ascent and descent, seizing the creation of Heaven and Earth—this is called the mechanism.\nIf one abandons the Five Desires and moves with the mechanism’s power—\nLike Heaven’s work, the true green yang within the human kidneys, the tortoise and serpent, ascends to communicate with the primordial qi of Heaven.\nThrough breath, above and below respond, rising to leave the earth.",

If one can empty the heart and concentrate the spirit, achieving the union of spirit and qi, with breath ceasing its movement—this is called the Great Stillness. Now, the spirit is the origin of Heaven and Earth, the root of nature and life, the ancestor of sun and moon, the chief of dragon and tiger, the foundation of yin and yang.

There is a spirit here named Peach Prosperity, which connects upward to the Nine Heavens and downward to the Bubbling Spring. The gathering and dispersal of true qi all pass through this gate. Thus the sage says: the Gate of Heaven is ever open, the Earth Gate forever closed.\n\nIf one can master these Three Essentials, spirit and qi will naturally intermingle. The *Yin Consecration Classic* states: \"The deviance of the nine apertures lies here.\" The Three Essentials correct precisely this.\n\n**The Outer Three Essentials**\nThe Outer Three Essentials are the Gate of the Mysterious Female.

The nose connects to the six bowels; what issues forth is light and pure qi, belonging to yang, joining with Heaven—this is called the Heaven Root. The Most High said: \"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the Heaven Root.\" The nose has two apertures, the mouth one aperture—together, three apertures. This is the gate through which spirit and qi come and go. The yang spirit is the mysterious, the yin breath is the female.

      "translated_text": "Bai Yuchan of Hainan, from youth, served Master Chen Niyuan for nine years. One day, beneath the pines in a secluded crag, with wind clear and moon bright, the night still and mist cold, he pondered the great matter of life and death, the swiftness of impermanence. Bowing twice in reverence, he asked: \"Though I have served you but briefly, I fear my blessings are shallow and my karma slight. Dare I ask—is there a share of immortality for me in this life?\"\n\nChen Niyuan replied: \"Every person may attain it—how much more so you?\"\n\nBai Yuchan said: \"Not shirking the weight of your dignity, I venture an overbold question: How many gates are there in immortal cultivation? How many methods in elixir refinement? My understanding remains as unpolished jade—pray, grant me a single word of enlightenment.\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"Come, and I will tell you. There are three ranks in immortal cultivation, three grades in elixir refinement.\n\nThe Dao of Heavenly Immortals enables transformation and ascension—superior scholars may study it. Take the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, wisdom as fire. In a single moment, coagulation may occur; in ten months, the embryo forms. This is the superior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has no hexagrams or trigrams, no weights or measures. Its method is simple and direct, transmitted mind-to-mind—easily accomplished.\n\nThe Dao of Water Immortals enables concealment and manifestation—middling scholars may study it. Take qi as lead, spirit as mercury, noon as fire, midnight as water. In a hundred days, union may occur; in three years, the image forms. This is the middle-grade method of elixir refinement. Though it has hexagrams and trigrams, it has no weights or measures. Its method is subtle and wondrous, transmitted orally—surely attainable.\n\nThe Dao of Earthly Immortals enables the preservation of form and dwelling in the world—common scholars may study it. Take essence as lead, blood as mercury, the kidneys as water, the heart as fire. In a year, fusion may occur; in nine years, success is achieved. This is the inferior-grade method of elixir refinement. It has both hexagrams and trigrams, as well as weights and measures. Its method is complex and difficult, transmitted through texts—hard to accomplish.\n\nThe superior-grade elixir method takes spirit, qi, celestial soul, earthly soul, intent, and will as medicinal ingredients; waking, dwelling, sitting, and lying as firing times; purity and spontaneity as application.\n\nThe middle-grade elixir method takes the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as medicinal ingredients; years, months, days, and hours as firing times; embracing the One and guarding unity as application.\n\nThe inferior-grade elixir method takes essence, blood, marrow, qi, and fluids as medicinal ingredients; swallowing breath and rubbing the body as firing times; visualization of ascent and descent as application.\n\nIn general, the subtlety does not lie in following diagrams to seek a steed. Those who cling to images and adhere to texts, vainly proud and arrogant, will reach old age without achievement.\"\n\nBai Yuchan said: \"For many years, I read elixir texts as though walking through thorns. Today, the dusty mirror is bright, clouds part and the moon shines clear. All myriad methods return to the One; all illusions return to reality. Yet I still do not know—where to begin the work?\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"Excellent question! The essentials of elixir refinement: take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and cauldron; the heart as the chamber of spirit; upright sitting and cultivating stillness as gathering and extraction; vigilant attention as firing; action and cessation as advance and retreat; interruption and distraction as guarding the embankment; application as drawing and adding; true qi steaming as bathing; calming thoughts as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing deliberation as life and death; the arising of thought as the Mysterious Female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as elixir completion; transferring spirit as changing the tripod; having a body beyond the body as shedding the embryo; returning to the origin and reverting to the source as true emptiness; shattering the void as fulfillment.\n\nThus one may gather to form shape, scatter to become qi, coming and going without hindrance, carefree and natural.\"\n\nBai Yuchan asked: \"Diligent yet unmet, one must meet a perfected being; met yet indolent, one ends as a lowly ghost. What verification is there for this method of elixir refinement?\"\n\nChen Niyuan said: \"At the outset of elixir refinement, spirit is clear and qi is fresh, body and mind harmonious and joyful. Chronic illnesses vanish entirely; dreams cease. One may fast for a hundred days, drink wine without intoxication. At this stage, red blood is transmuted into white blood, yin qi refined into yang qi. The body becomes fiery-hot, steps swift as flight. The mouth can dry water, breath can cook meat. Facing scenes without attachment, unmoving as suchness. One may command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and rain, hear the Nine Heavens, see ten thousand miles. The body becomes purely yang, sinews of gold and bones of jade. The yang spirit manifests its form, coming and going naturally—this is the Dao of eternal life and deathlessness complete.\n\nYet I fear worldly people cling to theories of medicinal ingredients and firing times, taking them as tangible and deliberate, unable to awaken suddenly. How could they know that before the separation of primordial chaos, there were no years, months, days, or hours; before the birth of father and mother, there were no essence, blood, qi, or fluids? The Dao is originally formless—metaphorically called dragon and tiger. The Dao is originally nameless—compared to lead and mercury.\n\nIf one studies the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, one must perfect both form and spirit, merging with the Dao in true union. How can one be bound by yin and yang, fettered within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a master of the Dao.\n\nSome may doubt, saying this method resembles Chan practice. Yet know this: all day discoursing and questioning is but dry wisdom; years of withered sitting in dullness is but stubborn emptiness. The study of Heavenly Immortals is like a pearl in a crystal dish—rolling freely, lively and vibrant, naturally round and luminous. Such a Heavenly Immortal is truly a Golden Immortal.\"",

      "translated_text": "This is the ineffable mystery—who knows it, who practices it? If one understands the *Vajracchedikā* and *Yuanjue* sutras, the meaning of the Golden Elixir becomes self-evident. Why distinguish between the differences of Lao and Śākya? There is no second Dao in the world, no dual mind in the sage. Moreover, each person is complete, each is perfectly realized—just as everywhere the green willows can tether a horse, every household’s gate opens onto Chang’an. One need only take the swiftest path.\n\nYu Chan says: Those who study immortality in the world are many, yet most study without encountering the Way, encounter it without practicing, practice without diligence, and in old age willingly descend to death beneath the Nine Springs. Is this not tragic? Now I set down the master’s oral instructions, carving them into wood to transmit to the world. Yet in doing so, I reveal the celestial mechanism—will I not incur blame? Niwan says: I shall transform all under heaven into immortals. If I am punished for this, would Heaven not be Heaven? The sutra says: My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. What blame could there be?\n\nYu Chan asks: Why was Ancestor Zhang Pingshu, though thrice transmitting to the unworthy, thrice afflicted with misfortune? Niwan replies: At that time, he lacked discernment, and moreover, his intent was not universal. Alas! The master may be at the edge of the sky, the disciple at the corner of the sea—how much harder is it to recognize a person amid worldly dust? Now I publish this to circulate throughout the world, so that those who cultivate immortality may seek meaning in the text, and the subtle principles will shine forth. This is truly a gift from Heaven—why rely on brush and tongue to transmit it?\n\nOne must settle into stillness, thought within no-thought, the work pure and unified, forged into a single whole. All day, silently like a hen brooding her eggs—then spirit returns to qi, and naturally the Mysterious Pass appears. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, this is the gathering of primordial qi, the mother of the Golden Elixir. Practice diligently, and in days you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. This is a proven effect, offered as guidance to those who study immortality.\n\nI have carefully compiled the essentials of these questions and answers, naming it *On Resolving Doubts in the Cultivation of Immortality*.\n\n**Discourse on the Valley Spirit That Does Not Die**\n\nThe \"valley\" is the Celestial Valley. The \"spirit\" is the original spirit of the body. The valley of Heaven harbors creation, contains emptiness; the valley of Earth holds the ten thousand things, bears mountains and rivers. Humans, sharing the same endowment as Heaven and Earth, also possess a valley. This valley stores the True One and houses the original spirit. Thus, the head has nine palaces, corresponding to the nine heavens. The central palace is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Yellow Court, Kunlun, or Celestial Valley—its names are many. It is the palace where the original spirit resides, hollow like a valley, and the spirit dwells within, hence called the Valley Spirit.\n\nWhen the spirit abides, there is life; when it departs, there is death. By day, it engages with things; by night, it meets in dreams. The spirit cannot rest in its dwelling. Before the yellow millet ripens, before waking from the Southern Branch dream, a lifetime of honor and disgrace, wealth and poverty, a century of sorrow and joy are all tasted in an instant. If it departs and does not return, wanders and does not come back, then the paths of life and death are sundered, the roads of darkness and light cut off.\n\nFrom this, we see that humans cannot give themselves life—the spirit gives them life. Humans cannot bring about their own death—the spirit brings about their death. If the spirit dwells in its valley and does not die, how can a person die? Yet the Valley Spirit does not die because of the Mysterious Female. The \"mysterious\" is yang, Heaven; the \"female\" is yin, Earth. Thus, the Mysterious Female’s two qi each have profound meanings, which cannot be known without receiving oral instructions from a perfected one.\n\nThe *Spiritual Pivot* says: The Celestial Valley’s original spirit, guarded, remains true. It speaks of the human body: above is the Celestial Valley, the Mud Pill, the palace that stores the spirit; in the middle is the Crimson Palace, the palace that stores qi; below is the Spirit Valley, the Pass of Origin, the palace that stores essence. The Celestial Valley is the primordial palace, the chamber of the original spirit, the abode of numinous nature—it is the essence of spirit.\n\nThe sage grasps the essentials of Heaven and Earth, knows the source of transformation. The spirit guards the primordial palace, qi ascends to the female’s mansion. Spirit and qi interact, naturally becoming true, uniting with the Dao, entering into neither death nor life. Thus it is said: The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe sage operates within the Mysterious Female, creating in the midst of vagueness. When the qi of the Mysterious Female enters its root, excessive restraint leads to tension, while indulgence leads to dissipation. One must make it continuous, unbroken. If one preserves it, following its natural course, the spirit will naturally calm, breath will naturally settle, nature will enter spontaneity, and the wondrous function of non-action will never reach exhaustion. Thus it is said: Use it without exertion.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the Mysterious Female is the true path of ascent and descent for the two sources of yin and yang. Worldly people, not delving into its root or investigating its source, take the nose as the mysterious and the mouth as the female. If the nose and mouth are the Mysterious Female, then what shall we call the gate of the Mysterious Female? These are all failures to reach its subtlety. Without being a great sage, how can one thoroughly investigate this principle?\n\n**Discourse on the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang**\n\nHeaven, by the Dao of qian, is light and pure, thus above. Earth, by the Dao of kun, is heavy and turbid, thus below. The primordial qi circulates between them without cease. That which is above employs yang—after the Winter Solstice, the qi of the single yang rises from Earth, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Heaven. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. That which is below employs yin, accumulating for one hundred eighty days until it reaches Earth. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born.",
      "overlap_context": "yin and yang, fettered within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a master of the Dao.\n\nSome may doubt, saying this method resembles Chan practice. Yet know this: all day discoursing and questioning is but dry wisdom; years of withered sitting in dullness is but stubborn emptiness. The study of Heavenly Immortals is like a pearl in a crystal dish—rolling freely, lively and vibrant, naturally round and luminous. Such a Heavenly Immortal is truly a Golden Immortal.\"",

      "translated_text": "A single ascent and a single descent—thus their coming and going are endless. Humans receive the harmonious qi to be born between Heaven and Earth, sharing the same body with them from the very beginning. The qi of Heaven and Earth completes one cycle in a year; the qi of the human body completes one cycle in a day. From *zi* to *si* is the time of yang’s ascent, so *zi* is regarded as the Winter Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Fu*. From *wu* to *hai* is the time of yin’s descent, so *wu* is regarded as the Summer Solstice within the day, corresponding in the *Yi* to *Gou*. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Their alternation between day and night is just like the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one can emulate the function of Heaven and Earth’s hinge, maintaining emptiness and tranquility so that the single qi circulates through the hundred bones, then when it opens, qi issues forth; when it closes, qi enters in. Qi issuing forth is like the ascent of Earth’s qi; qi entering in is like the descent of Heaven’s qi. Thus one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth. But if one rushes about in the realm of splendor or gallops in the arena of right and wrong, true qi will dissipate and no longer belong to oneself. It is better to guard the center with emptiness and stillness to nurture it.\n\nThe center is where the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Mysterious Female converges. If one can focus the mind on it without scattering, true essence will naturally arrive at dawn, primordial qi will naturally gather, the Valley Spirit will naturally connect, the Three Corpses will naturally depart, and the Nine Worms will naturally perish—this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. From this we know that true breathing and primordial qi are the root of the human body’s nature and life. Deep roots and firm stems are the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nHuman life is endowed with the single primordial qi of the great Dao. While in the mother’s womb, one shares breath with her; after birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single spark of primordial yang abides in the cinnabar field. True breathing enters and exits through the Heavenly Gate, connecting with Heaven above, ascending into the Mud Pill, meeting with the primordial spirit, and descending into the cinnabar field, communicating with primordial qi. *Zhuangzi* said: “The breath of the multitude reaches the throat; the breathing of the sage reaches the heels.” The heels represent the Dao of deep roots and firm stems. If one can banish all thoughts, true breathing will naturally settle, the body will enter the formless, and one will unite with the Dao, living long in the world. From this perspective, how can the Dao within the body not be revered? How can it not be prized?",

With the wood that restrains the hun-soul, the metal of the west’s po-soul, the fire of the south’s spirit, the water of the north’s essence, and the earth of the central intent, this is called the interpenetration of the Five Phases. By containing the light of the eyes and condensing the resonance of the ears, regulating the breath of the nose and sealing the qi of the tongue, this is called the harmonization of the Four Images. When the eyes do not see, the hun-soul abides in the liver; when the ears do not hear, the essence abides in the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, the spirit abides in the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po-soul abides in the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, the intent abides in the spleen—this is called the Five Qi Returning to the Origin. Refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness, the qi abides in the spleen without leaking from the four limbs or orifices—this is called \"non-leakage.\" As essence is refined, it is called the \"Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown.\" When the hun-soul abides in the liver without leaking from the eyes, the po-soul in the lungs without leaking from the nose, the spirit in the heart without leaking from the mouth, and the essence in the kidneys without leaking from the ears, intent, spirit, hun-soul, and po-soul blend and merge, transforming into a single qi—imperceptible, formless, and nameless—this is called \"emptiness and non-being.\"\n\nTo refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence aroused by lust. To refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose. To refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and concerns. Thus, this spirit, qi, and essence share the same root as heaven and earth and the same body as the myriad things. Obtaining them brings life; losing them brings death. Refining them with yang fire transforms them into yang qi; nurturing them with yin talismans transforms them into golden essence—thus, \"what is seen cannot be used; what is used cannot be seen.\"\n\nThe body is the dwelling of the heart; the heart is the master of the body. The heart’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger. Within the body resides a single point of true yang qi; within the heart resides a single point of true yin essence—these are called the \"Two Things.\" The heart belongs to Qian; the body belongs to Kun—thus, they are the cauldron and vessel of Qian and Kun. Yang qi belongs to Li; yin essence belongs to Kan—thus, they are the medicine of the Crow and Hare. Embracing the One and guarding the center, refining the primordial and nurturing simplicity—this is called \"gathering the primordial qi of pre-heaven.\" From dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, from noon’s yang to midnight’s yin—this is called \"circulating the fire times of the celestial cycle.\" Wood fluid flourishes at *mao*; metal essence flourishes at *you*—thus, one must bathe. The Zhen male drinks the wine of the west; the Dui female plucks the flower of the north. The Xun wind stirs the six yangs; the Kun earth stores their number—thus, one must withdraw and replenish.\n\nAt the outset of gathering the medicine, one moves the key of Qian and Kun and takes the *daogui* of Li and Kan. At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains; next, like the moon cradling ten thousand waters. Naturally, it resembles the union of tortoise and snake, the pacing of horse and ox. Yet one does not realize: the dragon contends for the hun-soul, the tiger for the po-soul, the crow for essence, the hare for spirit. Within the indistinct, true lead appears; within the profound darkness, true mercury exists. With the Yellow Dame as matchmaker, guard the Central Palace. Lead flees at the sight of fire; mercury scatters at the sight of fire. Thus, blend them with the oil of non-action and stabilize them with the uncarved jade. Lead returns to the Kun palace; mercury returns to the Qian position. True earth blends them, containing light in silence.\n\nWhen the fire’s number is excessive, it scorches; when the water’s measure is too great, it overflows. The scorching of fire and the overflow of water must be balanced—thus, there are the methods of weights and measures. At this stage of refinement, wind arises in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and waves settle in the Valley Sea. The spine turns like a wheel; the four limbs become like mountain stone. The pores feel as if just risen from a bath; bones and channels are as if in deep slumber. Spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy; hun-soul and po-soul cling like mother and child. This is the true realm, not a metaphor.\n\nRefining with method gathers without scattering; refining with weights and measures binds ever more firmly. The hun-soul is stored; the po-soul is extinguished. Essence congeals; spirit solidifies. A single intent of harmonious qi pervades, and the skin becomes radiant. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers. From formlessness, form arises—thus, the Sacred Embryo is formed.\n\nA year has twelve months; a month has thirty days; a day has one hundred *ke*. A month totals three thousand *ke*; ten months total thirty thousand *ke*. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying, one continuously abides in it. Once the fetal qi congeals, the infant manifests; the Mysterious Pearl takes form; the Great One contains the true. Thus, within these thirty thousand *ke*, one can seize the thirty thousand years of heaven. Why? Because each *ke* of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal cycle—thus, thirty thousand *ke* can seize thirty thousand years. A year has twelve months, totaling thirty-six thousand *ke*. Even the dullest and most ignorant person, by practicing this, can ascend to the sacred realm. Yet how is it that the common people daily neglect it?\n\nThe loss of the primordial, the exhaustion of primordial qi, the impurity of primordial spirit—thus, in these thirty thousand *ke*, each *ke* must be harmonized. If even a single *ke* deviates, the medicinal materials dissipate, and the fire times falter. Thus, it is said: \"A hair’s difference, and the elixir will not form.\" One must act in every *ke*, yet the effort is not laborious. True qi congeals; primordial spirit expands. Internally, one refines the elixir of thirty thousand *ke* in a year; externally, one seizes the thirty thousand years of a lifetime. In greatness, one forms the embryo of thirteen thousand five hundred breaths in a day; in smallness, one circulates the qi of eighty-four thousand *li* in twelve hours. Thus, it is said: \"Seize the single yang of heaven and earth, gather the dual qi of sun and moon, circulate true water in the lead furnace, and move true fire in the mercury cauldron.\"",

      "translated_text": "When lead encounters mercury, it is called the Flowery Pond; when mercury enters lead, it is called divine water. One must not cling to non-action, nor manifest in forced effort; one must not be rigid in visualization, nor attached to holding and guarding; one must not sit in lifeless stillness, nor practice blindly and recklessly. The greatest fear is not knowing the source of the medicinal materials, or being ignorant of the methods and measures of fire times. One must know the single aperture within the body, called the Mysterious Female. This aperture is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nTo know this single aperture is to know where the winter solstice resides, where the medicinal materials lie, where the fire times are found, where bathing occurs, where the embryo forms, and where the body is shed. This aperture has no boundaries, no inside or outside; it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness. Seek it within the body—it cannot be sought elsewhere. This aperture of essence cannot be conjectured by private speculation; it must be transmitted heart-to-mouth. Without such transmission, all efforts are in vain.\n\nHerein lies this *Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir*, encompassing the root of creation and transformation, threading through the marrow of yin and yang. It guides those who refine the elixir to trace the stream and know the source, to abandon delusion and follow truth, lest they forget the root and chase the branches.\n\nThe golden elixir arises from nothingness and is nurtured along its path. Yet its birth from nothingness must not be forced into the form of an infant; how can one cling to images and texts and drown in crooked byways and empty spaces? Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, and that within nothingness there is indeed something—this is true emptiness.\n\nNow, as Ma Ziran departs, he speaks these words for your reflection:\n\nTrue earth captures true lead,\nTrue lead restrains true mercury.\nLead and mercury return to true earth,\nBody and mind still and unmoving.\n\nTrue earth is the earth within the body. Lead and mercury are the water and fire within the body. With earth restraining water, lead may be captured; with water restraining fire, mercury may be controlled. Why are lead-water and mercury-fire both subdued by true earth? Only when body and mind unite in stillness can earth, water, and wood merge as one—this is the method of gathering medicinal materials into the furnace and cauldron.\n\nFrom emptiness, white snow is born;\nFrom stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.\nThe jade furnace’s fire glows warmly,\nAbove the cauldron, purple mist soars.\n\nWhite snow must arise from emptiness, for it is born from nothingness. The yellow sprout must be nurtured by fire, for fire gives birth to earth. Just as in the months of *zi* and *chou*, when yang qi has yet to stir and all things vanish into nothingness, white snow descends from heaven. By the months of *yin* and *mao*, when yang qi gradually flourishes and stillness holds movement within, the yellow sprout emerges from the earth. Once white snow and yellow sprout appear, the fire of the jade furnace need only be warmly nurtured, and naturally, purple mist will rise above the cauldron. If the fire is too fierce, it will scatter all.\n\nThe lotus of the Flowery Pond blooms,\nDivine water’s golden waves grow still.\nDeep in the night, the moon shines bright,\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\n\nThe *hua* is the flower, akin to fire. The *shen* is the heart, which belongs to fire. The essence of the golden elixir lies in divine water, for the Flowery Pond embodies the principle of water and fire in harmony. When waves within water become clear and serene, fire gives birth to the lotus, and the flower naturally blooms. At midnight, the hour of *zi*, when the first yang stirs, the moon shines fully, its golden light illuminating heaven and earth as a single bright mirror.\n\nCinnabar refines yang qi,\nQuicksilver cooks gold essence.\nGold essence and yang qi—\nCinnabar and quicksilver.\n\nYang qi is the single spark of true yang within the body. Gold essence is the single drop of true yin within the heart. Refined with yang fire, it becomes like cinnabar; nurtured with yin tally, it becomes like quicksilver. Cinnabar and quicksilver are external substances; using external medicines to describe the inner elixir is a last resort for immortals.\n\nThe sun’s soul is the jade hare’s marrow,\nThe moon’s spirit is the golden crow’s essence.\nGathered into the cauldron,\nThey transform into a pool of water.\n\nThe soul governs wood, and wood gives birth to fire, so spirit is stored in the soul. The spirit governs metal, and metal gives birth to water, so essence is stored in the spirit. If one can nourish spirit by absorbing wind and nurture essence by absorbing qi, then spirit and essence merge and harmonize within the cauldron, transforming into a pool of water.\n\nMedicinal materials arise in the mysterious aperture,\nFire times ignite the yang furnace.\nWhen dragon and tiger meet,\nThe precious cauldron yields the mysterious pearl.\n\nThe medicinal materials—crow’s liver, hare’s marrow, red mercury, black lead—all arise within the mysterious aperture. If one can rouse the fire of samadhi within the yang furnace, then dragon and tiger will meet, refining metal and wood to give birth to the yellow sprout, and finally producing a single grain of the mysterious pearl.\n\nThis aperture is no ordinary thing,\nFormed by the union of heaven and earth.\nCalled the cavity of spirit and qi,\nWithin it lies the essence of *kan* and *li*.\n\nThe aperture of the Mysterious Female is no common object. Before this body existed, this aperture was already present. It is neither above nor below, neither within nor without—it is the primordial aperture. At the moment of the body’s conception, the father’s essence and the mother’s blood joined to form it, becoming the cavity of spirit and qi, which holds the essence of water and fire.\n\nA single red drop of wood-mercury,\nThree pounds of black metal-lead.\nLead and mercury congeal into cinnabar,\nGlowing with the radiant hue of purple gold.",

      "translated_text": "I bow my head a hundred times in reverent reply to the Venerable Master of Tiantai, the Perfected One of Realizing the True, the True Man Zhang of Purple Yang’s gate. On this day, as spring’s winds and rains awaken, all things grow verdant and chill. I humbly pray that the celestial spirits of water, grass, and valley, the divine soldiers of heaven and earth, left and right, may overflow with dragon essence, that the fire-tending remains serene and still, that golden flowers fill the chamber, and that root and destiny be restored.\n\nI have heard it said: “There is no second Dao in the world, no dual heart in the sage.” The greatness of the Dao cannot be captured in form or description; if one were to describe this Dao, it would be emptiness, stillness, and void—subtly profound, deep, and silent. The vastness of the heart cannot be compared or likened; if one were to liken this heart, it would be purity, clarity, spiritual luminosity—harmonious, warm, and refined.\n\nWhen the myriad transformations return to the one Dao, then all under heaven transforms itself, and the ten thousand things are naturally as they are. When the hundred deeds return to the one heart, then the sage naturally acts without acting, and all things arise without attachment. Extend this heart to merge with the Dao, and this heart is the Dao; embody this Dao to unite with the heart, and this Dao is the heart. The Dao fuses with the heart, the heart fuses with the Dao. Beyond the heart, there is no separate Dao; beyond the Dao, there is no separate thing.\n\nThus, heaven and earth were never originally Qian and Kun, yet the ten thousand things naturally embody Qian and Kun. The sun and moon were never originally separated from Kan, yet the ten thousand things naturally partake of Kan’s departure. Reflecting on our Dao Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao, who enlightened the world with this Dao and clarified the heart for the sage: this Dao in the world cannot be objectified or transformed by things. Therefore, the principles of objectification and transformation exist in the world but not in this Dao. This Dao is thusness itself; to unite this heart with this Dao is fitting.\n\nThis heart in the sage cannot be known by knowledge or recognized by recognition; such principles exist in the sage but not in this heart. This heart is thusness itself; to unite this Dao with this heart is fitting. The Dao pulses through this heart, the heart marrowizes this Dao. I know not which is Dao and which is heart. I only perceive the indistinct and vague, the dim and obscure—something like a thing yet not a thing, something like an image yet not an image. If one listens with the ears, the eyes hear; if one looks with the eyes, the ears see. I fear this can only be named the marrow of yin and yang, the essence of chaos, the root of emptiness, the stem of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe ancients, not knowing, forcibly named it the Dao. From today’s perspective, calling a rainbow a rainbow is but deluded refinement; pointing to jade as jade is but empty rhetoric. Is this not the Golden Elixir? Now, to know the wonder of the Golden Elixir, why fabricate the illusion of a furnace or cling to the form of a crucible? The Yellow Sprout and White Snow are not the visible Yellow Sprout and White Snow; the Divine Water and Flower Pool are not the usable Divine Water and Flower Pool. If likened to lead essence and mercury marrow, or compared to gold essence and wood liquid—where is the furnace for refining the crescent moon? Where is the crucible for smelting cinnabar? Knowing this, one says: the sun’s crow and moon’s hare, the heavenly horse and earthly ox.\n\nQian and Kun originally have no use for departing Kan, just as Kan has no substance of Qian and Kun. Red lead and black mercury—are these not the mating of dragon and tiger? White gold and black tin—are these not the union of tortoise and snake? The numbers two, eight, nine, and three are all variant meanings of yin and yang; the measures of jin, zhu, and liang are but remnants of chaos. In essence, they are harmonized and balanced, drawn out and applied. Thus, these medicinal substances are not materials of metal, stone, herbs, or wood; this fire-tending is not measured by years, months, days, or hours.\n\nBefore father and mother were born, there were already endless living paths. After body and mind cease movement, the infinite true mechanism of the limitless remains. Formerly, by long-standing karmic affinity, a withered bone was revived by a needle’s touch. Having long attended the master’s side, I have fortunately tasted the Dharma-milk. It is said: the essence of refining the Golden Elixir is to gather medicinal substances within stillness and conduct the fire-tending within non-action. It is to bathe in the union of spirit and qi, to match form and spirit. Only then does one realize that within the heart lies boundless medicinal material, and within the body lies boundless fire symbols.\n\nAwakening to this, one refines the Elixir thus; cultivating the Dao thus, one carves stone to seek jade, refines sand to obtain gold, tempers the form to nurture spirit, and clarifies the mind to merge with the Dao—all are of one intent. This is the principle of extracting mercury from lead and cinnabar from sand. Proceeding accordingly, husband and wife unite.\n\nApplying this principle to the Confucian classics, it is one; applying it to the Buddhist scriptures, it is one. Thus, there is no second Dao in the world. Since the Dao of heaven has no dual principles, how could the heart of the sage have two uses? Within form, spirit is sovereign, for spirit is the destiny of form; within spirit, nature is the ultimate, for nature is the destiny of spirit. From the spirit within form uniting with the nature within spirit—this is called returning to the root and restoring destiny.\n\nThis Dao is most clear, this heart no longer deluded. The secret of the seven returns and nine reversions is not transmitted in the world. The seven returns and nine reversions signify returning to the origin and reverting to the source. The numbers seven and nine are both yang numbers. If one can be without heart in the heart, without thought in thought, utterly pure and without blemish—this is called pure yang. At this time, the Three Corpses vanish, the Six Thieves surrender, and even if a body exists outside the body, it is not yet extraordinary. Only when emptiness is pulverized does the whole body fully appear.\n\nThe shallow understanding of the vulgar, the superficial learning of common folk—how could they know that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the celestial and terrestrial immortals daily gather medicinal substances without cease, and that the more they gather, the more inexhaustible the medicinal substances become? How could they know that the mountains, rivers, and great earth, along with the dull and the sentient, constantly tend the fire without pause, and that the more the fire is tended, the more it does not rest?",

      "translated_text": "Only this fire-tending and these medicinal substances—follow them and you remain mortal; reverse them and you become a sage. As the ancient saying goes: *\"When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields its seven treasures; when the Five Phases flow in order, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit.\"* Such is the principle.\n\nThe former masters Master Niyuan and Perfected One Cuixu emerged from the lineage of the Venerable Master Piling, Master Xue. Yet the thread of Piling’s transmission truly originated with the Venerable Master Xinglin, Master Shi. Master Shi inherited the Dao of Ancestral Master Ziyang. Viewing the single transmission of today, one might say that the nightlong dream of Xihua at Tiantai in former times was nothing other than a blessing for later generations—a boon to the myriad spirits.\n\nIn recent years, Master Niyuan led me to the immortal cavern of Huodong, where we burned incense and bowed reverently. The ancestral masters Xinglin and Piling responded to our fervent invocations, touching our bodies and grasping our ears to return with us, deepening our resolve to embrace the feminine and hold fast to the One. When I arrived at Wuyi and met Ma Ziran, he spoke earnestly, presenting a sacred scroll of four hundred words. Each character was a healing stone; gazing upon it, I recognized the nurturing love, as sweet dew bathed my heart, and my very bones and marrow felt suddenly clear.\n\nSince the wondrous Dao has become manifest, I have long dwelled at Zhiti. Now, as he prepares to depart like an infant torn from its mother, he wishes to visit Qingcheng Mountain. Passing by chance through Shiwu Cavern, I was moved to send this brief letter. Here, I have described only the essence of the great elixir of golden cinnabar. As for the mechanism of the plantain flower in spring wind, the secret of the parasol tree in autumn rain, the midnight moon over the emerald pool, and the evening clouds above the green mountains—such profound mysteries dare not be openly revealed, for they pertain to the celestial workings.\n\nHas the ancestral master nodded in approval?\n\nThe three masters—Xinglin, Piling, and Niyuan—must now soar like cranes on paired wings. Ashamed that the path of immortals and mortals remains divided, I wonder when my work of refinement will be complete, when I may ride the spirit and command the qi, to stand beneath their soaring sandals and serve in the calling of phoenixes and cranes. As I write, my longing overflows, tears staining the brush, leaving me disoriented and at a loss.\n\nI humbly beseech you to send a purple raft or ascend a cinnabar ladder, to store up golden sand and extend your hand to the multitude of creatures. I dare not elaborate further.\n\n**A Letter in Gratitude to the Immortal Master**\n\nThe golden elixir is forged by gathering the medicine of two eights and nurturing the embryo for three hundred days. The work of the heart lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling qi; the primordial creation requires gathering qi and congealing spirit. To practice this, one must rely on oral instructions—utterly simple, utterly easy, neither form nor emptiness.\n\nWithin the formless, nurture the infant; within yin, refine yang qi. Let the Metal Lord capture the living tiger; let the Maiden of Cinnabar ride the crimson dragon alone. The Heavenly Husband and Earthly Wife, with the Yellow Dame as matchmaker; the Maiden of Li and the Lad of Kan, uniting to form the crimson child. A single furnace’s flame refines emptiness into motes of dust; a vast ice-pot reflects the world as a grain of millet.\n\nWhen spirit returns to the four great elements, it is the moment of the tortoise and serpent’s union; when qi enters the four limbs, it is the place where the crow and hare gather. The jade gourd yields golden liquid; the golden sprout blossoms into a white jade flower. At the hour when wind chimes tinkle and the moon shines bright—who grasps the meaning of green mountains and flowing waters?\n\nThe sagely masters, mouth to mouth, have transmitted this through the ages, heart to heart. Even if one were to thread together ten thousand immortal classics, a single moment’s work brings boundless ease. First, clarify the Three-Five-One, and refine it with the true fire of the nine yangs. Later, when it reaches ten thousand, a hundred, a thousand, the infant’s treasure is complete.\n\nA mountain of silver, a wall of iron—a single thrust of the awl pierces the golden lock and jade gate, and each step becomes naturally unimpeded. One sees a realm of ten thousand miles without a speck of dust and becomes a person of a thousand years, never to die. The seas turn to mulberry fields, yet I wander in carefree realms; my robe wears away the stone of kalpas, and together we return to the land of Nothing Whatsoever.\n\nThe white toad’s original vow remains unfulfilled, my initial sincerity and past reverence unshaken. I sigh at my reed-like nature, now nearing the twilight years. Yet my aged cheeks still flush red, as if destined for immortality; my youthful beard darkens again, returning at last to the source of virtue and the Dao.\n\nI lament that the ancients spoke of sixty-four as the age of retirement, yet I have received the eighty-one chapters of the former sages to enjoy. My village breast weeps tears; I seal my lips and press my hand to my heart. All my past efforts and labors were like grasping at shadows—today, in the realm of the formless, the alchemical method turns iron into gold.\n\nI revere the sagely masters Niyuan Nie and Perfected One Cuixu—heroes of the age, with the skill to mend the heavens. Their hearts transmit the profound intent of clouds and rain; their hands wield the mighty power of thunder. I, Yu Chan, am indebted to three generations of masters, awaiting the true chariot for a thousand years. I spoke of the medicinal spoon on an autumn evening in *guiyou*, and exhausted the workings of Kan and Li in the spring rains of *yihai*.\n\n**Miscellaneous Writings on the Pointers to the Mysteries from the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection, Scroll Six (concluded)**\n**Miscellaneous Writings on the Pointers to the Mysteries from the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection, Scroll Seven**\n\n**Eight Treasures for the World to Inherit**\n*By Xu Zhenjun of West Mountain*\n\n**Song of the Drunken Immortal**",

operation.\n\nZhongli Quan said:\nThe four great elements of the body all belong to yin.\nThus, one cannot seek within the body—\nOne may only pursue the single spark of yang essence within.\nYet this yang essence resides in an aperture,\nWhich ordinary people cannot fathom.\nThis single aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,\nThe very flowery pond of spirit.\nKnowing this, one may then gather and refine,\nThen unite and congeal, then refine and bathe,\nAnd finally nurture to form the elixir.\nHow can the elixir be completed without discerning the source,\nKnowing the weight, or

      "translated_text": "6. Do not overindulge in wine or consume forbidden meats.\n   Instead, regulate your qi and temperament, and devote yourself to purity and emptiness.\n\n7. Do not be insatiably greedy, hoarding wealth without sharing.\n   Instead, practice frugality and relieve the poor and needy.\n\n8. Do not associate with the unworthy or dwell in filth and disorder.\n   Instead, seek those who surpass you and reside in quiet seclusion.\n\n9. Do not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or untrustworthy.\n   Instead, fulfill your duties to ruler and teacher, and extend sincerity to all things.\n\n10. Do not treat speech and laughter lightly or act without authenticity.\n    Instead, always maintain integrity and modesty, and make the Dao and virtue your foremost concern.\n\nThose who uphold these Ten Precepts shall ascend as immortals.\n\n*Song of Guarding Life* by Master Shuxi of the Western Mountains\n\nIn this world, tales abound of those who consume elixirs or feast on immortal fruits to ascend in broad daylight—yet such wonders remain unseen. As for the arts of cultivating qi, they closely align with the Way of nurturing life. Humans are born with qi and blood, and as the *Treatise on Nurturing Life* states: \"The essence of nurturing life lies in removing what harms it.\" This is a clear truth.\n\nThe *Song of Dispelling Illness* I have compiled distills the essentials of nurturing life from various schools. Those who follow it shall attain peace and joy; if its profound subtleties are fully realized, longevity may also be within reach.\n\nThe song says:\nOf all things, humans are most noble,\nA hundred years of life but a fleeting sojourn.\nWithout intent to cultivate and nurture,\nIllness and suffering shall weigh upon the heart.\n\nExamine your diet and desires,\nRemove excesses to find ease.\nWhy chase cloud-gazing or alchemical pills,\nFalsely seeking to extend life like tortoises or cranes?\n\nAfter eating, walk a hundred steps at a leisurely pace,\nRub your hands together and massage your abdomen.\nThen turn your hands to stroke the kidneys,\nThis is called \"moving Water and Earth.\"\n\nLook up and exhale three or four times,\nNaturally dispelling the toxins of food.\nDrunken slumber and overfull reclining bring no benefit,\nWhile excessive thirst or hunger must also be avoided.\n\nDo not eat too coarsely or hastily,\nBetter to eat lightly in succession.\nA single heavy meal to fill the stomach\nHarms the qi and injures the spleen—no blessing for you.\n\nAvoid raw, tough, or greasy foods,\nAs well as the flesh of dead or trapped animals.\nSteamed buns obstruct the qi and are unfit,\nRaw fish readily invite spleen and stomach ailments.\n\nFresh sauces, fertilized eggs, and oily foods,\nAlong with aged, spoiled, or pickled items, all belong to the yin category.\nThe elderly and infirm should not consume them,\nFor it is no different from inviting bandits to arm themselves.\n\nGrilled and roasted foods should be eaten sparingly,\nLest they harm the teeth and damage the blood vessels.\nDine before the hours of *shen* and *you*,\nFor late-night eating burdens the stomach and diaphragm.\n\n*Note: The spleen delights in music; eating at night prevents the spleen’s qi from grinding, as the sounds of music cease. The* Rites of Zhou *states: \"Music accompanies meals,\" for the spleen rejoices in the sounds of strings and bamboo. At the first note, the spleen begins to grind. Thus, all sounds originate from the spleen. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided, lest digestion falter.*\n\nDo not drink to the point of drunkenness,\nFor excess harms the spirit and impairs the mind.\nWhen thirsty, drink water or tea,\nYet this may cause swelling in the waist and legs.\n\n*Note: While wine can gladden the temperament and circulate the blood, it naturally invites wind and harms the kidneys, rotting the intestines and corroding the knees—nothing is more damaging. After a full meal, it is especially to be avoided. Drink slowly, lest you injure the lungs. The lungs are the bloom of the five viscera and must not be harmed. When wine has not yet worn off and thirst is great, avoid drinking water or tea, for the wine will draw them into the kidneys, creating stagnant toxic water. This leads to heavy, aching legs, cold pain in the bladder, and ailments like edema, wasting-thirst, and spasms.*\n\n*Generally, tea is not to be consumed in any season, as it chills the lower burner. Only after a meal may one or two cups be taken without harm, for it aids digestion. When hungry, it is especially to be avoided.*\n\nI have often heard: \"Avoid wind as you would an arrow.\"\nIn sitting or lying, take care to guard against harm.\nAfter drinking, the pores open,\nAnd the slightest breeze may cause paralysis.\n\n*Note: If you sense wind while sitting outdoors, avoid it promptly—do not endure it. The elderly, whose bodies are depleted and defenses weak, are easily invaded by wind. At first, they may not notice, but over time, it harms them. Thus, even in summer, do not seek coolness in the wind or fan yourself while drunk. There was once a man who learned the Way of longevity from Peng Zu but suffered from chronic headaches. Peng Zu examined his sleeping quarters and found a hole directly above his head. He promptly had it sealed, and the ailment vanished.*\n\nWarm wine in all seasons,\nFor if it is too hot, it will be hard to drink.\nExcess of any of the five flavors harms the body,\nLest they bring misfortune to the organs.\n\n*Note: A moderate amount of the five flavors refreshes, but excess harms the corresponding organs. Too much sourness injures the spleen, too much pungency harms the liver, too much salt damages the heart, too much bitterness injures the lungs, and too much sweetness harms the kidneys. This is the natural principle of the Five Phases. At first, the harm is imperceptible, but over time, it becomes chronic.*\n\nDo not engage in prolonged seeing, hearing, walking, or sitting,\nFor the five labors and seven injuries arise from this.\n\n*Note: Prolonged seeing harms the heart and depletes the blood; prolonged sitting injures the spleen and wastes the flesh; prolonged exposure harms the lungs and depletes the qi; prolonged walking injures the liver and damages the sinews; prolonged standing harms the kidneys and weakens the bones. This is why Confucius said: \"Move when it is time to move, sit when it is time to sit.\"*\n\nThe limbs should be gently exercised,\nLike a door hinge that never rusts.\n\n*Note: Fatigue may arise from inactivity. Do not always carry heavy burdens or grasp light objects, idling away the days. Yet it is the idle who often suffer from this ailment. Those who live in leisure do not exert themselves, and after eating, they sit outdoors. Their meridians become blocked, and their blood stagnates—this is the cause. Thus, the noble appear at ease but labor in mind, while the humble are carefree in heart but toil in body.*",

      "translated_text": "The noble, indulging in untimely desires or unaware of taboos, may feast on delicacies before lying down outdoors—thus, they must engage in physical exertion, though not to the point of exhaustion. What matters is that *rong* and *wei* circulate freely, blood and vessels flow smoothly, like running water that never stagnates or a door hinge that never rusts. Outdoors, do not loathe stretching and relaxing; after a full meal, bathe; when hungry, comb your hair. Frequent combing and infrequent bathing benefit the heart and eyes; silent rest and dim sleep keep the spirit serene.\n\n*Note: Lying on one’s side with knees bent strengthens the heart and qi. Upon waking, stretch fully to preserve the spirit. Stretching outdoors may invite demons and spirits—Confucius did not sleep like a corpse, and this is likely why. Frequent combing dispels wind and brightens the eyes, so Daoists comb their hair one hundred and twenty times each morning. Excessive bathing harms the heart and abdomen, causing fatigue. One should not speak while lying down, for the five viscera are like bells and chimes—unsuspended, they cannot sound. Sleeping with a lamp or candle disturbs the spirit.*\n\nOf the four seasons, summer is the most difficult to manage, for *yin* lies hidden within, and the abdomen grows cold. Tonics for the kidneys and intestines must not be lacking, and cold foods should be avoided. *Note: Summer is the season when one’s essence and spirit are depleted. The heart flourishes while the kidneys wane, their essence transforming into water, which only congeals in autumn and hardens by winter—thus, one must be especially vigilant. In summer, regardless of age, all should consume warming foods; by autumn, this prevents cholera and vomiting. A consistently warm abdomen keeps all illnesses at bay, for robust blood and qi naturally resist disease. When the heart flourishes and the kidneys wane, what must one avoid? Above all, avoid draining the essence and qi. Sleeping quarters should be secluded and quiet, with tranquil repose and a harmonious mind.*\n\n*Note: The \"Monthly Commands\" for mid-summer decree that the noble fast, dwell in stillness, cover their bodies, and avoid restlessness; they must abstain from music and sensuality, moderate their diet, and refrain from indulgence to calm the heart and qi. Bathing, washing, and rinsing should all be done with warm water. Even in sweltering heat, washing the face or hands with cold water dries the five viscera, depleting their fluids—how much worse is bathing? Pillows made of cold materials severely harm the eyes. Melons, raw vegetables, and uncooked greens should not be eaten—not only do they cause autumnal malaria and dysentery.*\n\n*Note: Raw vegetables are inherently cold; melons may regulate qi but dull the ears and eyes. Donkeys and horses that eat them go blind the same day. Such foods should generally be avoided in all seasons, not just summer, and the elderly must be especially cautious.*\n\nWhen *yang* lies hidden within during the three winter months, take care not to sweat excessively, lest the *yang* qi be drained. *Note: Heaven and earth are closed, blood and qi are stored—even if ill, one should not induce sweating. Do not travel far in misty conditions or linger in violent storms and thunder. Note: Once, three men ventured out early in the fog—one fasting, one having eaten porridge, and one having drunk wine. The fasting man died, the porridge-eater fell ill, and the wine-drinker remained healthy, for wine repels frost, dew, and malevolent qi. If you suddenly encounter whirlwinds, thunder, or dark mists on the road, seek shelter indoors; otherwise, you will be harmed. The damage may not be apparent at first, but over time, it will manifest as illness.*\n\nThe Daoists have further principles for nurturing life, the foremost being to restrain one’s will. In autumn and winter, dress only after sunrise; in spring and summer, rise at cock’s crow. *Note: Rise early in spring and summer, and sleep late in autumn and winter. Late rising should not extend past sunrise, and early rising should not precede cock’s crow. Awaken between midnight and dawn, close your eyes, and click your teeth thirty-four times. Inhale the new and exhale the old without error, then swallow the Jade Spring to nourish the embryo.*\n\n*Note: The fluid in the mouth is called the \"Flowery Pool\" or \"Jade Spring.\" The* Huangting Jing *states: \"The Jade Spring’s pure water irrigates the numinous root; cultivate this, and your life will endure.\" Damo’s* Taixi Lun *says: \"For ingestion, one should sit cross-legged facing east after midnight, exhale the old qi from the abdomen three or two times, then pause and gently inhale fresh qi through the nose. Beneath the tongue lie two cavities connected to the kidney orifices; press the tongue against the upper palate, hold the breath briefly, and saliva will flow. Rinse the mouth until full, then swallow slowly, allowing it to naturally irrigate the five viscera—this is called 'qi returning to the cinnabar field.' If midnight is missed, dawn will suffice; even midday is acceptable. The pillow should not be too high.\"*\n\nHan Xijing lived to one hundred and twenty, yet remained robust, claiming that daily ingestion of the Jade Spring and thirty-four tooth-clicks—called \"refining the essence\"—was his secret. The Later Han adept Wang Zhen often rinsed his mouth with the Jade Spring beneath his tongue and swallowed it, calling it \"embryonic breathing.\" Sun Simiao said: \"Hair should be frequently combed, hands often rubbed over the face, teeth regularly clicked, saliva constantly swallowed, and qi refined with precision. These five practices are what the* Huangting Jing *means by: 'If you wish not to die, cultivate the Kunlun.'\"*\n\nWarm your palms by rubbing them and press them over your eyes—*Note: Do this thirty-four times to naturally clear obstructions from the eyes, dispel wind, and brighten the vision. No method surpasses this for supplementing kidney qi.* Then rub your forehead and face. *Note: Frequently wiping the forehead—called \"cultivating the Heavenly Court\"—twenty to thirty-four times from the hairline will naturally lend the face a lustrous glow. Those with dim vision should do this often.* Occasionally massage the sides of your nose with your middle fingers. *Note: Rub the sides of the nose twenty to thirty times until both inside and out are warm—this is called \"irrigating the Central Peak to moisten the lungs.\"* Knead your ears and the corners of your eyes repeatedly. *Note: Kneading the ears means massaging the ear lobes.
