  "full_translation": "**Daoist Canon of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\n**Title:** *The True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (Unannotated Edition from the Daoist Canon)\nThis edition’s text and chapter divisions align with the *Heshang Gong’s Chapter and Verse* version, likely dating to the Song dynasty.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Transmission*, *Section of Divine Writings*, *Category of Original Texts*\n**Collated with:** *Laozi’s True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue: Heshang Gong’s Chapter and Verse*\n\n---\n\n### *The True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume One*\n\n**Chapter 1: Embracing the Dao**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nThus, in constant non-being, one observes its mystery;\nIn constant being, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and yet more profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\n**Chapter 2: Nurturing Life**\nWhen all under heaven recognize beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhen all recognize goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficult and easy complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nSound and voice harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\nThe ten thousand things arise, yet he does not refuse them;\nHe gives them life, yet does not possess them;\nHe acts, yet does not rely on them;\nHe accomplishes, yet does not dwell in it.\nOnly because he does not dwell in it does it not depart.\n\n**Chapter 3: Pacifying the People**\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.\nThus, in the sage’s governance,\nHe empties their hearts,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their ambitions,\nStrengthens their bones,\nEver keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.\nHe ensures that the knowing dare not act—\nActing through non-action, nothing is left ungoverned.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Fathomless Source**\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nIt blunts its sharpness,\nUntangles its knots,\nSoftens its glare,\nMerges with its dust.\nSubmerged! It seems to endure.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nIt appears before the image of the Lord.\n\n**Chapter 5: Emptiness and Use**\nHeaven and earth are not humane;\nThey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane;\nHe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Completion of Images**\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female—\nThis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly enduring, it seems to exist;\nIts use is never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter 7: Veiling Radiance**\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring.\nThe reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring\nIs because they do not live for themselves—\nThus they can live long.\nTherefore, the sage places himself last and yet comes first,\nPuts himself outside and yet remains.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he can achieve his self.\n\n**Chapter 8: Ease of Nature**\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend;\nIt dwells in places all others disdain—\nThus it is close to the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be close to the earth.\nIn the heart, be deep.\nIn giving, be kind.\nIn speech, be truthful.\nIn governance, be orderly.\nIn affairs, be capable.\nIn action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending can one be free from blame.\n\n**Chapter 9: Balancing the Extreme**\nTo hold and fill to overflowing is not as good as stopping.\nTo sharpen and grind to a point cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted ruin.\nTo withdraw when the work is done—\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\n\n**Chapter 10: The Power of Capacity**\nIn embracing the soul and holding to the One, can you never part from it?\nIn concentrating qi and attaining softness, can you be like an infant?\nIn cleansing and purifying your profound mirror, can you make it without blemish?\nIn loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?\nIn opening and closing the gates of heaven, can you play the female?\nIn understanding all directions, can you do so without knowledge?\nIt gives life and nurtures,\nGives life yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely on it,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter 11: The Use of Non-Being**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\nClay is shaped into a vessel—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\nThus, being provides the advantage,\nNon-being provides the use.\n\n**Chapter 12: Restraining Desire**\n\n**Chapter 12: Restraining Desire**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nRacing and hunting madden the heart,\nRare goods impede conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—\nTherefore he discards that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter 13: Disdaining Shame**\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm,\nRegard great trouble as you do your body.\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like alarm\"?\nFavor is base.\nGaining it is like alarm,\nLosing it is like alarm—\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like alarm.\"\nWhat is meant by \"regard great trouble as you do your body\"?\nThe reason I have great trouble\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body,\nWhat trouble could I have?\nTherefore, one who values the body as the world\nMay be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves the body as the world\nMay be charged with the world.\n\n**Chapter 14: Praising the Mysterious**\nLook for it and it cannot be seen—it is called *Yi* (Subtle).\nListen for it and it cannot be heard—it is called *Xi* (Rare).\nGrasp for it and it cannot be held—it is called *Wei* (Minute).\nThese three cannot be fully fathomed,\nThus they merge into one.\nIts rising is not bright,\nIts sinking is not dark,\nUnceasing, unnameable,\nIt returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nThe imageless image,\nThe elusive and evanescent.\nMeet it and you do not see its head,\nFollow it and you do not see its rear.\nHold to the ancient Dao\nTo master the present being,\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 15: Manifesting Virtue**\nThe masters of old who were adept in the Dao\nWere subtly mysterious and profoundly penetrating,\nToo deep to be known.\nBecause they were unknowable,\nI force myself to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a winter stream,\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides,\nReserved, as if a guest,\nYielding, as ice about to melt,\nSimple, as uncarved wood,\nVast, as a valley,\nOpaque, as muddy water.\nWho can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?\nWho can rouse the stagnant and gradually bring it to life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nBecause they are not full,\nThey can be worn yet ever renewed.\n\n**Chapter 16: Returning to the Root**\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nHold fast to stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nI thereby observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\nEach returns to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nStillness is called returning to life,\nReturning to life is called constancy,\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.\nKnowing constancy brings acceptance,\nAcceptance brings impartiality,\nImpartiality brings kingship,\nKingship brings heaven,\nHeaven brings the Dao,\nThe Dao brings enduring,\nAnd one’s body is not imperiled.\n\n**Chapter 17: Pure Customs**\nThe highest rulers—those below know they exist.\nNext, they are loved and praised.\nNext, they are feared.\nNext, they are scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nHow carefully they weigh their words!\nWhen tasks are accomplished and affairs completed,\nThe people say, \"We are naturally thus.\"\n\n**Chapter 18: Declining Customs**\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned,\nThere is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge,\nThere is great hypocrisy.\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nThere is filial piety and kindness.\nWhen the state is in chaos and confusion,\nThere are loyal ministers.\n\n**Chapter 19: Returning to Simplicity**\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom,\nAnd the people will benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness,\nAnd the people will return to filial piety and kindness.\nAbandon skill, discard profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers will disappear.\nThese three, as cultural adornments, are insufficient—\nTherefore let them have something to which they belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce selfishness, diminish desires.\n\n**Chapter 20: Different Customs**\nAbandon learning and there will be no sorrow.\nHow much difference is there between \"yes\" and \"ah\"?\nHow far apart are good and evil?\nWhat others fear, I too must fear—\nHow boundless! How endless!\nThe crowd is merry,\nAs if feasting on a great sacrifice,\nAs if ascending a springtime terrace.\nI alone am inert, showing no sign,\nLike an infant who has not yet smiled,\nListless, as if with nowhere to go.\nThe crowd all have more than enough,\nI alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nI alone am dim.\nThe common people are sharp,\nI alone am dull.\nVast, like the ocean,\nCeaseless, as if without end.\nThe crowd all have purpose,\nI alone am stubborn and rustic.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I value seeking sustenance from the Mother.\n\n**Chapter 21: The Empty Heart**\nThe appearance of great virtue\nFollows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing\nIs elusive and evanescent.\nEvanescent, elusive,\nYet within it are images.\nElusive, evanescent,\nYet within it are things.\nDark, obscure,\nYet within it is essence.\nIts essence is most real,\nWithin it is trustworthiness.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not depart,\nBy which we observe the origins of all things.\nHow do I know the origins of all things?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 22: Increasing Humility**\n\n**Chapter 22: Increasing Humility (continued)**\nTo yield is to be preserved whole;\nTo be bent is to become straight;\nTo be hollow is to be filled;\nTo be tattered is to be renewed;\nTo have little is to possess;\nTo have much is to be perplexed.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One,\nAnd becomes the model for all under heaven.\nHe does not display himself, and so is luminous.\nHe does not assert himself, and so is distinguished.\nHe does not boast, and so achieves merit.\nHe does not strive, and so endures.\nIt is only because he does not contend\nThat none under heaven can contend with him.\nThe ancient saying, \"To yield is to be preserved whole,\"\nIs not an empty phrase.\nTruly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.\n\n**Chapter 23: Emptiness and Non-Being**\nRare words are natural.\nA whirlwind does not last the morning;\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho makes these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot make them last long,\nHow much less can man?\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao\nAre one with the Dao.\nThose who follow virtue\nAre one with virtue.\nThose who follow loss\nAre one with loss.\nThose who are one with the Dao,\nThe Dao also welcomes them.\nThose who are one with virtue,\nVirtue also welcomes them.\nThose who are one with loss,\nLoss also welcomes them.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThere is distrust.\n\n**Chapter 24: Forced Effort**\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who takes long strides cannot walk far.\nOne who displays himself is not luminous;\nOne who asserts himself is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who strives does not endure.\nIn the Way, these are called:\n\"Excess food and redundant deeds.\"\nSome things detest them,\nTherefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\n\n**Chapter 25: The Image of the Dao**\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nIt moves around without peril,\nAnd is the mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it \"Dao\";\nIf forced to give it a name, I call it \"Great.\"\nGreat means it flows ever onward,\nFlowing ever onward means it is far-reaching,\nFar-reaching means it returns.\nTherefore: the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four greats,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nAnd the Dao models itself on nature.\n\n**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**\nThe heavy is the root of the light;\nStillness is the ruler of motion.\nTherefore the noble person travels all day\nWithout leaving the baggage wagon.\nThough there are beautiful sights to see,\nHe remains calm and unattached.\nHow can a lord of ten thousand chariots\nTreat himself lightly before all under heaven?\nTo be light is to lose one’s ministers;\nTo be restless is to lose one’s throne.\n\n**Chapter 27: Skillful Means**\nGood traveling leaves no tracks;\nGood speech has no flaws;\nGood reckoning uses no tally sticks;\nGood closure needs no bolts, yet cannot be opened;\nGood binding needs no cords, yet cannot be untied.\nTherefore the sage is always good at saving people,\nAnd so abandons no one.\nHe is always good at saving things,\nAnd so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following the light.\nThus the good person is the teacher of the bad,\nAnd the bad person is the resource of the good.\nOne who does not value his teacher,\nOr love his resource,\nThough wise, is greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter 28: Returning to Simplicity**\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine,\nAnd be a valley for all under heaven.\nBeing a valley for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue does not depart,\nAnd you return to the state of infancy.\nKnow the white, hold to the black,\nAnd be a model for all under heaven.\nBeing a model for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue does not err,\nAnd you return to the boundless.\nKnow honor, hold to disgrace,\nAnd be a valley for all under heaven.\nBeing a valley for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue is complete,\nAnd you return to simplicity.\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nThe sage uses it, and becomes the chief of officials.\nTherefore the great ruler does not carve.\n\n**Chapter 29: Non-Action**\nThose who would take hold of all under heaven and act upon it,\nI see they will not succeed.\nAll under heaven is a sacred vessel,\nNot to be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nTherefore things sometimes lead, sometimes follow;\nSometimes breathe gently, sometimes blow fiercely;\nSometimes are strong, sometimes weak;\nSometimes are secure, sometimes destroyed.\nTherefore the sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness.\n\n**Chapter 30: Restraining Warfare**\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao\nDoes not dominate all under heaven with arms.\nSuch affairs tend to rebound.\nWhere armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great wars, years of famine follow.\nThe good person aims only for results,\nAnd does not dare to dominate by force.\nHe achieves results but does not boast;\nHe achieves results but does not brag;\nHe achieves results but is not arrogant;\nHe achieves results because he has no choice;\nHe achieves results but does not dominate.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age.\nThis is called \"not the Dao.\"\nWhat is not the Dao soon ends.\n\n**Chapter 31: Against Warfare**\nFine weapons are instruments of ill omen.\nSome things detest them,\nTherefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\nThe noble person at home values the left;\nIn war, he values the right.\nWeapons are instruments of ill omen,\nNot the instruments of the noble person.\nHe uses them only when he has no choice.\nPeace and quiet are prized.\nVictory is not beautiful.\nThose who find it beautiful\nRejoice in killing.\nThose who rejoice in killing\nCannot achieve their ambitions under heaven.\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nIn inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.\nThe lieutenant general stands on the left,\nThe supreme general stands on the right.\nThis means they are positioned as in a funeral.\nWhen many are killed,\nOne should mourn with sorrow and grief.\nWhen victorious in war,\nOne should observe the rites of mourning.\n\n**Chapter 32: The Virtue of the Sage**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\nThough its simplicity seems small,\nNone under heaven can subordinate it.\nIf kings and lords could hold to it,\nThe myriad things would submit of themselves.\nHeaven and earth unite to drop sweet dew,\nAnd the people, without being commanded, distribute it evenly.\nWhen institutions begin, names arise.\nOnce names exist,\nOne should also know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop is how to avoid peril.\nThe Dao’s relation to all under heaven\nIs like that of rivers and valleys to the great rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter 33: Discerning Virtue**\nOne who knows others is wise;\nOne who knows himself is enlightened.\nOne who conquers others has strength;\nOne who conquers himself is mighty.\nOne who knows contentment is rich;\nOne who perseveres has will.\nOne who does not lose his place endures;\nOne who dies yet does not perish enjoys long life.\n\n**Chapter 34: The All-Pervading Dao**\nThe great Dao flows everywhere,\nTo the left and to the right.\nThe myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse them.\nIts work is accomplished, yet it does not claim credit.\nIt clothes and nourishes the myriad things, yet does not act as their master.\nEver without desire, it may be called \"small.\"\nThe myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—\nIt may be called \"great.\"\nBecause it never regards itself as great,\nIt is able to achieve greatness.\n\nThe myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—\nIt may be called \"great.\"\nThus the sage never regards himself as great,\nAnd so is able to achieve greatness.\n\n**Chapter 35: Virtue of Benevolence**\nHold to the great image, and all under heaven will come to you.\nThey come without harm, and dwell in peace and security.\nMusic and fine food may make the passing traveler pause,\nBut the Dao as it issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor.\nLook for it and it cannot be seen;\nListen for it and it cannot be heard;\nUse it and it cannot be exhausted.\n\n**Chapter 36: Subtle Illumination**\nThat which is to be contracted must first be expanded.\nThat which is to be weakened must first be strengthened.\nThat which is to be abolished must first be exalted.\nThat which is to be taken away must first be given.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nThe sharp instruments of the state must not be displayed to others.\n\n**Chapter 37: Governance**\nThe Dao is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone.\nIf lords and rulers can hold to it, the myriad things will transform themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs and desire arises,\nI will press it down with the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block—\nIt too will be without desire.\nWithout desire, through tranquility,\nAll under heaven will right itself.\n\n*Tao Te Ching, Scroll One*\n*(Note: Following the original text, two and a half pages—ten blocks—of Fu Yi’s *Ancient Text of the Tao Te Ching* are inserted here under the character 聖. Corrected according to *Heshang Gong’s Chapter and Verse*, without further textual notes to avoid redundancy.)*\n\n*Tao Te Ching, Scroll Two*\n**Chapter 38: On Virtue**\n\n**Chapter 38: On Virtue**\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue never loses virtue—thus it lacks virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts not, nor does it act for any purpose.\nThe lesser virtue acts, and it acts for a purpose.\nThe highest benevolence acts, yet without purpose.\nThe highest righteousness acts, and with purpose.\nThe highest propriety acts, yet none respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of disorder.\nForethought is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the onset of folly.\nTherefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,\nNot in the superficial.\nAbides in the fruit,\nNot in the blossom.\nThus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\n**Chapter 39: The Root of Law**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear.\nEarth attained the One and became stable.\nSpirits attained the One and became numinous.\nValleys attained the One and became full.\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life.\nLords and rulers attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n\nShould this attainment be pressed further:\nWithout clarity, heaven might split.\nWithout stability, earth might erupt.\nWithout numinosity, spirits might vanish.\nWithout fullness, valleys might dry.\nWithout life, the myriad things might perish.\nWithout nobility and loftiness, lords and rulers might falter.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nThe lofty takes the lowly as its foundation.\nTherefore, lords and rulers call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy\"—\nIs this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?\nThus, the pursuit of excessive praise yields no praise.\nOne should not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.\n\n**Chapter 40: Rejecting Utility**\nReversion is the movement of the Dao;\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nAll things under heaven arise from being,\nAnd being arises from non-being.\n\n**Chapter 41: Sameness and Difference**\nWhen the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nWhen middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe it.\nWhen the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nIf they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThus, the established saying goes:\nThe bright Dao seems dim;\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nThe level Dao seems uneven.\nThe highest virtue resembles a valley;\nGreat whiteness seems sullied;\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient;\nEstablished virtue seems lax;\nTrue substance seems mutable.\nThe great square has no corners;\nThe great vessel is late in completion;\nThe great tone is soundless;\nThe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless—\nYet only the Dao excels at bestowing and completing.\n\n**Chapter 42: The Dao’s Transformations**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nThe One gives birth to the Two;\nThe Two give birth to the Three;\nThe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAnd through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people despise are \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy\"—\nYet kings and dukes use these as their titles.\nThus, things may be diminished yet gain,\nOr increased yet lose.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\n**Chapter 43: Universal Application**\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest.\nNon-being enters where there is no space.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching without words,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew under heaven attain these.\n\n**Chapter 44: Establishing Boundaries**\nFame or self—which is dearer?\nSelf or wealth—which is greater?\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nThus, excessive love incurs great cost;\nHoarding brings heavy loss.\nKnow contentment, and you will not be disgraced.\nKnow when to stop, and you will not be imperiled.\nThis is how to endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Vast Virtue**\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness seems empty, yet its use is unending.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\nGreat skill seems clumsy;\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nMovement overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.\nClarity and tranquility are the standard for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: Moderating Desire**\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world loses the Dao, cavalry horses breed in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;\nNo fault is greater than the desire for gain.\nThus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 47: Discerning the Distant**\nWithout stepping outside, one knows all under heaven.\nWithout looking through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the sage knows without traveling,\nNames without seeing,\nAccomplishes without acting.\n\n**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**\nIn the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.\nLosing and losing again,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo govern all under heaven, one must always remain without affairs.\nWhen affairs arise, it is no longer sufficient to govern all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 49: Embracing Virtue**\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nBut takes the people’s mind as their own.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining virtue in goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining virtue in trust.\nThe sage, in their presence under heaven, is reverent,\nAnd for all under heaven, harmonizes their minds.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nAnd the sage treats them all as children.\n\n**Chapter 50: Valuing Life**\nEmerging into life, entering death—\nOf those bound for life, ten have three;\nOf those bound for death, ten have three.\nOf those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, ten have three.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they over-nourish life.\nI have heard that those skilled in preserving life\nTravel on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without donning armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn;\nThe tiger finds no place to sink its claws;\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have no ground for death.\n\n**Chapter 51: Nurturing Virtue**\nThe Dao gives them life;\nVirtue nurtures them.\nMatter shapes them;\nCircumstances complete them.\nThus, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe reverence for the Dao, the honor for virtue—\nNo one bestows these, yet they are always naturally so.\nThus, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them,\nRears them, matures them, ripens them, sustains them, and protects them.\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter 52: Returning to the Source**\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich is the mother of the world.\nOnce you grasp the mother,\nYou know her children.\nOnce you know the children,\nReturn to guard the mother.\nThus, to the end of life, you will not be imperiled.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates—\nAnd to the end of life, you will not toil.\nOpen the openings, meddle in affairs—\nAnd to the end of life, you will not be saved.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity;\nTo guard the soft is called strength.\nUse your light,\nYet return to the state of no-light,\nLeaving no harm to the body—\nThis is called embracing the constant.\n\n**Chapter 53: Adding Evidence**\nIf I had but a little knowledge,\nI would walk the great Dao,\nFearing only to stray.\nThe great Dao is smooth,\nYet the people prefer byways.\n\nThe court is immaculate,\nThe fields are overgrown,\nThe granaries are empty.\nThey wear fine embroidery,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSate themselves with food and drink,\nHoard excess wealth—\nThis is called the boast of thieves.\nIt is not the Dao!\n\n**Chapter 54: Cultivating Observation**\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nWhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus, descendants will never cease their sacrifices.\n\nCultivate it in your person—\nYour virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in your family—\nYour virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in your village—\nYour virtue will endure.\nCultivate it in your state—\nYour virtue will abound.\nCultivate it in the world—\nYour virtue will be universal.\n\nTherefore, observe the person through the person,\nThe family through the family,\nThe village through the village,\nThe state through the state,\nThe world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Mystery’s Token**\nOne whose virtue is profound\nIs like a newborn child.\nPoisonous insects will not sting it,\nFierce beasts will not seize it,\nBirds of prey will not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet its grip is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female,\nYet its organ stirs—\nSuch is the perfection of its essence.\nIt cries all day without hoarseness—\nSuch is the perfection of its harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ill-omened;\nTo let the mind direct the qi is called forceful.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nThis is called not-Dao.\nNot-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Mystery’s Virtue**\nThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nBlunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nSoften the glare, merge with the dust—\nThis is called the mysterious sameness.\n\nThus, it cannot be made close,\nNor can it be made distant;\nIt cannot be benefited,\nNor can it be harmed;\nIt cannot be valued,\nNor can it be demeaned.\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter 57: The Unadorned Wind**\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nUse the military with cunning,\nTake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nThe more prohibitions in the world,\nThe poorer the people.\nThe more sharp weapons the people have,\nThe more troubled the state.\nThe more skill and craft,\nThe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nThe more thieves and bandits there are.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, and the people right themselves.\nI do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves.\nI have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.\n\n**Chapter 58: Following Transformation**\nWhen governance is dull,\nThe people are simple.\nWhen governance is exacting,\nThe people are lacking.\n\nDisaster is where fortune leans;\nFortune is where disaster lurks.\nWho knows their ultimate point?\nIs there no norm?\nThe norm reverts to the strange,\nGoodness reverts to the baleful.\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\n\nThus, the sage is square but not cutting,\nSharp but not piercing,\nStraight but not overbearing,\nBright but not dazzling.\n\n**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nNothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one return early.\nTo return early is called accumulating virtue abundantly.\nAccumulating virtue abundantly—\nThere is nothing one cannot overcome.\nWhen there is nothing one cannot overcome,\nNo one knows one’s limit.\nWhen no one knows one’s limit,\nOne can possess the state.\nPossessing the mother of the state,\nOne can endure long.\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nThe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Occupying the Position**\nGoverning a great state\nIs like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao is applied to the world,\nIts ghosts lose their spiritual power.\nNot that its ghosts lose their spiritual power,\nBut their power no longer harms the people.\nNot only do the ghosts’ powers not harm the people,\nThe sage also does not harm the people.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Virtue of Humility**\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nThe confluence of the world.\nThe world’s confluence is the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness,\nUsing stillness as the lower.\n\nThus, if a great state lowers itself to a small state,\nIt will win over the small state.\nIf a small state lowers itself to a great state,\nIt will win over the great state.\nThus, some lower themselves to win,\nSome lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires only to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires only to join and serve others.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nSo the great should lower themselves.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao**\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things,\nThe treasure of the good,\nThe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can be traded,\nNoble conduct can be offered to others.\nWhy abandon those who are not good?\n\nTherefore, when the Son of Heaven is established,\nThe Three Ministers are appointed,\nThough one may present jade disks followed by teams of horses,\nIt is not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao valued of old?\nDid they not say:\nSeek and you will obtain,\nHave sins and you will be spared?\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Grace**\nPractice non-action,\nAttend to non-affairs,\nTaste the tasteless.\nWhether great or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\n\nPlan for difficulty when it is easy;\nAct on the great when it is minute.\nThe world’s difficult affairs\nMust begin with what is easy.\nThe world’s great affairs\nMust begin with what is minute.\nThus, the sage never strives for the great,\nAnd so accomplishes the great.\n\nOne who makes promises lightly must lack trust;\nOne who takes things lightly must encounter many difficulties.\nThus, the sage treats things as difficult,\nAnd so never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: Guarding the Minute**\nWhat is at rest is easy to hold;\nWhat has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for.\nWhat is brittle is easy to break;\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before it exists;\nGovern before it is in disorder.\n\nA tree as wide as a man’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny shoot.\n\nA nine-story terrace rises from piled earth;\nA thousand-mile journey begins with a single step.\nOne who acts fails in it;\nOne who grasps loses it.\nThus, the sage does not act and so does not fail,\nDoes not grasp and so does not lose.\n\nThe people in their affairs\nOften fail when near completion.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nAnd there will be no failed affairs.\n\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not prize goods hard to obtain.\nLearns what others do not learn,\nAnd returns to what the multitude has passed by.\nThereby he aids the naturalness of the myriad things,\nYet dares not act.\n\n**Chapter 65: Simplicity of Virtue**\nThose of old who were adept in the Dao\nDid not enlighten the people with it,\nBut rather made them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nBecause of their cleverness.\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s ruin.\nNot to govern the state with cleverness\nIs the state’s blessing.\nTo know these two is also a pattern.\nTo constantly know this pattern\nIs called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nAnd turns back with things,\nThen attains great compliance.\n\n**Chapter 66: Putting Oneself Last**\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nIs that they excel in staying low.\nThus, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nHe must speak as though he were beneath them.\nIf he wishes to be ahead of the people,\nHe must put himself behind them.\nThus, though he dwells above, the people do not feel his weight;\nThough he stands in front, the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, the world delights in pushing him forward and does not tire of him.\nBecause he does not contend,\nNo one in the world can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**\nAll under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unlike anything else.\nPrecisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything else.\nIf it were like anything else, it would long since have become small.\n\nI have three treasures that I hold and preserve:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nCompassionate, thus able to be courageous;\nFrugal, thus able to be expansive;\nNot daring to be first in the world,\nThus able to become the chief of all vessels.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim courage,\nTo abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,\nTo abandon the last yet claim the first—\nThis is death.\nFor with compassion, in battle one wins;\nIn defense, one is secure.\nHeaven will save such a one,\nAnd protect him with compassion.\n\n**Chapter 68: Matching Heaven**\nOne adept as a warrior is not martial;\nOne adept in battle is not enraged;\nOne adept at conquering the enemy does not engage them;\nOne adept at employing others places himself below them.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThe power of employing others,\nMatching Heaven—\nThe ultimate of old.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Mysterious Use**\nThere is a saying in the use of arms:\nI dare not be the host, but rather the guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.\nThis is called marching without marching,\nRolling up one’s sleeves without baring one’s arms,\nSeizing without confronting an enemy,\nWielding a weapon without holding one.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nThe one that retreats will win.\n\n**Chapter 70: Knowing Difficulty**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\nWords have an ancestor,\nAffairs have a lord.\nIt is only because of ignorance\nThat they do not know me.\nThose who know me are few,\nThus I am esteemed.\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing Sickness**\nTo know yet to think one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think one knows is sickness.\nOnly by regarding sickness as sickness\nCan one not be sick.\nThe sage is not sick,\nBecause he regards sickness as sickness—\nThus he is not sick.\n\n**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**\nWhen the people do not fear authority,\nThen great authority arrives.\nDo not constrict their dwelling,\nDo not oppress their livelihood.\nOnly by not oppressing them\nWill they not be oppressed.\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter 73: Acting Through Non-Action**\n\n**Chapter 73: Acting Through Non-Action (continued)**\nTo be brave in daring leads to death;\nTo be brave in not daring leads to life.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWho knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?\nEven the sage finds this difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven:\nExcels in victory without contention,\nResponds well without speech,\nArrives of itself without summons.\nThough unhurried, it excels in planning.\nThe net of Heaven is vast and wide,\nSparse yet nothing escapes.\n\n**Chapter 74: Governing Delusion**\nWhen the people no longer fear death,\nWhy threaten them with death?\nIf the people always feared death,\nAnd I seized and killed those who act strangely,\nWho would dare?\nThere is always an executioner who kills.\nTo kill in place of the executioner\nIs like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter.\nFew who hew wood in place of the master carpenter\nDo not injure their own hands.\n\n**Chapter 75: The Harm of Greed**\nThe people’s hunger\nComes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\nComes from their superiors’ meddling—\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s disregard for death\nComes from their excessive pursuit of life—\nThus they disregard death.\nOnly those who do not make life their aim\nAre wiser than those who value life.\n\n**Chapter 76: Warning Against Strength**\nWhen the people are born, they are supple and weak;\nWhen they die, they are stiff and strong.\nAll things—plants and trees—\nWhen alive are supple and fragile;\nWhen dead, they are withered and dry.\nThus, the stiff and strong are companions of death;\nThe supple and weak are companions of life.\nTherefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail;\nWhen a tree is strong, it will be felled.\nThus, the strong and stiff occupy the lower position,\nWhile the supple and weak occupy the higher.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**\nThe Way of Heaven—\nIs it not like drawing a bow?\nWhat is high is pressed down,\nWhat is low is lifted up;\nWhat has excess is reduced,\nWhat is insufficient is supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement insufficiency.\nThe way of man is not so—\nIt reduces the insufficient to serve the excess.\nWho can take excess and offer it to the world’s insufficiency?\nOnly one who possesses the Way.\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\nAccomplishes without dwelling on it,\nAnd does not wish to display his worth.\n\n**Chapter 78: Trusting in Simplicity**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing can surpass it in attacking the hard and strong—\nNothing can replace it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThere is none in the world who does not know this,\nYet none can practice it.\nTherefore, the sage says:\nTo bear the nation’s disgrace\nIs to be lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nTo bear the nation’s misfortune\nIs to be king under Heaven.\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical.\n\n**Chapter 79: Fulfilling Agreements**\nWhen great resentment is reconciled,\nSome resentment must remain.\nHow can this be made good?\nTherefore, the sage holds the left tally\nAnd does not demand from others.\nThose who possess virtue oversee the tally;\nThose who lack virtue oversee exactions.\nThe Way of Heaven shows no favoritism—\nIt always aligns with the good.\n\n**Chapter 80: Standing Alone**\nLet states be small, their people few.\nThough there be tools for ten or a hundred,\nLet them not be used.\nLet the people hold life dear\nAnd not wander far afield.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nLet none ride them.\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nLet none display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\nSweet be their food,\nFair their clothing,\nSecure their dwellings,\nJoyful their customs.\nNeighboring states may be within sight,\nThe cries of cocks and dogs may be heard,\nYet the people will grow old and die\nWithout ever coming and going between them.\n\n**Chapter 81: Manifest Reality**\nTruthful words are not fine;\nFine words are not truthful.\nThe good do not dispute;\nThe disputatious are not good.\nThe wise are not broadly learned;\nThe broadly learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not accumulate.\nHaving given all to others,\nHe possesses even more.\nHaving bestowed all on others,\nHe has even greater abundance.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm.\nThe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.",

It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\nIt blunts its sharpness,\nUntangles its knots,\nSoftens its glare,\nMerges with its dust.\nSubmerged! It seems to endure.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nIt appears before the image of the Lord.\n\n**Chapter 5: Emptiness and Use**\nHeaven and earth are not humane;\nThey treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane;\nHe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Completion of Images**\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female—\nThis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly enduring, it seems to exist;\nIts use is never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter 7: Veiling Radiance**\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring.\nThe reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring\nIs because they do not live for themselves—\nThus they can live long.\nTherefore, the sage places himself last and yet comes first,\nPuts himself outside and yet remains.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he can achieve his self.\n\n**Chapter 8: Ease of Nature**\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend;\nIt dwells in places all others disdain—\nThus it is close to the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be close to the earth.\nIn the heart, be deep.\nIn giving, be kind.\nIn speech, be truthful.\nIn governance, be orderly.\nIn affairs, be capable.\nIn action, be timely.\nOnly by not contending can one be free from blame.\n\n**Chapter 9: Balancing the Extreme**\nTo hold and fill to overflowing is not as good as stopping.\nTo sharpen and grind to a point cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance bring self-inflicted ruin.\nTo withdraw when the work is done—\nThis is the Dao of heaven.\n\n**Chapter 10: The Power of Capacity**\nIn embracing the soul and holding to the One, can you never part from it?\nIn concentrating qi and attaining softness, can you be like an infant?\nIn cleansing and purifying your profound mirror, can you make it without blemish?\nIn loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?\nIn opening and closing the gates of heaven, can you play the female?\nIn understanding all directions, can you do so without knowledge?\nIt gives life and nurtures,\nGives life yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely on it,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter 11: The Use of Non-Being**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\nClay is shaped into a vessel—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nWhere there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\nThus, being provides the advantage,\nNon-being provides the use.\n\n**Chapter 12: Restraining Desire**",

Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot make them last long,\nHow much less can man?\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao\nAre one with the Dao.\nThose who follow virtue\nAre one with virtue.\nThose who follow loss\nAre one with loss.\nThose who are one with the Dao,\nThe Dao also welcomes them.\nThose who are one with virtue,\nVirtue also welcomes them.\nThose who are one with loss,\nLoss also welcomes them.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThere is distrust.\n\n**Chapter 24: Forced Effort**\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who takes long strides cannot walk far.\nOne who displays himself is not luminous;\nOne who asserts himself is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who strives does not endure.\nIn the Way, these are called:\n\"Excess food and redundant deeds.\"\nSome things detest them,\nTherefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\n\n**Chapter 25: The Image of the Dao**\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void,\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nIt moves around without peril,\nAnd is the mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it \"Dao\";\nIf forced to give it a name, I call it \"Great.\"\nGreat means it flows ever onward,\nFlowing ever onward means it is far-reaching,\nFar-reaching means it returns.\nTherefore: the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd the king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four greats,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nAnd the Dao models itself on nature.\n\n**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**\nThe heavy is the root of the light;\nStillness is the ruler of motion.\nTherefore the noble person travels all day\nWithout leaving the baggage wagon.\nThough there are beautiful sights to see,\nHe remains calm and unattached.\nHow can a lord of ten thousand chariots\nTreat himself lightly before all under heaven?\nTo be light is to lose one’s ministers;\nTo be restless is to lose one’s throne.\n\n**Chapter 27: Skillful Means**\nGood traveling leaves no tracks;\nGood speech has no flaws;\nGood reckoning uses no tally sticks;\nGood closure needs no bolts, yet cannot be opened;\nGood binding needs no cords, yet cannot be untied.\nTherefore the sage is always good at saving people,\nAnd so abandons no one.\nHe is always good at saving things,\nAnd so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following the light.\nThus the good person is the teacher of the bad,\nAnd the bad person is the resource of the good.\nOne who does not value his teacher,\nOr love his resource,\nThough wise, is greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter 28: Returning to Simplicity**\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine,\nAnd be a valley for all under heaven.\nBeing a valley for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue does not depart,\nAnd you return to the state of infancy.\nKnow the white, hold to the black,\nAnd be a model for all under heaven.\nBeing a model for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue does not err,\nAnd you return to the boundless.\nKnow honor, hold to disgrace,\nAnd be a valley for all under heaven.\nBeing a valley for all under heaven,\nEternal virtue is complete,\nAnd you return to simplicity.\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nThe sage uses it, and becomes the chief of officials.\nTherefore the great ruler does not carve.\n\n**Chapter 29: Non-Action**\nThose who would take hold of all under heaven and act upon it,\nI see they will not succeed.\nAll under heaven is a sacred vessel,\nNot to be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nTherefore things sometimes lead, sometimes follow;\nSometimes breathe gently, sometimes blow fiercely;\nSometimes are strong, sometimes weak;\nSometimes are secure, sometimes destroyed.\nTherefore the sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness.\n\n**Chapter 30: Restraining Warfare**\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao\nDoes not dominate all under heaven with arms.\nSuch affairs tend to rebound.\nWhere armies camp, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great wars, years of famine follow.\nThe good person aims only for results,\nAnd does not dare to dominate by force.\nHe achieves results but does not boast;\nHe achieves results but does not brag;\nHe achieves results but is not arrogant;\nHe achieves results because he has no choice;\nHe achieves results but does not dominate.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age.\nThis is called \"not the Dao.\"\nWhat is not the Dao soon ends.\n\n**Chapter 31: Against Warfare**\nFine weapons are instruments of ill omen.\nSome things detest them,\nTherefore those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\nThe noble person at home values the left;\nIn war, he values the right.\nWeapons are instruments of ill omen,\nNot the instruments of the noble person.\nHe uses them only when he has no choice.\nPeace and quiet are prized.\nVictory is not beautiful.\nThose who find it beautiful\nRejoice in killing.\nThose who rejoice in killing\nCannot achieve their ambitions under heaven.\nThus in auspicious affairs, the left is honored;\nIn inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.\nThe lieutenant general stands on the left,\nThe supreme general stands on the right.\nThis means they are positioned as in a funeral.\nWhen many are killed,\nOne should mourn with sorrow and grief.\nWhen victorious in war,\nOne should observe the rites of mourning.\n\n**Chapter 32: The Virtue of the Sage**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\nThough its simplicity seems small,\nNone under heaven can subordinate it.\nIf kings and lords could hold to it,\nThe myriad things would submit of themselves.\nHeaven and earth unite to drop sweet dew,\nAnd the people, without being commanded, distribute it evenly.\nWhen institutions begin, names arise.\nOnce names exist,\nOne should also know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop is how to avoid peril.\nThe Dao’s relation to all under heaven\nIs like that of rivers and valleys to the great rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter 33: Discerning Virtue**\nOne who knows others is wise;\nOne who knows himself is enlightened.\nOne who conquers others has strength;\nOne who conquers himself is mighty.\nOne who knows contentment is rich;\nOne who perseveres has will.\nOne who does not lose his place endures;\nOne who dies yet does not perish enjoys long life.\n\n**Chapter 34: The All-Pervading Dao**\nThe great Dao flows everywhere,\nTo the left and to the right.\nThe myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse them.\nIts work is accomplished, yet it does not claim credit.\nIt clothes and nourishes the myriad things, yet does not act as their master.\nEver without desire, it may be called \"small.\"\nThe myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—\nIt may be called \"great.\"\nBecause it never regards itself as great,\nIt is able to achieve greatness.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 38: On Virtue**\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue never loses virtue—thus it lacks virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts not, nor does it act for any purpose.\nThe lesser virtue acts, and it acts for a purpose.\nThe highest benevolence acts, yet without purpose.\nThe highest righteousness acts, and with purpose.\nThe highest propriety acts, yet none respond—\nThen it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of disorder.\nForethought is the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the onset of folly.\nTherefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,\nNot in the superficial.\nAbides in the fruit,\nNot in the blossom.\nThus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\n**Chapter 39: The Root of Law**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear.\nEarth attained the One and became stable.\nSpirits attained the One and became numinous.\nValleys attained the One and became full.\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life.\nLords and rulers attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n\nShould this attainment be pressed further:\nWithout clarity, heaven might split.\nWithout stability, earth might erupt.\nWithout numinosity, spirits might vanish.\nWithout fullness, valleys might dry.\nWithout life, the myriad things might perish.\nWithout nobility and loftiness, lords and rulers might falter.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nThe lofty takes the lowly as its foundation.\nTherefore, lords and rulers call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy\"—\nIs this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?\nThus, the pursuit of excessive praise yields no praise.\nOne should not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.\n\n**Chapter 40: Rejecting Utility**\nReversion is the movement of the Dao;\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nAll things under heaven arise from being,\nAnd being arises from non-being.\n\n**Chapter 41: Sameness and Difference**\nWhen the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nWhen middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe it.\nWhen the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nIf they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThus, the established saying goes:\nThe bright Dao seems dim;\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nThe level Dao seems uneven.\nThe highest virtue resembles a valley;\nGreat whiteness seems sullied;\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient;\nEstablished virtue seems lax;\nTrue substance seems mutable.\nThe great square has no corners;\nThe great vessel is late in completion;\nThe great tone is soundless;\nThe great image has no form.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless—\nYet only the Dao excels at bestowing and completing.\n\n**Chapter 42: The Dao’s Transformations**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One;\nThe One gives birth to the Two;\nThe Two give birth to the Three;\nThe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAnd through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people despise are \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy\"—\nYet kings and dukes use these as their titles.\nThus, things may be diminished yet gain,\nOr increased yet lose.\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The violent do not die a natural death.\"\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n\n**Chapter 43: Universal Application**\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest.\nNon-being enters where there is no space.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching without words,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew under heaven attain these.\n\n**Chapter 44: Establishing Boundaries**\nFame or self—which is dearer?\nSelf or wealth—which is greater?\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nThus, excessive love incurs great cost;\nHoarding brings heavy loss.\nKnow contentment, and you will not be disgraced.\nKnow when to stop, and you will not be imperiled.\nThis is how to endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Vast Virtue**\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness seems empty, yet its use is unending.\nGreat straightness seems bent;\nGreat skill seems clumsy;\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nMovement overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.\nClarity and tranquility are the standard for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 46: Moderating Desire**\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world loses the Dao, cavalry horses breed in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;\nNo fault is greater than the desire for gain.\nThus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 47: Discerning the Distant**\nWithout stepping outside, one knows all under heaven.\nWithout looking through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThus, the sage knows without traveling,\nNames without seeing,\nAccomplishes without acting.\n\n**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**\nIn the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.\nLosing and losing again,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo govern all under heaven, one must always remain without affairs.\nWhen affairs arise, it is no longer sufficient to govern all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 49: Embracing Virtue**\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nBut takes the people’s mind as their own.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining virtue in goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining virtue in trust.\nThe sage, in their presence under heaven, is reverent,\nAnd for all under heaven, harmonizes their minds.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nAnd the sage treats them all as children.\n\n**Chapter 50: Valuing Life**\nEmerging into life, entering death—\nOf those bound for life, ten have three;\nOf those bound for death, ten have three.\nOf those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, ten have three.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they over-nourish life.\nI have heard that those skilled in preserving life\nTravel on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without donning armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn;\nThe tiger finds no place to sink its claws;\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have no ground for death.\n\n**Chapter 51: Nurturing Virtue**\nThe Dao gives them life;\nVirtue nurtures them.\nMatter shapes them;\nCircumstances complete them.\nThus, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe reverence for the Dao, the honor for virtue—\nNo one bestows these, yet they are always naturally so.\nThus, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them,\nRears them, matures them, ripens them, sustains them, and protects them.\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nLeads yet does not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.",

children,\nReturn to guard the mother.\nThus, to the end of life, you will not be imperiled.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates—\nAnd to the end of life, you will not toil.\nOpen the openings, meddle in affairs—\nAnd to the end of life, you will not be saved.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity;\nTo guard the soft is called strength.\nUse your light,\nYet return to the state of no-light,\nLeaving no harm to the body—\nThis is called embracing the constant.\n\n**Chapter 53: Adding Evidence**\nIf I had but a little knowledge,\nI would walk the great Dao,\nFearing only to stray.\nThe great Dao is smooth,\nYet the people prefer byways.\n\nThe court is immaculate,\nThe fields are overgrown,\nThe granaries are empty.\nThey wear fine embroidery,\nCarry sharp swords,\nSate themselves with food and drink,\nHoard excess wealth—\nThis is called the boast of thieves.\nIt is not the Dao!\n\n**Chapter 54: Cultivating Observation**\nWhat is well planted cannot be uprooted;\nWhat is well embraced cannot slip away.\nThus, descendants will never cease their sacrifices.\n\nCultivate it in your person—\nYour virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in your family—\nYour virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in your village—\nYour virtue will endure.\nCultivate it in your state—\nYour virtue will abound.\nCultivate it in the world—\nYour virtue will be universal.\n\nTherefore, observe the person through the person,\nThe family through the family,\nThe village through the village,\nThe state through the state,\nThe world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Mystery’s Token**\nOne whose virtue is profound\nIs like a newborn child.\nPoisonous insects will not sting it,\nFierce beasts will not seize it,\nBirds of prey will not strike it.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet its grip is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female,\nYet its organ stirs—\nSuch is the perfection of its essence.\nIt cries all day without hoarseness—\nSuch is the perfection of its harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ill-omened;\nTo let the mind direct the qi is called forceful.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nThis is called not-Dao.\nNot-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Mystery’s Virtue**\nThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nBlunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nSoften the glare, merge with the dust—\nThis is called the mysterious sameness.\n\nThus, it cannot be made close,\nNor can it be made distant;\nIt cannot be benefited,\nNor can it be harmed;\nIt cannot be valued,\nNor can it be demeaned.\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter 57: The Unadorned Wind**\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nUse the military with cunning,\nTake the world with non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nThe more prohibitions in the world,\nThe poorer the people.\nThe more sharp weapons the people have,\nThe more troubled the state.\nThe more skill and craft,\nThe more strange things arise.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nThe more thieves and bandits there are.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, and the people right themselves.\nI do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves.\nI have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.\n\n**Chapter 58: Following Transformation**\nWhen governance is dull,\nThe people are simple.\nWhen governance is exacting,\nThe people are lacking.\n\nDisaster is where fortune leans;\nFortune is where disaster lurks.\nWho knows their ultimate point?\nIs there no norm?\nThe norm reverts to the strange,\nGoodness reverts to the baleful.\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\n\nThus, the sage is square but not cutting,\nSharp but not piercing,\nStraight but not overbearing,\nBright but not dazzling.\n\n**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**\nIn governing people and serving Heaven,\nNothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly through frugality can one return early.\nTo return early is called accumulating virtue abundantly.\nAccumulating virtue abundantly—\nThere is nothing one cannot overcome.\nWhen there is nothing one cannot overcome,\nNo one knows one’s limit.\nWhen no one knows one’s limit,\nOne can possess the state.\nPossessing the mother of the state,\nOne can endure long.\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundation,\nThe Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Occupying the Position**\nGoverning a great state\nIs like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the Dao is applied to the world,\nIts ghosts lose their spiritual power.\nNot that its ghosts lose their spiritual power,\nBut their power no longer harms the people.\nNot only do the ghosts’ powers not harm the people,\nThe sage also does not harm the people.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nVirtue converges in them.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Virtue of Humility**\nA great state is the lower reaches,\nThe confluence of the world.\nThe world’s confluence is the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness,\nUsing stillness as the lower.\n\nThus, if a great state lowers itself to a small state,\nIt will win over the small state.\nIf a small state lowers itself to a great state,\nIt will win over the great state.\nThus, some lower themselves to win,\nSome lower themselves and win.\nA great state desires only to unite and nurture people;\nA small state desires only to join and serve others.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nSo the great should lower themselves.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao**\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things,\nThe treasure of the good,\nThe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can be traded,\nNoble conduct can be offered to others.\nWhy abandon those who are not good?\n\nTherefore, when the Son of Heaven is established,\nThe Three Ministers are appointed,\nThough one may present jade disks followed by teams of horses,\nIt is not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao valued of old?\nDid they not say:\nSeek and you will obtain,\nHave sins and you will be spared?\nTherefore, it is honored by the world.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Grace**\nPractice non-action,\nAttend to non-affairs,\nTaste the tasteless.\nWhether great or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\n\nPlan for difficulty when it is easy;\nAct on the great when it is minute.\nThe world’s difficult affairs\nMust begin with what is easy.\nThe world’s great affairs\nMust begin with what is minute.\nThus, the sage never strives for the great,\nAnd so accomplishes the great.\n\nOne who makes promises lightly must lack trust;\nOne who takes things lightly must encounter many difficulties.\nThus, the sage treats things as difficult,\nAnd so never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64: Guarding the Minute**\nWhat is at rest is easy to hold;\nWhat has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for.\nWhat is brittle is easy to break;\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before it exists;\nGovern before it is in disorder.\n\nA tree as wide as a man’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny shoot.",
