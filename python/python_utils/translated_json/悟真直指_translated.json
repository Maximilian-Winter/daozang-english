  "full_translation": "*The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*\n*A Preface to the Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*\n\nThe Dao of cultivating reality is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and attaining destiny. Thus, to fulfill one’s nature, one must first exhaust the principle of that nature; to attain one’s destiny, one must first exhaust the principle of that destiny. Only by clarifying its principle can one gain true knowledge and firm insight, avoiding delusion by the false, thereby fulfilling one’s nature and attaining one’s destiny. Otherwise, without exhausting its principle, right and wrong remain indistinguishable, the deviant and the upright unseparated. One enters side paths and crooked trails, clinging to emptiness or fixating on forms—this is not the cultivation of reality but the pursuit of the false. Such pursuit of the false distances one daily from the Dao, merely misleading one’s nature and destiny. How then can one cultivate and preserve them?\n\nThis is why the Immortal Elder Ziyang composed the *Awakening to Reality*. Its verses delve into the profound and subtle, drawing from afar and near, comparing and illustrating in myriad ways. Its original intent was for all to awaken to reality and each to cultivate the Dao. Yet alas, later generations of deluded fools, failing to receive the true transmission, cling to forms and adhere to words, making wild guesses and private conjectures. Some regard it as inner alchemy, others as external refinement; some suspect it of emptiness and stillness, others fall into fixation on forms—greatly betraying the compassionate intent of the Immortal Elder to deliver the world.\n\nAmong the annotations of earlier awakened ones, there are indeed fine interpretations. Fine though they may be, they remain explanations of symbols by symbols, comparisons by comparisons, concealing the head while revealing the tail, hiding the mother while speaking of the child. They dare not plainly reveal the truth, leaving learners bewildered and unable to awaken. These are not *awakenings* to *Awakening to Reality* but mere *retellings* of it.\n\nAlas! The more annotations there are, the more obscure the principle becomes; the more books proliferate, the more people are confused. The true Dao declines daily, while deviant paths flourish; genuine learning is buried, while false teachings arise—strange and ever stranger. No wonder Confucians regard Daoism as heterodoxy!\n\nI myself, having inhaled the fragrant breeze from the incense burner of the hermitage, recognize this book as the treasury of the principles of Dao cultivation and the celestial ladder to attaining reality. Its roots in nature and destiny, its fire phases and sequences—none are lacking. Yet for too long, it has been obscured by deviant interpretations, like the sun veiled by dark clouds, its radiance unmanifest.\n\nAs a humble student fortunate enough to draw near the gate, I cannot bear to withhold this true treasure from fellow seekers. Thus, I name this work *The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*. I do not presume to claim I have grasped the truth but merely offer it to rescue the true.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, the cyclical year *jiwei*, by the Plain-and-Simple Man of Dwelling Cloud Mountain, Awakened Primordial One, Liu Yiming, in his *Abode of Ease*.\n\n*Original Preface to the Awakening to Reality*\nAlas!\n\nThe human body is hard to obtain, yet the passage of time is swift; who can fathom its span or escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken early to this truth but merely resigns to awaiting the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads may plunge one into the three evil destinies—then, drifting through kalpas of dust, there shall be no end to suffering. At such a time, though one may repent, what use is it?\n\nThus, the elders of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means through the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate and refine themselves to escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, one transcends directly to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one ascends immediately to sagehood. But if one fails to illuminate the original nature, one remains bound to the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains words on exhausting principle, fulfilling *xing*, and attaining *ming*; the *Analects* speaks of \"no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no self-absorption\"—this, too, is Confucius’ profound attainment of the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words often brief and not expounded in detail? It is because he sought to order human relations and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music—all active virtues. Thus, he did not explicitly speak of the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of *ming* within the images of the *Changes* and blended the methods of *xing* into subtle words.\n\nAs for *Zhuangzi*, who explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi*, both approached the subtleties. Later, Wei Boyang of the Han dynasty drew upon the *Changes*’ principle of the union of yin and yang to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of Loyalty prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the origin and end of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?\n\nAlas! In later generations, the followers of the Yellow and the Black robes each clung to their own traditions, mutually rejecting one another, causing the essential purport of the three teachings to be lost amid deviant paths, unable to merge and return to unity.\n\nMoreover, people today believe that the Daoist gate emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two paths: one easy to encounter but difficult to accomplish, the other difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the five sprouts, ingesting the light of the seven luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and commanding talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, preserving spirit and holding breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, and practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining metals, minerals, herbs, and trees—all belong to the category of the easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish.\n\nIf one diligently applies effort to the above methods, though they may fragmentarily benefit the cultivation of the body, the results remain unverifiable despite great exertion. At best, they may help avoid illness and avert misfortune. Yet once discontinued, the previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such practices merely prolong the years without ensuring success. How, then, can one hope for a single attainment to become permanent, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and ascend in flight? Is this not exceedingly difficult? Truly, it is a cause for deep sorrow!\n\nMost modern practitioners cling blindly to misconceptions, failing to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that all who attain the Dao do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of heavenly secrets, they instead attribute their success to various other practices. Among these, only the method of holding the breath—if one can forget scheming and still the mind—resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If practiced diligently, it may lead to entering samadhi and projecting spirit. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must constantly employ methods of transference. Without mastering the Dao of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones and exchange yang, ascending to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three *xing* in the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible boils, and the golden furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this occurs in but a moment’s effort, yet secures boundless ease and joy forever.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and contemplating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing correctness and maintaining fullness, one must hold to the feminine and embrace the One. Naturally, the *qi* of returning yang will arise, and the form of slaying yin will be shed. Once the nodal *qi* is complete, one sheds the womb and transforms spirit, is inscribed in the registers of immortals, and titled as a Perfected One—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, point to the viscera as the five phases, divide heart and kidney into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lung as dragon and tiger, use spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and cling to fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they know the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang’s mutual employment? All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returning Elixir? Is this not exceedingly difficult?\n\nFrom youth, I have been fond of the Dao, delving into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, and extending my studies to law, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and fate—nothing has escaped my careful inquiry. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, white metal and black tin, the *li* male and *kan* female, capable of forming the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Yet none reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor expound on the methods of fire phases, the standards of cultivation, or the aims of nurturance.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded followers, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad errors. Not only do they disorder the immortal classics, but they also mislead and confuse later learners.\n\nI, having yet to meet a perfected one and seldom encountered oral instructions, grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withered and waned. Though I sought far and wide across land and sea, consulting the wise and foolish alike, none could fathom the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* era, I followed Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu. Unwavering in my long-held resolve and ever more reverent in my sincerity, I at last moved a true person to impart the secrets of the Golden Elixir—its ingredients, medicines, and fire phases. His words were spare, his essentials uncluttered, such that pointing to the stream revealed the source, one phrase awakened a hundred insights, mist dispersed to reveal the sun’s brilliance, dust settled to mirror perfect clarity. Compared with the immortal classics, they matched as tally and seal.\n\nI reflected that of those who study immortality, eight or nine in ten pursue it, yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essentials. Having encountered this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it in silence? I poured forth all I had received, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them: sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the number of two eights; sixty-four jueju verses aligned with the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*; one pentasyllabic poem to symbolize the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics to correspond to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully set forth the hierarchy of vessels, the weights of medicines, the advance and retreat of fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of life and death, and the auspices of fortune, regret, and remorse.\n\nYet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and solidifying form, leaving the original awakening of true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that ancestral masters had attained enlightenment upon hearing the strike of bamboo. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I now append to the end of the volume. May this suffice to convey the Way of realizing the root and illuminating nature.\n\nMy hope is that like-minded readers, upon perusing these, may perceive the branch and awaken to the root, abandoning delusion to follow truth.\n\nWritten on New Year’s Day of the *Yimao* year of the *Xining* era of the Great Song, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai.\n\n**Postscript to *Awakening to Reality***\n\nI observe that human birth arises from deluded passions, which give rise to this body. With this body comes suffering; without it, whence would suffering arise? To escape suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao; to embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind. Thus, the mind is the substance of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe nature, the luminous and perfect substance will manifest of itself, and the effortless function will spontaneously arise. Without need for contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. How could this occur unless the mind-mirror shines resplendently and the spirit-pearl radiates clarity, such that all phenomena instantly dissolve, not a speck of dust adheres, the mind-source remains free, and birth-and-death is decisively overcome?\n\nYet for those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao, the body cannot burden their nature, nor can circumstances disturb their truth. How then could blades and weapons harm them, tigers and rhinoceroses endanger them, or great fires and floods cause them concern? The enlightened one’s mind, like a mirror, reflects without grasping; responding to circumstances, they harmonize without leading. Thus, they master things without being harmed—this is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth.\n\nOriginally, the Dao had no name; the sages forcibly named it. The Dao had no words; the sages forcibly spoke of it. Yet if names and words were silenced, later generations would have no means to recognize its substance and return to its truth. Therefore, the sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao is made manifest through words, while words, through the Dao, return to oblivion.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature, cling to their bodies, loathing death and delighting in life, and thus rarely attain awakening. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life, following their desires to guide them gradually. Since the essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Daodejing* and *Yinfu Jing* flourished in the world—because people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound. Though scholars recite their texts, none comprehend their meaning. Without encountering a perfected one to transmit oral instructions, even if one were to speculate a hundred ways, one could never achieve its work or accomplish its task. Is this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns?\n\nIn the *Jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu and received the method of the Elixir. Thereafter, I transmitted it thrice to unworthy recipients and thrice suffered calamities, each lasting no more than twenty days. Recently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition: *\"If one day someone comes to loosen your bonds and shackles, you may transmit it to them; otherwise, you must not.\"* Later, wishing to dissolve my name from the registers, yet fearing that people would not believe in this Way, I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, setting forth the origins and ends of the Elixir method.\n\nOnce published, seekers flocked to me in droves. Seeing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse, and so I selected some to instruct. Yet those I instructed were none of great power or strength, capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning—none were magnanimous, outstanding, benevolent, or enlightened. Initially, I suffered calamities twice and remained ignorant of my errors; it was only at the third that I reflected on my past transgressions.\n\nThus, I know the Great Elixir’s method is most simple and easy. Even the dullest and most foolish, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to sagehood. Therefore, Heaven cherishes and guards it, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, Boduan, disregarded my teacher’s words and repeatedly divulged Heaven’s secrets. Because of this body, I have repeatedly incurred Heaven’s reproof and suffering—so swift and divine is Heaven’s admonition. How dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself?\n\nFrom this day forward, I shall seal my lips and still my tongue. Though cauldrons and blades were placed before me, though swords were laid upon my neck, I would never again dare speak of it.\n\nHerein, *The Waking to Reality*’s verses sing in full of the Great Elixir, the subtle essences of medicinal substances, and the firing times—nothing is left unaddressed. Should an earnest seeker, one who bears the bone of immortality from past lives, peruse these lines, their wisdom and discernment will naturally awaken, allowing them to trace the text and grasp its meaning. What need have they for Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In this, it is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous transmission.\n\nAs for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse on the matter of seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrous, awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its foremost task; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately arise. Alas, ordinary beings, bound by karma of varying depth and endowed with faculties sharp or dull, even upon hearing a single note, scatter into divergent views. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are but the One Vehicle, yet listeners, according to their capacity, comprehend it differently, naturally forming the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nHereafter, should a person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and may awaken to the myriad dharmas through a single word. If, however, residual habitual tendencies remain, they will revert to middling or inferior views—this is no fault of Boduan’s.\n\nWritten on the day *wuyin* of the mid-summer month in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign, the year *wuwu*, by Zhang Bairui, styled Pingshu.\n\n*Direct Pointers of Waking to Reality*, Scroll One\nSixteen heptasyllabic regulated verses to represent the number of the two eights.\nThe two eights make sixteen. As the moon’s first quarter holds eight ounces of metal within water, and the last quarter holds eight ounces of water within metal, the two eights combine to form one catty. When metal and water are evenly harmonized, their radiance is neither biased nor partial, perfectly centered and upright—this is the image the Elixir method draws from the two quarters. For those who cultivate the Great Dao, the yang within yin is true yang, corresponding to the first quarter; the yin within yang is true yin, corresponding to the last quarter. When yang within yin harmonizes with yin, and yin within yang harmonizes with yang, true yin and true yang unite as one—this is called the two eights making one catty, the image of the Golden Elixir’s formation. The sixteen verses represent the two eights, signifying precisely this.\n\n**I.**\n\n**II.**\nWho seeks not the Great Dao strays lost upon the path—\nthough gifted with talent, how can one be called a true man?\nA hundred years of light flash like sparks from flint,\na lifetime’s fate drifts like bubbles on water.\nOnly chasing profit and rank, craving glory and fame,\nunaware the body withers, the face sallow and dry.\nTry asking: though gold be piled high as Mount Tai,\ncan impermanence be bought off, made never to come?\n\nThis world is but a realm of sound and form, a land of fame and gain,\nwhere suffering is called joy, falsehood taken for truth,\nwhere essence is drained, qi exhausted, life and nature worn away—\nall ends in death.\nThose who awaken and transcend are the Perfected;\nthose who remain ignorant, trapped within, are the deluded.\n\nThus the immortals and realized ones of old:\nfrom youth, they were filial and kind within the family, fulfilling human bonds;\nby forty, they practiced the Way of unmoving mind, preserving life and nature.\nA hundred years of borrowed time pass in an instant,\na lifetime’s glory and shame turn in the blink of an eye.\nIf one does not return to the root, restore the origin, revert to the mandate,\nwhen the great limit arrives, though gold be heaped like mountains,\none departs empty-handed.\n\nThe Immortal Elder said:\n*“Try asking: though gold be piled high as Mount Tai,\ncan impermanence be bought off, made never to come?”*\nTruly, these are the golden bell and dharma drum,\nawakening all beneath the sky.\n\n**III.**\nThough man’s span may reach a hundred years,\nshort or long, poverty or ease—none can foresee.\nYesterday he rode through the streets on horseback,\ntoday he lies still within the coffin’s planks.\nWife and wealth, cast aside, were never truly his;\nkarmic deeds follow—who can deceive the self?\nIf the Great Elixir is not sought, how can it be met?\nTo know it yet not refine it is sheer folly.\n\nThe world’s people vie for fame and gain, ceaseless day and night,\ndeluding themselves that life has no end, that ease may last forever.\nHow could they know that heaven’s span, long or short,\nfortune or misfortune, gain or loss—none can be foretold?\nDo not assume rare are those who live a hundred years;\neven if one reaches a century, in the end, none escape the wild burial ground.\nOften one sees men here one moment, gone the next,\nsuddenly struck dead mid-stride, mid-laughter—countless such cases.\nAlas!\nWhile eyes are open, wealth and wife seem mine, clung to without cease.\nWhen eyes close, all things vanish, nothing carried away—\nonly a full load of karmic transgressions, borne back alone.\n\nHow much better to see through worldly affairs early,\nhurry to seek a wise teacher, and pursue the Great Elixir!\nIf conditions align and the Elixir is met,\nthis is great fortune, a profound foundation.\nPressing forward with fierce effort to refine it,\none may step from death into life, transcending impermanence.\nBut if, having met it, one refuses to devote the heart to refinement,\nthis is self-abandonment, the height of folly—\nno different from those who never saw through worldly affairs,\nbound to perish in the end. What value then in mere knowledge?\n\n**IV.**\nTo learn immortality, learn the immortality of heaven—\nonly the Golden Elixir is most true and sure.\nWhen the two things meet, nature and feeling unite;\nwhere the five phases are complete, dragon and tiger coil.\nOriginally, *wu* and *ji* served as matchmakers,\nthus husband and wife dwell in constant joy.\nAwaiting only the work’s completion, to ascend the northern palace,\nriding the simurgh amidst ninefold radiance.\n\nThe two preceding poems teach one to see through worldly affairs,\nto urgently seek the Great Elixir and escape birth and death.\nThe Way to escape birth and death is the Way of learning immortality.\nYet immortals have many ranks:\nthose who complete nature and project a yin spirit are ghost immortals;\nthose who complete life and preserve form in the world are earth immortals;\nthose who complete both nature and life, whose body beyond the body is wondrous,\nwhose form and spirit unite with the Dao—these are heaven immortals.\n\nGhost immortals, though their yin spirits move freely,\ndwell in unstable abodes, still subject to casting off and entering bodies.\nEarth immortals, though they preserve form in the world,\nfind their dharma-body hard to liberate, still burdened by illusory form’s decay.\nOne falls into death, the other into birth—\nneither has truly escaped the cycle of birth and death.\nOnly heaven immortals, shedding illusory form to become dharma-body,\ntranscend the bounds of creation, beyond birth and death,\nable to escape the cycle, their lifespan equal to heaven’s, enduring forever.\n\nThose who would escape birth and death must learn heaven immortality.\nTo begin learning heaven immortality, none but the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir will suffice.\n*Jin* is the unyielding, indestructible substance;\n*dan* is the seamless, unimpeded image.\nUnyielding and indestructible, seamless and unimpeded—\na single qi, vast and round as heaven’s unfathomable void,\nencompassing all things, harmed by none.\nThus, after attaining the Dao, one is called a heaven immortal.\nFor their eternal indestructibility, they are also called golden immortals;\nfor their unfathomable concealment and manifestation, they are called spirit immortals.\nYet golden immortals and spirit immortals are all heaven immortals.\nTo cultivate heaven immortality, apart from the Way of the Golden Elixir, no other method exists.\n\nThis Golden Elixir is what one receives from heaven at birth—\nutterly good, without evil, the luminous knowing and innate ability,\nperfect and whole, the numinous root.\nIt is the primordial, supremely yang qi, congealed into form.\nWithin it, yin and yang are contained, the five phases concealed;\nit has qi but no substance, unlike the postnatal, tangible, turbid things of the body.\nWhen refined through the *yin* tally and *yang* fire, tempered to maturity,\nit becomes indestructible—called the Seven-Return, Nine-Cycle Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is another name for the originally complete nature—\nnot some golden elixir existing apart from that nature.\nThis Elixir is possessed by all, complete in each,\nneither increased in sages nor diminished in commoners.\nIt is the seed of immortals and buddhas, the root of sages and worthies.\nYet without the fire of refinement, yang’s extremity must turn to yin,\nperfection’s extremity must wane, falling into the postnatal.\nAs knowledge opens, selfish desires mingle;\nas temperament arises, celestial purity darkens.\nLuminous knowing and innate ability both turn unwholesome,\nno longer retaining the purely untainted body.\nThus the sages of old established the Way of the Golden Elixir’s return,\nenabling all to return home and recognize their ancestors,\nrecovering what was originally their own.\n\nHow then is this called \"return\"? \"Return\" speaks of what has gone and yet comes back; \"restore\" means what was lost and yet is regained. That the numinous root of original nature becomes obscured is all due to the disharmony of yin and yang, the mutual injury of the Five Phases. Should yin and yang truly unite as one, the Five Phases gather and cluster, and it remains the same unbroken, perfectly complete thing as of old.\n\nThese two things—one firm, one yielding; one strong, one compliant; one true knowing, one numinous knowing; one true feeling, one numinous nature—abide thus: true knowing resides in the mind of Dao, governing firmness and strength, issuing forth as true feeling; numinous knowing lies hidden in the human mind, governing compliance and softness, containing within it numinous nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing separate, strength is no longer rightly strong, compliance no longer rightly compliant; firmness and softness lose their measure, and true feeling and numinous nature transform into false feeling and false nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing unite, strength is as it ought to be strong, compliance as it ought to be compliant; firmness and softness follow the moment. False feeling and false nature transform back into true feeling and numinous nature.\n\nThe Immortal Elder said: \"When the two things meet, feeling and nature unite—how could this not be perfectly clear?\"\n\nThe Five Phases are the five qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In the prenatal state, these five qi are the Five Primes: original nature, original feeling, original essence, original spirit, and original qi. In the postnatal state, they become the five entities: wandering soul, ghostly po, yin essence, conscious spirit, and deluded intent. The Five Primes possess the Five Virtues: humaneness, rightness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The five entities possess the Five Dispositions: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire.\n\nWhen the Five Phases are complete, prenatal and postnatal merge and gather, the Five Primes governing the five entities. The Dragon is yang, master of the impulse of life, belonging to Wood of the Eastern Direction, corresponding in humans to nature. The Tiger is yin, master of the impulse of destruction, belonging to Metal of the Western Direction, corresponding in humans to feeling. When the Five Phases are disharmonious, each strays from its nature: the Five Primes transform into the five entities, the Five Virtues into the Five Thieves. Dragon in the East, Tiger in the West—nature in chaos, feeling deluded—become false nature and deluded feeling, destructive qi eclipsing life qi. When the Five Phases are complete, all return to one nature: the five entities transform back into the Five Primes, the Five Thieves into the Five Virtues. Dragon coiled, Tiger crouched—nature settled, feeling forgotten—become true feeling and true nature, and even destructive qi becomes life qi.\n\nThe Way of Elixir refinement is nothing more than harmonizing firmness and softness, ensuring strength and compliance are in balance, nature and feeling united. When nature and feeling unite, yin and yang meet, the Five Phases are complete, and it is once more the undifferentiated principle of Heaven, supremely good without evil, luminous knowing and innate ability—original things restored—and the Golden Elixir returns.\n\nYet after the original prenatal state scatters, nature drifts east, feeling west; firmness and softness no longer respond. Without a harmonizing agent to convey messages back and forth, they remain cut off, forever unaware of each other. This harmonizing agent is the two earths of wu and ji. Wu earth governs movement and belongs to yang; ji earth governs stillness and belongs to yin. That which is utterly still is ji earth; that which responds upon sensing is wu earth. The two earths of wu and ji correspond in the Five Virtues to true trust. True trust abides within, and nature is settled; true settledness is applied without, and feeling is harmonized. When nature is settled and feeling harmonized, nature and feeling return to their root, like husband and wife in joyful union. Humaneness, rightness, propriety, and wisdom return to one trust; nature, feeling, spirit, and essence converge in one qi. The Three Families meet, the five qi pay homage to the origin, returning to the root and restoring the origin—the Golden Elixir congeals, also called the Sacred Embryo. With further effort directed upward, one moves from effortful practice to effortless attainment.\n\nFor ten months, the embryo is nurtured, firmly sealed and secured. Excess in strong feeling is drawn out, deficiency in compliant nature is replenished. Using the natural true fire, one practices \"morning Layering, evening Delving,\" refining away postnatal yin qi. From formlessness, form arises; from the subtle, the manifest. Qi becomes full, spirit complete—with a thunderous crack, the golden cicada sheds its husk, a body appears beyond the body. The work is accomplished, the name achieved. One ascends the Northern Palace, riding a soaring simurgh, ascending in broad daylight to become a pure yang, deathless Celestial Immortal—how joyous indeed!\n\nAlas! The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir;\nthe Four Great serve as the furnace, refining it into a single mass.\nThose who awaken ascend at once to sagehood;\nthose who remain deluded sink into endless kalpas.\nMen of aspiration—can you not exert yourselves?\n\nThis method is true within the true, wondrous beyond the wondrous—\nall because I alone differ from others.\nI know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*;\nwho recognizes the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\n\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,\nthe jade pool first descends silver into water.\nDivine work moves fire not through the whole day—\nsuddenly, a single wheel of sun appears in the deep pool.\n\nThe above poem speaks of refining the Golden Elixir:\none must harmonize nature and emotion, complete the Five Phases,\nonly then can success be achieved.\nYet while the medicinal substances are easy to know,\nthe firing times are most difficult.\nThe firing times are the method and process of refinement.\n\nMaster Lü said:\n\"Those of superior virtue preserve their form through the Dao—\nthis is their unbroken pure yang.\nThose of inferior virtue extend their lives through techniques—\nthis is due to *kan* and *li* already formed.\"\nFor those of inferior virtue, one must rely on methods to pursue and gather.\nMethod is technique.\nWithout method or technique, one cannot return to the root and restore nothingness;\nthe foundation of life remains unstable, and the great Dao is hard to achieve.\nThus the immortal elder said:\n\"This method is true within the true, wondrous beyond the wondrous—\nall because I alone differ from others.\"\nWhen a method is called true and wondrous,\nit is the most true and most wondrous of methods.\nWhen a method reaches truth,\nit can steal yin and yang, seize creation,\nreverse life and death, invert the mechanisms of qi.\nWhen a method reaches wondrousness,\nneither spirits nor divination can fathom it;\nit precedes heaven yet heaven does not oppose it,\nfollows heaven yet accords with the celestial timing—\nthis is the way of sages and worthies,\nnot something any minor side-method can glimpse.\n\nThe wonder of the true method of refinement—\nwhere does its wonder lie?\nIts wonder lies in inversion.\nInversion means overturning yin and yang,\nreversing the workings of creation.\n*Li* is fire, outwardly masculine yet inwardly feminine.\nIts inner femininity is true yin;\nin humans, it is the numinous awareness hidden in the human heart.\nWhen the human heart stirs, numinous awareness flees—\nlike fire flaring upward.\n*Kan* is water, outwardly dark yet inwardly bright.\nIts inner brightness is true yang;\nin humans, it is true knowing, possessed by the heart of Dao.\nWhen the heart of Dao is obscured, true knowing hides—\nlike water flowing downward.\n\nTo use inversion is to give rise to the heart of Dao\nand stabilize the human heart.\nWhen the heart of Dao arises, true knowing becomes firm and strong,\nand the water of essence and oneness ascends.\nWhen the human heart is stabilized, numinous awareness becomes gentle and compliant,\nand the scorching fire of excess descends.\nWater above, fire below—\nthus water and fire aid each other.\n\nNuminous awareness is nature, nature belongs to wood;\nwood’s nature is soft and easily floats.\nTrue knowing is emotion, emotion belongs to metal;\nmetal’s emotion is hard and easily sinks.\nWhen numinous awareness floats and acts as host,\nthe true contains the false.\nWhen true knowing sinks and remains unmanifest as guest,\nthe false entraps the true—\nthis is the ordinary course.\n\nTo fix host and guest:\ntake the emotion of true knowing as host,\nmaking what sinks below float upward;\ntake the nature of numinous awareness as guest,\nmaking what floats above sink downward.\nHost and guest reverse—\nthus metal and wood unite.\n\nWhen water and fire merge, metal and wood join,\nthe heart of Dao is strong, the human heart compliant,\ntrue knowing and numinous awareness unite as one,\nnature and emotion harmonize—\nhow could the Golden Elixir not coalesce?\n\nYet such true and wondrous techniques,\nneither form nor emptiness,\nlie where others do not know—\nonly the self knows,\nhence \"I know\" and \"who recognizes.\"\nWhen others do not recognize yet the self knows,\nthis is the mechanism of theft.\nNone in the world can see or know it.\n\nThis Dao has sequence, urgency, and pacing.\nIf one does not grasp the wondrous use of sequence, urgency, and pacing,\neven if one recognizes the medicinal substances,\ninversion is hard to apply, host and guest remain unfixed.\nThus it immediately follows:\n\"The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,\nthe jade pool first descends silver into water.\"\n\nGold is a firm and hard substance;\njade is a gentle and soft substance.\nThe crucible is the vessel for refining medicine;\nthe pool is the vessel for nurturing fire.\nGolden crucible and jade pool—\nthey illustrate the Dao of self-cultivation,\nembodying hardness and softness.\n\nThe human heart belongs to *li*,\n*li* is originally the body of *qian*—\nthis is the golden crucible.\nIt possesses the fire of earth’s second hexagram as numinous awareness,\nthe inherently gentle and compliant center of *kun*—\nthis is the original good capacity.\nThe human heart is originally empty and open,\nnuminously aware and unobscured.\nYet after engaging with postnatal consciousness,\nit borrows awareness to generate delusion,\nsees phenomena and stirs dust,\nriding the wind and stirring waves without cease—\nlike mercury within cinnabar, which flies when heated,\nmost difficult to retain.\nAs the *Cantong qi* says:\n\"The flowing pearl of great yang constantly seeks to leave the person.\"\n\nThe heart of Dao belongs to *kan*,\n*kan* is originally the body of *kun*—\nthis is the jade pool.\nWithin it hides the water of heaven’s one as true knowing,\nthe inherently firm, strong, and upright center of *kan*—\nthis is the original good knowing.\nAfter falling into the postnatal,\nguest qi takes control, true qi retreats,\nyang trapped within yin, the true obscured by the false,\nsinking into the sea of desire,\ngood knowing dimmed—\nlike silver in water, nearly nonexistent.\n\nSilver is of the same kind as gold;\nsilver in water is the gold hidden within water.\nThis gold in the prenatal is the good knowing of original nature;\nin the postnatal, it is the true knowing of the heart of Dao.\nBecause this true knowing is utterly firm and strong,\nit is likened to true lead.\nBecause this true knowing enables transcendence and the Dao,\nit is also likened to the true seed.\nSince ancient times, sages and worthies\nhave all gathered this single great medicine to complete nature and life.\n\nThe numinous awareness of the human heart,\nthough easily stirred,\nif restrained by the true knowing of the heart of Dao,\nreturns to the true and does not flee—\nas the *Cantong qi* says:\n\"Suddenly obtaining golden radiance, it turns and interacts.\"\nThe *Huanghe fu* states:\n\"Within *li* are seven kinds of cinnabar—\nwithout the true seed, it is difficult to retain even for a moment.\"\n\nThe seven kinds of cinnabar are tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and humors. The instability of these seven kinds of cinnabar all stems from the instability of the numinous awareness of the human heart. Yet the instability of the human heart’s numinosity arises from the loss of the heart of Dao, which fails to stabilize it. If one wishes to retain the numinous awareness of the human heart, one must first apply this true knowing of the heart of Dao. Once the true knowing and true seed are established, there is an inner sovereign that is not deluded by杂 qi, and the numinous awareness of the human heart naturally congeals without scattering. Borrowing the heart of Dao to restrain the human heart, aligning the human heart with the heart of Dao, using true knowing to govern numinous knowing, and employing numinous knowing to nurture true knowing—hard and soft correspond, strength and compliance unite, nature and emotions harmonize. Within half a *shi* (an hour), they coalesce into a single luminous and radiant pearl. Its numinous light shines brightly, and no yin or malevolent qi can harm it. Thus it is said: *\"The divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor; a single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\"*\n\nThe \"divine work\" refers to the subtle operation of numinous clarity and the practice of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude). \"Fire\" refers to the harmonious qi of true knowing and numinous knowing united in hardness and softness. \"Firing\" means being cautious where nothing is seen and fearful where nothing is heard—applying this true knowing and numinous knowing, uniting hardness and softness, ensuring not a trace of impurity lingers within the heart. This divine fire of the work is like casting a shadow with a pole or echoing a voice in a valley. If one resolutely applies it, without waiting a full day, one can reverse yin to return to yang, like the sun over a deep pool, where yin qi naturally retreats.\n\nThe most crucial part of the verse lies in the four characters \"欲留\" (*desiring to retain*) and \"先下\" (*first applying*). Within them lies the principle of \"striking first to control others,\" where righteousness does not yield to guests. Grasping this principle, the inversion of yin and yang, the harmonization of the four images, becomes as easy as turning one’s palm. This is the symbolic method of *waidan* (external alchemy).\n\n*Waidan* is another name for *huandan* (returning elixir), for it has departed and then returns, has been lost and is regained, moving from without to within—hence it is called *waidan* or *huandan*. Once returned, it becomes *neidan* (internal elixir); this is the distinction between internal and external.\n\n---\n\nThe fifth verse:\n*\"Tigers leap and dragons soar—waves and winds rage rough;\nAt the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born.\nThough fruit on the branch will ripen in time,\nHow can the child in the womb be different?\"*\n\n*\"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms;\nMorning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—\nWhy seek deep mountains to guard solitary stillness?\"*\n\nThis poem speaks of the matter of the returning elixir, while the previous verse speaks of the Dao of the great elixir. The Dao of the great elixir is the work of a single moment. In this moment, one’s virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, one’s clarity merges with the sun and moon, one’s order merges with the four seasons, and one’s fortune merges with spirits and gods. It is difficult to encounter yet easy to err; the slightest carelessness, and the primordial true unity of qi is gained and then lost. This primordial true unity of qi is the returning elixir. Because the returning elixir is formed from the union of hard and soft qi, it is called the true unity of qi—there is no true unity of qi beyond the returning elixir.\n\nWhen the returning elixir is attained, the heart of Dao is firm and strong, the human heart is soft and compliant, true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, round and luminous—returning to the state at the beginning of life, where good knowing and good ability are quiescent and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated, the original face of things. This thing, due to its firm nature, is called true lead; due to its robust qi, it is also called the male tiger. True lead and the male tiger are both the vast and upright qi, utterly good without evil, the innate celestial truth of good knowing and good ability.\n\nHaving regained this celestial truth, one must return it to the state before parents were born, where the five phases do not reach, to forge an enduring and indestructible celestial truth. Thus, when celestial truth is restored, one must warm and nurture it, seal and store it securely, emptying to the utmost and stilling profoundly. When yang qi is abundant and stillness reaches its peak, movement arises, and the numinous sprout appears—the time when, as Ancestor Lü said, *\"The midnight hour lingers, the lead cauldron warms, and light pierces the curtains.\"*\n\nAt this moment, the yang light emerges from its cave like a tiger, vigorous and unstoppable. One must swiftly use the spark of empty numinous fire from true nature to meet it. This empty numinous fire is called the female dragon. *\"Tigers leap and dragons soar\"* symbolizes the struggle of yin and yang. *\"Waves and winds rage rough\"* signifies the wind rising as the tiger leaves its cave and the waves surging as the dragon leaves the pool—the contention of yin and yang. When dragon and tiger unite, nature and emotions harmonize, merging into one and entering the center. The primordial qi comes from emptiness, congealing into a single millet-like pearl—the sacred embryo takes form.\n\nThe sacred embryo is the valley spirit; the valley spirit is the numinous union of *xuan* and *pin*. Yang *xuan* is the tiger’s emotion; yin *pin* is the dragon’s nature. When nature and emotion unite, the sacred embryo forms; when the primordial *pin* is established, the valley spirit is born. At this stage, the work of action is complete, and the work of non-action manifests—no further effort is needed; one lets it be. Like fruit on the branch, it will ripen in time; like the child in the womb, it will be born in due course.\n\nYet even as the sacred embryo congeals, one must still guard against danger and risk—this cannot be ignored. *\"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms\"* means the south is fire, the north is water; when the sacred embryo congeals, harmonious qi steams and permeates, water and fire return to their source, naturally refining each other. One practices the work of neither forgetting nor forcing. *\"Morning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot\"* means morning is the beginning of the day, when yang qi governs; evening is the beginning of the night, when yin qi governs.\n\nThe celestial pivot is the dynamic of yin and yang qi—when yang is due, one employs yang; when yin is due, one employs yin. The firing process advances and retreats, subtly aligning with the mechanisms of morning and evening, the ceaseless vigilance of day and night. Neither forgetting nor forcing, this day-and-night vigilance, this gentle nurturing over ten months, transforms the postnatal trigrams and sheds the prenatal dharmakāya. My life is governed by me, not by Heaven.\n\nThis Dao is cultivated among humanity and practiced amid the dust of the marketplace. Its great function and true application lie in concrete effort, not in empty, effortless extinction. Thus it is said: *One must know the great hermit dwells in the city’s bustle—why seek solitude in deep mountains?*\n\n**Sixth Stanza**\nEvery person possesses the elixir of immortality,\nYet deluded seekers heedlessly cast it aside.\nWhen sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite;\nWhere the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li merge.\nThe well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists;\nThe fence-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.\nWhen the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house—\nWhy search for herbs to burn as straw?\n\nThe three preceding poems elucidate the great elixir of returned cinnabar, its ingredients, and firing times in full and clear detail. Yet lest practitioners mistakenly assume the golden elixir is forged by refining common substances, this poem follows closely to correct such errors.\n\nThe golden elixir is none other than the original nature of innate knowing and innate ability, bestowed upon each person. This nature is complete in all, perfectly realized in each—unchanged in sages, undiminished in ordinary beings. It requires no external pursuit, for it is inherently one’s own. With a resolute heart, one ascends directly to the sacred realm; with nature stabilized and life congealed, it endures unbroken. This original nature of innate knowing and ability is the great elixir of immortality.\n\nAll deluded seekers, failing to investigate the true principles of sages and worthies, neglecting the root of nature and life, abandon the near to chase the distant, discard the real to grasp the false. They pass their lives in vain, achieving nothing by old age—heedlessly casting away what is most precious. How lamentable! How tragic!\n\nHuman life is endowed with the vigorous virtue of innate knowing, received from Heaven—this is Heaven itself. It is also endowed with the compliant virtue of innate ability, received from Earth—this is Earth itself. The originally empty, luminous spirit is the numinous nature, transformed from Earth’s qi—this is fire. The originally pure, unadulterated essence is true feeling, transformed from the qi of Heaven’s unity—this is water.\n\nWhen one unites vigor and compliance as one, Heaven and Earth within the body merge, like sweet dew sprinkling the heart, instantly dissolving afflictions. When one preserves spirit and essence without dissipation, Kan and Li within the body unite, like the yellow sprout naturally arising, restoring primordial qi.\n\nSweet dew descends when the heart is clear. The yellow sprout arises when the mind is still. With heart clear and mind still, innate knowing and innate ability, the one numinous true nature, hangs suspended in empty space—serene and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated. Constantly active, constantly tranquil, unshaken by transformation, unbent by the myriad things, *my life is governed by me, not by Heaven.*\n\nThis is the Way of longevity. How could the frog in the well know of this dragon’s cave? How could the sparrow in the fence comprehend this phoenix’s nest?\n\nHearing talk of medicinal substances and firing times, one may suspect these to be the strange and bizarre techniques of burning and refining in the Mao school, with no limit to their eccentricities. Yet they know not that in the great elixir’s cultivation, when the day of ripening arrives, gold and jade fill the hall—life preserved, form perfected, wealth and honor incomparable. How could one cling to the dross of worldly things?\n\n**Its seventh [poem] states:**\n*Know well the source where the medicine is born—*\n*Only in the southwest recognize your homeland.*\n*When lead meets the arising of gui, swiftly gather;*\n*Gold past the full moon is no longer fit to taste.*\n*Send it to the earthen crucible, sealed fast;*\n*Then join with the flowing pearl in proper match.*\n*A pound of medicine requires two times eight;*\n*Adjust the firing time, entrusting to yin and yang.*\n\nThis verse speaks of the elixir of longevity present in every person, yet does not specify where or when the medicine arises. Thus, this poem clarifies the precise origin of its birth, so that practitioners may work in accord with the time and carefully tend the firing.\n\nThe southwest is the direction of *kun*, where the moon’s waning reaches its extreme and revives—where yin at its utmost generates yang. In the human body, this is the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and first stirs. This stirring at stillness’s extreme is when the great medicine appears. Yet this stirring is not the movement of external guest qi or emotional desires, nor the inner stirring of the heart’s thoughts and intentions. It is the stirring of the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing, the stirring of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. This Heavenly Heart and innate knowing, this Dao-Heart and true knowing—because they can transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, raise the dead and restore life—they are symbolized as the medicinal substance. Because at the moment of extreme stillness, when the ten thousand conditions are all stilled, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing reveal a glimmer of light at their inception, they are symbolized as the place where the medicine is born. Because the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing arise from darkness as whiteness, emerge from emptiness, and stir from stillness like a river with its source, they are symbolized as the river-source where the medicine is born.\n\nThis medicine is, in the prior heaven, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing; in the posterior heaven, it is the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. The Dao-Heart is the reflection of the Heavenly Heart; true knowing is the reflection of innate knowing. Because the Heavenly Heart, submerged in the posterior heaven, cannot always abide and only occasionally appears, it has another name: the Dao-Heart. Because innate knowing, sunk in the sea of desire, has its radiance dimmed and only intermittently remains unobscured, it has another name: true knowing. Yet after the return to the origin, the Dao-Heart is still the Heavenly Heart, and true knowing is still innate knowing. When it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, this is the homeland of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. For in the place where it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, a spark of the prior heaven’s true unity and vital impulse resides. By relying on this spark and reversing the course of cultivation, how could one not restore the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing? Yet the restoration is not difficult—what matters is knowing the stirring at stillness’s extreme, the river-source.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\"* The *Book of Changes* states: *\"The Way of return: in seven days it comes back.\"* Both refer to the river-source where the Dao-Heart’s true knowing is born.\n\nOnce the river-source of the medicine’s birth is known, one must understand the moment to begin. The marvelous work of elixir refinement is simply to take the Dao-Heart’s single flavor as the mother of the elixir. Because the Dao-Heart is firm and strong, possessing the sentiment of true knowing, it is symbolized as true lead—lead containing silver, black without and white within. The Dao-Heart contains true knowing, dark without yet bright within, which is why the immortals all compare the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to true lead. They are unwilling to point it out directly, valuing and honoring it, lest it be stolen by the unworthy.\n\nThis Dao-Heart’s true knowing, buried and drowned by emotions and desires, cannot emerge on its own. Yet once the river-source is known, it can be gradually gathered and restored. The method of restoration must still be sought within emotions and desires. True knowing is born of Heaven’s one, a pure and perfectly clear yang water—*ren* water. Emotions and desires are born of Earth’s six, a turbid and utterly impure yin water—*gui* water. *Ren* water is hidden within *gui* water; without *gui* water’s arising, *ren* water does not appear, and true lead is not seen. *\"When lead meets the arising of gui\"* refers precisely to the joining of yin and yang qi, when *gui* has just arisen but has not yet taken effect. *Ren* water has not dispersed, true knowing has not dimmed—swiftly gather it and return it to the suspended womb crucible, and emotions and desires will have no place to act and will naturally vanish. This is what Zhang Sanfeng meant by *\"plucking the fresh blossoms beyond the wall.\"*\n\n*\"Gold past the full moon\"* refers to having obtained the return of true knowing. Relying on this single spark of true knowing’s true sentiment, it is augmented again and again, advancing toward firmness, strength, centrality, and purity—like refining white gold from lead, its color full and bright. At this stage, innate knowing and innate ability shine unobscured, responding to things with flexibility, moving or stilling at will. Walking freely, every step is the Way—like a bright moon hanging in the sky, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, penetrating the hidden and reaching the obscure. One may then abandon the work of augmentation, leave effortful practice, and enter effortlessness.\n\nYet if one does not know the firing time and fails to stop at fullness, the round will inevitably wane, brightness at its extreme will turn to darkness—like the moon past fullness, where yang generates yin. True knowing is harmed, the true dims and the false arises, and what remains is the dross of the posterior heaven—how could it be fit to taste? Thus, when true knowing has returned to fullness, swiftly send it to the central earthen crucible, seal it firmly to prevent the slightest leakage, then match it with the single drop of numinous flowing pearl from one’s original nature. Borrowing yin to aid yang, using emptiness to nourish fullness, one guards against danger and considers risk. The goal is to reach the state where firmness and softness are as one, yin and yang in perfect balance.\n\nWhen the dual eights reach their full count—neither more nor less—advance until the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure, without a trace of qi-quality remaining. Yet to fulfill the dual eights, one must rely entirely on regulating the firing time, discerning maturity from tenderness, knowing when to stop at sufficiency, distinguishing fortune from misfortune, and recognizing urgency from slowness. When the time calls for advancing yang, advance yang; when the time calls for moving yin, move yin. Neither great nor small is harmed, and both states are preserved whole. Naturally, the true unified qi of the prior heaven emerges from emptiness, coalescing without dispersion—thus the sacred embryo takes form.\n\nRegulating the firing time precisely adjusts the ceaseless interplay of firmness and softness. When the medicine weighs one jin, firmness and softness both return to central equilibrium; the dual eights align, yin contains yang, yang contains yin, yin and yang merge as one, firmness and softness wholly transform. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating—once responsive and instantly penetrating, still and unmoving, it becomes an indestructible thing forever.\n\nAlas! The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the hour’s arrival at midnight lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The medicine’s nature is inherently difficult to know, and the firing time is likewise not easily understood—how can the seeker not urgently seek a true teacher?\n\nThis poem encompasses the medicine, the firing time, the wondrous workings of the returning elixir and the great elixir, all contained within. It is the most crucial among the sixteen poems. The reader must carefully delve into its depths, not letting a single word slip by. If one truly comprehends even a part, upon meeting a true teacher, a single phrase may reveal the ten thousand methods.\n\n**Poem Eight**\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits,\nSeeking myriad herbs is even less the truth.\nOnly when yin and yang find their kind do they merge,\nAt the balanced two-and-eight they naturally unite.\n\nAt the pond’s depths, the sun crimson—yin’s illusions vanish;\nAt the mountain’s peak, the moon pale—the elixir sprouts anew.\nIf men of this age wish to know true lead and mercury,\nThey are not the common cinnabar or quicksilver.\n\nThis poem speaks of true lead and true mercury, the two medicines conjoined, which alone can accomplish the golden elixir. Yet some may suspect the golden elixir to be a tangible worldly substance, forged through smelting—thus the poem immediately declares: *\"Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking myriad herbs is even less the truth.\"* The Three Yellows are sulfur, realgar, and orpiment; the Four Spirits are cinnabar, mercury, lead, and saltpeter. The Three Yellows, Four Spirits, and all herbs are not of our kind—how could they sustain life? How could they refine nature? Failing to sustain life and refine nature, all is in vain, not the true Way.\n\n*The Three Categories* states: *\"Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike seed, no achievement is made.\"* Humans, endowed with heaven and earth’s yin and yang qi, possess within their bodies the qi and virtue of yin and yang. Yang is firmness; yin is softness. The virtue of firmness governs life; the virtue of softness governs nature. Thus, this firm yang and soft yin are the very source of nature and life. Of like kind: yang takes yin as its kind, and yin takes yang as its kind. When yin and yang find their kind, firmness and softness respond—like husband and wife long parted, meeting suddenly, how could they not merge?\n\nThe two-and-eight: within yin, true yang is firm and upright; within yang, true yin is gentle and balanced. When firmness and softness both return to the center, yin and yang are in perfect balance, neither leaning nor tilting—they naturally unite, intimately bound, merging into a single qi, congealing without dispersion. When yin and yang find their kind, and the two-and-eight are balanced, the postnatal returns to the prenatal: the Dao-heart is firm, the human heart is gentle, true knowing and numinous knowing merge, and the original, single spark of innate knowing and ability emerges from the void of thought.\n\nLike the crimson sun rising from the pond’s depths—yin’s illusions vanish;\nLike the pale moon hanging high on the mountain’s peak—the elixir sprouts fresh.\nFor when the upright qi arises, deviant qi naturally retreats; when the true returns, the false instantly dissolves. The crimson sun at the pond’s depths and the pale moon on the mountain’s peak both depict the manifestation of true yang, the return of the celestial heart. With the celestial heart restored, knowing and ability are both refined—this is the golden elixir. This golden elixir is the true yin and true yang originally possessed, conjoined in firmness and softness, the true treasure of fulfilling nature and attaining life—how could it be forged from common cinnabar or quicksilver?\n\n**Poem Nine**\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;\nCultivating but one thing only weakens the body.\n\nExhausting the body with massage and stretching is not the Dao;\nIngesting qi and consuming mist is all madness.\nThe world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury—\nWhen shall true dragon and tiger descend?\n\nI urge you to thoroughly investigate the source of your birth,\nFor returning to the origin and restoring the primordial is the King of Medicines.\n\nThe preceding poem speaks of the golden elixir’s ingredients—\nNot the external three yellows or four spirits, nor common herbs or vulgar things.\nThus, the cultivator must refine within the body itself.\nYet most do not know that after the prenatal true yang is lost,\nAll that remains in the body is the yin essence within yang.\nThis yin essence is not merely the essence of intercourse;\nAll tears, saliva, fluids, blood, and qi are yin essence.\nIts nature is not firm—it exists while the body exists, vanishes when the body perishes,\nRising and falling with the illusory form.\nIf one cultivates only this yin essence within yang, hoping to preserve life and perfect the form,\nIt only weakens the body further, and success remains elusive.\nThose who exhaust their bodies with shadow-stretching, ingest qi, or feast on mist,\nAlong with the myriad schools—\nSome refine yin essence, others supplement it—\nAll stray from the Dao, drifting ever farther.\nHow could they subdue true lead and true mercury, returning to the one qi?\nHow could they tame true dragon and true tiger, uniting them as one?\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir is the thoroughfare of birth;\nThe Way of birth is the union of the two—yin and yang—into one.\nIn this union, the vital mechanism resides.\nThe Way of human birth relies on mortal father and mother to produce the illusory body;\nThe Way of immortal birth relies on the numinous father and sacred mother to complete the true body.\nThe numinous father is the firm and vigorous true knowing;\nThe sacred mother is the yielding and receptive numinous knowing.\nBoth human and immortal birth lie beyond yin and yang—\nThe difference lies only in the sacred and the mundane, the reverse and the forward.\nIf one thoroughly investigates the principle of birth—\nGreat awakening, great enlightenment—\nUnderstanding how parents unite, how they join,\nHow conception occurs, how the fetus is nurtured,\nHow the fetus matures, how birth transpires,\nHow the child is nursed, how it learns to walk, how it grows—\nThen the entire process of cultivation becomes clear and bright.\nOne may proceed directly, returning to the origin and restoring the primordial,\nReviving the dead, preserving life and perfecting the form,\nBecoming the great King of Medicines.\nFor the great Way of true cultivation\nIs nothing but the principle of birth—no other method exists.\nThose who follow all other side paths—\nLone yin, solitary yang, clinging to emptiness or form, cultivating but one thing—\nHow could they know this?\n\n**Poem Ten**\nDiligently seek true lead with intent,\nLest time slip by in vain.\nBut capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury,\nAnd the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal.\nThis may be called: the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nIt may be said: virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.\nOnce you know longevity equals heaven and earth,\nNo vexation shall ever arise in the heart.\n\nThe preceding poem teaches one to thoroughly investigate the source of birth,\nTo return to the origin and restore the primordial.\nYet to do so, one must recognize the one great medicine—true lead.\nRecognizing true lead means all ten thousand affairs are complete;\nAll else becomes easy.\nTrue lead is no other thing—\nIt is the true knowing of the heart-mind’s Dao, as mentioned before.\nTrue knowing is also called the true seed.\nWithout recognizing the true seed, cultivation lacks a root,\nAnd all efforts are in vain.\nThus it says: *Diligently seek true lead with intent*—\nThe phrase *with intent* contains the work of investigating things and attaining knowledge, the effort of exhausting principle.\nIf one wishes to cultivate the great Dao,\nFirst thoroughly investigate real principle.\nOnce real principle is penetrated, the work of cultivation yields immediate results.\nWithout such penetration, vainly hoping for celestial treasures\nIs like grasping at emptiness—wasting time in vain.\n\nEarthly po and watery metal are yang within yin,\nAll images of true knowing.\nCelestial hun and cinnabar mercury are yin within yang,\nAll images of numinous knowing.\n*But capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury*—\nThis means using true knowing to restrain numinous knowing.\n*And the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal*—\nThis means using numinous knowing to nurture true knowing.\nTrue knowing is firm, belonging to yang, the husband;\nNuminous knowing is yielding, belonging to yin, the wife.\nWhen the husband restrains the wife, the wife naturally submits;\nWhen the wife submits, the husband also cherishes her.\nHusband and wife in harmony, the vital mechanism endures.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The great yang’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart;\nOnly when it obtains golden radiance does it turn and abide.\"*\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing, two united as one,\nFirmness and softness return to the center.\nTransformed into good knowing and good ability,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive to all things—\nThe sacred embryo takes form.\nAt this stage, the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nVirtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.\nLongevity equals heaven and earth,\nAnd what vexation could ever trouble the heart?\n\n**Poem Eleven**\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find—\nThe discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct.\nThe four images and five phases all depend on earth;\nThe three origins and eight trigrams how could they leave ren?\nRefining the numinous essence, others cannot recognize it;\nDissolving yin demons, ghosts dare not intrude.\nWishing to leave this secret formula among humankind,\nYet not a single soul is a true confidant.\n\nThe preceding poem speaks of the Dao’s loftiness and virtue’s weight,\nWhere dragons, tigers, ghosts, and spirits all submit—\nThus, one with the Dao must not lack virtue,\nAnd one with virtue must not lack the Dao.\nThe supreme Way is not complex;\nThe great medicine is not distant.\nWhite clouds lie near at hand;\nYellow sprouts grow within the household.\nIf one has the will, it may be grasped effortlessly—\nThus it says: *not hard to find*.\nYet this Way transcends the mundane to enter the sacred,\nRevives the dead, and is the rarest thing under heaven.\nThough not hard to find, only those of great virtue and conduct can know it—\nThus it says: *the discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct*.\nIf one is truly a virtuous gentleman or noble man,\nIt will not be hard to find.\n\nThe Four Symbols are the four qi of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, which together with Earth form the Five Phases. The Three Origins are Heaven Origin, Earth Origin, and Human Origin. Alternatively, Upper Origin, Middle Origin, and Lower Origin also constitute the Three Origins. The Eight Trigrams are the yin and yang of the Four Symbols and Five Phases: Qian is yang Metal, Dui is yin Metal; Kan is yang Water, Gen is yin Water; Zhen is yang Wood, Xun is yin Wood; Li is yang Fire, Kun is yin Fire. Though the Eight Trigrams correspond to the yin and yang of the Four Symbols, Kun and Gen also contain the two Earths, wu and ji. Kun is yin Earth, Gen is yang Earth, and the qi of the Five Phases is also within them. In humans, the Five Phases manifest as the five origins of nature, emotion, essence, spirit, and qi, which unfold into the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The Three Origins in humans are original essence, original qi, and original spirit, while the Eight Trigrams in humans correspond to the five origins, five virtues, and the nature of hardness and softness. In sum, the Four Symbols, Three Origins, and Eight Trigrams are all transformations of the Five Phases—there are no Four Symbols, Three Origins, or Eight Trigrams beyond the Five Phases.\n\nWhen Metal in the Four Symbols and Five Phases relies on Earth, it is like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all depending on trust to be complete. How can the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from ren? This is like nature, emotion, spirit, and qi not departing from the unity of essence. The Yellow Sprout is the vital force of Earth, with trust at its core. The White Snow is the light clarity of Water, with essence reaching unity. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom return to trust, holding fast to the center, and the Yellow Sprout gradually grows. Nature, emotion, spirit, and qi return to unity, being only essence and unity. As the White Thunder soars into the void, essence and unity hold the center. Through cultivation and refinement, the longer one practices, the stronger the effort. The mind of Dao remains ever-vigilant, the human mind ever-still. True knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, and a single luminous pearl hangs in the emptiness. Constantly responsive, constantly still, form and emptiness unbound, manifesting or hidden as the time requires—before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; after Heaven, it accords with Heaven’s timing. If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less so humans? How much less so ghosts and spirits? Though people may not recognize it and ghosts cannot invade, is this mere empty talk?\n\nThis Dao is utterly simple and effortless, concise and unburdened. Those who know it ascend to sagehood in an instant, without waiting three years or nine refinements. Yet in the world, there are few virtuous gentlemen, no true men—most merely grasp the axe to hew the axe-handle, still thinking it distant. As the Immortal Elder said: *\"I wish to leave this secret melody among men, yet I have not met a single true confidant.\"* Is this not lamentable?\n\nTwelve\n\nYin and yang in grasses and trees stand paired as one;\nLack but a single half, and fragrance is undone.\nFirst unfurl green leaves, yang’s primacy proclaimed,\nThen bloom red blossoms, yin in quiet train unnamed.\nThis common Way is daily life’s unchanging course,\nYet who returns to this true source with conscious force?\nI say to all who seek the Dao, take heed and hear:\nWithout yin-yang’s discernment, act not without fear.\n\nThe former poem spoke of virtue’s cultivation due;\nThis poem speaks of the Dao’s illumination true.\nThe *Yi* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.”\nIt also says: “Heaven and earth in misty union blend,\nThe myriad things in harmony transform and mend.\nMale and female in essence meet,\nThe myriad things in life complete.”\n\nThe Way of Golden Elixir relies entirely on yang’s vigor and yin’s compliance for its operation. When yin and yang unite as one, the elixir is born and life extended; when yin and yang diverge, discord arises and life is forfeit. Observe the insensate grasses and trees: first, green leaves emerge as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers follow as yin comes in train. Yin and yang never part, and by analogy, all sentient beings in the common Way achieve nothing outside yin and yang—only that the common Way flows with them while the immortal Way reverses their course. To flow with them is to follow yin and yang; to reverse them is to invert yin and yang’s operation. Worldly people know only the Way of following; they do not know the Way of inversion. Thus they chase illusory realms, lose the true source, and when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—when yin reaches its peak, death follows.\n\nFor scholars, the first step is to recognize the two things: yin and yang. Once yin and yang are known, the true source is likewise known. The true source is the Gate of Mystery and Darkness, where yin is born, where yang is born, where following and inversion both reside. Know the constant and return to the root, and you ascend to sagehood in an instant.\n\nYet yin and yang are not uniform: there are prior-heaven yin and yang, posterior-heaven yin and yang; there are yin and yang of fate, yin and yang of nature; there are true yin and yang, false yin and yang; there are outer yin and yang, inner yin and yang. All these must be thoroughly investigated until clarity is achieved before daring to proceed. Without recognizing true yin and true yang, acting recklessly leads to abandoning the real for the false, squandering one’s nature and life.\n\nThirteen\n\nNot knowing inversion’s turn within the mystery’s core,\nHow can one plant lotuses in fire’s embrace more?\nLead the White Tiger home to tend with care,\nAnd bear a luminous pearl bright as the moon’s sphere.\n\nDo not idly watch the furnace, tending flame and hour,\nBut still the spirit’s breath and let nature take its power.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens true,\nLeap from the cage of mortal bounds to live ten thousand years anew.\n\nThe former poem taught recognition of yin and yang;\nThis poem teaches the investigation of their function’s span.\nFunction is the method of inverting yin and yang.\nWithout knowing this inversion’s art, how grasp the lotus in fire’s fang?\n\nWhat is inverted? What is turned? The White Tiger, metal-aligned,\nIs the pure, unyielding qi of Qian’s palace, named the mind of Dao,\nWhich, when invested, becomes the true knowing’s emotion.\nYet through posterior-heaven’s exchange, the human mind takes sway,\nThe mind of Dao grows dim, true feeling fades and false arises,\nAs the White Tiger leaves its home to roam and harm afar.\nTo invert is to return from false feeling to the true,\nTo pair it with true nature, as the White Tiger homeward drew.\n\nWhen true feeling moves, true nature appears,\nAnd nature and feeling in love unite.\nThe prior-heaven’s true unity of qi arises from the void,\nForming a precious pearl, round as the moon’s full light,\nIts radiance illuminating mountains, rivers, and the earth entire,\nAs if held within the palm—this is the Golden Elixir’s sign.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: “When metal returns to nature’s dawn,\nIt is called the Returned Elixir,” and so it is drawn.\n\nOnce the Returned Elixir is formed,\nInnate knowing and ability, in stillness, act not,\nIn motion, follow nature’s course, at ease within the Way.\nMedicine is fire, fire is medicine,\nThe work of gathering is unneeded.\nSimply still the spirit’s breath and let nature hold its sway.\nWithin the furnace of creation, yin and yang in harmony blend,\nTrue fire refines away the posterior-heaven’s yin,\nTransforming it to pure yang—this is the elixir’s ripening.\nSwallow and ingest it, shed the mortal coil,\nLeap from the mundane cage, your life span heaven’s to share,\nAnd live forever, deathless, beyond compare.\n\nFourteen\n\nThree, five, one—just three words compose the key,\nYet from ancient times to now, few truly see.\n\nEast three and south two together make five,\nNorth one and west four complete the same.\nWu and Ji return to the generative number five,\nWhen the three families meet, the infant is formed.\nKnow then that the Great One contains true qi,\nAfter ten months the embryo is full—enter the sacred foundation.\n\nThe preceding poem holds the principle of inverting yin and yang,\nThis poem speaks of the work of gathering the five phases.\nAt the dawn of human life, the five-phase nature one possesses\nWas originally a single qi in perfect unity.\nYet through engagement with the posterior-heaven,\nEach phase scatters its nature:\nMetal and wood cannot coexist,\nWater and fire do not interact.\nTrue earth lies buried,\nFalse earth runs rampant.\nNature is disordered, destiny shaken,\nYang qi exhausted and yin qi pure—\nHow can one avoid death?\nThe immortal elder points to the three words \"three-five-one,\"\nTeaching people to gather the five phases into one family,\nRestoring our original innate knowing and ability,\nThe unblemished face of heaven’s principle.\nYet these three words—three-five-one—\nHave led astray countless heroes through the ages.\nAmong them, those who truly understand can be counted on one’s fingers.\n\nWhat is meant by \"three-five\"?\nThey are the generative numbers of the five phases in the *River Chart*:\nEast three is wood, south two is fire.\nFire is born of wood, so wood and fire form one family—one five.\nWest four is metal, north one is water.\nWater is born of metal, so metal and water form one family—one five.\nThe center, earth, stands alone as one family—one five.\nThe cultivator who clearly understands the three-fives,\nReverses the course and refines them,\nHarmonizing the four images and gathering the five phases,\nSo that nature, emotion, essence, qi, and spirit congeal.\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust share the same qi—\nThis is called \"the three families meeting.\"\nIn Confucianism, it is named \"Great Ultimate,\"\nAlso \"Heaven’s Principle,\" \"Supreme Goodness,\" or \"Utmost Sincerity.\"\nIn Daoism, it is called \"the Infant,\"\nAlso \"prior-heaven’s singular qi,\" \"sacred embryo,\" or \"golden elixir.\"\nIn Buddhism, it is named \"Perfect Enlightenment,\"\nAlso \"true emptiness,\" \"Dharma-body,\" \"śarīra,\" or \"cintāmaṇi.\"\nIn sum, it is \"heaven’s innate good nature.\"\nWhen the Dao restores this original nature,\nInnate knowing and ability return to their source,\nNurtured for ten months until qi is full and spirit complete.\nOne escapes the sea of suffering,\nGains a body beyond the body,\nAnd enters the sacred foundation of non-birth and non-extinction.\n\nFifteen\nNot knowing true lead, the true ancestor,\nAll efforts are vainly expended.\nParting from one’s wife only severs yin and yang,\nFasting merely empties the stomach and bowels.\nHerbs, metals, and silver are all impure substances,\nClouds, mist, sun, and moon belong to illusion.\nEven if one masters breath-work and visualization,\nAll differ from the work of the golden elixir.\n\nThe preceding poem speaks of gathering the five phases into one qi\nTo enter the sacred foundation.\nYet to gather the five phases,\nOne must first recognize the prior-heaven’s true singular qi.\nThe single yang within Kan\nIs the firm, strong, and upright qi of Qian’s house,\nThe true knowing of the Dao-heart,\nSymbolized as true lead—born of heaven’s one.\nIt holds the prior-heaven’s true singular qi,\nThe ancestral qi that gives life to all things.\nWithin it lies the potential to become a sage or immortal,\nTo become a buddha or transcendent—\nIt is the root of sages and worthies,\nThe seed of immortals and buddhas,\nThe true ancestor of the golden elixir.\nAs the saying goes, \"Know the one, and all affairs are complete.\"\nWithout recognizing true lead, one lacks an ancestor,\nAnd the elixir has no root.\nAll practices—abandoning one’s wife, fasting,\nRefining herbs, metals, or silver,\nIngesting clouds, mist, sun, or moon,\nExpelling turbid qi, or visualizing images—\nEither cling to emptiness or grasp at forms,\nAll efforts are wasted,\nAnd how do they relate to the golden elixir?\n\nSixteen\nThough ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures exist,\nThe golden elixir has but this one root.\nRely on Kun’s position to form the body,\nPlant it in Qian’s palace of mutual resonance.\nDo not fault the celestial mechanism for being revealed,\nFor it is learners’ own ignorance that blinds them.\nIf one grasps the meaning of this poem,\nOne will immediately meet the Three Pure Ones and the Most High.\n\nThe preceding fifteen poems,\nWhether speaking of the sequential or the reverse,\nWhether divided or unified,\nWhether pointing to the medicine or indicating the firing times,\nDistinguishing true from false,\nOr setting forth right and wrong in detail—\nTheir subtle layers, though scattered, are not yet whole.\nFearing that people might doubt the complexity of the work\nAnd find progress difficult,\nThis poem summarizes the meaning of the fifteen,\nRevealing the utmost simplicity and ease of the Dao.\n\nSince ancient times, the perfected immortals,\nIn their scriptures and Daoist texts,\nHave used a thousand metaphors and a hundred analogies,\nEstablishing images and crafting words\nTo exhaustively describe and clarify the marrow of the Dao.\nThough their expressions differ,\nTheir principles are the same—\nAll illuminate the root of the golden elixir.\nYet in later ages,\nThe more books there are, the more people are confused.\nEach clings to their own views,\nStraying into side doors—\nHow could they know that the root of the golden elixir\nLies in \"taking from Kan to fill Li,\"\nRelying on Kun to return to Qian in one move?\n\"Kun’s position forming the body\" refers to the single yang within Kan;\n\"Qian’s palace of mutual resonance\" refers to the single yin within Li.\nKan is originally Kun’s body, hence \"Kun’s position\";\nLi is originally Qian’s body, hence \"Qian’s house.\"\nQian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its power;\nQian is firm and strong, Kun is yielding and compliant.\nBecause of its firmness and strength, it is easy to know and does not resist;\nBecause of its yielding compliance, it is simple in its power and unforced.\nThis ease of knowing and simplicity of power,\nIn humans, is the original innate knowing and ability of our nature.\nAt the beginning of human life,\nStrength and compliance were one,\nFirmness and softness blended,\nUnknowing and unperceiving,\nFollowing the emperor’s rule—\nRound and complete, radiant and bright,\nPure and bare, unadorned and free,\nThere was only the original innate knowing and ability of our nature,\nWithout a trace of impurity.\n\nBy the age of sixteen, yang reaches its peak and generates yin, entering the postnatal realm where yin-qi prevails. Principle and desire intermingle, firmness and compliance fall out of balance, hardness and softness lose their measure. Thus yang is trapped by yin, the celestial truth becomes obscured—like Qian uniting with Kun, Qian’s single yang line enters the Kun palace, and Kun’s solidity transforms into Kan. Yin usurps yang’s position, knowledge gradually awakens—like Kun uniting with Qian, Kun’s single yin line enters the Qian palace, and Qian’s emptiness transforms into Li.\n\nWhen the celestial truth is obscured, the Dao-heart hides and becomes faint; when knowledge awakens, the human heart arises and becomes perilous. Faintness means near-absence, for yang cannot overcome yin; peril means responding to appearances with emotion, for yin overcomes yang. Yet though the Dao-heart is faint and the human heart perilous, the Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished, nor is the human heart entirely dominant. The Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished because at times a spark of clarity may arise within darkness—this is called true knowing, though it flickers and vanishes. The human heart is not entirely dominant because it can respond to circumstances with adaptability—this is called numinous knowing, though it merely borrows numinosity to generate delusion.\n\nThe Way of cultivating the elixir is to return yang within yin, extracting the true knowing of the Dao-heart and refining the numinous knowing of the human heart. When numinous knowing returns to truth and true knowing returns to numinosity, the Dao-heart becomes firm and strong, the human heart becomes yielding and compliant; yin and yang interact, hardness and softness respond; firmness and compliance align, true and numinous knowing remain undispersed. Thus one restores the original face of innate knowing and ability from the Qian era—this is called \"extracting Kan to fill Li,\" or \"planting in Kun to cultivate Qian.\" In truth, it means relying on Kun’s position to form the body and sowing in Qian’s palace of interaction—this is precisely the meaning of \"extracting Kan to fill Li.\" Extracting Kan releases the yang trapped within, restoring Kun; filling Li transforms the yin mixed within, restoring Qian. When the bodies of Qian and Kun are complete, the Mysterious Female is established and the Valley Spirit abides; the Golden Elixir coagulates, nature and life are attained, and one is no longer bound by postnatal transformation. This is the celestial mechanism transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe ancient immortals refused to speak of it plainly. The Immortal Elder, in his great compassion, revealed in sixteen poems what the ancients had left unsaid—truly \"uprooting the celestial root and chiseling the cavern of principle.\" In the closing lines, he directly points to the root and origin of the Golden Elixir, fully disclosing the celestial mechanism. If one awakens to the marvelous meaning in these poems, one may ascend directly to the sacred realm and immediately behold the Three Pure Ones—how could this be empty words?\n\n*Direct Pointers to Awakening the Truth*, Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains, Corresponding to the Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. On the Cauldron and Furnace (Two Poems):\n\n**I**\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel,\nThen gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.\nOnce these two things are driven back to the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Golden Elixir fail to be born?\n\nQian is firmness, symbolizing Heaven; Kun is compliance, symbolizing Earth. In humans, they are the natures of hardness and softness. The sun contains the Crow—yang within yin—corresponding to the hexagram Li, which is yang outside and yin within; its inner yin line is true yin, in humans the numinous knowing hidden in the human heart. The moon contains the Hare—yin within yang—corresponding to the hexagram Kan, which is yin outside and yang within; its inner yang line is true yang, in humans the true knowing inherent in the Dao-heart.\n\n\"First take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel\" means using firmness and compliance as the foundation for elixir-cultivation. \"Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine\" means employing true knowing and numinous knowing as the function of elixir-cultivation. Refining true knowing until nothing is untrue restores hardness to central correctness; refining numinous knowing until nothing is obscured restores softness to central correctness. When both hardness and softness return to central correctness, the Dao-heart is firm and the human heart compliant; true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, like driving the Crow and Hare back to the Yellow Path.\n\nThe Yellow Path is the Central Path, the sun’s course. The sun travels the Central Path, while the moon travels nine paths. The nine paths consist of four pairs—blue, red, white, and black—each extending beyond the Yellow Path, making eight paths in total. When the moon meets the sun, they interact and travel together, forming nine paths. The place where the sun and moon interact is called \"the two things returning to the Yellow Path.\"\n\nAt the beginning of human life, there is only one true and numinous nature of innate knowing and ability, with no human heart or Dao-heart. After entering the postnatal realm, the human heart and Dao-heart become distinct, as do true knowing and numinous knowing. The human heart encompasses all perception and movement—perception is numinous knowing; the Dao-heart encompasses all situations without delusion—non-delusion is true knowing. The human heart can only possess numinous knowing, not true knowing, and its nature is soft, hence called yin. The Dao-heart possesses true knowing and can also employ numinous knowing, and its qi is hard, hence called yang.\n\nEven sages have a human heart, and even ordinary people have a Dao-heart. Sages have a human heart because they cannot eliminate perception; ordinary people have a Dao-heart because they occasionally have moments of clarity. What distinguishes sages from ordinary people is that their true and numinous knowing remain unified, perceiving and aware, yet constantly undeluded. What distinguishes ordinary people from sages is that their true and numinous knowing are separated, perceiving and aware, yet unable to remain undeluded.\n\nFor the human heart harbors the consciousness-spirit, which borrows numinosity to generate delusion, responding to appearances with emotion and riding the winds to stir waves. Numinosity returns to falsity, and the human heart becomes perilous. When the human heart is perilous, deviant qi flourishes while upright qi weakens; the Dao-heart is not manifest, and the Dao-heart becomes faint. In cultivating the Dao, one refines the hardness of the Dao-heart’s true knowing to return it to central correctness...\n\nTo temper the human heart’s numinous knowing in its softness and return it to central correctness is to unite hardness and softness, balance vigor and compliance, be utterly refined and singular, and hold fast to the center. Here, innate knowing and innate ability merge with Heavenly Principle, and a single qi flows unimpeded. How could the Golden Elixir fail to arise? The Golden Elixir is formed by the coagulation of the two qi of hardness and softness; when true knowing and numinous knowing return to central correctness, Heaven and human merge as one, like a single precious pearl suspended in emptiness, illuminating all without exception. The Golden Elixir has form, growing from the subtle to the manifest, from raw to ripe—how could one not attain liberation?\n\n**Second Stanza**\n*Setting the furnace and establishing the crucible, emulating Qian and Kun,*\n*Tempering essence to refine the po and hun.*\n*Gathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, transforming without cease—*\n*Who dares treat the profound and wondrous as commonplace?*\n\nThe furnace serves to circulate fire, the crucible to temper the medicine. In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, one models the furnace after Kun’s soft compliance, advancing step by step; one patterns the crucible after Qian’s firm vigor, applying fierce fire and urgent refinement. Able to be hard, able to be soft; able to be vigorous, able to be compliant—with resolve and thought unwavering, the longer the effort, the greater the strength. When the crucible and furnace are stable, unmoving and unshaken, one may then gather the medicine and circulate the fire.\n\nThe human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, like the essence of the sun, its radiance shining outward. The Dao-heart’s true knowing is like the splendor of the moon, its brilliance concealed within. Numinous knowing, outwardly yang, pertains to the hun; true knowing, outwardly yin, pertains to the po. Numinous knowing and essence-hun are what is called \"spiritual and yet spiritual\"; true knowing and splendor-po are what is called \"not spiritual and yet spiritual.\" \"Spiritual and yet spiritual\" contains falsity within; \"not spiritual and yet spiritual\" holds truth within falsity. To temper essence is to burn away the falsity within the human heart’s numinous knowing and refine the truth within the Dao-heart’s falsity. When false numinosity departs and true numinosity settles, the hun does not fly and is thus mastered; when true knowing appears and false knowing vanishes, the po does not scatter and is thus mastered. Once hun and po are mastered, true knowing and numinous knowing, emotion and nature, converge as one, congealing into a single qi. Misty and harmonious, gathering and dispersing, transforming without end—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and immediately penetrating—every step and movement is Heaven’s mechanism. The wondrousness herein cannot be captured in words.\n\n**Two Poems on the Crescent-Moon Furnace**\n\n**Third**\nDo not cling to alchemical hearths and waste effort—\nTo refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.\nIt possesses a natural, true firing time—\nNo need for firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath.\n\nThe crescent moon appears on the third day of each month, its sliver of light emerging in the Kun direction, its glow upturned—hence the name. In the human, within utmost stillness, a single point of yang light breaks through, resembling the crescent moon. In the hexagrams, this is Zhen, as in the saying: *\"On the third day, Zhen issues forth Geng; by the winding riverbank, the moon’s splendor gleams.\"* This point of yang light is nothing other than the light of the Dao-heart. What is hardest to attain in the Dao of the Elixir is the Dao-heart. Once the Dao-heart appears, Heavenly Principle shines forth, the qi of firmness gradually revives, and mountains, rivers, and the great earth—all become spiritual medicine. Grasped at will, every touch is the Dao. The medicine is the fire, the fire is the medicine; it possesses a natural alchemical furnace and true fire—why labor over hearths, firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath?\n\n**Fourth**\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout;\nIn the cinnabar crucible, mercury lies level.\nOnly after the fire’s power is harmonized\nDoes the yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\nThe crescent-moon furnace is what was earlier called the Dao-heart. The jade bud: jade is a gentle substance, belonging to yin; the bud is a luminous substance, belonging to yang. The jade bud is yang within yin, an analogy for the Dao-heart’s true knowing. The cinnabar crucible is the human heart. Mercury is a fluid, unstable substance, belonging to yin—yang within yin, an analogy for the human heart’s numinous knowing. When the Dao-heart is ever-present and true knowing undimmed, the human heart’s numinous knowing naturally calms, unable to soar. Applying the work of harmonization, one uses the true fire inherent in the Dao-heart to burn away the false numinosity within the human heart, returning it to empty numinosity.\n\nWhen heaven and humanity unite in emanation, true knowing and numinous knowing become as one. When knowing reaches its fullness and intention becomes sincere, this is called the \"yellow sprout.\" The yellow sprout is the seed of true numinosity, which, nurtured by the warmth of earth, emerges like grass from the soil—first as a sprout of yellow hue, hence the name \"yellow sprout.\" After the fire’s power harmonizes true knowing and numinous knowing, they return to central equilibrium, entering the upper crucible of the central palace. Applying the work of nurturing with true intention, after ten months when qi is full, it naturally ripens and transforms.\n\nSpeaking of true lead, four verses begin:\n\n**Five**\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi—this is human practice,\nYet only with the proper substance can creation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks the true seed,\nOne merely boils an empty cauldron with water and fire.\n\nThe Dao-heart’s true knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, symbolized as lead—the true seed for becoming a sage, worthy, buddha, or immortal. If one wishes to refine the great elixir, apart from this true seed, there is nothing else. Yet deluded fools of the world, practicing only upon their bodily forms and tangible substances—swallowing saliva and absorbing qi, believing themselves to cultivate the Dao—do not realize that what the body produces are merely postcelestial dregs. How can these give birth to the primordial, most numinous and sagely elixir? This is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire, for the crucible holds no true seed.\n\n**Six**\nTo harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,\nNeither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole.\nIf you ask what true lead is,\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\n\nThe golden elixir is formed from the Dao-heart’s true knowing as true lead and the human heart’s numinous knowing as true mercury. To refine the golden elixir, first harmonize lead and mercury. The Dao-heart is firm, belonging to yang, and is great; the human heart is gentle, belonging to yin, and is small. Without the Dao-heart, the human heart borrows its numinosity to generate delusion and obstruct the Dao. Yet if the Dao-heart governs it, numinous clarity remains undimmed and can assist the Dao. The Dao-heart cannot be lacking, nor can the human heart be extinguished—only its false numinosity must not be misused. The ancients taught \"putting the human heart to death,\" meaning to extinguish its false numinosity, not its true numinosity. If one fails to distinguish true from false and extinguishes all, one falls into the study of dull emptiness and annihilation. Harming the small harms the great; with yin and yang isolated, how can the vital breath of life-force give rise to the great Dao of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: neither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole. When both realms are whole, the human heart’s numinous knowing and the Dao-heart’s true knowing merge as one—true knowing governs numinous knowing, and numinous knowing submits to true knowing. True and numinous knowing remain undispersed, returning to innate knowing and innate ability, wholly embodying heaven’s principle, perfectly illuminating original nature, and the golden elixir is complete.\n\nFor true knowing and numinous knowing are the totality of innate knowing and innate ability. In the primordial, they are called innate knowing and innate ability; in the acquired, they are called true knowing and numinous knowing. When the acquired returns to the primordial, true knowing is innate knowing, and numinous knowing is innate ability. True knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family, no different. Yet upon entering the acquired, a speck of heaven’s true purity in innate knowing becomes lost externally, possessed by another household. The numinous ability remaining in one’s own household becomes impure and unstable. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek the whereabouts of the true within false knowing and guide it back to one’s own household, so that numinous knowing remains undimmed. This true knowing is the most firm and vigorous substance, hence symbolized as true lead. True knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, also symbolized as gold within water and as moonlight. Gold within water and moonlight both signify yang within yin. Yet this true knowing, before being restored, still belongs to another household and is not one’s own, hence the saying: \"The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\" The moon contains a golden toad, and the toad’s light is the moon’s light—an analogy for true knowing’s outer darkness and inner brightness. Shining all day upon the west and not the east clearly means its radiance lies there. The immortal’s later verse says: \"The Metal Lord was originally the eastern householder’s child, sent to the western neighbor to lodge and grow.\" This precisely captures the meaning of \"the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\" If the practitioner can truly recognize that the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—knowing the whereabouts of true knowing—then it can shine eastward and meet with numinous knowing. Alas! Going with the flow brings death; reversing it brings life. Often, one is taught to seek yet cannot find—how easily can true knowing be known?\n\n**Seven**\nBefore refining the returned elixir, do not enter the mountains,\nFor within and without the mountains, there is no lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet fools fail to recognize it fully.\n\nWithdrawing from the world and leaving the dust to dwell in the mountains and nurture stillness are matters for after the elixir’s return. Those who do not understand enter the mountains to nurture stillness, believing this can bring longevity. Yet the way of longevity requires obtaining the single flavor of true lead to be effective. But true lead must be sought within the dusty world. If one enters the mountains to cultivate the Dao, within and without the mountains are entirely yin qi—where can one find the true lead of utmost yang? True lead is the primordial numinous root, also called the heavenly root, the true unity’s essence, the true unity’s qi, the lead of the watery realm, gold within water, white within black, the hun within the po, the black tiger, the Metal Lord, and the other household’s elixir of immortality. The ancients employed many symbols, but in essence, they all describe the single substance of the Dao-heart. This Dao-heart, when active, manifests as the wondrous existence of true knowing; when concealed, it is the true emptiness of the unified essence. It is possessed by all, perfectly complete in each—neither increased in sages nor diminished in commoners—existing in every household.\n\nYet though it exists in every household, it is not possessed by one’s own household—this is because what is seen cannot be used, and what is used cannot be seen. Precisely because it exists in every household yet is not one’s own, fools encounter it without recognition, passing it by even when face to face. In the late Ming, Peng Haogu, failing to grasp this principle, took the phrase \"existing in every household\" as a direct reference to the \"female crucible,\" while in recent times, Zhiji Zi has annotated it with the Three Peaks’ art of bedchamber warfare. Such benighted delusions mislead later learners—no greater transgression exists!\n\n**VIII.**\nWhen bamboo splits, bamboo must be used to mend it;\nTo hatch a chick, an egg must serve the task.\nAll else is but vain labor, disparate kind—\nHow could it match true lead uniting with the sage’s mechanism?\n\nWhen bamboo splits, bamboo repairs it; when hatching a chick, an egg is used—this is seeking by kind. *The Three Kinds* states: \"Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike kind, skill is hard to achieve.\" If not of its kind, it is not the true seed—all exertion is but vain labor. Thus, the great Way of the golden elixir is the sage’s affair. To learn from the sage, one must seek the sage’s seed, which is the true knowing of true lead. Cultivating the great Way with this true knowing, none will fail to unite with the sage’s mechanism. The sage’s mechanism is nothing other than the undifferentiated heavenly principle—true knowing without a single thing unknown, without a single thing untrue, able to restore the heavenly principle. Hence it is called \"uniting with the sage’s mechanism.\" Once united with the sage’s mechanism, one is a sage—why then do learners refuse to humble their hearts?\n\n**On the Use of Lead**\n**IX.**\nEmpty the heart and fill the belly—both meanings run deep,\nYet emptying the heart first requires knowing the heart.\nBetter to refine lead and fill the belly first,\nThen gather gold to fill the hall.\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir involves emptying the heart and filling the belly—two distinct endeavors. To empty the heart is to empty the human heart, the work of cultivating nature; to fill the belly is to fill the Dao-heart, the work of cultivating life. These two—emptying the heart and filling the belly—are the unfolding of nature and life, each bearing profound meaning. If one wishes to empty the heart, one must first know the heart. For the heart has two aspects: the human heart and the Dao-heart. The human heart should be empty, not full; the Dao-heart should be full, not empty. If one fails to distinguish the true and false, right and wrong of the heart, emptying it indiscriminately, one will not only fail to complete life but also fail to complete nature. If one knows the heart, there is no need to empty the human heart first—one must refine the Dao-heart of true lead to fill the belly. When the belly is full, righteousness gathers and arises, guest qi naturally dissipates, and the human heart empties of itself. The four images harmonize, the five phases converge, gold and jade fill the hall, the treasure of life is in hand—then one may empty the human heart to nourish the Dao-heart, completing the lineage of nature and returning to the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\n\n**On Not Using Lead**\n**X.**\n\n**On Using Lead**\n\nOne must not use common lead; having used true lead, one must also discard it. This is the true esoteric principle of using lead—\"using lead without using it\" is no empty word.\n\nThe method of refining the elixir depends solely on gathering true lead as its essential step. Yet lead is not all the same: there is common lead, and there is true lead. Common lead is that which is mined from mountains, a turbid substance of form, without affinity to the self. True lead is stored within the garden of the household, the formless Dao-heart, of the same kind as the self. Since ancient times, those immortals who have transcended the mundane to enter sagehood have all relied on the power of this true lead, the Dao-heart—hence the saying, \"One must not use common lead.\"\n\nYet though the Dao-heart is a primordial treasure, it arises from the postnatal realm. There is a time for its use, and a time when it must not be used. Before the elixir coalesces, one must rely on the true knowing of the Dao-heart to restrain the numinous knowing of the human heart. Once the human heart is settled and its numinous knowing unobscured, Dao-heart and human heart move and rest as one; true knowing and numinous knowing respond in emptiness and fullness. When the sacred embryo has formed, one must swiftly withdraw the hardness of the Dao-heart to gently nurture the fetal breath.\n\nThe purpose of employing the Dao-heart is to restrain the human heart. Once the human heart is stilled and the consciousness of the senses extinguished, innate knowing and innate capacity remain quiescent and unmoving. Yet when stirred, they respond with perfect clarity; the true spirit abides alone, luminous and undimmed. The Dao-heart is no longer needed, and one may stand where being and nonbeing are both negated, where self and other dissolve entirely into emptiness.\n\nLu Ziye said: \"The method of using lead is like the trap and snare for catching fish and hare.\" Fish and hare are obtained by means of the trap and snare, but once obtained, trap and snare are of no further use. The esoteric principle of using lead lies precisely here. If one does not grasp the secret of using lead and, after the elixir has formed, still clings to the Dao-heart, one will inevitably employ the Dao-heart only to rouse the human heart again. The true spirit scatters once more, and the golden elixir, though gained, is lost again—hence the saying, \"Having used true lead, one must also discard it.\" The secret of \"using lead without using it\" may be understood from this.\n\n**On Lead and Mercury**\n**XI**\n\nIn a dream I ascended to the Nine Heavens, where I met the Western Flower;\nA true immortal bestowed upon me the *Finger-Pointing to the Origin*.\nIts words were few and simple,\nTeaching only the refinement of mercury and lead.\n\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is utterly simple and easy,\nRequiring no verbose instruction—\nIt is nothing more than refining the true knowing within the Dao-heart\nAnd the numinous knowing within the human heart.\nWhen the Dao-heart is firm and vigorous, returning to central equilibrium,\nThe Dao-heart abides constantly.\nUsing true knowing to govern numinous knowing,\nWhen the human heart is yielding and compliant, returning to central equilibrium,\nThe human heart remains ever still.\nWhen firmness and softness correspond, true and numinous knowing unite—\nThis is called the mutual embrace of lead and mercury,\nThe coagulation of the Golden Elixir.\nIts method is most simple and easy, concise and unburdensome;\nEven an ordinary person, upon attaining it, ascends at once to sagehood.\nYet most lack great virtue and great fortune,\nAnd thus rarely obtain it.\nIf one possesses great virtue and great fortune,\nAnd encounters a true immortal who reveals this simple and wondrous method,\nIt is like awakening from a dream—\nOnly then does one realize the Great Medicine lies within oneself,\nNot to be sought elsewhere.\nWith a mere grasp and application, all desires are fulfilled.\nThe immortal elder’s dream of meeting the Western Flower and receiving instruction\nCarries profound meaning—it is no mere allegory.\nThe Western Flower is the place where true gold is produced;\n\"Flower\" signifies the radiant essence of true gold.\nThe Nine Heavens are the realm of pure yang, devoid of yin.\nTrue gold is the symbolic form of true knowing.\nWithin darkness, the sudden appearance of the yang light of true knowing—\nSeizing this true knowing and returning it to one’s own abode,\nUniting it with numinous knowing,\nAnd refining it with fire until it reaches the state of pure yang without yin,\nIs called the \"Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions,\"\nThe Great Elixir of Golden Liquor—\nHow could this truly be a dream?\n\n**On the Single Qi of Emptiness and Nothingness**\n**XII**\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness, giving birth to the single qi;\nFrom this single qi, yin and yang emerge.\nYin and yang unite again to form the Three Bodies,\nAnd from the Three Bodies, the myriad things unfold.\nThe Dao of nature and life,\nThe Dao of creation—\nThe Dao of ceaseless generation.\nTracing its source,\nIt originates from the single qi within emptiness and nothingness;\nFrom this single qi, heaven and earth arise, producing yin and yang.\nYin and yang unite once more, containing within them the single qi to form the Three Bodies.\nOnce the Three Bodies are complete, the single qi moves—\nNow yin, now yang—\nAnd thus the myriad things are born.\nTake, for example, the growth of plants:\nFirst, a sprout emerges from the earth—\nThis is the single qi born from emptiness and nothingness.\nThen it breaks the soil, opening into two leaves—\nThis is yin and yang produced from the single qi.\nNext, a stem rises between the two leaves—\nThis is the Three Bodies formed from the union of yin and yang.\nFrom this, branches and leaves proliferate—\nThis is the myriad things unfolding from the Three Bodies.\nAll things in heaven and earth, whether sentient or insentient,\nArise from this single qi of emptiness and nothingness,\nYet all follow the forward course of creation.\nIf the cultivator of the Dao understands this forward course of creation\nAnd reverses it in practice—\nReturning the myriad to the Three,\nThe Three to the Two,\nThe Two to the One,\nAnd the One to emptiness and nothingness—\nThen the state of utter silence and formlessness is attained.\n\n**On Kan and Li**\n**XIII**\n\n**On Kan and Li**\n\n**XIII**\n\nThe lightning of Kan roils and boils the crucible of metal and water,\nFire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.\nIf these two substances harmonize and unite,\nThe elixir ripens naturally, its fragrance suffusing the body.\n\nThe lightning of Kan is the image of fire arising within water,\nComparable to the true knowing of the Dao-mind,\nEmerging in the deepest darkness—\nWhere it appears is precisely the living *zi* hour within this body.\n\n\"Roiling and boiling\" is the image of the indistinct and unfixed.\nThe \"crucible of metal and water\" refers to the true knowing of the Dao-mind,\nThe genuine feeling of *jingyi*,\nPossessing the dual qi of metal and water.\n\nKunlun lies in the West, the ancestral vein of all mountains,\nThe place where true metal is produced.\nWhen the true knowing of the Dao-mind flashes forth in the deepest darkness,\nLike lightning’s sudden gleam—now bright, now dim, indistinct and fleeting—\nSwiftly employ the empty, numinous fire of Li to receive it,\nThen true knowing and numinous knowing, nature and feeling, long for one another,\nYin and yang unite.\nFrom this union, the primordial spiritual medicine is born.\nAgain, the natural true fire is set in motion,\nForging away the turbid qi of later heaven,\nSmelting the ore until the metal is pure.\nThe golden elixir matures—\nSwallowed and ingested, it transforms bone and flesh,\nRevealing the pure Dharma-body.\nThen fragrant winds fill the dusty world—\nHow could it be merely the body that is suffused with fragrance?\n\n**On Wu and Ji**\n\n**XIV**\n\nIf Li and Kan yet lack Wu and Ji,\nThough they contain the Four Images, no elixir forms.\nOnly because each holds true earth,\nDoes the golden elixir gain its return.\n\nKan is water, in man it is primordial essence,\nIssuing forth as wisdom;\nWithin water gold is concealed, in man it is true feeling,\nIssuing forth as righteousness.\nLi is fire, in man it is primordial spirit,\nIssuing forth as propriety;\nFire is born of wood, in man it is primordial nature,\nIssuing forth as benevolence.\n\nThe Dao-mind bears the image of Kan,\nThe human mind bears the image of Li.\nDao-mind and human mind together possess\nThe four natures of metal, wood, water, and fire.\nYet these four natures stand apart—\nShould they wish to generate one another in a single qi,\nThey rely wholly on the work of Wu and Ji.\n\nWu is yang earth, primordial qi,\nIssuing forth as trust;\nJi is yin earth, intention,\nIssuing forth as desire.\nKan receives Wu, in the Dao-mind it is trust;\nLi receives Ji, in the human mind it is intention.\n\nTo rectify the mind, first make intention sincere.\nWhen intention is sincere, Ji earth settles and the human mind is still;\nTo practice the Way, first establish trust.\nWhen trust is established, Wu earth appears and the Dao-mind is manifest.\n\nIf the Dao-mind lacks trust,\nAnd the human mind is not sincere,\nThough benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom exist,\nEach turns away from the others.\nThe natures, feelings, and spirits they contain\nAll stand in opposition—\nHow then could they congeal the most numinous and sagely divine elixir?\n\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao\nMust take sincerity of intention and establishment of trust as their foundation.\nWhen intention is sincere and trust is established,\nThe Dao-mind is manifest and the human mind is rectified.\nEach harmonizes with the other,\nYin and yang respond,\nAnd the primordial qi,\nArising from emptiness and nothingness,\nCoagulates into a single grain of millet-pearl.\nThe scattered gathers once more,\nThe departed returns again—\nThus it is said: *Only because each holds true earth,\nDoes the golden elixir gain its return.*\nGreat indeed is the work of Wu and Ji.\n\n**On the Inversion of Kan and Li**\n\n**XV**\n\nThe sun dwelling in the Li position inverts to become the woman,\nThe Kan matched with the Toad Palace becomes the man instead.\nIf one does not grasp this inversion of meaning within,\nDo not presume to discourse loftily on matters with narrow insight.\n\nThe sun dwelling in the Li position (in one version, \"Li dwelling in the sun’s position\")—\nSpirit-awareness is originally yang,\nYet outwardly bright and inwardly dark,\nEver inviting guest qi.\nLike the sun dwelling in the Li position,\nOutwardly yang and inwardly yin,\nIt inverts to become the woman.\nTrue awareness is originally yin,\nYet outwardly dark and inwardly bright,\nPossessing the upright qi.\nLike Kan matched with the Toad Palace,\nOutwardly yin and inwardly yang,\nIt becomes the man instead.\nThe postnatal human mind,\nBorrowing spirit to generate delusion,\nBuries the celestial authenticity of the Dao-mind—\nJust as the woman takes charge of the household,\nAnd the man retreats from his position.\nThe way of elixir refinement\nIs to use the true awareness of the Dao-mind\nTo govern the spirit-awareness of the human mind,\nAnd to have the spirit-awareness of the human mind\nComply with the true awareness of the Dao-mind.\nThe man is firm, the woman is yielding;\nThe man presides, the woman obeys—\nIn great work, there is none that does not succeed.\nIf one does not grasp this inversion of meaning within,\nIt is to fail to recognize the true awareness of the Dao-mind,\nTo fail to recognize the spirit-awareness of the human mind.\nAll is chaos and confusion,\nAll takes the false for the true.\nDo not presume to discourse loftily with narrow insight,\nThereby deceiving both self and others.\n\n**XVI**\n\nExtract the solid core within Kan’s heart,\nAnd transmute the yin within Li’s belly.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nWhere concealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.\n\nAll at the heart’s command (in one version, \"all under the heart’s command\"; in another, \"ever at the heart’s command\")—\nThe solid core within Kan’s heart\nIs the true awareness of the Dao-mind.\nThe yin within Li’s belly\nIs the spirit-awareness of the human mind.\nExtract the true awareness of the Dao-mind from Kan’s depths,\nAnd transmute the spirit-awareness of the human mind within Li’s palace.\nIn a single instant,\nYin qi dissipates and yang qi returns,\nRestoring the original face of Qian’s primal origin,\nReturning to me the original nature of innate knowledge and ability.\nStill and unmoving, it responds and thus communicates;\nResponding and thus communicating, it remains still and unmoving.\nThus it is said: from this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nWhere concealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.\nThis body is not the illusory form of the physical frame,\nBut the true body of the Dharma-body.\nThe Dharma-body is the original nature.\nAt the beginning of human life,\nA single spark of true numinous nature,\nRound and luminous, unwavering,\nFirm and strong, upright and balanced,\nPure and without the slightest impurity—\nLike the Qian hexagram’s three yang lines,\nA symbol of pure yang without yin.\nUpon entering the postnatal realm,\nHeavenly integrity becomes obscured,\nNuminous qi becomes false—\nLike Qian’s central void becoming Li,\nAnd Kun’s central solidity becoming Kan.\nThe central void means the true has departed;\nThe central solidity means the true has sunk into Kan.\nTo \"extract Kan and fill Li\"\nIs to return to celestial authenticity,\nRestoring the original true numinous nature of that year,\nAs if sealing Li and reverting to the Qian hexagram.\nOnce the true numen is restored,\nMastery is in hand,\nConstantly responsive, constantly pure.\nLeft or right, all is fitting—\nConcealment and soaring,\nHow could they not be entirely at the heart’s command?\nLater generations,\nNot comprehending this principle,\nTake \"extracting Kan and filling Li\"\nTo mean drawing qi from the kidneys to merge with the heart.\nOthers speak of ascending the kidney qi,\nThen descending it to settle in the Crimson Palace.\nAlas! There is something strange indeed—\nHeart and kidneys were never Kan and Li.\nTo take Kan and Li as heart and kidneys\nIs the height of folly.\n\n**On the Five Phases:**\n\n**XVII**\n\nThe thunder dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland,\nThe marsh tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction.\nThese two things are all because the child gives birth to the mother,\nThe five phases must all enter the center.\n\nEmerges from (in one version, \"emerges from within\")—\nZhen is the dragon, the wood-mercury;\nDui is the tiger, the metal-lead.\nLi is fire, Kan is water.\nThe dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland—\nWood emerges from fire.\nThe tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction—\nMetal is born from water.\nThe root born from fire\nBecomes everlasting, indestructible wood;\nThe metal born from water\nBecomes everlasting, incorruptible metal.\nWood originally gives birth to fire,\nYet fire in turn gives birth to wood.\nMetal originally gives birth to water,\nYet water in turn gives birth to metal—\nThis is called \"the child giving birth to the mother.\"\nThe ancient classics say:\n\"The five phases do not proceed in order;\nThe dragon emerges from within fire.\nThe five phases move in inversion;\nThe tiger is born from within water.\"\nThis is precisely the meaning.\nHuman qi and temperament are easily stirred,\nLike the floating nature of wood-mercury.\nIf refined with the fire of original spirit,\nDross is burned away,\nQi-nature is transformed and true nature appears,\nBecoming an eternally unchanging nature.\nHuman delusive passions are profoundly heavy,\nLike the sinking nature of metal-lead.\nIf washed clean of dust and grime with the water of essence-oneness,\nDelusive passions dissipate and true passions congeal,\nBecoming an eternally passionless state.\nNot only this—\nWhen temperament is transformed, there is no nature-fire;\nWhen the consciousness of the acquired mind is extinguished, original spirit is ever-born.\nWhen desires dissipate, there are no lustful thoughts;\nTurbid essence is transformed, and original essence is without leakage.\nTrue nature appears, true passions congeal,\nOriginal spirit is born, original essence is secured.\nNature, passions, spirit, and essence\nReturn to a single qi.\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom\nReturn to a single trust.\nThis is called \"the five phases complete.\"\nWhen the five phases are complete,\nThey merge into a single center—\nThis is called \"the five phases enter the center.\"\nThe five phases enter the center,\nNeither inclined nor biased,\nYin and yang unite—\nThis is called \"the golden elixir coagulates.\"\nIf one loses the east, neglects the west,\nAbandons the south, or forgets the north,\nSeeking other ingredients,\nThen refining the golden elixir will be difficult.\nThe crucial point in the verse\nIs the line: \"The five phases must all enter the center.\"\nIf the five phases do not enter the center,\nThe five phases scatter, and the golden elixir does not coagulate.\nIf the five phases enter the center,\nThe five phases become one qi, and the golden elixir forms of itself.\nHow can scholars not first clarify the five phases?\n\n**On the Two Bowstrings:**\n\n**XVIII**\n\nWhen the moon first shows half its wheel bright in the sky,\nThe dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar arise early.\nThis is the time to refine the two eights—\nWithin a single double-hour, the elixir is assured.\n\nThe golden elixir is the dragon’s nature and the tiger’s essence,\nFormed by the union of the two bowstrings’ qi.\nFirst take eight ounces of metal from the upper bowstring\nTo serve as the elixir’s mother;\nThen take half a catty of wood from the lower bowstring\nTo coalesce the sacred embryo.\n\nWhat are the two bowstrings?\nFrom the third day of the lunar month, when the first yang arises,\nTo the eighth day, when yang reaches half within yin—\nIts levelness like a taut string, resembling a drawn bow—\nThis is called the *upper bowstring*, for its yang light is above.\nOn the fifteenth day, the moon is full;\nBy the sixteenth, the first yin is conceived;\nOn the eighteenth, the first yin appears;\nBy the twenty-third, yin reaches half within yang—\nIts levelness like a taut string, resembling a drawn bow—\nThis is called the *lower bowstring*, for its yang light is below.\n\nThe moon’s yang light, born from the west, is the tiger,\nBelonging to metal, which resides in the west—\nThus the moon on the eighth day is called the tiger’s bowstring qi.\nThe moon’s yin body, emerging from the east, is the dragon,\nBelonging to water, while wood resides in the east—\nThus the moon on the twenty-third day is called the dragon’s bowstring qi.\n\nTrue knowing is of firm essence, like the tiger,\nResembling the moon’s yang light;\nSpiritual knowing is of yielding nature, like the dragon,\nResembling the moon’s yin body.\nWhen true knowing’s firm essence advances to central equilibrium,\nIt is like the yang light emerging at the upper bowstring—\nEight ounces of metal.\nWhen spiritual knowing’s yielding nature retreats to central equilibrium,\nIt is like the yin body receding at the lower bowstring—\nEight ounces of wood.\n\nWhen the moon first shows half its wheel bright in the sky,\nIt is precisely when true knowing’s firm essence advances to central equilibrium.\nAs true knowing advances to central equilibrium, yielding contains firmness,\nAnd spiritual knowing, restrained by true knowing, can no longer soar unchecked.\nYang governs yin, and yin submits to yang—\nThus the dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar respond in unison,\nSeeking one another as like attracts like.\nAt this moment, it is most fitting to devote effort to cultivation,\nBorrowing yang to aid yin,\nGuiding spiritual knowing’s yielding nature to return to central equilibrium.\nWhen spiritual knowing returns to central equilibrium, firmness contains yielding,\nAnd both true knowing and spiritual knowing attain central equilibrium.\nThe qi of the two eights’ bowstrings is now complete in measure,\nYin and yang in balance,\nFirmness and yielding as one—\nWithin a single double-hour, the elixir is assured.\n\nYet if the two eights’ measure is not complete—\nWhether yang is in excess and yin deficient,\nOr yang deficient and yin in excess—\nThe elixir cannot form.\nOnly when yin and yang are in perfect balance,\nNeither inclined nor biased—this is called *the center*—\nCan the elixir be assured within a single double-hour.\nHow easily is this hour’s work accomplished?\nWithout decades of unrelenting effort,\nOne cannot suddenly reach this realm.\n\nOn Harmonization:\n\nNineteen\nThe male tiger roars on Huayue’s rocky peaks,\nThe female dragon hums in Fusang’s sea-deep lair.\nThe Yellow Matron herself knows how to matchmake,\nSending them as husband and wife with a single heart.\n\nHuayue lies in the west, Fusang in the east.\nThe tiger embodies the metal disposition,\nThe dragon the wood nature.\nAt the dawn of life, their natures were originally united.\nMetal and wood conjoined—\nYet once they enter the postnatal realm,\nThe false arrives and the true is obscured,\nNature and disposition split asunder,\nLike the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west.\n\nThe tiger is called male for its metal disposition’s firmness,\nThe dragon female for its wood nature’s yielding.\nThough true disposition is sundered by the false,\nAnd true nature veiled by the false abode,\nTrue disposition and true nature never cease longing to unite.\nThe male tiger roars on the mountain’s crest,\nThe female dragon hums in the sea’s depths—\nA sign of yin and yang’s hidden communion despite obstruction.\nObstructed yet secretly communicating,\nThey could meet,\nBut lack the harmonizing agent,\nAnd so cannot unite.\n\nThe Yellow Matron—\nAlso called true earth,\nAlso called true intent,\nAlso called its trust.\nWhen true trust appears,\nIntent becomes sincere and the heart upright,\nThe false departs and the true returns.\nDisposition returns to nature,\nAnd in an instant, nature and disposition unite,\nAs a matchmaker conveys messages between two households,\nSending them as husband and wife with a single heart.\n\nTwenty\nThe red dragon and black tiger, each to west and east,\nThe four images intersect at wu-ji’s center.\n\nFrom here, *Fu* and *Gou* can be set in motion—\nWho would say the golden elixir cannot be achieved?\n\nWood can generate fire, fire and wood are one family—\nThus called the red dragon.\nMetal can generate water, metal and water are one family—\nThus called the black tiger.\nMetal, wood, water, and fire form the four images;\n*Wu* and *ji* are earth.\nEarth can harmonize the four images,\nAnd the four images, joined with earth, become the five phases.\nYet when the five phases flow in sequence,\nThey are the fiery pit of the dharma-realm;\nWhen the five phases are inverted,\nThey become the seven treasures of the great earth—\nAll depends on how one applies them.\n\nWhen the feeling of the Dao-heart’s true knowing stirs,\nThis is called *Fu*—the method then is to advance the yang fire to forge the elixir.\nWhen the nature of the human heart’s numinous knowing is still,\nThis is called *Gou*—the method then is to withdraw the yin tally to nurture warmth.\nWhen it is time to employ yang, employ yang;\nWhen it is time to employ yin, employ yin.\nYang is firm, yin is yielding—\nUse nine, use six,\nEach following its season.\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing,\nTwo yet one,\nEnter the center.\nThe five phases gather,\nThe golden elixir is accomplished—\nNaturally, of itself.\n\nSpeaking of dragon and tiger:\nTwenty-One\n\nThe White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly,\nThe Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and force them into mortal combat—\nThey transform into a lump of purple-golden frost.\n\n(In one version: *two beasts*)\nThe true knowing of feeling and the numinous knowing of nature,\nThough originally of the primordial,\nOnce fallen into the later heaven,\nAre intermingled with principle and desire,\nBlending the real and the false.\nLong separated, they cannot suddenly be tamed and brought to face one another—\nThus it is said: *The White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly,\nThe Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.*\n\nYet the Dao of the golden elixir possesses the method of\n*Borrowing the false to cultivate the real,\nUsing the real to transform the false.*\nFollow their desires step by step,\nGradually guiding them.\nApply unrelenting effort—\nWhat was not united must unite,\nWhat was not harmonized must harmonize.\nThe longer the work, the greater the force:\nDeluded feelings naturally depart,\nTrue feelings naturally arise;\nQi and temperament naturally dissolve,\nTrue feelings naturally manifest.\nThe false is forever extinguished,\nThe real abides eternally.\nFeeling without feeling—this is true feeling;\nNature without nature—this is true nature.\nTrue feeling and true nature,\nTwo yet one,\nThe heart dies, the spirit lives,\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nFollowing the emperor’s rule—\nThey transform into a lump of purple-golden frost.\n\nGold is the unyielding, indestructible substance.\nWhen gold becomes purple,\nIt emerges from the great furnace,\nRefined to full purity.\nPurple gold transformed into frost—\nForm and substance both vanish,\nMerged into a single qi,\nTranscending yin and yang.\n\nSpeaking of refining the self, three verses:\nTwenty-Two\n\nFirst observe the heavens to discern the Five Thieves,\nThen examine the earth to pacify the people.\nOnly when the people are at peace and the nation prosperous may war be waged;\nOnly after war’s end may the sage be revealed.\n\nTo observe the heavens is to observe one’s own celestial nature;\nTo discern the Five Thieves is to understand the mutual conquest of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.\nTo examine the earth is to examine the ground of one’s own heart-mind;\nTo pacify the people is to settle the spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intention, each in its proper place.\n\nIn the Dao of refining the elixir, nothing precedes the refinement of the self;\nThe essence of refining the self begins with observing celestial nature.\nWhen celestial nature is unobscured, the Five Thieves cannot deceive.\nNext, examine the ground of the heart-mind;\nWhen the heart-mind is pure and still, the Five Agents are all at peace.\nWhen the Five Agents are at peace, essence is firm and spirit whole, the ethereal soul stabilized and the corporeal soul serene.\nSincerity of intention is called national prosperity—\nThereupon, wage war against the Five Thieves and repel the host of yin.\nYin qi transforms into yang qi,\nThe mechanism of death shifts to the mechanism of life—\nOnly then may the sage be seen.\n\nThe sage is the original face of innate knowing and innate ability,\nAlso called the sacred embryo.\nWhen the Five Thieves are subdued, they transform into the Five Primes,\nManifesting as the Five Powers.\nAbiding in quiescence, yet responsive to all things—\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nFollowing the emperor’s rule—\nIs this not the sacred embryo?\n\nThe character for \"war\" in the verse carries profound meaning:\nThe Five Thieves dwell in the heart and act upon heaven.\nWithout the great dharmic power to contend with heaven, they cannot be subdued.\nWar is precisely the means to rouse great function, unleash great mechanism,\nAdvance with valor and vigor,\nGrowing ever stronger with time—\nNever allowing retreat halfway.\n\nAn ancient immortal said:\n*\"A single thread of yang qi unexhausted, one does not die;\nA single thread of yin qi unexhausted, one does not ascend as an immortal.\"*\nRefinement of the self must continue until not a trace of yin qi remains,\nThe Five Phases merge and transform,\nThe ore is spent and the gold pure—\nOnly then is it complete.\n\nTwenty-Three\nTo employ generals, first divide the left and right armies;\nLet them take the lead while I remain the guest.\n\nAdvise you, when facing battle, not to underestimate the foe—\nLest you lose our priceless treasure of the house.\nThe Dao of refining the self cannot succeed all at once;\nOne must follow its desires and guide it step by step.\nFor the true numinous aperture has been sealed for so long,\nDeep-rooted habits have settled in,\nThe Five Thieves wreak havoc—\nNot a matter of a single morning or evening, most difficult to eradicate.\n\nTo employ generals, first divide the left and right armies,\nLet them take the lead while I remain the guest—\nThis means: to take, one must first give.\nAdvise you, when facing battle, not to underestimate the foe—\nLest you lose what is yours while seeking from others.\nWithin, guard against danger and contemplate peril;\nWithout, diligently temper and refine.\nThen the false may be cast off, the true preserved—\nWhat worry then that the great Dao will not be achieved?\n\nTwenty-Four\nFire is born of wood, its edge concealed within—\nWithout knowing how to drill and refine, do not force the attack.\nDisaster arises from this, harming the self;\nOne must subdue it to seek the Metal Elder.\n\nSince the postnatal takes charge,\nThe consciousness-spirit holds power.\nThe postnatal qi of the Five Phases within the body,\nThe afflictions of root and dust carried through kalpas,\nAnd present defilements of habit—\nAll erupt at once.\nWithout great dharmic power, without great skill,\nHow can they all be subdued?\nIf one does not know the true principle of drilling and refining,\nBut rashly takes action,\nUsing mind to restrain mind,\nAttacking too fiercely—\nAt times, sovereign fire and ministerial fire both flare,\nNot only failing to subdue the thief,\nBut instead being overpowered by it.\nNot only is there no benefit, but harm is done.\nAs fire is born of wood, disaster erupts and overcomes;\nWood is instead consumed by fire, wounding its own life.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The flowing pearl of Great Yang ever seeks to leave man,\nBut once it obtains Metal’s radiance, it turns and follows it.\"*\nMetal’s radiance is the Dao-mind.\nThe Dao-mind is not the mind of the heart,\nBut arises from the celestial true body,\nPossessing the emotion of true knowing,\nAnd the qi of upright strength—\nNo thing can deceive it.\nWhen the luminous brilliance of the Dao-mind appears,\nAll evil retreats.\nIts resolute decisiveness and firm judgment\nAre as sharp as metal.\nThus, the Dao-mind is named the Metal Elder.\nTo drill and refine the true principle\nIs to drill and refine the true principle of using metal to restrain wood.\n\nFor in the great elixir, the Metal Elder is the master.\nIf one abandons the Metal Elder to refine the self,\nDisaster is merely courted.\nThus, Zhang Sanfeng said:\n*\"When refining the self, one must use true lead.\"*\nTrue lead and the Metal Elder\nAre both alternate names for the Dao-mind.\n\nOn the Metal Elder:\nTwenty-Five\n\nThe Metal Elder is originally the son of the eastern household,\nSent to dwell in the western neighbor to be nurtured in borrowed form.\nOnce recognized and called home to be reared,\nHe is matched with the maiden of the house to forge marital bonds.\n*(Alternate versions: \"summoned home\"; \"to form marital bonds\")*\n\nThe Metal Elder is none other than the true knowing of the Dao-mind spoken of before.\nTrue knowing is true emotion.\nIn human life, nature and emotion are originally one family, undivided,\nSpoken of as nature when referring to essence,\nAnd as emotion when referring to function.\nEmotion is nature; nature is emotion—\nSame origin, different names, not two distinct things.\nAfter entering the postnatal realm, nature and emotion shift and change,\nTrue emotion dims while false emotion arises.\nThe qi of upright strength is obscured by guest qi,\nNo longer issuing from the self.\nLike the son of the eastern household,\nNow dwelling as a guest in the western neighbor.\nYet though he dwells in the western neighbor,\nHe is not forever beyond our sight—\nWe merely fail to recognize him when we see him.\nIf one is a person of true resolve, penetrating principle to its depths,\nAnd recognizes the real when he sees it,\nA single call brings him home,\nLike an echo in an empty valley—effortless.\nFurther, if one can nurture him in the inner chamber,\nConstantly guarding and sustaining him,\nAnd match him with the true nature of the Maiden,\nSo that yin and yang become one qi,\nAnd marital bonds are formed,\nHe is once more the possession of the eastern household.\n\nThe Maiden is the maiden within the house,\nThe nature of numinous knowing.\nNature is fundamentally yang, yet called \"maiden\"\nBecause nature governs softness, resembling wood—hence the Maiden.\nEmotion is fundamentally yin, yet called \"elder\"\nBecause emotion governs firmness, resembling metal—hence the Metal Elder.\nThe Metal Elder, long gone abroad,\nOne day returns home\nAnd meets the Maiden—\nTheir bond is exceptionally intimate,\nAnd the elixir cannot but be born.\nThus the *Cantong qi* says:\n*\"When metal returns to its original nature,\nOnly then is it called the Returned Elixir.\"*\nMetal and wood conjoined, emotion and nature united—\nThis is the Returned Elixir,\nAnd there is no other Returned Elixir beyond this.\n\nOn the Maiden:\nTwenty-Six\n\nThe Maiden roams with a method all her own—\nHer forward path must be short, her return path long.\nWhen she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nAnd weds the Metal Elder as her old lord.\n\nThe Maiden is the numinous knowing of nature, as explained in the previous verse. Once she enters the postnatal realm, the mind of man harbors the consciousness-spirit, and the true inevitably mingles with the false. From the numinous arises delusion, and at the sight of fire she takes flight, wandering without constancy—this is what is meant by “coming and going without fixed time, no one knowing her homeland.”\n\nTo refine the Golden Elixir, one must first guide this single spark of numinous nature to roam in the directions it ought to go. Empty its numinosity without obscuring its numinosity, and the numinous will return to true numinosity. The forward path must be short: this is using nature to seek emotion. The return path must be long: this is using the numinous to nurture the true. Using nature to seek emotion is the marvel of forming the elixir in an instant—hence it is called short. Using the numinous to nurture the true is the work of ten months’ gentle cultivation—hence it is called long. Where it should be short, be short; where it should be long, be long—this is what is meant by “having a method all her own.” Follow this method in practice, and the Golden Elixir may be attained.\n\nBut first, one must dismiss cunning and destroy cleverness, turning the light around to reflect inward. Place this single spark of numinous nature in the central, correct position—this is what is meant by “coming back to enter the Yellow Dame’s abode.” The Yellow Dame’s abode is the dwelling of impartiality and centrality, neither leaning nor biased. When numinous nature is centered and correct, the heart is upright and the intent sincere; when the intent is sincere, trust in the true arises, and one no longer roams outside. Thus, using nature to seek emotion, emotion returns to nature, and nature and emotion yearn for each other, merging into a single qi—this is what is meant by “wedding the Metal Elder as her old lord.”\n\n“Old lord” is no ordinary phrase—it carries profound meaning. In the Dao of elixir refinement, one first uses numinous nature to summon true emotion. When true emotion returns, numinous nature remains unshaken, and numinous nature itself naturally returns to the true. Then, one must use numinous nature to restrain true emotion, nurturing true emotion in a realm of pure yang without yin until the end. Like an old husband and an old wife, they grow old together, never allowing discord or a broken mirror along the way. This is precisely the meaning of “the return path must be long.” Scholars must delve deeply into this.\n\nOn Fire Times, Two Poems:\n\nTwenty-Seven\nThough you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.\nThe whole depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.\n\nThe Dao of the Returned Elixir relies solely on taking two medicinal substances, cinnabar and black lead, and forging them into a treasure to extend life and nature. Cinnabar is the single spark of empty numinous qi within *li*, that is, numinous knowing, belonging to the human heart. Black lead is the single spark of firm and upright qi within *kan*, that is, true knowing, belonging to the Dao-heart. Because the human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly bright and inwardly dark, brightness pertains to fire, and fire is red—hence it is symbolized as cinnabar. Because the Dao-heart’s true knowing is outwardly dark and inwardly bright, darkness pertains to water, and water is black—hence it is symbolized as black lead. These are the cinnabar and lead without form or image, not the cinnabar and lead of the mundane world with form and image.\n\nOnce you recognize the cinnabar and lead of true knowing and numinous knowing, you can gather them at will without difficulty. However, gathering them requires forging them. If you know the medicine but not the method of forging it, it is no different from not knowing at all. Thus it is said: *Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.* The Golden Elixir relies entirely on the fire times of cultivation to be accomplished. “Fire” is the power of cultivation, and “times” are the sequence of cultivation. When gathering the medicine, one must know its maturity; when forging the medicine, one must know the seasons. There are the fire times of gentle refinement, the fire times of fierce forging, the fire of initial application, the fire times of cessation and rest, the fire times of advancing yang, the fire times of retreating yin, the fire times of the Returned Elixir, the fire times of the Great Elixir, the fire times of increase and decrease, and the fire times of gentle nurturing. With so many fire times, one must achieve great awakening, knowing the beginning and the end, to succeed. If one errs by a hair’s breadth, the mistake spans a thousand miles, and forming the elixir becomes difficult.\n\nTwenty-Eight\nThe契论 and scriptural songs expound the utmost truth,\nYet they do not set the fire times down in writing.\nTo know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysterious,\nYou must discuss them carefully with an immortal.\n\nSince ancient times, the true immortals’ *契论* and scriptural songs have spoken of the medicine and fire times of cultivating the true in the most detailed and precise way, utterly genuine and without falsehood. Though they discuss them, the discussion does not reach the core; though they speak of them, the words do not exhaust the meaning. How could they not set the fire times down in writing? But the *契论* and scriptural songs are profoundly abstruse: sometimes they speak of nature, sometimes of life; sometimes of medicine, sometimes of fire; sometimes of the fire times of cultivating life, sometimes of the fire times of cultivating nature; sometimes of external fire times, sometimes of internal fire times. They do speak of fire times, but their words are scattered and disordered. Without encountering an enlightened teacher to organize the net and grasp the outline, to fold the clothes and lift the collar, one cannot understand.\n\nThus it is said: *they do not set the fire times down in writing.* And again: *You must discuss them carefully with an immortal.* This teaches one to study the *契论* and scriptural songs while also seeking an enlightened teacher for verification. One must not set aside the *契论* and scriptural songs to rely solely on a teacher, nor should one take the *契论* and scriptural songs as self-realization and neglect seeking a teacher. If the *契论* and scriptural songs contained no fire times, how could they be said to *expound the utmost truth*?\n\nGenerally speaking, the student must both read the *契论* and scriptural songs and seek an enlightened teacher. Reading the *契论* and scriptural songs allows one to distinguish the true from the false, the orthodox from the heterodox, and to broaden one’s understanding, so that when seeking an enlightened teacher, one can verify the principles one has discerned. Self-study and seeking a teacher are both indispensable.\n\nOn Gathering the Medicine and Fire Times:\n\nTwenty-Nine\n\nOn the Fifteenth Night of the Eighth Month, one delights in the toad’s radiance—\nthis is precisely when the Metal essence is in its fullest vigor.\nWhen the first Yang stirs, one must hasten to advance the fire without delay.\n\n*(An alternate version reads: \"When the first Yang begins to rise.\")*\n\nAt the Mid-Autumn Moon, the Metal essence is at its peak,\nand the Dao reaches its most steadfast, upright, and balanced state—\nthe original nature, perfectly luminous.\nThis luminous achievement depends entirely on the mind of the Dao.\n\nWhere the first Yang stirs is the moment when the single spark of true knowing—\nthe Yang light of the Dao-mind—just begins to move, yet has not fully awakened,\nand the Celestial Root reveals its first signs.\nAt this critical juncture, one must swiftly apply the fire,\ngathering it into the furnace of creation,\ngradually refining it from subtlety to clarity.\nFrom the first Yang, it must progress to the fullness of six Yangs,\njust as the Mid-Autumn Moon shines with extraordinary brilliance,\nilluminating the entire cosmos.\n\nThe phrase *\"without delay\"* is crucial,\nfor the light of true knowing in the Dao-mind is hard to attain yet easily lost.\nIf one hesitates even slightly, the luminous qi disperses,\nand the opportunity is missed before one’s very eyes.\n\nOn Withdrawing and Adding Fire Times:\nThirty\n\nWhen the first Yang stirs to form the elixir,\nthe lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the inner curtains.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily attained—\nyet in applying withdrawal and addition, one must guard against peril.\n\nThis verse follows closely upon the previous one.\nAs the first Yang stirs, gather it into the cauldron:\nthe heart settled, qi harmonized, emptiness giving birth to clarity,\nradiance gathering within, darkness yielding to light—\nas though illuminating the inner curtains.\n\nMaster Cui said: *\"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against its turning inauspicious.\"*\nFor the first Yang’s return comes easily,\nbut its fullness is most difficult to achieve.\nOne must be vigilant against danger, ever mindful of risk,\napplying the work of withdrawal and addition\nto ensure success.\n\nTo withdraw is to reduce the excess of the human mind’s clever knowing;\nto add is to augment the insufficiency of the Dao-mind’s true knowing.\nWithdraw again and again, add again and again,\nuntil there is no more to withdraw or add—\nthe human mind no longer arises,\nthe Dao-mind abides constantly,\ntrue knowing and numinous knowing unite,\ninner and outer shine with light—\nonly then is there no fear of midnight storms.\n\nAt this time, the Dao-mind has just returned,\nYang qi is faint, Yin qi still flourishing.\nWithout the work of withdrawal and addition,\neven a moment’s slackness may lose what was gained.\nThus the work of withdrawal and addition is precious,\nfor it is itself the work of guarding against peril—\nthere is no guarding against peril apart from withdrawal and addition.\nPeril lies within withdrawal and addition,\nthe two being one and the same.\nThe scholar must keep this firmly in view.\n\nOn Nurturing with Fire Times:\nThirty-one\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl takes form as Yang arises,\nat Yang’s apex Yin recedes, its shape gradually stripped away.\nBy the tenth month, frost descends and the elixir ripens—\neven spirits and ghosts must tremble at this time.\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl is the Pearl of Supreme Yang,\na thing of perfect clarity and unobscured luminosity,\nanother name for the Golden Elixir,\nthe original nature of innate knowing and innate ability,\nthat fundamental nature which, though quiescent and unmoving,\nresponds and penetrates when stimulated—\na likeness to the Mysterious Pearl.\nThis Pearl is the single point of unyielding true knowing in the Dao-mind,\nformed through the accumulation of rightness,\never generating, generating again,\nuntil its vast qi fills all space,\nits radiance full and complete—\nthis is the apex of Yang.\nAt Yang’s apex, Yin must be brought to meet it.\nYin strips away its form, nurturing Yang with Yin,\ntransforming the dryness of Yang’s rigidity.\nThis gradual stripping requires the work of ten months.\nThrough ten months of nurturing with fire times,\nthe ore is exhausted and the gold refined,\ntransmuted into numinous frost—\ntrue emptiness containing wondrous being,\nwondrous being concealing true emptiness,\nunaware and unknowing,\naccordant with the Emperor’s principle.\nLike frost drifting in empty space,\nbeyond the semblance of being or non-being—\nonly then does the elixir ripen.\nAt this stage, the workings of creation cannot constrain it,\nthe myriad things cannot sway it;\nits merit perfected among humans,\nits name recorded in heaven—\nhow could spirits and ghosts not tremble?\n\nOn the firing times for embryo formation:\n\nBetween the waxing crescent’s end and waning crescent’s start,\nthe medicinal flavor is balanced, its qi-phase complete.\nGathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,\nrefined through gentle nurturing, naturally simmered and steamed.\n\nThe waxing crescent is Yang within Yin, true knowing returning to central equilibrium;\nthe waning crescent is Yin within Yang, numinous knowing returning to central equilibrium.\nWhen true knowing and numinous knowing both return to central equilibrium,\nhard and soft are matched—\nthis matching point is called *between the waxing crescent’s end and waning crescent’s start*.\nAt this moment, true knowing and numinous knowing,\nneither excessive nor deficient, are both fully present.\nFrom within arises a primordial, singular sprout of numinous growth—\nthe medicinal flavor is balanced, Yin and Yang harmonized.\nSwiftly gather and take it,\nenclose it within the furnace of creation,\nforge and refine it into truth,\nand bind it as the sacred embryo.\nAt this stage, the medicine is the fire, the fire is the medicine;\nthrough ten months of gentle nurturing,\na natural, true fire will simmer and steam it,\nevolving from the subtle to the manifest,\ngiving formless form.\n\nOn Yin and Yang returning to the center:\n\nThe eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the West,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.\nShould the Azure Maiden meet thereafter,\nAll at once the lock and key rest in the Yellow House.\n\nThe eldest son is *Zhen*.\nThe wine of the West is Metal-Water.\nOn the third day of the lunar month, the crescent appears in the *geng* direction,\nbeneath the utmost Yin, a single Yang descends and arises—\nin the hexagram, this is *Zhen*, hence \"the eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the West.\"\n\nThe youngest daughter is *Dui*.\nThe flower of the North is the golden blossom born within Water.\nAs the moon’s radiance emerges, from *Dui* to *Kun*,\nYang appears within Yin—\nhence \"the youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.\"\nBoth lines describe the image of a single Yang arising.\n\n\"Suddenly drinks\" means he has never drunk before, yet now drinks unexpectedly.\n\"First blooms\" means it has never bloomed before, yet now blooms for the first time.\n\"Suddenly drinks\" and \"first blooms\" both convey the intent that the mind of the Dao and true knowing are easily lost yet difficult to find.\nFor the mind of the Dao has long lain buried, true knowing obscured,\nuntil in the midst of utmost stillness, it suddenly appears—\nlike one who suddenly drinks wine or a flower that first blooms.\nThis is the turning point of return,\na rare and precious encounter that must not be missed.\nOne must seize the moment to gather it,\nunite it with numinous knowing,\nand seal it within the central chamber of the Yellow Court.\nWhen husband and wife meet, the elixir naturally forms.\n\nNuminous knowing is nature, Yin within Yang,\nbelonging to Wood—Wood’s color is azure,\nhence numinous knowing is symbolized as the Azure Maiden.\nWhen true knowing and numinous knowing meet,\nof one heart and one qi,\nthey naturally return to the center.\nYet though they return, if one does not know how to lock and seal,\nthere is the risk of union followed by separation.\nHaving locked, one must also seal,\ntightly closing the gates and doors,\nso that what was not united must unite,\nand what has united remains so.\n\nThis is what Zhang Sanfeng meant by:\n*\"The maiden from the eastern house, the lad from the western lodge,\njoined as husband and wife and enter the bridal chamber;\nthe Yellow Dame urges them to drink the purest nectar,\nand in a single day, they lift the veil and become drunk.\"*\n\nThe words \"lock\" and \"seal\" serve to guard against danger and forestall risk.\nFor when Yin and Yang first meet, their natures and dispositions are not yet pure and unified.\nOne must neither forget nor force,\nmaintaining strict vigilance—\nonly then can there be no leakage or loss,\nand the golden elixir will congeal from emptiness.\n\nThis is a celestial mechanism, unknown without a teacher.\n\nOn bathing:\n\nAt thirty-four: the months of the Hare and the Rooster and their appointed times—when Punishment and Virtue arrive at the gate, they mirror the medicine’s image. Here the golden elixir should be bathed; if fire is still applied, ruin and peril will surely follow.\n\nThe month of the Hare at the Spring Equinox: yang qi ascends at the center of Heaven and Earth. The month of the Rooster at the Autumn Equinox: yin qi ascends at the center of Heaven and Earth. The Spring Equinox pertains to Wood, the qi of generation, and is Virtue; the Autumn Equinox pertains to Metal, the qi of killing, and is Punishment. Virtue gives life to things, Punishment brings them to completion. Without Punishment, Virtue cannot be fulfilled; without Virtue, Punishment cannot be perfected. With both Punishment and Virtue, the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth flows as a single qi, circulating without end.\n\nThe cultivator of the Dao tempers true knowing’s hardness to return to central equilibrium, like the Autumn Equinox; softens numinous knowing’s pliancy to return to central equilibrium, like the Spring Equinox. When true knowing and numinous knowing both return to central equilibrium, they resemble the Virtue of the Spring Equinox and the Punishment of the Autumn Equinox. The firmness of true knowing restrains the perverse qi of the human heart; the compliance of numinous knowing nurtures the upright qi of the Dao-heart. When hardness is fitting, be hard; when softness is fitting, be soft—without missing the proper time, then hardness and softness attain central equilibrium, like the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, each in its season. Thus it is said: the months of the Hare and the Rooster and their appointed times.\n\nWithin hardness there is softness, within softness there is hardness; when hardness and softness become as one, true and numinous knowing do not scatter, like the alternating operation of Spring’s Virtue and Autumn’s Punishment. Hence it is said: when Punishment and Virtue arrive at the gate, they mirror the medicine’s image. When the Dao reaches the central equilibrium of hardness and softness, the Dao-heart abides constantly, the human heart attains perfect stillness; true knowing becomes utterly numinous, numinous knowing becomes utterly true. When true and numinous knowing unite as one, innate knowing and innate capacity arise, and the golden elixir takes form. It may then be bathed and gently nurtured, the fire withdrawn from beneath the cauldron. Otherwise, if one does not know when to stop or be content, and continues to apply fire for refinement, hardness will be excessive, softness insufficient—hardness and softness will fail to attain central equilibrium. The medicine will wither, the elixir will be harmed; how can ruin and peril be avoided?\n\nOn civil refinement and martial tempering: thirty-five.\n\nThe sun and moon meet once every thirty days, their timely exchange a method of divine efficacy. In holding the city or waging wild battle, one knows fortune and misfortune, and the numinous cinnabar fills the crucible red.\n\nThe moon itself has no light but borrows the sun’s radiance. In a year, it meets the sun twelve times; in a month, thirty days; between the last and first days, one meeting occurs. When a person’s true knowing lies buried, pure yin without yang, it is like the moon without light—it must borrow numinous knowing to generate illumination. When numinous knowing and true knowing meet, it is like the sun and moon converging after thirty days.\n\nThe perfected emulate the image of their meeting, condensing thirty days into a single day, and that day into a single hour. In that hour, they rouse the firm qi, borrowing the human heart to generate the Dao-heart, using the Dao-heart to govern the human heart; relying on numinous knowing to produce true knowing, and using true knowing to dismiss numinous knowing. They gather the primordial qi of the undivided Hongmeng as the mother of the elixir, aligning with the divine mechanism of yin-yang transformation as the fire-timing.\n\nThis Dao involves both civil refinement and martial tempering. Holding the city is civil refinement; waging wild battle is martial tempering. When civil is called for, be civil; when martial is called for, be martial—this is fortune. When civil is needed but martial is used, or martial is needed but civil is used—this is misfortune.\n\nCivil fire is the turning of light back to illuminate, dismissing cleverness and destroying cunning, concentrating the mind to nurture the upright qi, like holding a city. Martial fire is restraining anger and blocking desire, eliminating delusion and preserving sincerity, fiercely expelling guest qi, like waging wild battle. Knowing the proper use of civil and martial, discerning fortune and misfortune, one employs martial fire when there is action and civil fire when there is none.\n\nThrough civil fire and martial tempering, yin qi is exhausted and yang qi purified; true knowing and numinous knowing unite, transforming into innate knowing and innate capacity, the wondrous awakening of original nature. Round and luminous, bright and resplendent, pure and bare, unadorned and free—still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating. Responsive and penetrating, yet still and unmoving, utterly imbued with heavenly principle, utterly devoid of human desire. It is like the numinous cinnabar filling the crucible red.\n\nWhen cinnabar reaches its numinous state, its material form is entirely transformed—neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being—purely the qi of clear yang. Ingesting it dispels illness and extends years, averts calamity and avoids misfortune, restores original nature, and preserves the unobscured and luminous, the true emptiness and wondrous being. Creation cannot limit it, yin and yang cannot constrain it, and the myriad things cannot harm it—it is just like this.\n\nYet in the world, are there not those who know fortune and misfortune but are unwilling to devote themselves to divine efficacy?\n\n**Two Poems on the Meaning of Hexagrams**\n\n**Thirty-Six**\nWhen *Pi* and *Tai* first meet, the ten thousand things fill the world;\n*Tun* and *Meng* receive the mandate of generation and completion.\nWithin this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images—\nTo exhaust all lines is but to waste one’s spirit in vain.\n\n*Qian* above, *Kun* below (䷋): Heaven’s qi descends from above, earth’s qi ascends from below—yin and yang do not meet, and this is *Pi* (Closed).\n*Kun* above, *Qian* below (䷊): Earth’s qi descends from above, heaven’s qi ascends from below—yin and yang unite, and this is *Tai* (Open).\nWhen *Pi* reaches its extreme, *Tai* arrives; as soon as yin and yang meet, the ten thousand things burst forth in fullness, filling the universe.\n\n*Tun* (䷂): *Kan* above, *Zhen* below—thunder within water, yang born amid yin, thus dispersing yin to generate beings.\n*Meng* (䷃): *Gen* above, *Kan* below—water beneath the mountain, yang trapped in yin, thus nurturing yang to complete beings.\n*Pi* and *Tai* govern the passage and blockage of the ten thousand things;\n*Tun* and *Meng* govern their generation and completion.\nPassage and blockage, generation and completion—all arise from the interplay of yin and yang.\nThe coming and going of yin and yang, the passage and blockage, generation and completion of the ten thousand things—all occur naturally, without forced effort.\n\nIn the Dao of cultivating truth:\nWhen firm and yielding have not yet united, this is *Pi*;\nWhen firm and yielding unite, this is *Tai*.\nWhen firmness is called for, advance with firmness to cultivate truth—this is *Tun*;\nWhen yielding is called for, employ yielding to nurture truth—this is *Meng*.\nKnowing passage and blockage, able to cultivate and nurture, firm and yielding applied in due time—transforming and shaping the sixty-four hexagrams, all lies within one’s own heart.\n\nGenerally, hexagrams present images to convey meaning; once meaning is grasped, images may be forgotten.\nIf one does not understand the meaning of the hexagrams but clings solely to their images, one will insist on advancing with one, two, or three yang lines to enact *Tai*, or controlling with one, two, or three yin lines to manage *Pi*.\nTo generate three yang lines to enact *Tai*—this approach still approximates reason.\nBut to generate three yin lines to manage *Pi*—is this not difficult?\nMoreover, some claim that at the *zi* hour of heaven, yang qi stirs within *Kan* and moves, so one should guard the kidneys at *zi*, making this \"morning *Tun*.\"\nAt the *wu* hour of heaven, yang qi is limited and halts, so one should guard the heart at *wu*, making this \"evening *Meng*.\"\nAlas! If one relies on this to interpret *Pi*, *Tai*, *Tun*, *Meng*, and the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, how can all be made to align?\nTo exhaust all lines in pursuit of perfect alignment—is this not a vain waste of spirit?\nThe ancient immortals said: *\"No need to seek* zi *and* wu *at the edge of the sky—within the body, a single yang is born.\"* This should serve as clear proof for those who practice hexagrams and lines. Scholars must reflect deeply.\n\n**Thirty-Seven**\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms;\nGrasp the meaning, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.\nYet the world’s deluded cling only to images,\nPracticing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.\n\n*Grasp the meaning* (one version reads *grasp the image*);\n*Cling to images* (one version reads *fixate on images*).\n\nThe sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Zhouyi* merely clarify the images of yin and yang, their centeredness or lack thereof.\nIf one comprehends the meaning of yin and yang, centeredness or lack thereof, one can harmonize yin and yang, naturally aligning with the hexagrams.\nYet how is it that the world’s deluded disciples, failing to investigate meaning, cling instead to images, insisting on practicing *Tun* in the morning and *Meng* in the evening, beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, following hexagram qi in hopes of attaining the Dao and ascending in flight? This is utter folly.\n\nLittle do they know that the ancient immortals’ references to \"morning *Tun*\" and \"evening *Meng*\" were teachings to recognize that when yang is born, it is *Tun*, and when yang is trapped, it is *Meng*.\nYang’s birth is like the dawn of day; yang’s entrapment is like the dusk of night.\nWhen yang is born, advance the yang fire to gather yang—this is \"morning *Tun*.\"\nWhen yang is trapped, employ the yin tally to nurture yang—this is \"evening *Meng*.\"\nAs for *Jiji* and *Weiji*, they teach that when yin and yang have united, it is *Jiji*; when they have not united, it is *Weiji*.\nWhen yin and yang unite, the golden elixir congeals, the work of yang fire is complete—*Jiji* must guard against failure, and the function of the yin tally is essential.\nWhen yin and yang do not unite, the golden elixir does not form, the yin tally is useless—*Weiji* urgently requires fulfillment, and the work of yang fire must be undertaken.\nThis is the meaning hidden within the hexagrams, the intent of these four hexagrams. Extending this to the remaining sixty hexagrams, all are but transformations of a single yin and yang. Thus it is said: *Grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.*\nIf one understands the meaning of the hexagrams, the heavenly gate is in hand, the earthly axis is at heart—walking freely, every step is the Dao. There is no need to cling to hexagram images, for one naturally aligns with them.\n\nAlas! The golden toad, the jade crow—recognize the true, and you are the master.\n\n**On Geng and Jia: Thirty-Eight**\n\nHeaven and Earth have their own times of fullness and emptiness; only by discerning their waxing and waning can one grasp the mechanism.\nSince ancient times, Geng and Jia have been invoked to clarify the command—when the Three Corpses are slain, the Dao may be attained.\n\nThe Way of Heaven and Earth is the Way of fullness and emptiness.\nWhen fullness reaches its extreme, emptiness follows; when emptiness reaches its extreme, fullness follows—each in its own time.\nThe cultivator of the Dao who can scrutinize the true principle of fullness and emptiness, and thereby subdue and dissolve yin while nurturing and augmenting yang, may be said to have grasped the mechanism of waxing and waning.\nTo subdue and dissolve yin is the mechanism of emptiness; to nurture and augment yang is the mechanism of fullness.\nYet in all dissolving and nurturing, one must never depart from the sincerity of true knowing or the numinosity of spiritual awareness.\nThe sincerity of true knowing is firm, belonging to the metal of Geng; the numinosity of spiritual awareness is yielding, belonging to the wood of Jia.\nFirmness governs the external, subduing the guest qi; yielding abides within, quietly nourishing the celestial authenticity.\nWhen firmness and yielding are both employed, inner and outer cultivation proceed in tandem—this is what it means for Geng and Jia to clarify the command.\nWhen the command is clear, firmness and yielding are properly balanced, waxing and waning follow the season, the upright qi prevails and the perverse qi is transformed.\nInner thoughts do not leak outward, and external things do not intrude within.\n\nWithout eyes, ears, mouth, tongue, body, or intent,\nWithout form, sound, scent, flavor, touch, or dharma—\nPure and bare, naked and unadorned,\nThis is called slaying the Three Corpses to the last.\nWhen the Three Corpses are slain, the host of yin is wholly transformed,\nAnd the Great Dao may be hoped for.\n\nThe crux of this verse lies entirely in the line:\n*\"Only by carefully discerning the waxing and waning can one grasp the mechanism.\"*\n*\"Carefully discerning\"* means thorough and intimate contemplation,\nPenetrating even the subtlest details.\nOnly after deep and prolonged practice can truth be seen.\nOnly when truth is seen can one respond with the heart and act with the hands—\nOnly then can one wax and wane.\nTo wax and wane is to know the mechanism;\nWithout this ability, one cannot be said to know it.\nNot knowing the mechanism means the principle has not been thoroughly examined and distinguished—\nHow then can the command be clarified to slay the Three Corpses?\nThus, the study of rectifying the heart and making intent sincere\nLies wholly in investigating things to extend knowledge.\n\n**On the Two Mysteries (Yuan and Pin):**\n\n**Thirty-Nine**\nTo keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\nWhen true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,\nA single spark of numinous light will never depart.\n\nThe Valley Spirit is the *qi* of primordial emptiness and non-being—\nWhat is called the \"Sacred Embryo.\"\nThis *qi* is neither form nor void, yet both form and void,\nExisting in the dim and obscure,\nInvisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp.\nIt is the boundary between the heart of Dao and the human heart,\nThe root of true knowing and numinous awareness,\nThe origin of firmness in *qing* and softness in *xing*—\nGiving birth to heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nThe Confucians call it the *\"Supreme Ultimate,\"* or *\"Utmost Goodness,\"* or *\"Utmost Sincerity.\"*\nThe Buddhists call it *\"Perfect Enlightenment,\"* or *\"Dharmakāya,\"* or *\"Tathāgata.\"*\nThe Daoists call it *\"Golden Elixir,\"* or *\"Sacred Embryo,\"* or *\"Valley Spirit.\"*\nIn truth, it is humanity’s original good knowing and good ability,\nThe spirit manifesting in the empty valley.\n\nWhen this Valley Spirit descends into the postnatal,\nYin and yang separate,\nThe false takes charge, and the true retreats—\nThe Valley Spirit is buried as if dead.\nTo refine the Golden Elixir, one must revive this Valley Spirit;\nTo revive the Valley Spirit, one must first harmonize yin and yang.\nIf yin and yang are not harmonized, the Valley Spirit will not coalesce.\n\n*Yuan* is yang, the firm and vigorous *qing*;\n*Pin* is yin, the soft and compliant *xing*.\nWith both firmness and softness, the Valley Spirit attains longevity,\nAnd the root of immortality is established.\nFor the Valley Spirit is the balanced *qi* of the two arcs,\nFormed through their union.\nWhen the two arcs unite in the dim and obscure,\nThere is something within—this is called the *\"Essence of True Unity.\"*\nThe Essence of True Unity is another name for the Valley Spirit.\nBefore refinement, it flickers in and out of existence—this is *\"true essence.\"*\nAfter refinement, it coalesces and does not scatter—this is the *\"Valley Spirit.\"*\n\nWhen true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,\nEssence unifies at the center, and the Valley Spirit coalesces.\nWith the Valley Spirit coalesced, the heart of Dao abides constantly,\nThe human heart obeys, and true knowing and numinous awareness merge as one.\nGood knowing and good ability become wholly celestial,\nStill and unmoving, yet responding with perfect accord.\nResponding with perfect accord while still and unmoving,\nEver responsive, ever tranquil—\nA single spark of numinous light will never depart.\nWhen the numinous light never departs, the Valley Spirit is ever undying.\nWhen the Valley Spirit is undying,\nIt is what the immortal elder meant by:\n*\"Swallow a grain of Golden Elixir,\nAnd you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven.\"*\n\nThe Valley Spirit, true essence, and numinous light\nAre all the same thing,\nDifferentiated only by their state of completion or incompletion—\nThere are not three distinct entities. Scholars must understand this.\n\n**Forty**\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world;\nPeople mistakenly take the mouth and nose as its locus.\nEven if you practice breath control for a thousand years,\nHow can you seize the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\"*\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\n*Yuan* is the yang of *Qian*, the virtue of vigor and strength;\n*Pin* is the yin of *Kun*, the virtue of compliance and softness.\nYang governs movement, yin governs stillness—\nThe movement and stillness of the Valley Spirit are the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nThis gate gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings,\nUtterly empty yet containing the utterly full,\nUtterly void yet containing the utterly substantial.\nIn the human body, it is where the Four Great do not adhere.\n\nAt the exact center of heaven and earth,\nA void aperture hangs suspended,\nOpening and closing in due time,\nMoving and stilling naturally.\nIt has no fixed location, nor any form—\nIt is also called the *\"Primal Pass.\"*\nThe Primal Pass is utterly void and utterly numinous,\nNeither existence nor non-existence—\nIt is also called the *\"Gate of All Wonders.\"*\nAll wonders: no principle is absent, no virtue is lacking.\n\nIf one takes the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\nExhaling and inhaling impure *qi*,\nHow can one drive the Golden Crow and Jade Hare back to the Yellow Path,\nCoalescing them into the most numinous elixir?\n\nThe Golden Crow is the image of the sun,\nYang containing yin—\nIn the human, it is the virtue of compliance and centeredness,\nThe numinous *xing* of numinous awareness.\nThe Jade Hare is the image of the moon,\nYin containing yang—\nIn the human, it is the virtue of vigor and centeredness,\nThe true *qing* of true knowing.\n\nNuminous awareness and true knowing,\nThe centered virtue of yang and yin—\nThese are the *qi* of the two arcs.\nThe Valley Spirit is formed by their coalescence.\n\nWithout knowing the Mysterious Female, how can one know the Crow and Hare?\nWithout knowing the Crow and Hare,\nHow can the Valley Spirit be undying and attain longevity?\n\nAlas!\nWhat kind of gate is this?\nGo with the flow, and you die;\nGo against it, and you live.\nOften it teaches you to seek, yet you cannot find it—\nHow easily can the Mysterious Female be known?\n\n**On Nature and *Qing*:**\n**Forty-One**\n\nBy different names they emerge, yet few know their common source—\nThese two, profoundly profound, are the pivotal mechanism.\nPreserving life and perfecting form, discerning gain and loss,\nThe Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare.\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir is but one firm and one yielding,\nTwo ingredients of the medicine, with nothing else besides.\nThe firm belongs to the *qing* of true knowing,\nThe yielding to the subtle *xing* of numinous awareness.\nOne *xing*, one *qing*—though their names differ,\nIn truth they issue together from the primordial Void’s true Unity of *qi*.\nThis true Unity of *qi* is the Valley Spirit of the earlier verse,\nWhile *xing* and *qing* are the Mysterious Female of that same poem.\nThe Mysterious Female, these two—profound beyond profundity—\nIs the essential mechanism of the undying Valley Spirit.\n\nFor the Dao of the primordial and spontaneous:\nThe Valley Spirit gives rise to the Mysterious Female.\nFor the Dao of later return:\nThe Mysterious Female completes the Valley Spirit.\nWithout their union, the Valley Spirit cannot coalesce.\nThe Mysterious Female is the pivotal mechanism precisely to coalesce the Valley Spirit.\n\nWhen the Mysterious Female is established, the Valley Spirit coalesces—\nOne may preserve life, perfect form,\nAnd further clarify the gains of advancing yang and the losses of retreating yin.\nAdvance yang until nothing more can be added,\nRetreat yin until nothing more can be diminished.\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang is pure,\nThe Valley Spirit attains longevity,\nA seamless unity of *qi*, utterly free of dregs—\nPerfectly round, radiantly luminous,\nImmaculately bare, resplendently unadorned.\nNeither creation can constrain it,\nNor the myriad things harm it.\nLike the firing times refining the Purple Gold Elixir,\nIt revives the dead and restores life—\nMost numinous, most wondrous.\n\n**On Effortful Practice:**\n**Forty-Two**\n\nAt first, effortful practice is difficult for others to perceive;\nOnly when it reaches effortless action do the many begin to understand.\nYet all see effortless action as the essential marvel,\nWho knows that effortful practice is the very root and foundation?\n\nThe ancient perfected ones said: *\"Nature and life must be cultivated in tandem,\nThe work requires two distinct stages.\"*\nFor the Dao of the Golden Elixir consists of two paths:\nOne to cultivate life, one to cultivate nature.\nThe path of cultivating life is the path of effortful practice;\nThe path of cultivating nature is the path of effortless action.\nThe path of effortful practice extends life through technique;\nThe path of effortless action preserves form through the Dao.\n\nThe path that begins with effortful practice is the way of effortful action, forging life anew.\nThe study of forging life relies entirely on method and movement—\nDrawing from the primordial *qi* before the separation of the Great Primal Chaos,\nWresting the pivotal mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation,\nReversing the twenty-four seasonal nodes,\nAnd returning the seventy-two micro-seasons to their essential Dao.\nHeaven and Earth cannot fathom it,\nGhosts and spirits cannot divine it,\nThe milfoil and tortoise cannot prognosticate it.\nIf even Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, milfoil and tortoise cannot know it,\nHow could mere humans perceive it?\n\nIn the end, effortless action employs the path of non-doing to cultivate nature.\nThe path of cultivating nature embraces the origin and guards the One,\nAll things become empty—\nLike a hen brooding her egg,\nLike an oyster containing its pearl.\nWhen the work reaches its day,\nUtmost sincerity grants foreknowledge,\nThe wisdom-mind opens wide,\nSounds enter and the heart understands,\nFortune and misfortune are known in advance,\nBlessings and calamities are foreseen—\nWho would not recognize this?\n\nYet people only see the path of effortless action as the essential marvel,\nUnaware that the path of effortful practice is the root and foundation.\nTo know not effortful practice and only pursue effortless action—\nNot only can one not cultivate life,\nBut one also cannot cultivate nature.\nEven if there is cultivation,\nIt is merely the cultivation of the acquired *qi*-constitution’s nature,\nHow could it cultivate the nature of the primordial root?\n\nThe root-nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate.\nOriginally, nature and life were one household, not two separate strands;\nBut upon engaging the acquired, yin and yang parted,\nOne became two, and nature and life diverged.\nOnce nature and life diverged,\nNature could no longer attend to life,\nNor could life attend to nature.\nLife was seized by things and could not govern itself,\nAnd nature, too, became disordered.\nWith nature in chaos and life unsteady,\nRight and wrong intermingled,\nPrinciple and desire intertwined,\nThe false took command,\nThe true retreated—\nDay after day, year after year,\nYin *qi* stripped away yang to exhaustion,\nAnd nature and life had no choice but to collapse.\n\nThus, the Dao of the Golden Elixir must first employ effortful practice within the acquired to return to the primordial,\nRestoring one’s original life-treasure.\nOnce the life-treasure is in hand,\nMastery resides with the self,\nUnmoved by the transformations of creation.\nThen, embracing the origin and guarding the One,\nOne practices the path of effortless action\nTo consummate the true emptiness of the original nature—\nFitting indeed to transcend to the most supreme and wondrous Dao.\n\nAlas! Why do all those stubborn adherents of emptiness and annihilation\nKnow only effortless action and not effortful practice?\n\n**On the Feminine and Masculine:**\n**Forty-Three**\n\nWithin the black there is white—this is the Elixir Mother;\nWithin the masculine lies the feminine—this is the Sacred Embryo.\nThe Great One in the crucible must be steadfastly guarded,\nAnd the treasures of the Three Fields gathered as the Three Terraces.\n\nThat \"within the black there is white\" refers to the true knowing born of the Dao-mind,\nA Way of firm strength and centered uprightness—hence called the Elixir Mother.\nThat \"within the masculine lies the feminine\" refers to the numinous knowing inherent in the human mind,\nA virtue of soft compliance and centered uprightness—hence called the Sacred Embryo.\nWhen firmness and compliance unite, when hardness and softness share the same *qi*,\nThe human mind is transformed into the Dao-mind,\nAnd numinous knowing returns to true knowing—\nThis is called the Great One containing true *qi*.\nThe Great One is the spirit of merged yin-yang and unified essence,\nAnother name for the Golden Elixir.\nWhen this true *qi* of the Great One enters the crucible of creation,\nIt is warmed and nurtured, sealed and securely stored, guarded without loss.\nThus, essence is whole, *qi* is whole, spirit is whole—\nThe Three Fields gather treasure like the Three Terraces supporting the pole,\nAnd creation lies within one’s grasp.\n\nThe Three Fields—*guanyuan*, *huangting*, and *ninian*—\nAre not the same as the cinnabar field, the vermilion palace, or the celestial valley,\nNor are they the coccyx, the spine’s midpoint, or the jade pillow.\nThey are the birthplaces of the three great medicines of primordial essence, *qi*, and spirit,\nFormless and imageless, without fixed location.\nBecause they are the places where essence, *qi*, and spirit arise, they are called \"Fields\";\nBecause essence, *qi*, and spirit are spoken of separately, they are called the \"Three Fields.\"\nYet in truth, the Three Fields are one field, the Three Treasures are one treasure.\nDue to the three layers of practice—refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—\nThey are spoken of as three.\nBut when refining spirit into emptiness is reached,\nThere is only emptiness, and essence, *qi*, and spirit also return to no trace—\nHow then could there be any talk of Three Fields?\n\n**On Being and Non-Being:**\n**Forty-Four**\n\nWithin the dim and indistinct, seek the image that arises;\nWithin the profound and obscure, find the true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being naturally merge,\nYet without seeing, how can one conceive of completion?\n\nThe dim and indistinct are neither form nor emptiness—an unfixed image;\nThe profound and obscure are utmost stillness and silence—a place unseen.\nWithin the dim and indistinct lies the image: numinous awareness;\nWithin the profound and obscure dwells true essence: true knowing.\nNuminous awareness is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin—non-being within being;\nTrue knowing is outwardly yin yet inwardly yang—being within non-being.\nThose who cultivate the Dao to complete the Golden Elixir\nMust seek numinous awareness within the dim and indistinct,\nAnd find true knowing within the profound and obscure.\nIf one can truly grasp this with heart and spirit,\nAnd recognize what is real, this is called \"having seen.\"\nOnce seen clearly, use true knowing to govern numinous awareness,\nAnd numinous awareness to nurture true knowing.\nThen being and non-being will embrace in mutual affection,\nNaturally merging and interacting—thus the Golden Elixir is instantly formed.\nOtherwise, if one does not know the image within the dim and indistinct,\nOr the essence within the profound and obscure,\nOne remains ignorant of what the ingredients of the Golden Elixir truly are.\nHow then can one vainly imagine its completion?\n\n**On Ingesting the Elixir (Two Poems):**\n**Forty-Five**\n\nWhen the Four Symbols converge, the mysterious body is complete;\nWhere the Five Phases are whole, the Purple Gold shines bright.\nOnce the embryo is shed and the elixir enters the mouth, the body attains sagehood—\nCountless dragons and spirits are utterly astonished.\n\nThe Way of the Purple Gold (or *Purple Radiance*) Elixir\nLies entirely in gathering the Five Phases and harmonizing the Four Symbols.\nWhen the Four Symbols converge,\nNature, emotions, essence, and spirit unite, and the primordial body is established.\nIf one can then hold fast to the center with perfect sincerity,\nAnd refine it with the fire of celestial truth,\nThis is called \"completing the Five Phases.\"\nOnce the Five Phases are complete,\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all return to single-minded trust;\nNature, emotions, essence, and spirit all transform into one *qi*.\nVigorous and yielding merge without trace,\nHard and soft leave no mark.\nTrue knowing and numinous awareness likewise shift into innate knowledge and innate ability—\nUtterly good, without evil,\nFused with the Heavenly Principle,\nRound and unobstructed,\nEmpty yet luminous,\nPossessing all principles and responding to all affairs.\nLike yellow gold forged into Purple Gold, its radiance shines outward.\nWhen ingested, it transmutes all acquired yin influences,\nRevealing the primordial Dharma-body,\nEntering the foundation of sagehood.\n\"My life is mine, not heaven’s to command\"—\nHow could dragons and spirits not be astonished?\n\nThe phrase \"entering the mouth\" signifies sudden awakening,\nNot the literal act of ingestion.\nWhen the primordial *qi* is refined to maturity,\nIt suddenly shifts from gradual to instantaneous,\nFrom clarity to sincerity—\nLike the elixir entering the mouth, all illnesses vanish,\nAnd thus the body attains sagehood.\nScholars must grasp the meaning beyond the words,\nAnd not cling to the text or fixate on images.\nIf one interprets \"entering the mouth\" as physical swallowing,\nAnd ponders how to ingest the primordial *qi*—\nFormless and imageless—\nWhat is there to swallow? What is there to ingest?\nHere, one may attain clear understanding.\n\nAt forty-six:\nThe Banquet in the Flowery Pond concludes, the moon’s radiance pure,\nI mount a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom this time, after meeting with the host of immortals,\nLet the seas turn to fields, the hills shift to valleys—my Dharma-body remains unchanging.\n\n*Sea-fields* (one version reads *Sea-Tide Realm*)\n\nThe \"Banquet in the Flowery Pond\" signifies drawing the true yang from Kan to enter the crucible of creation, stabilizing the Dao-heart and filling the abdomen. The \"moon’s radiance pure\" means the Dao-heart abides constantly, its wisdom-light shining bright, neither concealed nor deceptive.\n\n\"Mounting a golden dragon\": Qian is metal, is dragon. Drawing the Dao-heart from Kan—the true knowing of yang—fills the yin of human-heart knowing in Li, transforming mere knowing into true knowing. Li reverts to Qian, the original face fully revealed, wholly imbued with Heavenly principle, perfectly round, luminously radiant, purely yang without yin.\n\n\"Visiting the Purple Tenuity\": The Purple Tenuity Emperor governs creation and binds the constellations. Cultivating the Dao to revert to the Qian-body, mastery rests within me; the celestial gate is in my grasp, the earth’s axis turns at my will. Creation cannot constrain, the myriad things cannot sway. Visiting the Purple Tenuity, I join the ranks of Heaven. The work is accomplished among men, the name inscribed above.\n\nFrom this time, meeting with the host of immortals, let the seas surge and tides rise, let hills and valleys shift—my Dharma-body endures forever, indestructible.\n\nOn the inner congealing of the elixir:\nAt forty-seven...\n\nTo grasp the method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir, one must plant the seed within the homestead. No need for forced breath or exertion—naturally, the elixir ripens and the true embryo sheds its husk.\n\nThe method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir lies in the nearest great medicine, not afar; the practice is concise, not cumbersome. The homestead itself holds the medicinal ingredients, which may be planted at any time. No external crucible or bellows, no labored firing, is required—it ripens and transforms of itself.\n\nThe elixir is the primordial, formless, true Unity-qi, the numinous root sundered at the dawn of chaos, the ancestral qi of all life. Contained, it becomes true emptiness; manifested, it becomes wondrous being. Employed, it is the Dao-mind; nurtured, it is the Valley Spirit. Utterly non-being yet containing utter being, utterly void yet containing utter fullness, it holds the qi of the Five Phases yet lacks their substance. Concealed within the Five Phases, it does not fall into their constraints. Sage or worthy, buddha or immortal—all arise from this.\n\nThis is no other thing but our original, neither form nor emptiness, the innate goodness of constant norm. Only through entanglement with the postnatal does the consciousness-spirit take charge, burying and obscuring it. If a true teacher points it out, one realizes the homestead’s own possession, not obtained from another. Once planted, it grows from subtle to manifest, ripening naturally.\n\nThe Immortal Elder said: *\"One must plant the seed within the homestead.\"* All heterodox paths seeking outside the body may now awaken and turn back.\n\n**On the medicine coming from without:**\n*Forty-eight*\nAbandon artifice and false effort,\nRecognize the deathless formula of another’s house.\nIn the flask, ever replenish the wine of extended life;\nIn the tripod, gather the nectar of returning soul.\n\nThe earlier verse spoke of planting the seed within the homestead, lest one cling to solitary cultivation. Thus, it immediately follows: *\"Abandon artifice and false effort, recognize the deathless formula of another’s house.\"*\n\nThe \"planting within the homestead\" refers to the elixir’s medicinal ingredients—unchanged in the sage, undiminished in the commoner, possessed by all, perfected in each, not sought elsewhere, for the homestead holds them already.\n\nThe \"deathless formula of another’s house\" refers to the postnatal qi, where consciousness-spirit dominates, and yang is trapped by yin—like one’s own property now held by another. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must employ the method of pursuit and gathering, so that the departed primordial true yang may be reclaimed, and what has come remains one’s own.\n\nWhat has not yet come belongs to another; what has come belongs to me. Because there is a time before and after arrival, there is a distinction between another’s house and one’s own. Thus, before its arrival, one must tread firmly, gradually gathering and refining, ever replenishing and collecting, performing the work of effort.\n\nThough called \"effort,\" it is truly effortless. \"Effort\" here means subtly harnessing yin and yang, seizing the transformations of creation—not the artifices of others, but the natural operation of things.\n\n\"Ever replenish the wine of extended life\" means augmenting the true knowing of the Dao-mind to secure destiny. \"Gather the nectar of returning soul\" means emptying the numinous knowing of the human mind to nurture nature.\n\nThe wine of extended life is golden juice; the nectar of returning soul is wooden liquid. Replenishing the gold and gathering it, metal and wood merge, emotion and nature unite, true knowing and numinous knowing congeal, and the elixir’s origin takes form.\n\nThe four words *\"ever replenish, gather\"* carry profound meaning. For yin and yang have long been scattered and dispersed; without gradual replenishment and collection, metal and wood cannot merge, nature and emotion cannot harmonize. Only through constant replenishment and gathering, vigilance day and night, neither forgetting nor forcing, with time and deep practice, do metal and wood naturally merge, nature and emotion naturally harmonize. Then one may extend life, return the soul, and enter the realm of deathlessness.\n\n**On the inner and outer elixirs:**\n*Forty-nine*\nA fine ghee from Snow Mountain,\nPoured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of creation.\nIf it passes northwest beyond Kunlun,\nZhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\n\nSnow Mountain lies in the west, representing metal and primordial emotion. Ghee, as water, represents primordial essence. The Eastern Sun, as wood, represents primordial nature; the crucible of creation, as fire, represents primordial spirit.\n\nTake the metal-water of primordial emotion and essence, pour it into the wood-fire of primordial nature and spirit. Refine metal-water with wood-fire, and restrain wood-fire with metal-water. Punishment perfects virtue, virtue fulfills punishment—both employed, metal and wood merge, water and fire harmonize, the Four Great unite, and the elixir returns.\n\nThis is the outer elixir’s symbolic method.\n\nKunlun Mountain lies in the northwest of heaven and earth, the ancestral vein of all mountains, akin to the primordial true Unity-qi, the ancestral qi of all life. The northwest belongs to Qian, the highest place on earth, where height is yang.\n\nZhang Qian is yang; Ma Gu is yin. When the reversion elixir has formed, transformed into the true Unity-qi, growing from subtle to manifest, yang-qi flourishes, the great medicine arises, imbued with Heavenly principle, firm and upright, central and correct. A single grain of utmost yang elixir emerges.\n\nUsing this elixir to touch the postnatal yin of the body is like a cat catching a mouse: false yin dissolves, true yin appears, yin and yang blend, forming the sacred embryo. Thus: *\"If it passes northwest beyond Kunlun, Zhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\"*\n\nThe three words *\"first meets\"* encompass layers of practice. Before the elixir reaches the extreme of yang, Zhang Qian is not permitted to meet Ma Gu. Only when nurtured to the yang extreme does Zhang Qian first meet Ma Gu.\n\nTrue yin and true yang meet; the Dao-mind and human mind both transform into the good mind. True knowing and numinous knowing wholly become good knowing. A single grain of millet-pearl hangs in the void, neither form nor emptiness, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds without obstruction.\n\nThis is the inner elixir’s symbolic method.\n\nThe outer elixir is that which is lost and then regained, returning from without to within—this is the returning elixir. The inner elixir is that which, once returned, refines away the yin qi, emerging from within as true purity—this is the great elixir. When the outer elixir is complete and the inner elixir is achieved, merit is fulfilled and fame is attained. One roams freely in the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever.\n\nOn yang essence:\n*Fifty—*\nNot knowing yang essence or host and guest,\nHow can one tell which is distant, which is close?\nSealing the Weilu acupoint in bedchamber arts\nHas misled countless souls in Jambudvīpa!\n\nYuanduzi said: \"A single droplet of yang essence is concealed within the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the primordial gate of the One Aperture. This yang essence, being utterly yang and utterly pure, contains not a trace of yin turbidity. It is the originally firm, strong, balanced, and unadulterated essence—concealed, it is true emptiness; manifested, it is wondrous existence. This is what is called the inherent goodness of the constant norm, or the Dao-mind, incomparable to the postnatal, utterly yin and turbid essence.\n\nWithin the human body, yang essence governs creation and transformation, dispelling all perversities. The ancients named it the essence of True Unity, or the water of True Unity, or the qi of True Unity—yet in truth, these are all one and the same as the yang essence of the Dao-mind.\n\nYang essence, born before Heaven and Earth, is the host; yin essence, born after Heaven and Earth, is the guest. The host is intimate with me; the guest is distant. Mistaking yin essence for yang essence, practicing bedchamber arts to control women, sealing the Weilu, restraining yin essence, and vainly hoping to form the elixir—how could this ever succeed?\n\nThough yang essence is obtained in the 'chamber,' this is not the chamber of a house, but the chamber of the entire body. As the immortal elders said: 'Every household has it, every household cultivates it'—the meaning is the same. How could it be the chamber of a house?\n\nIf the cultivator wishes to recognize yang essence, first seek the Primordial Gate. Once the Primordial Gate is known, there lies the yang essence.\"\n\nOn returning to the root:\n*Fifty-one—*\n\nThe myriad things all return to their root,\nReturning to the root and recovering life—this is everlasting.\nTo know the constant and return to the root is rarely grasped by men;\nReckless action invites misfortune, as often heard.\n\nAll things sprout in spring, grow in summer,\nGather in autumn, and store in winter—this is the constant Dao.\nHaving grown them, then gathering and storing them,\nThis is called returning to the root.\nTo return to the root is to recover life.\nRecovering life means restoring the life-qi of Heaven’s mandate.\nWhen life-qi is restored, it issues anew from the root,\nThus achieving constancy and immortality.\n\nIf one can comprehend the celestial mechanism by which the myriad things endure,\nAnd return to the root to recover life,\nThen one too may endure as an immortal.\nYet the Dao of knowing the constant and returning to the root is profound in principle,\nSubtle in practice—\nThere is the maturity of medicinal substances, the urgency of firing times;\nThere are inner medicinal substances, outer medicinal substances;\nInner firing times, outer firing times;\nCivil firing times, martial firing times;\nFiring times for gathering medicine, for forging and refining;\nFiring times for forming the elixir, for shedding the elixir;\nFiring times for cultivating life, for cultivating nature.\nThese layers must be transmitted one by one by a true teacher\nBefore one may proceed.\nOtherwise, failing to seek instruction from others,\nRelying on one’s own cleverness and insight,\nConjecturing and guessing,\nBelieving oneself enlightened and rashly taking action—\nLittle does one realize that a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of loss,\nAnd reckless action invites misfortune, as principle confirms!\n\nOn the Sword of Wisdom:\n*Fifty-two*\n\nOuye’s personally transmitted sword-forging method,\nMoye’s metal and water blend softness and hardness.\nOnce refined, it responds to human intent—\nA thousand miles to slay demons in a flash of lightning.\n\nThe sword is a guardian for the body,\nA wisdom-tool for attaining Buddhahood or immortality,\nThe very handle for becoming a sage or worthy—\nThis is what is called the Returned Elixir.\nThere is no sword apart from the Returned Elixir.\nThe so-called Returned Elixir is the restoration of one’s original innate knowledge and innate capacity,\nThe true spirit where hardness and softness unite.\nForging the sword is forging this wisdom-tool of innate knowledge and innate capacity,\nWhere hardness and softness merge as one.\nIn terms of essence, it is the Elixir;\nIn terms of function, it is the Sword.\nYet in truth, the Sword and the Elixir are one and the same,\nNot two separate things.\n\nOf old, Ouye forged a sword but repeatedly failed,\nUntil his wife Moye leapt into the furnace,\nAnd with one firing, it was complete.\nThe world calls it the Moye Treasure Sword,\nIts sharpness unmatched.\n\nIn the Dao of cultivating reality,\nForging the sword comes first—\nDrawing forth the qi of hardness and softness in perfect balance,\nRefining it with water and fire into a treasure,\nCalled the Sword of Wisdom.\nWorn at the side, it obeys the heart’s command,\nSlaying demons a thousand miles away in a flash of lightning.\n\nThe Immortal Elder uses Ouye and Moye\nTo illustrate the principle of hardness and softness in harmony,\nA most subtle and profound teaching.\nCultivators must understand that both hardness and softness\nMust return to the mean and uprightness,\nOnly then can they transmute postnatal yin.\nIf hardness is needed but one is soft,\nOr softness is needed but one is hard,\nOr hardness becomes excessive and rash,\nOr softness grows too weak and timid—\nFailing to hit the mean and uprightness,\nThe sword is not successfully forged.\nIf the sword is not forged, one lacks an inner handle,\nEvery step meets obstruction,\nHow then can the Great Dao be fulfilled?\n\nYet the method of forging the sword is not easily known,\nThe balance of hardness and softness most difficult to grasp.\nWithout a true teacher’s personal transmission and oral instruction,\nAll is but vain conjecture.\n\nOn Harmonizing Temperament:\nFifty-Three\n\nStriking bamboo to summon the turtle that swallows jade mushrooms,\nPlaying the zither to call the phoenix that drinks the elixir spoon.\nOf late, golden light shines through the body entire—\nNot to be spoken of to common folk is this principle.\n\nBamboo is a thing of hollow heart; when struck, it responds.\nThe zither is a thing of sound; when tuned, it harmonizes.\nThe turtle is a thing that nurtures qi;\nThe phoenix is a thing of civil brilliance.\nJade mushrooms are things of tender softness and long life,\nThe elixir spoon is a thing of pure essence, unadulterated.\nTurtle, spoon, and *gui* all belong to yang;\nPhoenix, jade, and mushrooms all belong to yin.\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir consists of two matters: emptying the heart and filling the abdomen—beyond these, there is no other method.\nWhen the human heart is empty, the heart of Dao arises, and the abdomen is filled, as in striking bamboo to summon the turtle.\nOnce the abdomen is filled, with the hardness of the heart of Dao, one restrains the softness of the human heart, as the turtle swallowing jade mushrooms.\nWhen true knowing manifests, numinous knowing becomes still and the heart luminous, as in playing the zither to call the phoenix.\nOnce the heart is luminous, with the nature of numinous knowing, one nurtures the emotions of true knowing, as the phoenix drinking the elixir spoon.\n\nThe heart of Dao is true knowing; the human heart is numinous knowing.\nEmptiness and fullness respond to each other, hardness and softness become one.\nConstantly responsive, constantly still,\nRound and radiant, pure and bare, unadorned and free,\nThe body transparent through and through, inner and outer luminous—\nOne enters the realm of the sage in the ease of the central Way.\n\nThis is the Way of stealing yin and yang, seizing creation,\nRevolving heaven and earth, twisting the pivot of qi,\nAdvancing before heaven so that heaven does not oppose it—\nHow could it be spoken of to common folk?\n\nOn Gradual and Sudden:\nFifty-Four\n\nMedicine meets its kindred qi to form an image,\nThe Dao resides in the subtle and unseen, uniting with nature.\nA single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—\nOnly then does one know my fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nMedicines of the same qi and kind are the true yang of true knowing and the true yin of numinous knowing.\nWhen true yin and true yang merge and unite,\nOnly then can they condense from formlessness into form.\nWhat cannot be heard is called the subtle;\nWhat cannot be seen is called the unseen.\nUnheard and unseen, the Dao returns to emptiness,\nA single qi harmonious and flowing,\nWithout thought, without action,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—\nAll under heaven unfolds without force,\nIn accord with nature.\n\nFirst, yin and yang condense;\nThen, yin and yang merge into oneness.\nA single grain of numinous elixir hangs in the void,\nIlluminating mountains and rivers across the great earth.\nSwallowed and ingested, its light arises within the five viscera,\nDispelling all yin influences,\nTransforming the post-heaven trigrams—\nOnly then does one know my fate is ruled by me, not by heaven.\n\nThe first two lines proceed from effort to naturalness;\nThe third line emerges from naturalness to sudden awakening.\nWhen the numinous elixir enters the belly, this is the meaning of sudden awakening.\nIn the state of sudden awakening through Dao cultivation,\nBoth being and non-being dissolve,\nHeaven and earth return to emptiness.\nOne leaps beyond yin and yang,\nNo longer bound by them,\nFate governed by the self, not by heaven.\nIf one has not reached the river of sudden awakening,\nStill moving in and out of yin and yang,\nFate remains subject to heaven—\nThe word \"only\" makes this clear.\n\nOn the Ease of Forming the Elixir:\nFifty-Five\nResplendent golden elixir forms in a single day—\nThe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three,\nIt is all procrastination, wasting time.\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir\nIs possessed by all, ready in every household.\nIf one can thoroughly investigate its true principles,\nSeek out an enlightened teacher,\nRecognize the two medicines of true knowing and numinous knowing,\nAnd discern the primal aperture,\nWith sincere resolve, one may swiftly reach the other shore.\nIn a single day’s effort, the radiant yang elixir may be formed—\nWhy wait three years or nine?\n\nThese are the words of the ancient immortals, not falsehoods.\nYet while the elixir coalesces in an instant,\nIts nurturing requires ten months.\nWithout the work of nurturing, the golden elixir will not stabilize,\nAnd one may gain it only to lose it again.\nThe \"single day\" refers to the union of yin and yang,\nNot the maturation of the golden elixir.\nMaturation demands the work of yin tally and yang fire,\nAdding and reducing, increasing and diminishing,\nUntil there is nothing left to add or diminish—\nOnly then is the radiant yang elixir complete.\nIf it were truly a mature elixir,\nHow could it mature in a single day?\n\nThe immortal elder’s earlier poem says:\n*\"Though you know cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.\"*\n\nThe later verse says:\n*\"To refine the nine transformations,\nFirst refine the self and hold the mind.\"*\n\nFrom this, one may understand the meaning of the golden elixir forming in a day.\n\nFifty-Six\nThe great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—\nKnow that it depends on me, yet also on heaven.\nWithout cultivating virtue and accumulating hidden merit,\nDemons will arise at every turn to obstruct the path.\n\nThe previous poem speaks of the elixir forming in a day, which seems easy.\nBut I fear students may treat the great Dao lightly,\nNeglecting virtue and conduct,\nYet vainly hoping for immortality.\nThus, this poem clarifies the importance of virtue.\n\nWhat heaven bestows upon humanity is virtue;\nWhat humanity offers in return to heaven is also virtue.\nWith virtue, heaven rejoices,\nAnd the cultivation of fate becomes easy, governed by the self.\nWithout virtue, heaven is displeased,\nAnd the cultivation of the Dao becomes difficult, governed by heaven.\n\nWhy is this so?\nWithout virtue or conduct, even spirits and gods will not tolerate it.\nAt every turn, demonic obstructions arise,\nAlong with calamities, illnesses, and setbacks,\nInevitably leading to abandonment halfway.\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao must prioritize cultivating virtue.\nWith weighty virtue, learning the Dao becomes easy,\nAnd cultivating the Dao becomes effortless—\nFor heaven rejoices, and demonic obstructions naturally dissolve.\n\nOn Stealing the Mechanism:\nFifty-Seven\nThe Three Powers steal from one another in due time—\nWithin this mechanism lie the Dao, virtue, and immortality.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nThe hundred bones are ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\nThe Three Powers steal from one another:\nHeaven and earth steal from the myriad things,\nThe myriad things steal from humanity,\nAnd humanity steals from the myriad things.\n\n\"In due time\" means:\nThe myriad things steal the qi of heaven and earth to flourish,\nWhile heaven and earth, seeing the myriad things flourish,\nSeize the opportunity to gather them in—\nThus, heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things.\nWhen people see the myriad things and generate greed and delusion,\nThe myriad things, sensing human greed and delusion,\nSeize the opportunity to drain their spirit—\nThus, the myriad things are the thieves of humanity.\nThe myriad things, nurtured by human cultivation, bear fruit,\nAnd humans, seeing the myriad things bear fruit,\nSeize the opportunity to make use of them—\nThus, humanity is the thief of the myriad things.\n\nThe mechanism of stealing in due time,\nWith its sequence of giving and taking,\nHas been hidden by immortals since ancient times.\nThey conceal it in the timely act of stealing,\nPilfering yin and yang,\nSeizing creation,\nReversing life and death,\nTwisting the pivot of qi,\nDissolving guest qi,\nAnd supporting the upright qi.\n\nThus, the myriad transformations are at peace,\nAll concerns cease,\nThe hundred bones are ordered,\nAnd the Dao of non-action and naturalness is realized.\n\nThe emphasis of this poem lies in the two words \"in due time.\"\nStealing in due time means the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is obtained by me.\nMissing the time means my qi is seized early by heaven, earth, and the myriad things.\n\"In due time\" is stealing;\n\"Not in due time\" is not stealing.\nThe subtlety of the word \"time\" is profound indeed.\n\nOn Investigating Principle:\nFifty-Eight\n\nThe *Yinfu* treasures surpass three hundred characters,\nThe *Daode* sacred scriptures fill five thousand.\nFrom ancient times to now, immortals number without end—\nAll attain the true essence within these very texts.\nThe *Yinfu* and *Daode*, twin scriptures of the Dao,\nReveal heaven and earth’s transformative mechanisms,\nExpose the secrets of yin-yang and life-death.\nFrom antiquity to the present,\nSuperior scholars and perfected beings\nHave delved into these two classics to fathom true principle,\nTo grasp the real essence and fulfill nature and life.\nEven the Immortal Elder’s *Wuzhen* was composed\nUpon the foundation of *Yinfu* and *Daode*.\nIf scholars can awaken to truth,\nThe meanings of *Yinfu* and *Daode* will become perfectly clear.\n\nOn Seeking a Teacher:\nFifty-Nine\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true teacher, do not force conjecture.\nFor the golden elixir lacks oral transmission—\nWhere then can you conceive the spiritual embryo?\n\nThe preceding section speaks of *Yinfu* and *Daode*\nAs treasured characters and sacred scriptures,\nWhich scholars should thoroughly investigate.\nYet I fear disciples may cling to alchemical texts,\nPresuming themselves correct and refusing to seek others—\nThus this poem urges the swift search for a true teacher.\nAlchemical classics and philosophical works\nContain every ingredient and firing process,\nEmploying myriad metaphors\nTo make all understand this principle,\nTo make each know this Way.\nBut the study of nature and life is subtle and profound,\nNot easily discerned as true.\nIf one has insights or awakenings,\nOne must seek a teacher’s verification.\nWithout seeking a teacher,\nRelying on one’s own brilliance,\nForcing conjecture and private interpretation—\nWill this not squander one’s nature and life?\nHence it is said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, / Without a true teacher, do not force conjecture.*\n\nThe Way of nature and life\nRelies on gathering primordial qi as its essential task.\nBut primordial qi is formless and imageless,\nInvisible, inaudible, untouchable—\nHow then to cultivate it?\nHow then to return it?\nAlchemical classics and philosophical works\nHave never failed to speak of this qi,\nNever failed to speak of cultivation,\nNever failed to speak of return.\nYet no matter how strenuously they describe it,\nTheir words fall short of its image;\nNo matter how forcefully they discuss it,\nTheir discourse fails to reach it.\nOnly through a true teacher’s oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction\nCan one recognize the ingredients,\nUnderstand the firing process,\nAnd proceed directly without hindrance.\nOtherwise, without seeking the teacher’s oral instructions,\nMerely following the words of alchemical texts,\nSlightly diverging into branches and leaves,\nPresuming great enlightenment and awakening,\nThen acting arbitrarily—\nWhether clinging to emptiness or grasping at forms—\nWhere can the spiritual embryo be conceived?\nThus the true teacher’s oral instructions cannot but be urgently sought.\n\nOn Quieting the Mechanism:\nSixty\n\nOnly when the heart-ape is thoroughly stilled,\nThe mind’s mechanism fully quieted,\nCan three thousand meritorious deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally, the cauldron will refine dragon and tiger—\nWhy cling to home, yearn for wife and children?\n\nDisciples fail to realize the Dao and attain the Dao\nDue to the heart’s instability and their unsteady roots.\nIf all conditions are truly emptied,\nAll things viewed with detachment,\nReduced again and again to non-action,\nThe square inch of the heart purified—\nThen inner cultivation is achieved.\nFurther accumulating virtue and practice,\nHardship for oneself, benefit for others,\nEverywhere offering convenience,\nUnmoved by wealth or honor,\nUnshaken by poverty or low status,\nUnbowed by power or force,\nWholly devoted, living with circumstances,\nAll afflictions extinguished—\nThen outer cultivation is accomplished.\nWith inner cultivation achieved and outer cultivation complete,\nThree thousand merits fulfilled,\nVirtue matching heaven,\nOne may attain longevity equal to heaven.\nAs it is said: *Those of great virtue must attain their alignment.*\n\nWithin the heart’s square inch,\nNot even a speck of dust can be tolerated.\nThe slightest dust disrupts the harmony of nature and emotion,\nDragon and tiger rage wildly,\nGiving rise to all manner of dangers.\nBut if the mind’s mechanism is entirely eradicated,\nEmpty and open,\nNo need to seek another cauldron—\nThis very self is the cauldron.\nOnce the cauldron is established,\nEvery movement and stillness,\nUnknowing and unperceiving,\nFollows heaven’s principle.\nNature and emotion unite,\nHarmonious qi steams and rises—\nThis itself is the refinement of dragon and tiger,\nNo need to ask further.\nThis Way—\nIngredients are ever-present,\nThe cauldron naturally exists.\nThose who know it,\nThough foolish or humble,\nThrough diligent practice may ascend to sagehood.\nYet worldly people fail to see through worldly affairs,\nFail to recognize true nature and life,\nClinging to wife and children,\nEntangled without end,\nExhausting their minds,\nOil dried, lamp extinguished,\nMarrow depleted, life lost—\nAlas!\n\nOn Knowing Contentment:\nSixty-One\n\nBefore refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to refine it;\nOnce refined, know when to halt and be content.\nIf the mind clings to fullness without cease,\nOne cannot avoid ruin and disgrace in time.\n\nThe Returned Elixir is the return to life’s origin—\nInnate knowing, innate ability,\nHard and soft united,\nThe true numinous essence of original nature.\nYet when humans reach yang’s extremity and yin arises,\nThe primordial enters the postnatal,\nInnate knowing becomes false knowing,\nInnate ability becomes false ability.\nHard and soft fall out of balance,\nThe true numinous grows dim—\nAs if one’s own possession were lost abroad.\n\nTo return is to reclaim what was originally one’s own,\nAs a lost object is found again,\nAs what has departed returns once more.\nYet the Dao of the Returned Elixir\nHas its rhythms of advance and retreat, urgency and ease,\nIts fire-tending of cultivation and contentment.\nOne must adapt to the moment, respond to circumstances,\nNeither excessive nor deficient.\n\nThus, before the Elixir returns,\nOne advances with courage and vigor,\nGradually gathering, gradually refining,\nUrgent in seeking its return.\nOnce the Elixir has returned,\nIt is again innate knowing, innate ability,\nHard and soft united,\nThe undimmed true numinous essence.\nThe work is accomplished, the medicine’s qi is full,\nThe task of effort is complete, the effortless task manifests—\nThen swiftly withdraw the fire, halt the wheel,\nRemove the fuel from beneath the cauldron.\nEmploy the work of gentle nurturing,\nGuard against danger, contemplate peril,\nPreserve this single spark of true numinosity\nWithin the furnace of creation.\nThe natural true fire\nSteams and simmers of itself,\nTransforming all yin,\nForging an indestructible vajra-body—\nOnly then is perfection attained.\n\nOtherwise, once the Elixir has returned,\nIf one knows not contentment,\nClings to fullness without end,\nAnd continues to stoke the fire,\nYang qi grows parched and desiccated,\nThe medicine withers and ages.\nThe true departs, the false arises,\nWhat was gained is lost again—\nRuin and disgrace cannot be avoided.\nOf old, Elder Pure Yang failed thrice to complete the Returned Elixir,\nElder Purple Clarity suffered midnight storms and thunder—\nAll due to this.\n\nFor civil refinement and martial tempering each have their time;\nYang fire and yin tally each have their wondrous use.\nA hair’s breadth of error leads a thousand miles astray—\nCan those who cultivate virtue not be cautious?\n\nOn the Two Heads of Life and Death:\nSixty-Two\n\nTurn the door of death into the door of life,\nLet not the gate of life be mistaken for the gate of death.\nIf one grasps the pivot of killing and reversal,\nOnly then does one know how harm gives rise to grace.\n\nThe gate of life and the door of death\nAre originally one and the same—\nThe very portal of the Mysterious Pass.\nWithin this portal lies the qi of the Five Phases:\nFollow their flow, and the Five Phases wound one another,\nEach dwelling apart, the Five Virtues turned to Five Thieves—\nThe door of life becomes the door of death,\nThe gate of life becomes the gate of death.\nReverse their course, and the Five Phases engender one another,\nReturning to a single qi, the Five Thieves transformed into Five Virtues—\nThe door of death becomes the door of life,\nThe gate of death becomes the gate of life.\nThe pivot of life and death lies solely in reversal.\n\nIf one grasps how to seek life within the mechanism of killing,\nAnd wields reversal with skill,\nThen harm gives rise to grace,\nThe door of death and the door of life may be transformed into the gate of life and the door of life—\nEven in the face of death, one does not perish.\n\nThe door is reckoned by odd numbers, the gate by even;\nWhen the door of death becomes the door of life, false yang departs and true yang arises;\nWhen the gate of death becomes the gate of life, false yin retreats and true yin arises.\nWhen true yin and true yang arise,\nThe two merge into one,\nRestoring the original face of utmost goodness, free from evil.\nUtmost goodness, free from evil, is the undifferentiated principle of Heaven,\nFlowing ceaselessly, the vital mechanism ever abiding—\nHow could one not prolong life and extend years?\n\nSixty-Three\n\nDisaster and fortune ever lie in mutual concealment,\nLike shadow following form, echo chasing sound.\nIf one can reverse this pivot of life and death,\nIn the space between turning one’s palm, calamity becomes blessing.\n\nThe Way of resonance in the world:\nWhen fortune departs, disaster comes; when disaster departs, fortune comes.\nDisaster and fortune lie in mutual concealment,\nLike shadow following form, echo chasing sound.\nThose who cultivate the Dao, knowing how disaster and fortune lie in concealment,\nMay likewise know how life and death lie concealed within the self.\nIf one can reverse this pivot of life and death,\nSeeking life within killing,\nThen in the space between turning one’s palm, disaster becomes blessing—\nNo effort is wasted.\n\nThe pivot of life and death\nIs the qi of the Five Phases inherent in the self.\nWhen the qi of the Five Phases flows in sequence, virtue contains punishment, giving rise to the mechanism of killing;\nWhen reversed, punishment contains virtue, giving rise to the mechanism of life.\nWhere the mechanism of life abides, the mechanism of killing perishes.\nAs the classic says:\n*\"When the Five Phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm is a pit of fire;\nWhen the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields seven treasures.\"*\nBetween sequence and reversal, life and death hang in the balance.\nThe single word \"reverse\" holds great power—\nNone but those whose virtue joins with Heaven and Earth,\nWhose brightness joins with sun and moon,\nCan reverse it;\nNone but those whose order joins with the four seasons,\nWhose auspices join with ghosts and spirits,\nCan reverse it;\nNone but those who look down upon all things,\nSeeing the emptiness of the myriad phenomena,\nAnd take the Dao as their task,\nCan reverse it.\n\nAlas!\nNot knowing is difficult, but acting is even more so—\nHow easily can the pivot of life and death be reversed?\n\nOn Blending with the World While Preserving One’s Radiance:\nSixty-Four\n\nTo cultivate the Dao while blending with the world, harmonizing one’s radiance—\nRound when round, square when square.\nManifest or hidden, yielding or resisting, none can fathom;\nHow could others discern one’s concealment or display?\n\nThe Great Way of the Golden Elixir is luminous and upright.\nTo cultivate within the dust of the world,\nTo practice amid the bustle of the marketplace—\nThis is no petty path of seclusion, of fleeing the world to guard stillness.\nOne must blend with the world and harmonize one’s radiance,\nAdapting to circumstance—round or square—\nManifest or hidden, yielding or resisting,\nConcealing or revealing, empty or solid,\nSo that none can fathom—\nOnly then is it a great achievement, a profound mechanism.\n\nThose who seek obscurity and indulge in eccentricity—\nWhether sitting in meditation in the dharma hall,\nContemplating emptiness to still the mind,\nCirculating qi or visualizing spirits,\nOr manipulating essence and marrow,\nOr tending the furnace for inner alchemy—\nHow dare they act in broad daylight, in places where all can see?\nIf they dare not act where all can see,\nTheir conduct is flawed, not true cultivation—\nHow could they fulfill their nature and destiny?\n\nOf old, Bodhidharma saw that the divine land of the East possessed the aura of the Great Vehicle,\nSo he entered China to accomplish the great matter.\nAfter Huineng received the transmission from the Fifth Patriarch,\nHe concealed himself among hunters in Sihui to attain fruition.\nAfter Zixian received the transmission from Apricot Grove,\nHe went to the great cities and relied on the powerful to fulfill his nature and destiny.\nLike these three sages, all blended with the world and harmonized their radiance,\nCultivating the Dao within the ways of the world—\nThus they became immortals and buddhas.\nIf one abandons the ways of the world, there is no Dao to cultivate.\nWithout the Dao, what can one practice to return to the root and revert to the origin,\nTo preserve life and perfect form?\n\nAlas!\nThe celestial mechanism of blending with the world and harmonizing one’s radiance—\nIt may be spoken of to those who know,\nBut is difficult to convey to those who do not.\n\n*Wuzhen Pian*, Direct Pointers, Scroll Three\nFive-character quatrain (symbolizing the Supreme Unity containing true qi):\n\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nA gentleman wears white silk.\nSeen, they cannot be used;\nUsed, they cannot be seen.\nIn the dim and indistinct, they meet;\nIn the distant and obscure, they transform.\nIn a flash, flames soar—\nThe true person emerges of itself.\n\nSpiritual awareness is the yin within yang, possessing softness.\nNature governs life, pertains to wood—wood’s color is azure,\nHence, \"a maiden dons azure robes.\"\nTrue awareness is the yang within yin, possessing firmness.\nEmotion governs restraint, pertains to metal—metal’s color is white,\nHence, \"a gentleman wears white silk.\"\n\nYet nature and emotion have distinctions of precelestial and postcelestial.\nThe postcelestial is qi prevailing over deluded emotion,\nThe nature and emotion of conditioned qi—\nTangible and visible, they cannot be used.\nThe precelestial is the true emotion of original nature,\nThe nature and emotion of true emptiness—\nFormless and imageless, they are what is used,\nYet cannot be seen.\n\nBecause they cannot be seen,\nThey reside in the dim and indistinct, the distant and obscure.\n\"Dim and indistinct,\" \"distant and obscure\"—\nThis is having qi without substance,\nInvisible, inaudible, untouchable—\nHow could one congeal them to form the elixir?\n\nYet though invisible, inaudible, untouchable,\nThe nature of spiritual awareness and the emotion of true awareness\nSometimes meet in the dim and indistinct,\nTransform in the distant and obscure.\nAt this moment of meeting and transformation,\nSpirit and clarity withdraw in silence,\nGathered into the furnace of creation,\nRefined with fire—\nIn an instant, precelestial qi\nEmerges from the formless,\nCongeals into form,\nAnd the true person appears in the dark chamber.\n\nThis is the symbolic image of returning the elixir,\nThe so-called \"elixir formed within an hour.\"\nWhen the true person appears,\nIt is the union of true yin and true yang within,\nA spark of life emerging—\nThis is the sacred embryo,\nNot the ten-month gestation of a body beyond the body.\n\nCould the appearance of a body beyond the body\nOccur in an instant,\nTranscending the womb and transforming the bones,\nA body beyond the body?\nThis poem by the immortal elder symbolizes the Supreme Unity containing true qi.\nIf one asks about the meaning of the true person’s appearance,\nI would say it is the Supreme Unity containing true qi.\n\n*Twelve Western Rivers* (to symbolize the twelve months).\nThe immortal elder said:\n\"West is the direction of metal,\nRiver is the body of water,\nMoon is the function of the elixir.\"\nFirst of the twelve.\n\nThe inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir,\nWhen the inner is unobstructed, the outer must also be unobstructed.\nThe cinnabar head harmonizes as if of the same kind,\nWith two distinct functions in nurturing and refining.\n\nWithin resides the natural true fire,\nIn the furnace, blazing and ever-red.\nThe outer furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort,\nFor nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed in subtlety.\n\nThe inner elixir is the numinous knowing of numinous nature,\nThe outer elixir is the true knowing of true essence.\nAs numinous knowing resides in the human heart,\nWhen the heart takes charge, it borrows the numinous to generate delusion—hence the inner elixir.\nAs true knowing abides in the Dao-heart,\nWhen the Dao-heart retreats, true knowing remains unmanifest—hence the outer elixir.\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family,\nEmerging from the same source with different names—thus the inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir.\n\nThe inner elixir serves to cultivate nature, and one must thoroughly understand it;\nThe outer elixir serves to cultivate life, and one must also thoroughly understand it.\nAs the ancient scripture says:\n\"To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost flaw in practice,\nTo cultivate nature without cultivating life makes it difficult for the yin spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas.\"\nThus, when the inner is unobstructed, the outer must also be unobstructed.\n\nNature is yin, life is yang.\nThe great elixir of golden liquid is attained by taking the true yin and true yang—qi of the same kind from the two arcs—\nAnd harmonizing them into one.\nIf one cultivates life without cultivating nature, or cultivates nature without cultivating life,\nIt is solitary yin or solitary yang, and the great elixir will not form—\nThus nature and life must be cultivated together.\n\nYet nature has its own function, and life has its own function;\nNature pertains to the Dharma-body, life to the illusory body.\nThe two functions of nurturing and refining differ greatly—\nThus the work must proceed in two stages.\n\nThe Dao of cultivating nature is the Dao of non-action,\nNon-action emphasizes stillness, requiring no deliberate effort,\nOnly guarding the center and embracing the One.\nWithin the inner furnace, true fire naturally blazes, ever-red—\nThis is the use of the gentle fire for nurturing.\n\nAs for the Dao of cultivating life, it is the Dao of action;\nAction emphasizes movement, requiring the outer furnace’s increase and decrease,\nDiligent effort in forging and refining—\nThis is the use of the martial fire for decoction.\n\nTo increase is to augment the insufficiency of true knowing—\nTo firmly uphold what is good.\nTo decrease is to reduce the excess of numinous knowing—\nTo cast aside cleverness and destroy cunning.\nWhen increase reaches its limit, and decrease reaches its end,\nNature stabilizes and life congeals, the true seed is attained—\nOnly then is it wondrous beyond compare.\n\nThese two functions of nature and life,\nOnce the outer elixir is accomplished,\nAre gathered into the tripod to become the inner elixir.\nFor what has not yet arrived is outer, and what has arrived is inner—\nThus when metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returned elixir.\n\n**Second**\n\nThis elixir is most divine and sacred,\nYet I fear your karmic endowment is too meager to bear it.\nHarmonizing lead and mercury need not take a full morning—\nEarly signs of the mysterious pearl will soon appear.\n\nIf a determined practitioner can refine it,\nWhy not dwell in the marketplace or court?\nThe work is easy, the medicine not distant—\nYet if one reveals the secret, others may laugh.\n\nThe previous verse clarified the inner and outer elixirs;\nThis verse speaks of the practice of the outer elixir.\nThe Dao of the golden elixir is most divine and sacred,\nIts cultivation yields immediate results, swiftly elevating one to sagehood—\nBut I fear one’s karmic endowment may be too shallow to receive it.\n\nWhat is hardest to obtain in the golden elixir\nIs the true lead of true knowing and the true mercury of numinous knowing.\nIf one recognizes true knowing and numinous knowing and harmonizes them,\nThen hardness and softness balance, nature and essence become one.\nWithout waiting for a full morning,\nThe signs of innate knowing and innate ability will soon appear—\nLike a dark pearl suddenly shining with light.\n\nFor the root of innate knowing and innate ability,\nBuried for so long, cannot emerge on its own.\nNow, with true knowing and numinous knowing united as one,\nThough the root of innate knowing and innate ability may not yet be fully restored,\nA spark of life already takes form in the realm of the indistinct and obscure.\nWith this spark of life, from subtle to manifest,\nIt can gradually be restored to wholeness.\nThe \"signs\" are the foretaste of wholeness.\n\nIf a determined practitioner diligently cultivates it,\nThere is no need to flee the world or leave the dust—\nWhy not dwell in the marketplace or court?\nFor the Dao of the golden elixir has its medicine ready at hand,\nThe work is simple and easy, requiring no external pursuit—\nIt lies within the very person.\nYet if one reveals it, others may laugh.\n\nFor laughter is the shared path of the mundane and the sage:\nHeaven and humanity share the same principle—\nThe difference lies only in compliance or defiance.\n\n**Third**\n\nThe White Tiger’s first classic is a supreme treasure,\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\nKnow that the source of the highest good runs deep—\nNot to be compared with ordinary medicines.\n\nIf one wishes to refine the ninefold transmutation,\nFirst refine the self and hold the heart.\nFollow the time to gather it, determining its floating or sinking,\nAdvance the fire with caution to avoid peril.\n\nThe previous verse spoke of harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir.\nYet to harmonize lead and mercury,\nOne must first recognize the great medicine of true knowing—true lead—\nBefore proceeding.\n\nTrue knowing is true essence,\nIn symbolic terms, the White Tiger’s first classic,\nOr the Flowery Pond’s divine water—\nTrue essence hidden within delusive emotion.\nEmotion pertains to metal, hence the White Tiger.\nThough true essence is concealed within delusive emotion,\nIt sometimes reveals itself—\nThe heart of heaven and earth reappears, sprouting the seed of life—\nHence the first classic.\n\n\"First\" means beginning, \"classic\" means the constant Dao.\nThe beginning of the constant Dao is the arising of something from nothing,\nYin containing yang, the mother of all things—\nThis is the spark of life.\nThis spark of life is the root of sagehood and worthiness,\nThe foundation of buddhahood and immortality—\nHence it is called the supreme treasure.\n\nThis spark of life is also called the Flowery Pond’s divine water.\nThe Flowery Pond is the single aperture of the primal pass, the gate of all wonders.\nAs it harbors the spark of life, it is called the Flowery Pond;\nAs this spark of life orders the hundred bones and cleanses the five viscera,\nIt is called divine water.\n\nThe spark of life, refined by fire and tempered, congeals without scattering, enduring unbroken—hence it is called true gold. The first classic, divine water, and true gold are all but one thing: the nature of supreme goodness.\n\nSupreme goodness is perfect goodness. Perfect goodness is without evil, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, like water with its source—deep-rooted and far-flowing, benefiting all things without exhaustion. This is the medicine that preserves life and completes form, the most authentic remedy, unlike ordinary medicines of herbs, trees, metals, or stones.\n\nYet this remedy lies hidden within the acquired, appearing only fleetingly, vanishing as soon as it arises, unable to remain long. If one wishes to refine it through nine cycles and make it eternally indestructible, one must first temper the self and hold the heart, dissolving the guest qi and worldly passions, gathering it at the proper time to stabilize its floating and sinking.\n\nAwareness resides in the human heart; when the human heart stirs, awareness takes flight, tending to float. True knowing abides in the Dao-heart; when the Dao-heart is obscured, true knowing hides, tending to sink. Tempering the self and holding the heart means refining away the awareness of the human heart, causing the floating to sink. Gathering at the proper time means drawing forth the Dao-heart, causing the sinking true knowing to float.\n\nReversing floating and sinking, the Dao-heart governs the human heart, the human heart submits to the Dao-heart, true knowing commands awareness, and awareness nourishes true knowing. When the human heart is still and the Dao-heart abides, true knowing and awareness share the same qi, like branches of one tree—then the golden elixir may be attained.\n\nYet while the medicine is easy to recognize, the firing times are most difficult. The work of advancing the fire must discern whether the medicine is ripe or tender, whether the timing is urgent or leisurely, auspicious or inauspicious. If one acts recklessly, not only will there be no benefit, but harm will follow—hence it is said, \"Advancing the fire, one must guard against great danger.\"\n\n---\n\nIf you would have true lead retain mercury,\nThe lord must not part from his minister.\nWood and metal, though sundered, meet not by chance—\nAll depends on the matchmaker’s summoning.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness.\nThey devour and yet embrace each other,\nOnly then does the man-child conceive.\n\nThis verse speaks of gathering the medicine through the work of tempering the self. Tempering the self aims to bring the three families into union. The way of the golden elixir is simply the two words: firmness and softness.\n\nThe central firmness of firmness is true knowing, symbolized as true lead; the central softness of softness is awareness, symbolized as true mercury. Taking these two substances and uniting them forms the elixir. But if true knowing does not manifest, awareness easily scatters—thus true knowing is the substance that restrains awareness. Yet while true knowing can restrain awareness, awareness in turn nourishes true knowing—thus awareness is the minister of true knowing.\n\nIf awareness is not first stabilized, true knowing will not appear—hence it is said, \"If you would have true lead retain mercury, the lord must not part from his minister.\" The lord refers to the union of true knowing and awareness, firmness and softness in harmony. True knowing is the sovereign; awareness is the minister. If the minister is disobedient, the sovereign cannot act.\n\nFor true knowing and awareness contend in the space of a hair’s breadth: when awareness is exhausted, true knowing appears; when true knowing abides, awareness submits. When true knowing abides, it is firm and strong; when awareness is still, it is soft and yielding. Firm strength and soft compliance—nature and feeling unite.\n\nThus the Dao of the elixir takes true lead and true mercury as its two medicinal ingredients. The lead of true knowing pertains to metal in its essence; the mercury of awareness pertains to wood in its nature. In the acquired, essence moves west and nature moves east. Like metal and wood, they are sundered, each in its own domain, unable to meet.\n\nWere it not for true nature as the medium, true essence and true nature would not appear, true knowing and awareness would not unite. True sincerity is true intention, also called true earth. When true earth appears, metal and wood naturally merge; when true sincerity flows, nature and essence naturally unite—thus true sincerity is the matchmaker of true essence and true nature.\n\nTrue nature is wood, governing compliance and kindness; true essence is metal, governing firmness and righteousness. When nature and essence are harmonized by sincerity within, wood’s nature loves metal’s essence and submits to righteousness, metal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness. Nature and essence unite, firmness and softness respond, kindness and righteousness are complete, true knowing and awareness share the same qi.\n\nThey devour and yet embrace each other, nature settles and essence is forgotten. The qi of the primordial arises from emptiness, congealing into a single grain of millet—thus the sacred embryo takes form, what is called \"the man-child conceives.\"\n\n---\n\nWho is the maiden of sixteen?\n\nWhere dwells the gentleman of nine-three?\nHe calls himself the liquid of wood and the essence of metal,\nYet when meeting earth, they form three lineages.\nOnly with Ding Gong’s forging and tempering\nDo husband and wife first unite in joyous union.\n\nThe river chariot dares not pause for even a moment,\nBut carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the three families meeting and the sacred embryo forming.\nYet without true fire’s forging and tempering, the sacred embryo cannot take shape.\nTwo is the number of yin fire, eight the number of yin wood—hence the maiden.\nNine is the number of yang metal, three the number of yang wood—hence the gentleman.\nWood’s liquid is fire, wood begetting fire as one lineage;\nMetal’s essence is water, metal begetting water as one lineage;\nEarth, dwelling at the center, forms its own lineage—thus the Five Phases divide into three lineages.\nWhen the three lineages converge, they merge into one—this is called the Five Phases complete.\n\nIn the practice of the Dao, original nature and original spirit form the wood-fire lineage;\nOriginal essence and original essence form the metal-water lineage;\nOriginal qi forms the earth lineage—these are the inner three lineages.\nBenevolence and ritual belong to wood-fire as one lineage,\nRighteousness and wisdom belong to metal-water as another,\nTrust belongs to earth as the third—these are the outer three lineages.\nThe cultivator governs the outer three lineages through the inner three,\nAnd fulfills the inner three lineages through the outer three,\nUltimately uniting the three lineages into one as the culmination.\n\nYet these three lineages must be cultivated with courage and vigor,\nWith single-minded devotion and the resolve of death itself,\nBefore they can return to the one lineage.\nDing Gong’s forging and tempering is precisely this courageous and vigorous cultivation.\nThrough courageous and vigorous cultivation,\nWhat lacks benevolence must attain benevolence,\nWhat lacks righteousness must attain righteousness,\nWhat lacks ritual must attain ritual,\nWhat lacks wisdom must attain wisdom,\nWhat lacks trust must attain trust.\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom all return to the one trust,\nWhile nature, essence, spirit, and essence transform into a single qi.\nThe three lineages harmonize, firmness and softness respond,\nNature and essence become as one—only then do husband and wife unite in joyous union.\n\nOnce husband and wife unite in joy,\nThe longer the union, the greater the effort,\nThe fire’s work unceasing,\nA single qi achieves completion,\nInevitably reaching pure yang,\nSilent and scentless, and only then does it cease.\n\nThus it is said: the river chariot dares not pause for even a moment,\nBut carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.\nThe river chariot is the true qi of the north,\nNot the alchemical notion of circulating kidney qi from the tailbone up the spine to the crown of the head.\nRather, it is the completion of a single qi,\nWith water aiding fire, fire and water simmering without interruption—\nLike a waterwheel in a river,\nCarrying water up and down,\nTurning day and night without ceasing.\nKunlun is the ancestor of all mountains;\nTo carry it to the summit of Kunlun’s peak\nIs the three flowers gathering at the crown,\nThe five qi returning to their origin,\nEntering the state of true emptiness and wondrous being,\nUnknowing and unperceiving,\nAbiding in the realm where one follows the decree of the Emperor.\n\nIts sixth:\nSeven returns—cinnabar returns to its origin,\nNine returns—golden liquid returns to truth.\n\nDo not count from *yin* to *shen* or from *zi* to *kun*—\nOnly let the Five Phases achieve their standard.\nIt is but a single taste of mercury,\nCirculating through all the celestial stations.\nWhen yin and yang’s numbers are complete, they naturally attain the numinous;\nHow could their entry and exit ever depart from the Mysterious Female?\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the Five Phases clustering together,\nOf applying fire to refine and temper—\nThus may success be achieved.\nYet refinement requires knowing the true principle of the seven returns and nine reversions.\nSeven is the yang number of fire; nine, the yang number of metal.\nThe numinous knowing of essence is yielding, concealing within it deviant fire.\nWhen deviant fire is consumed, true fire arises—\nLike quicksilver congealing into cinnabar,\nForever becoming a substance neither flying nor scattering:\nFire has returned to its origin.\nThe true knowing of emotion is firm, containing within it dry metal.\nWhen dry metal is transformed, true metal is purified—\nLike impure metal refined into liquid,\nForever becoming the most limpid and luminous gold:\nMetal has returned to its truth.\n\nThis is the meaning of the seven returns and nine reversions in the alchemical canon.\nYet those of heterodox schools,\nCounting from *zi* to *shen* as nine reversions,\nAnd from *yin* to *kun* as seven returns—\nHow could they know the meaning of seven returns and nine reversions?\nWithout knowing the meaning of seven returns and nine reversions,\nHow could they know when the Five Phases have achieved their standard?\n\nWhen the Five Phases achieve their standard:\nFire returns to its origin, then from fire wood emerges, and the spirit becomes numinous.\nNuminous, the knowing of essence remains undimmed.\nMetal returns to truth, then from water metal is born, and essence becomes unified.\nUnified, true knowing abides constantly.\nThe knowing of essence undimmed, true knowing constant—\nTrue knowing is the knowing of essence; the knowing of essence is true knowing.\nMetal, wood, water, fire—\nThe Four Images harmonize and merge,\nReturning to the center.\nThe Five Phases become a single qi,\nNeither biased nor partial,\nWholly the pattern of Heaven.\nThus the Five Phases achieve their standard.\n\nYet the work of achieving the Five Phases’ standard\nIs entirely the great medicine of metal within water.\nThe mercury employed is metal within water—\nMetal within water is still metal within water,\nEver the true emotion of true knowing.\nTrue knowing contains within it the primordial true unity of qi,\nThe root of the Five Phases,\nThe origin of the Four Images.\nIn movement, it generates yang;\nIn stillness, it generates yin,\nCirculating through the positions of the Four Images and Five Phases.\nIn the Dao of return and reversion,\nWhen the time is yang, advance the yang fire to gather this true knowing;\nWhen the time is yin, apply the yin tally to nurture this knowing.\nWhen the numbers of yang fire and yin tally are complete,\nThe Five Phases blend and transform.\nGood knowing and good ability,\nStill and unmoving,\nYet responsive and instantly penetrating—\nNaturally attaining the numinous.\nThe numinous is the unknowable of yin and yang.\nWhen yin and yang are unknowable,\nThe sacred embryo congeals—\nCalled the Valley Spirit.\nThe Valley Spirit does not die;\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nIs called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen the numbers of yin and yang are complete,\nThe Mysterious Female is established.\nOnce the Mysterious Female is established,\nThe Valley Spirit enters and exits through the gate of the Mysterious Female—\nAttaining longevity without death,\nThe Dao of return and reversion is fulfilled.\nAs it is said:\n“To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.”\n\n---\n\nIts seventh:\nWithin the male lies the essence of the female,\nEmbracing yin yet holding fast to yang’s essence.\nWhen the two blend, the medicine is complete—\nTransmuting the soul to refinement, the spirit to sanctity.\n\nTrust in a single grain of the golden elixir:\nA serpent that swallows it instantly becomes a dragon;\nA chicken that feeds on it transforms into a *luan* or *peng*,\nSoaring into the pure realm of true yang.\n\n*(Alternative readings: \"embracing yet holding fast,\" \"the spirit to immortality, the soul to sanctity,\" \"may also\")*\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of seven returns and nine reversions,\nWhich require the numbers of yin and yang to be complete.\nYet in applying yin and applying yang,\nOne must recognize true yin and true yang.\nWithin the male lies the essence of the female:\nIn the hexagrams, this is the emptiness within *Li*;\nIn the human, it is the numinous knowing concealed within the human heart.\nEmbracing yin yet holding fast to yang’s essence:\nIn the hexagrams, this is the fullness within *Kan*;\nIn the human, it is the true knowing possessed by the heart of Dao.\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing—\nThese two medicinal substances,\nOnly when blended can the elixir be formed.\nThe *po* is yang within yin, the spirit of true knowing;\nThe *hun* is yin within yang, the spirit of numinous knowing.\nWhen the *po* is refined, yang is scant;\nWhen the *hun* prevails, yin is excessive.\nScant yang and excessive yin—\nBiased and not centered,\nThe golden elixir cannot form.\nOnly when true knowing and numinous knowing meet,\nAnd the *hun* and *po* likewise return to the center,\nTransforming into true nature and true emotion—\nYin and yang blend as one,\nThe pattern of Heaven shines forth,\nHuman desires vanish.\nGood knowing and good ability,\nRound and luminous,\nPure and bare,\nUnadorned and free—\nA single grain of the golden elixir,\nSuspended in the great void,\nIlluminates the three thousand great thousand worlds,\nTranscending all directions, obstructions, and hindrances.\n\nThis elixir—\nIf a person swallows a single grain, they instantly become an immortal;\nIf a serpent swallows a grain, it too transforms into a dragon;\nIf a chicken feeds on a grain, it too becomes a *luan* or *peng*,\nSoaring straight into the pure realm of true yang.\nYet the serpent swallowing and the chicken feeding\nAlso allegorize the method of the elixir.\nThe serpent pertains to fire, in the south as *Li*;\nThe dragon pertains to wood, in the east as *Zhen*.\nThe chicken is in the west, pertaining to metal as *Dui*;\nThe *luan* and *peng* are near water, in the north as *Kan*.\nWhen the serpent swallows and becomes a dragon, wood emerges from fire;\nWhen the chicken feeds and becomes a *luan* or *peng*, metal is born from water.\nWood emerging from fire, metal born from water—\nMetal and wood intermingle,\nWater and fire aid each other,\nA single qi blends all,\nNeither being nor non-being established,\nSelf and other return to emptiness.\nForm and spirit both wondrously enter the sagely—\nThat which cannot be known is called the numinous.\nHaving shed the mortal world,\nDwelling in the realm of pure yang—\nHow could this be empty words?\n\n---\n\nIts eighth:\nWhen Heaven and Earth first meet in *Pi* and *Tai*,\nAt dawn and dusk, keenly recognize *Zhun* and *Meng*.\nSpokes gather at the hub as water flows east—\nThe wonder lies in the art of drawing and adding.\n\nAttain the One, and all things are complete;\nDo not divide north, south, east, or west.\nReduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—\nThe treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir\nIs the Dao of creation and transformation.\nThe Dao of creation and transformation\nIs the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nWithin the span of a year, in the month of *yin*, Heaven’s qi ascends while Earth’s qi descends, forming *Tai*; in the month of *shen*, Earth’s qi ascends while Heaven’s qi descends, forming *Pi*. Within the span of a day, the hour of *zi* marks the dawn’s beginning—at *zi*, yang qi stirs within as yin qi emerges outward, forming *Zhun*; the hour of *wu* marks the dusk’s beginning—at *wu*, yang qi halts without as yin qi arises within, forming *Meng*. *Pi* and *Tai* are the yearly ascent and descent of yin and yang in spring and autumn; *Zhun* and *Meng* are the daily ebb and flow of yin and yang at dawn and dusk. Observe the alternation of *Pi* and *Tai* as Heaven and Earth meet, and you will recognize the waxing and waning of *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk. For the daily rhythm of yin and yang mirrors the yearly rhythm of yin and yang. Yet whether in a year or a day, yin and yang are but a single qi, circulating in perpetual motion.\n\nThe cultivator of the Dao models the seasonal nodes of *Pi* and *Tai*, aligns with the moments of *Zhun* and *Meng* at dawn and dusk, advances the yang fire when yang arises, and moves the yin tally when yin prevails. Yang’s firmness and yin’s softness, timed without error, gather power and amass the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images. Like thirty spokes converging at the hub to form a wheel, like a thousand streams flowing together toward the sea, all becomes a single qi, and the golden elixir congeals. Though the marvel of the golden elixir’s congealment lies entirely in the art of drawing and adding: *drawing* removes false yin and false yang; *adding* replenishes true yin and true yang. When false yin departs, true yang appears; when false yang dissolves, true yin arises. True yin and true yang return to central equilibrium, merging into one. True knowing and numinous knowing unite, nature and emotion harmonize, and the original face of innate knowledge and innate ability is restored. How wondrous is the work of drawing and adding!\n\nIn cultivating the elixir, one must first discern true yin and true yang, and further recognize the primordial, undifferentiated qi of the One. This qi existed before the chaos of *Hongmeng* divided, when yin and yang had not yet separated. Contained, it is true emptiness; expressed, it is wondrous existence. Its image is gold within water; its essence is Heaven’s inherent goodness; its function is the mind of the Dao, rooted in essence and unity. The elixir method seeks only this single great medicine of the Dao-mind. Though this Dao-mind is but one flavor, it governs the qi of the Five Phases and embodies their virtues. For the Dao-mind arises from the water of the One—the beginning of all numbers—one containing five, five returning to one. Yet when it returns to the One, it can no longer be called the Dao-mind, but only the undifferentiated principle of Heaven.\n\nThus the Confucians call this undifferentiated principle the Supreme Ultimate; the Daoists call it the golden elixir; the Buddhists call it perfect enlightenment. The ancient scriptures’ saying, “Attain the One, and all things are complete,” refers precisely to this. Once the One is attained, the treasure of life is already in hand, and there is no need to distinguish north, south, east, or west, nor to employ the method of amassing and gathering. One need only guard the Dao-mind against the human mind, reducing and reducing again. All guest qi of the human mind must be transformed away, leaving only the soft, compliant numinous knowing—then the human mind, too, becomes the Dao-mind.\n\nFor the human mind is inhabited by the consciousness-spirit, which carries the impressions of past kalpas, the accumulated habits of this life, and the perverse qi of one’s physical constitution. If these roots of calamity are not entirely diminished, even a trace left behind may seize an opportunity to arise, causing leaks in the treasure of life and wasting all prior effort. Hence the caution: “guard the prior work,” and “the treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.” The ancient immortals said: “If a single speck of yang qi remains, one does not die; if a single speck of yin qi remains, one does not ascend.” Thus, after obtaining the elixir, one must uproot the seeds of beginningless kalpas and the cycle of birth and death, ensuring the treasure of life belongs entirely to oneself and remains eternally unbroken.\n\nIts ninth:\nAt the winter solstice, the yang returns with one yang line;\nOver three decades, each line adds one yang.\n\nAt mid-month, the *Fu* hexagram returns with the morning tide at the new moon,\nWhen the full moon wanes, the *Qian* ends and the *Gou* portends.\nThe sun further divides into cold and heat,\nYang revives at midnight, rising again in the middle of the night.\nAt noon, the *Gou* hexagram appears as one yin arrives—\nIn refining the elixir, one must know dusk and dawn.\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the work of drawing out and adding,\nTeaching one to emulate the creative transformations of heaven and earth at dusk and dawn.\nIn a year’s cycle of dusk and dawn:\nAt the winter solstice of the eleventh month, one yang is born,\nEach thirty days adding one yang line.\nThus, in the eleventh month, the *zi* branch sees one yang born, forming *Fu* (䷗);\nIn the twelfth month, the *chou* branch sees two yang born, forming *Lin* (䷒);\nIn the first month, the *yin* branch sees three yang born, forming *Tai* (䷓);\nIn the second month, the *mao* branch sees four yang born, forming *Da Zhuang* (䷡);\nIn the third month, the *chen* branch sees five yang born, forming *Guai* (䷪);\nIn the fourth month, the *si* branch sees six yang born, forming *Qian* (䷀)—\nThese are the six yang hexagrams.\nBy the fifth month, the *wu* branch sees one yin born, forming *Gou* (䷫),\nEach month adding one yin line for thirty days.\nIn the sixth month, the *wei* branch sees two yin born, forming *Dun* (䷠);\nIn the seventh month, the *shen* branch sees three yin born, forming *Pi* (䷋);\nIn the eighth month, the *you* branch sees four yin born, forming *Guan* (䷌);\nIn the ninth month, the *xu* branch sees five yin born, forming *Bo* (䷖);\nIn the tenth month, the *hai* branch sees six yin born, forming *Kun* (䷁)—\nThese are the six yin hexagrams.\nThe six yang months are dawn; the six yin months are dusk—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a year.\n\nWithin a single month, between the dark and new moon,\nThe sun and moon conjoin, the moon receives the sun’s light,\nAnd after three days, yang light begins to emerge from the sea,\nThe tides responding as *Fu*.\nEvery two and a half days, one yang line is added.\nBy the fifteenth day, the moon and sun face each other,\nIts radiance full and round as *Qian*.\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day—these are the six yang hexagrams.\nWhen the full moon wanes and *Qian* ends,\nFrom the sixteenth to the eighteenth day, one yin is born,\nThe yang light waning as *Gou* begins to portend.\nEvery two and a half days, one yin line is added.\nBy the thirtieth day, the moon’s light is entirely gone,\nLeaving only its dark body as *Kun*.\nFrom the sixteenth to the thirtieth day—these are the six yin hexagrams.\nTwo and a half days make one *hou*,\nTwelve *hou* traverse the six yang and six yin hexagrams—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a month.\n\nWithin a single day, it further divides into cold and heat.\nEach day at midnight, the *zi* hour, one yang is born as *Fu*,\nEach hour adding one yang line.\nBy the *si* hour, six yang are born as *Qian*.\nAt noon, one yin is born as *Gou*,\nEach hour adding one yin line,\nBy the *hai* hour, six yin are born as *Kun*.\nThe twelve hours traverse the six yin and six yang hexagrams—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a day.\n\nThe sage transposes the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a year into a month,\nThe yin-yang dusk and dawn of a month into a day,\nAnd the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a day into a single hour.\nOne hour has eight *ke*,\nEach *ke* fifteen *fen*,\nEight *ke* totaling one hundred twenty *fen*.\nThe first four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yang,\nThe latter four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yin.\nFurther transposing the yin-yang dusk and dawn of an hour into a single *ke*,\nDividing it into fifteen *fen*:\nThe first seven and a half *fen* are yang,\nThe latter seven and a half *fen* are yin.\nWithin a fleeting moment, the great medicine is gathered,\nReturned to the crucible of creation,\nRefined with yang fire and yin tally into the elixir—\nThis is what is meant by “within the unbroken hour, distinguish *zi* and *wu*;\nwithin the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*.”\nOne must only recognize the dusk and dawn of yin’s birth and yang’s birth.\nKnowing dusk and dawn,\nThe creative transformations of a day, a month, a year\nAre present within a single hour and *ke*.\nThose blind fools of the world,\nSome sit in *zi-wu* meditation for a day,\nSome practice qi circulation at the new and full moon,\nSome cultivate at the winter and summer solstices—\nHow could they understand the principle of dusk and dawn?\n\n---\n\nIts tenth:\nWithout discerning the Five Phases and Four Images,\nHow can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?\nBefore ever hearing of the firing times of elixir refinement,\nThey rashly claim reclusive mastery.\nUnwilling to reflect on their own errors,\nThey further teach others their mistaken path,\nLeading them astray into eternal delusion—\nHow can such heartless deceit be endured?\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the need to know yin-yang dusk and dawn in elixir refinement;\nThis verse follows closely, addressing those who do not understand yin-yang dusk and dawn.\nThe Dao of immortality originally aims to perfect oneself and then others,\nTo cultivate the Way and then virtue.\nYet those lost on the path\nDo not grasp the true principles of the Five Phases and Four Images,\nNor comprehend the allegories of cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver.\nUnclear about the medicine, ignorant of the firing times,\nThey dabble in peripheral minor arts,\nPresuming themselves enlightened and claiming reclusive mastery.\nUnwilling to reflect on their own errors,\nThey further teach others their mistaken path,\nOne blind man leading many blind—\nMisguiding others into eternal delusion,\nNever to transcend.\nSuch heartless deceit\nCondemns them to the Avīci Hell,\nWith no hope of escape—\nHow can they ever attain the Dao?\n\n---\n\nIts eleventh:\nVirtue cultivated beyond eight hundred,\nHidden merits accumulated to three thousand.\nEqualizing self and others, friend and foe,\nOnly then does one fulfill the immortal’s original vow.\nTigers and rhinos cannot harm,\nThe inescapable fire and burning house cannot bind.\nAfter the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to heaven,\nSteadily riding the phoenix chariot and simurgh carriage.\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of peripheral paths and external teachings,\nThose who obscure the Dao and only harm virtue, unable to cultivate it.\nThis verse speaks of cultivating the Way and then necessarily cultivating virtue.\nCultivating the Way is the work of self-perfection;\nCultivating virtue is the work of benefiting others.\nThe cultivation of the Way has limits,\nBut the cultivation of virtue is boundless.\nThus, after attaining the immortal Dao,\nOne must fulfill three thousand merits,\nComplete eight hundred deeds,\nForget self and others,\nTreat friend and foe as one—\nMeasuring with heaven and earth,\nEncompassing the ten thousand things,\nVirtue and power both perfected,\nOnly then is the original vow fulfilled.\nAt this stage,\nInner and outer are both empty,\nExistence and non-existence are not established,\nForm and spirit both wondrous—\nTigers and rhinos cannot harm,\nBlades and weapons cannot touch,\nThe inescapable fire and burning house cannot bind.\n\nWhen the celestial talisman descends to summon,\nSteadily rides the phoenix chariot and simurgh carriage,\nAscending in broad daylight—\nA true man’s work accomplished, name achieved,\nHow joyous indeed!\n\nThe twelfth:\nThe love between Cowherd and Weaver Girl stems from Daoist affinity,\nTortoise and snake naturally share kindred endowment.\nToad and crow meet at new and full moons in harmonious union,\nThe two qi mutually nourish and revolve.\nThis is but the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—\nWho grasps this true essence?\nWhen yin and yang are blocked and estranged, faults arise;\nHow then can one attain the enduring constancy of heaven and earth?\n\n*(One version reads \"abyss\" for \"true essence.\")*\nThe above eleven lyrics all speak of the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar,\nWhich requires the union of true yin and true yang, medicines of the same kind,\nTo form the elixir.\nYet some may suspect this is forced fabrication—\nIn truth, it is not forced but the natural operation of the Way.\nThus, this lyric summarizes the preceding meaning,\nUrging practitioners to thoroughly investigate the underlying principle.\nFor instance, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the seventh night,\nTortoise and snake unite by kind,\nToad and crow conjoin at dark and full moons—\nAll are the mutual resonance of yin and yang,\nTheir natural union,\nThe wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nFor the Dao of Heaven and Earth is the Dao of one yin, one yang.\nYin and yang mutually sustain each other,\nA single qi flowing ceaselessly—\nYin becomes yang, yang becomes yin,\nYin and yang alternate,\nThe four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born,\nLife’s vitality unending,\nThus enduring through all ages.\nIf a cultivator fails to grasp this true essence,\nAbandons the principle of yin-yang creation,\nClings to emptiness or fixates on forms,\nForces actions unnaturally,\nThey will only deepen the estrangement of yin and yang.\nNot only will this fail to benefit life and destiny,\nBut it will harm them.\nHow can one avoid faults and transgressions,\nYet still hope for the enduring constancy of heaven and earth,\nTo become an immortal beyond death?\nIs this possible? No.\n\nThe Dao of heaven’s constancy and earth’s endurance\nIs the Dao of true yin and true yang in union.\nWhen true yin and true yang unite,\nVital energy flourishes within,\nCongealing the sacred embryo.\nFrom non-being to being,\nFrom being to non-being,\nShedding the illusory body to emerge in the true body—\nOnly then can one attain the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.\nIf a cultivator seeks this enduring constancy,\nApart from true yin and true yang, there is no other method.\n\n*Appended: \"Moon Over the West River\" (to symbolize the moon’s radiance)*\nThe elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nFurther, delve into the true origin of nature,\nAnd master the wondrous function of non-arising.\nNo need to await another life—\nBefore one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\nEver since the Dragon Girl accomplished this work,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\nThis lyric and the five following quatrains,\nAccording to the Immortal Elder’s preface,\nAre not part of the main collection of *Awakening to Reality*,\nBut belong to the external collection.\nExamining their meaning,\nThey expound the Dao of first cultivating life, then cultivating nature.\nThe three commentaries by Xue, Lu, and Chen,\nBecause they discuss the cultivation of life,\nInclude them in the main collection—here, we follow their example.\n\nMaster Yuanduzi said:\n\"A single spark of yang essence,\nHidden within the mountain of form,\nNot in the heart or kidneys,\nBut in the primordial pass of the One Aperture.\"\nThis single spark of yang essence is the elixir.\nHidden within the mountain of form,\nIt is the supreme treasure of the physical body.\nThe elixir is no other thing—\nIt is the primordial, supremely yang spark of essence,\nAlso called the primordial true unity of qi,\nOr the vast and upright qi.\nConcealed, it is true emptiness;\nManifest, it is wondrous being.\nIts substance is innate goodness,\nIts function is the mind of Dao—\nThe supreme treasure within the human form,\nNot a thing possessed by heart or kidneys,\nBut stored within the primordial pass.\nThe One Aperture of the primordial pass\nHas no location, no place,\nNo form, no image.\nThis elixir, too, has no location, no place,\nNo form, no image.\nIt moves and rests freely,\nUnbound by form or emptiness,\nVibrant and alive,\nLike refining fire forging something solid.\nConstantly responsive, constantly still,\nConstantly still, constantly responsive,\nTransforming endlessly,\nIts wonders unfathomable.\nThough even heaven and earth’s spirits cannot grasp it,\nIt resides within the physical form,\nAble to transmute it—\nThis is what is called the Dharma-body.\nThus, the ancient immortals said,\n\"The creation of life depends on the body.\"\nDepending on the body means depending on the Dharma-body.\nWhen the Dharma-body is accomplished,\nThe sacred embryo is complete,\nThe foundation of life is firm.\nWith the work of effort completed,\nThe work of non-effort becomes manifest—\nThen one may cultivate nature.\nThe true origin of nature is the wondrous function of non-arising.\nCultivating life enables longevity,\nCultivating nature enables non-arising—\nNon-arising means no death.\nWithout arising, without ceasing,\nOne becomes one with the Great Void,\nForm and spirit both wondrous,\nForever freed from the cycle of rebirth,\nTranscending beyond heaven and earth.\nNo need to await another life—\nBefore one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\n\nFor the Dao of non-arising is sudden awakening and perfect penetration,\nAll things empty,\nDirectly transcending to the other shore.\nAt the assembly on Vulture Peak,\nThe World-Honored One expounded the Dharma.\nA seven-year-old Dragon Girl emerged from the earth,\nOffered a precious pearl,\nAnd instantly attained Buddhahood.\nThe Immortal Elder cites the case of the Dragon Girl offering the pearl\nTo illustrate the cultivation of the true emptiness of nature.\nCultivating the true emptiness of nature\nIs like the Dragon Girl offering the pearl.\nAwakening to true emptiness,\nWithout arising, without ceasing,\nIs attaining the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\nYet if the principle of life remains uncultivated,\nThe principle of nature is difficult to complete.\nDifficult to complete means that,\nThough one may attain sudden awakening and perfect penetration,\nAnd nurture the true nature,\nOne still moves within the postnatal realm,\nHaving not undergone the great fire’s refinement,\nWith slight leaks remaining,\nAnd thus cannot avoid the peril of discarding one body only to enter another.\nAfter cultivating life, one then cultivates nature.\nEmerging from the great furnace’s refinement,\nAll impurities are transformed.\nFrom this point, one practices the Dao of non-effort to cultivate nature,\nProgressing gradually to suddenness,\nAscending directly to the most supreme, wondrous awakening—\nHow then could one discard one body only to enter another?\nThus it is said:\nNo need to await another life—\nBefore one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\n\nOne knows then that in the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, one first cultivates life before cultivating nature. Five seven-character quatrains are presented, corresponding to the Five Phases of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.\n\n**I**\nThough you may comprehend the Suchness of True Thusness,\nYou still cannot avoid discarding one body only to enter another.\nWhy not further refine the Great Medicine?\nThen suddenly transcend the leakless and become a true person.\n\nThe Suchness of True Thusness is the celestial truth in its natural state, utterly free from contrivance, a nature neither form nor emptiness—what is called \"not knowing, not perceiving, yet accordant with the Emperor’s decree.\" To cultivate this nature, one must first awaken to it; having awakened to it, one must then refine it into an indestructible vajra-substance, only then can one attain liberation. If one has awakened but does not refine, life remains subject not to oneself but to heaven; when the great limit arrives, with nothing to sustain one, discarding one body to enter another cannot be avoided. After sudden awakening, one does not abandon the work of gradual cultivation: employing the yang fire and yin tally to refine the Great Medicine, transmuting the host of yin, shedding the borrowed vessel, and revealing the true body. Then one enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, is unharmed by tigers or rhinoceroses, untouched by blades or weapons, and becomes a leakless true person. In former times, after the Sixth Patriarch received transmission from the Fifth, he concealed himself among hunters in Sihui, blending with the world while preserving his light, and thus attained the true fruit. Zixian suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, yet knew this was not the ultimate matter; only after receiving transmission from Apricot Grove did he achieve great completion—all for the sake of refining the Great Medicine. If awakening to True Thusness were itself enlightenment, then what did the Fifth Patriarch transmit to the Sixth in the dead of night after the latter had awakened to \"fundamentally not a single thing\"? And why did Zixian, having suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, still seek out Apricot Grove? One knows then that sudden awakening and gradual cultivation are indispensable, whether one first awakens suddenly and then cultivates gradually, or first cultivates gradually and then awakens suddenly. Nature and life must be cultivated together, and the work must proceed in two stages. This verse moves from nature to life, from suddenness to gradualness.\n\n**II**\nEntering the womb, seizing the dwelling, or relocating—\nThose who abide in the old are called the Four Fruits’ followers.\nIf you can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger,\nWhen will the house built of true gold ever wither?\n\nEntering the womb means foreseeing a pregnant woman of wealth and nobility and, at the moment of her delivery, entering the womb oneself. Seizing the dwelling means that when a pregnant woman is about to give birth, a yin spirit always waits to enter the aperture; one preempts it and enters first, seizing the dwelling. Relocating means that when one’s body decays, one selects a robust living person and secretly exchanges bodies. Abiding in the old means that when a robust person dies suddenly, one borrows the warm corpse and enters the aperture, residing in the old dwelling. Entering the womb and seizing the dwelling are largely the same with minor differences; relocating and abiding in the old are also largely the same with minor differences. All four involve the adept manipulation of the yin spirit for free entry and exit. Buddhists call these the Four Fruits’ followers, also known as external paths, derived from the teachings of the Two Vehicles, not the supreme vehicle of awakening to True Thusness. Their distinction from ordinary people lies merely in their clarity of coming and going. In the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, when the eastern household is subdued, the dragon of true nature is tamed in the western household; the tiger of true emotion returns emotion to nature and nurtures emotion with nature. When nature and emotion unite, dragon and tiger meet, giving birth to the sixteen-foot Dharma-body, like a house built of true gold, enduring as long as heaven and earth, forever an unwithering substance—how could there be any matter of moving from this to that?\n\n**III**\nThe method of inspecting form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—\nArduous for beginners, yet smooth for those who follow.\n\nSwiftly one may wander all lands in an instant—\nYet why abandon the old house only to relocate?\n\n**Inspecting form** means suspending a mirror on the wall,\nconcentrating spirit within,\nuntil over time the yin-spirit emerges outward.\n**Closing breath** begins with holding one or two breaths,\nthen ten or a hundred,\ngradually extending to never exhaling,\nso that qi circulates internally of itself.\n**Contemplating spirit** may involve silently paying homage to the Supreme Emperor,\nor ascending a cloud-ladder to manifest the sacred,\nor envisioning the spirit exiting through the fontanel,\nor the spirit emerging from the Hall of Light—\nsuch methods are myriad.\nThough difficult for beginners,\nthe path becomes smooth with practice.\nOver years and months,\nthe yin-spirit may indeed venture outward,\nbut it remains solitary yin.\nWhen qi and blood decline,\nabandoning this body for another—\nwhat benefit does it bring to one’s nature and life?\n\n**IV**\nThe Śākya teachings urge cultivation of the Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nfor Ultimate Bliss is the golden quarter.\nOf all forms and appearances, only this is real—\nthe other two are not true, mere idle speculation.\n\nUltimate Bliss lies in the west, the west being the golden quarter;\nin human terms, it is the emotion of steadfast true knowing.\nThis emotion is firm, pure, and unyielding,\nlike gold’s nature—utterly hard, enduring without decay.\nCultivating Ultimate Bliss is cultivating this true knowing,\nthis true gold.\nWhen true gold is refined,\nit possesses both hardness and pliability,\nall dross transformed,\nits body radiant with light,\nbecoming the supreme treasure.\nOf old, Dipamkara cultivated it to manifest the jeweled pagoda,\nŚākyamuni cultivated it to manifest the sixteen-foot golden body—\namong all forms and appearances,\nonly forging this steadfast, true-knowing emotion yields true treasure.\nAll else is not real—mere idle speculation.\n\n**V**\nThe common saying holds that ordinary speech accords with the supreme Dao—\none ought to seek within it with care.\nIf in daily life one inverts the search,\nevery mote of dust on earth becomes treasure.\n\nThe Dao is not distant from humanity,\nyet humanity, in pursuing the Dao, distances itself from it.\nFor the Dao of nature and life is the constant Dao.\nThe constant Dao is the Dao of daily use—\nonly the common folk employ it daily without awareness.\nTo cultivate nature and life,\none must exhaust the principles of the constant Dao.\nIf one truly delves deeply into its principles,\nthere is no need to read a thousand scriptures or ten thousand classics—\neven in the common sayings of everyday speech,\ngreat revelations of the celestial mechanism lie hidden.\nFor instance, praising a good person, one says:\n*\"An honest person, an upright person, one with conscience,\none with Heaven’s principle, one with dignity,\none who knows contentment, who knows advance and retreat,\nwho considers past and future, who is open to all directions,\nwho stands on solid ground.\"*\nCondemning a wicked person, one says:\n*\"Not a person, without conscience, without Heaven’s principle,\nharming others to benefit oneself, deceiving oneself and others,\ninjuring Heaven and violating principle,\nfinding joy in suffering, passing off falsehood as truth,\nforgetting this and losing that, grasping east while forgetting west,\nunaware of life and death, unable to discern good from bad,\nknowing only oneself and not others,\nknowing only one side and not the other.\"*\nSuch phrases are spoken without intent,\nyet savored with meaning.\nWhy not take one or two from these common sayings\nand delve into them,\nextracting a key insight?\nIf in the midst of daily conduct one inverts the search,\nthen every mote of dust on earth is true treasure,\neverywhere the Dao,\nleft or right—\nall is fitting.\n\nScholars of the world all claim the Dao cannot be spoken of, yet refuse to apply solid, grounded effort to exhaustively investigate the principles of nature and life. Nor can they humble themselves to seek guidance from teachers and friends; even if they do seek guidance, they fail to do so with earnest sincerity. Lacking any foundation of their own, they attempt to conjure treasure from empty hands. Such conduct—even if one spends a lifetime as a renunciate, wandering to the ends of the earth—what use is it?\n\n*Wuzhen Xingzong Zhizhi*, Scroll Four\nThe *Xingzong* is an appendix to the *Wuzhen Pian*. After completing the *Wuzhen Pian*, the Immortal Elder, fearing that the directly awakened nature of the original source might remain insufficiently explored, composed additional songs, odes, and miscellaneous verses, appending them to the end to complete the Way of dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nFour Quatrains\n\n**I**\nThe Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades the Ganges’ sands,\nMyriad forms, vast arrays—unobstructed, unimpeded.\nWhen one attains the true Dharma-eye of perfect penetration,\nOnly then does one know the Three Realms are one’s home.\n\nThe Tathāgata neither comes from anywhere nor goes anywhere—it is the nature of true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, and thus its body is supremely wondrous. The nature of true emptiness has no inherent form; it is because it inwardly contains wondrous existence that wondrousness becomes its body. If emptiness were not wondrous, it would be mere quiescent, inert emptiness—not the true nature of the Tathāgata. How could it pervade the Ganges’ sands? How could the myriad forms be unobstructed and unimpeded?\n\nBecause it is wondrous and not empty, its body pervades the Ganges’ sands, nowhere impassable. Because it is empty and truly so, the myriad forms, vast arrays, cannot obstruct or impede it. Because it pervades the Ganges’ sands without obstruction or impediment, it is called the Dharma-eye of perfect penetration.\n\nPerfect means without beginning or end, without front or back, without above or below, without inside or outside—it is the Tathāgata. Penetrating means present everywhere, manifest at all times, vast enough to fill heaven and earth, minute enough to be as fine as a hair—it is the wondrous body. Only the perfect can penetrate; only through penetration is it perfect. Radiant and luminous, illuminating all circumstances, nothing can harm it. Thus, attaining the Dharma-eye is the treasury of the true Dharma-eye.\n\nWhen one attains this Dharma-eye of perfect penetration, one directly sees the Tathāgata’s wondrous body. Then, it is neither form nor emptiness—form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Heaven and hell are swept away entirely. The Three Realms are one’s home; the ten directions are one’s whole body.\n\n**II**\nLook and its form cannot be seen,\nYet when called, it responds at once.\n\nDo not say this sound is like an echo in the valley—\nif there were no valley, what sound would there be?\nLook and its form cannot be seen—it is emptiness;\ncall and it responds at once—it is being.\nFrom emptiness arises being, like an echo answering the valley.\nYet emptiness that is not empty—this is like the Tathāgata’s wondrous body.\n\nBut the Tathāgata’s wondrous body is ever empty, ever present,\never present, ever empty—why must one call before it responds?\nThat which responds to a call still harbors emptiness.\nWhere emptiness remains, it is still bound by emptiness.\nEmptiness that does not penetrate cannot be the Tathāgata’s wondrous body.\nBetter to take this thing called emptiness and shatter it with a single blow.\nWhen emptiness is no longer emptiness, whence comes sound?\nWithout sound, emptiness too ceases to be.\nNo emptiness, no sound—this is great liberation, great freedom,\nliving and unbounded.\n\nThey say: \"One who halts at the top of a hundred-foot pole has entered,\nyet this is not true entry.\nTake another step from the hundred-foot pole,\nand the ten directions become one’s whole body.\"\n\n**III**\nOne thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing—\nall sense realms reveal its mechanism.\nYet this ever-luminous one thing is not truly existent—\non what do the four depend?\n\nHearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing—\nall arise from the radiant, luminous mind-essence.\nBecause this one thing is ever luminous,\nthe four conspire in the sense realms, ceaselessly active.\n\nIf one could remove this ever-luminous one thing,\nthe four would have no ground and would vanish of themselves.\nAll deluded beings fail to recognize\nthe Tathāgata’s true nature as true emptiness and wondrous being.\nThey take this radiant, luminous mind-essence as real,\neither negating this thing or clinging to it.\nYet they do not know this thing is the root of birth and death,\nthe seed of kalpas of saṃsāra.\nIf one does not uproot this thing entirely,\nhow can one recognize the Tathāgata’s true nature?\nThis is what is meant by: \"The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—\nfools call it the original person.\"\n\n**IV**\nWithout moving a step, one reaches the Western Heaven—\nall directions sit plainly before one’s eyes.\nLight behind the neck is still illusion;\nclouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.\n\nThe Tathāgata’s true nature has no head, no tail,\nno back, no front.\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning;\nfollow it and you do not see its end.\nSpeak of its being, and it seems not to exist;\nspeak of its non-being, and it is present.\n\nNot falling into the forms of being or non-being,\nits light penetrates the obscure and reaches the luminous,\nable to illumine the three thousand great thousand worlds—\nthis is the wondrous awakening of the natural,\nnot something produced by sitting meditation.\n\nAll those who engage in meditation and seated practice,\nwho belong to the school of the discriminating mind,\nseeing some illusory scenes or false appearances—\nwhether dreaming of journeying to the Western Heaven,\nor generating light behind the neck,\nor entering profound darkness yet perceiving various objects,\nor becoming lost in trance with clouds rising beneath their feet—\nmistake these for the attainment of true fruition and Buddhahood,\nmissing the mark by far.\n\nThose with aspiration for the Dao must first sweep away\nall heterodox side paths and external teachings,\nthen in the realm of formlessness and colorlessness,\ninvestigate to uncover the true, wondrous awakening.\nOnly then can the fundamental nature be delivered.\n\n**Verse on the Ground of Nature**\nBuddha-nature is neither same nor different;\na thousand lamps share one light.\nTo add to it brings no benefit;\nto subtract from it causes no harm.\nTaking and discarding both pass without fault;\nburning and flooding cannot obstruct.\nThe dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—\nnot one can be fathomed.\n\nThe verse is called \"Ground of Nature,\"\nfor the true nature’s essence is like the earth—\nunmoving, unshaken, whether called same or different.\nThough circumstances and things are myriad,\nrespond to all with a mind of equality,\nas a thousand lamps shine—\nlamps may differ, but the light is one.\n\nThis nature admits no increase, no decrease,\nno taking, no discarding.\nFire may burn, water may flood—\nnothing can impede it,\njust as the earth bears the weight of mountains,\nendures the rush of waters,\nand contains all things, whether harmed or whole.\n\nThe earth is thus; the nature is thus.\nSeeing, hearing, knowing, perceiving—\nall are fundamentally empty.\nYet this emptiness is not annihilation,\nbut meeting things with things,\nadapting to square and round,\nresponding with a mind of no-mind.\n\n**Verse on Birth and Extinction**\nSeeking birth is itself without birth;\nfearing extinction, what has ever temporarily ceased?\nSeeing with the eyes is not like hearing with the ears;\nspeaking with the mouth cannot compare to speaking with the nose.\n\nThe Tathāgata’s true nature is originally without birth or extinction.\nThose who forcefully seek birth and fear extinction—\nwhen have they ever been born without perishing?\nWhere there is birth, there is extinction;\nonly where there is no birth is there no extinction.\n\nBecause its fundamental nature is without birth or extinction,\nit cannot be seen with the eyes, only heard with the ears;\nit cannot be spoken with the mouth, only spoken with the nose.\nWhat is seen with the eyes and spoken with the mouth\nbelongs to the nature of birth and extinction.\nWhat is heard with the ears and spoken with the nose\nbelongs to the nature without birth or extinction.\n\nWhat is seen with the eyes and spoken with the mouth is not the nature;\nonly what is heard with the ears and spoken with the nose is the nature.\nSeeing without seeing is true seeing;\nspeaking without speaking surpasses all speech.\n\nFor this nature without birth or extinction\nhas no head, no crown, no back, no face;\nit is neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor form.\nWhat is there to see? What is there to say?\nIf it can be seen or spoken, it is not the true empty nature.\n\n**Verse on the Three Realms as Mind Only**\nThe three realms are mind alone—wondrous principle;\nthe myriad things are neither this nor that.\nNo single thing is not my mind;\nno single thing is my self.\n\nThe three realms are the form realm, the desire realm, and the formless realm.\nThe form and desire realms are realms of mind.\nThe formless realm is a realm without mind.\nWhether with mind or without mind—\nneither is the Buddha-nature.\n\nThe verse is called \"The Three Realms as Mind Only,\"\nneither being nor non-being,\nwhere both being and non-being are not established,\nand self and other all return to emptiness.\n\nThe mind without mind is called the true mind;\nthe true mind’s mind is one body with the myriad things,\nwithout division of self and other.\n\"No single thing is not my mind\"—\nthis is not clinging to emptiness.\n\"No single thing is my self\"—\nthis is not clinging to form.\n\nNot clinging to emptiness, not clinging to form—\nonly mind alone.\nOne mind is one nature;\nmind is Buddha, Buddha is mind.\n\n**Verse on Seeing the Mind in Things**\nSee things and you see the mind;\nwithout things, the mind does not appear.\nWithin the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,\nthe true mind pervades all.\n\nIf you generate intellectual understanding,\nyou fall into inverted views.\nPerceiving conditions without mind—\nonly then do you see the face of bodhi.\n\n\"See things and you see the mind;\nwithout things, the mind does not appear\"—\nthis is the mind of those with knowledge and perception.\n\"Within the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,\nthe true mind pervades all\"—\nthis is the true mind without knowledge or perception.\n\nThe human mind arises and ceases with things’ presence and absence;\nthe true mind’s numinous light is ever bright.\nWith things, it is this; without things, it is this.\nIn the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,\nthere is nowhere it is not.\nIt neither arises nor ceases,\nunlike the human mind with knowledge and perception.\n\nIf you interpret the true mind with knowledge and perception,\nyou mistake a thief for your son—\nan inverted view, greatly mistaken.\n\nFor the true mind is round and luminous,\npure and bare, bright and free,\nneither separate from nor attached to conditions.\nIf one can perceive conditions without mind,\nthis is the true mind, the original face of bodhi—\nno need to seek the original face of bodhi elsewhere.\n\nIn short, only without the human mind\ncan one see the true mind.\nOnce the true mind is seen,\none immediately realizes bodhi\nand suddenly transcends the other shore.\n\n**Verse on Equalizing Things**\nI am not different from others;\nothers’ minds differ of themselves.\nPeople have close and distant relations;\nI have no self and other.\nWater, land, and flying beings—\nall are viewed as one body.\nNoble and base, high and low—\nhands and feet are the same as oneself.\n\nI am not even myself—\nhow could there be a you?\nWhen self and other both vanish,\nall bubbles return to water.\n\nThe verse is called \"Equalizing Things.\"\nClose and distant relations, self and other,\nwater, land, and flying beings,\nnoble and base, high and low—\nall are equally manifested.\n\nThe emphasis lies in the line \"I am not even myself.\"\nThe reason people cannot equalize things\nis because of the existence of an \"I.\"\nIf one can be without self,\nhow would one know there is a \"you\"?\nWhen self and other are both forgotten,\nthe myriad things are all empty—\nnot equalized, yet naturally equal.\n\n**Verse on \"The Mind Itself Is Buddha\"**\n\nThe Buddha is mind, the mind is Buddha—\nmind and Buddha have ever been illusory things.\nOnly when you know there is no Buddha, no mind,\ndo you become the true Dharma-body Buddha.\n\nThe Dharma-body Buddha has no form,\na single sphere of radiance containing all images.\nThe formless form is the true form,\nthe imageless image is the true image.\n\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,\nneither movement nor stillness, neither coming nor going.\nNeither different nor same, neither being nor non-being,\nneither graspable nor relinquishable, neither audible nor visible.\n\nWithin and without, perfectly luminous, everywhere unobstructed—\na single Buddha-realm lies within a grain of sand.\nA single grain of sand contains the great chiliocosm,\none body and mind are identical to ten thousand.\n\nTo know this, you must master the mindless Dharma;\nuntainted and unobstructed is pure karma.\nGood and evil, a thousand kinds—yet nothing is done—\nthis is precisely \"Namo\" and Mahākāśyapa.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the line *\"To know this, you must master the mindless Dharma.\"*\n\"Mindless\" does not mean dull and insensate.\nIf it were dull and insensate, like a wooden carving or clay statue,\nhow could it be said that the mind itself is Buddha?\n\nGenerally, the meaning of \"mindless\" is:\nnot clinging to form, not clinging to emptiness.\nThe true mind has no form, no image—\noriginally, it is no-thing. How could it have form?\nThe true mind’s light contains all images,\npervading and unobstructed. How could it be empty?\n\nNeither form nor emptiness—\nperfectly round, radiant, pure, bare, and unadorned—\nthis is the mind as Buddha, the Buddha as mind,\nyet neither mind nor Buddha.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The Buddha is mind, the mind is Buddha,\"*\nand also: *\"Mind and Buddha have ever been illusory movements.\"*\nIf you recognize that the mind itself is Buddha,\nyet also know it is neither mind nor Buddha,\nthen the mindless Dharma is attained,\nand you do not fall into the teaching of quiescence.\n\n---\n\n**Verse on \"Mindlessness\"**\n\nHow laughable, this mind of mine—\nstubborn and coarse.\nDull and drifting,\nit lets things be as they are.\n\nIt does not practice cultivation,\nnor does it commit offenses.\nIt neither benefits others,\nnor seeks gain for itself.\n\nIt does not uphold precepts,\nnor observe taboos.\nIt knows nothing of rites or music,\nnor practices benevolence or righteousness.\n\nOf all human skills,\nit has mastered not a single one.\nWhen hungry, it eats;\nwhen thirsty, it drinks.\n\nWhen tired, it sleeps;\nwhen awake, it walks.\nWhen hot, it wears light clothes;\nwhen cold, it covers itself.\n\nWithout thought or worry,\nwhat sorrow or joy could there be?\nNo regret, no scheming,\nno thoughts, no intentions.\n\nAll the honors and humiliations of life\nare but a travelers’ inn.\nLike birds nesting in trees,\nit may be compared.\n\nComing, it does not forbid;\ngoing, it does not prevent.\nIt neither avoids nor seeks,\nneither praises nor blames.\n\nIt does not loathe the ugly,\nnor admire the beautiful.\nIt does not seek quiet chambers,\nnor shun bustling markets.\n\nIt does not speak of others’ faults,\nnor boast of its own rightness.\nIt does not favor the noble,\nnor slight the lowly.\n\nLoved ones and enemies,\nthe great and small, inner and outer—\njoy and sorrow, gain and loss,\nreverence and contempt, danger and ease—\n\nthe mind does not see two ways,\nbut remains level and even.\nIt does not act for blessings first,\nnor initiate calamity.\n\nIt responds only when moved,\nrises only when pressed.\nIt does not fear blades,\nhow could it fear tigers?\n\nIt follows things in their names,\nwhy cling to labels?\nThe eye does not chase after forms,\nsound does not enter the ear.\n\nAll appearances\nare but delusion and falsehood.\nMale and female, form and sound—\nnone are fixed entities.\n\nWith no mind in form or image,\nuntainted and unobstructed,\nit is free and at ease,\nnothing can burden it.\n\nThe wondrous awakening is perfectly luminous,\nilluminating within and without.\nIt encompasses the six directions,\nwithout near or far.\n\nIts light is not light,\nlike the moon in water.\nHard to grasp, hard to relinquish—\nwhat could compare to it?\n\nUnderstanding this wondrous function,\nit transcends all else.\nIf asked its principle,\nthis alone is it.\n\nThese dozens of lines,\nrepeated again and again,\nall elucidate the two words: *mindless*.\nThe wonder lies in *mindlessness*—\namid dust, it transcends dust;\nin the world, it transcends the world.\nFree and at ease,\nnothing can burden it.\n\nWithin the square inch of the human heart,\nnot a speck of dust can lodge.\nIf even a speck remains,\nendless human thoughts arise.\n\nOnce human thoughts arise,\nnow this, now that—\nthe body is no longer its own,\nand the self is not present.\nWhen the self is not present,\nthe slave becomes master,\nthe master becomes slave.\nHow can there be freedom?\n\nIf one can be *mindless* in all things,\nunmoved and unshaken,\nthen one is free.\nBeing free,\none is self-mastered,\nall anxieties cease,\nall entanglements vanish.\n\nThe wondrous awakening is perfectly luminous,\nilluminating within and without,\nencompassing the six directions,\nwithout near or far.\nTruly free—\nhow wondrous is the function of mindlessness!\n\n---\n\n**Verse on the *Heart Sutra***\n\nThe aggregates, truths, faculties, and dusts—\nform and emptiness—\nnone of these dharmas can be spoken of.\nWhen inverted views are exhausted,\nthe quiescent body abides in itself.\n\n*Aggregates* refer to the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness.\n*Truths* refer to the four truths: suffering, its cessation, the path, and extinction.\n*Faculties* refer to the six faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.\n*Dusts* refer to the six dusts: form, sound, scent, taste, touch, dharmas.\n*Emptiness* is quiescence;\n*form* is clinging to appearances.\n\nThe aggregates, truths, faculties, dusts, emptiness, and form—\nall are dharmas produced by the mind,\nall belong to inverted views.\nIf one can sweep them all away,\nthe mind’s essence becomes quiescent—\nthis is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,\nthis is Śāriputra, unborn and undying.\n\nIf even the slightest dharma remains among these six,\nthere is birth and death,\nand one does not attain freedom.\nOnly when one reaches the place of no birth and death,\nconstant and free,\nare the six truly purified.\n\n---\n\n**Verse on \"No Merit, No Sin\"**\n\nAll day walking, yet never walked;\nall day sitting, yet never sat.\nCultivating good, yet no merit accrues;\ncommitting evil, yet no sin is incurred.\n\nIf one has not yet awakened to the mind,\ndo not cling to these words and act recklessly.\nAfter death, you must face King Yama—\nhow can you escape the cauldron, the pestle, the millstone?\n\n**Verse on \"No Sin, What Is Merit?\"**\n\nTo name it \"no sin\"—what then is merit?\nSin and merit both arise from the mind.\nWith mind to do evil, one creates sin with mind;\nwith mind to practice good, one seeks merit with mind.\nGood and evil, sin and merit—\nall arise from the mind.\nIf one reaches the state of no-mind,\nwalking and sitting are unknown—\nhow then know good and evil?\nHow then know sin and merit?\nThus it is said: cultivating good yet no merit accrues,\ncommitting evil yet no sin is incurred.\nLike an infant, without knowledge or awareness,\nlaughter and anger, scolding and cursing—\nall arise from no-mind.\nWhat merit or sin could there be?\n\nThis no-mind is the absence of the human mind.\nWithout the human mind, the true mind naturally exists.\nThe true mind’s measure is equal to heaven and earth,\nencompassing the ten thousand things.\nIt neither thinks of good nor thinks of evil,\nneither creates sin nor seeks merit.\nMerit and sin—\nboth are beyond its reckoning.\n\nIf one has not yet awakened to the true mind\nand instead lets the deluded mind run wild,\ncommitting a hundred evils,\nclaiming there is no sin—\nafter death, the retribution of cauldrons, pestles, and millstones—\nhow can one escape it?\n\n---\n\n**Verse on Perfect Penetration**\n\nSeeing true emptiness, emptiness is not empty;\nwhere is there no perfect penetration in radiant clarity?\nRoot, dust, mind, and dharmas—all are without substance.\nOnly in wondrous function does one know they are one with things.\n\nThe nature of true emptiness is perfectly penetrating, unimpeded.\nIts brilliance shines everywhere, and nothing can deceive it.\nNot empty, yet naturally empty;\nempty, yet not empty—\nit is merely constant response, constant stillness,\nconstant stillness, constant response.\n\n---\n\n**Following-Him Verse**\n\nThe ten thousand things lie scattered before the eyes,\nlet them move or be still, let them have their way.\nRadiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—\never untainted,\nlike a lotus rising from water, dry of itself.\n\nThough this verse has four lines,\nits meaning is contained in the single phrase:\n\"Radiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—ever untainted.\"\nRadiant clarity is wondrous being;\nsamādhi and wisdom are true emptiness.\nTrue emptiness naturally abides in the ten thousand things\nyet is not tainted by them.\nWondrously, it naturally encounters the ten thousand things\nand responds to them.\nConstant response, constant stillness—\nat ease wherever it goes,\nlike a lotus rising from water,\nborn in the mire yet unstained.\n\n---\n\n**Moon-in-the-Sky Verse**\n\nA single bright moon hangs in the empty sky,\nits pure light shines on all lands without obstruction.\nGather it—its light does not condense;\nscatter it—its light does not disperse.\nPush it forward—its light does not advance;\ndraw it back—its light does not retreat.\nThat which it illuminates is not distant,\nthis which it shines upon is not near.\nThe light on the surface is not external,\nthe light within is not internal.\nGathering and scattering, advancing and retreating,\ndistance and nearness, surface and interior—\nthough the illumination differs,\nthe light is the same.\nWithin sameness there is difference,\nwithin difference there is sameness.\nOne source scatters into the ten thousand distinctions,\nthe ten thousand distinctions return to the one source.\nUnfurled, it fills the six directions;\nrolled up, it retreats into secrecy—\nlively and free,\nlike a puppet show.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Pearl**\n\nA poor man wears a pearl in his robe,\nbright and perfectly round from the start.\nNot knowing to seek it himself,\nhe counts the treasures of others.\n\nCounting others’ treasures brings no benefit—\nit only makes you waste your strength in vain.\nBetter to recognize your own jewel,\nworth gold beyond measure.\n\nThis pearl’s light is greatest,\nshining throughout the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.\nIt has never lacked even a fraction,\nonly obscured by floating clouds.\n\nSince recognizing this cintāmaṇi,\nwho still clings to bubbles, illusions, or flowers?\nThe Buddha’s pearl is one with my pearl,\nmy nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.\n\nPearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—\nthe mind’s vastness embraces the dharma-realm.\nThough clamor and dust fill your eyes,\nsamādhi and wisdom remain radiantly clear, ever at ease.\n\nNot emptiness, not form—\nwithin and without, resplendent and unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers, wondrous and boundless—\nself-benefit and benefiting others, how could they be exhausted?\n\nSeeing is completion, all affairs are finished.\nBeyond learning, without doing, one passes the days.\nTranquil as an unborn infant,\nmovement and stillness follow conditions, without fixation.\n\nNeither cutting off delusion nor cultivating truth—\nthe minds of truth and delusion both belong to dust.\nFrom the beginning, the ten thousand dharmas are without form;\nwithin formlessness, there is the dharma-body.\n\nThe dharma-body is the natural Buddha,\nneither human nor thing.\nVast, it fills the space between heaven and earth—\nonly subtlety and indistinctness, shadowy and vague.\n\nStains do not taint it, its light shines of itself.\nNo dharma does not arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—\nthen one knows sin and merit were never substantial.\n\nNo Buddha to cultivate, no dharma to expound—\na true person’s wisdom and insight are naturally distinct.\nSpeaking, one roars like a lion,\nnot like a wild fox debating birth and death.\n\nThis song hinges on the line:\n\"If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease.\"\nDharmas here are not the dharmas of the Buddha-dharma,\nbut the myriad thoughts, delusions, and false imaginings of the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, the ten thousand dharmas are empty.\nThe nature-pearl shines constantly,\nsamādhi and wisdom are perfectly clear,\nwithin and without, resplendent.\nBubbles, illusions, flowers—\nwhat is there to cling to?\nThough clamor and dust fill your eyes,\nthey cannot obstruct you.\nBeyond learning, without doing,\nlike an unborn infant,\nmovement and stillness follow conditions,\nwithout the illusions of truth and delusion.\nThe dharma-body is ever manifest,\nthe natural Buddha appears—\nfilling heaven and earth,\nilluminating the great-thousand worlds.\nWhat floating clouds could obscure it?\n\n---\n\n**Song on Chan Meditation to Dispel Delusion**\n\nThe Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—\nwhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn activity and rest, ever serene and clear—\nnot only when sitting is this so.\n\nPeople today seek realization through silent sitting,\nnot knowing it depends entirely on seeing the nature.\nIf the nature is clear within seeing,\nseeing naturally settles within the nature.\n\nWhen concentration matures, wisdom’s function is boundless—\nthis is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.\nShould one seek to fathom its essence and function,\none sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.\nWithin this emptiness, not a single thing exists,\nnor any trace of the subtle or indistinct.\nIf you chase after the subtle and indistinct,\nthe search itself becomes a deviation.\nYet even these two words—deviation—\ncannot be grasped as evidence.\nThe original mind is already empty;\nhow could gain or loss ever touch it?\n\nSimply cast aside all dharmas,\nleaving nothing behind.\nSuddenly, perfect clarity appears of itself—\nthen you are no different from the Buddhas.\nThis colored body is but my fetters;\nfor now, blend with the world’s radiance and mingle with the dust.\nIn all actions, be without intention—\nwhy quarrel over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?\nThis borrowed form is but a temporary abode,\nwhile the host of this inn is Vairocana.\nVairocana neither comes nor goes—\nthus one knows birth and death leave no residue.\n\nShould someone ask what Vairocana is like,\nit is simply that all forms fail to describe it.\nBefore your eyes, every speck of dust is active,\nyet dust and activity are neither the same nor different.\nSeeing this dust and activity in every particle,\neach one is Śākyamuni, each one is Kāśyapa.\nIf they differ, the ten thousand sounds all resound;\nif they are one, a single wind gathers all.\nIf you wish to recognize the wish-fulfilling jewel,\ndo not say you must attain the Dharma first.\nWhen ill, use medicine to heal;\nonce healed, what need is there for medicine?\nWhen the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;\nwhen the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.\nLike a tarnished mirror polished bright,\nblemishes and grime vanish of themselves.\n\nAll dharmas are fundamentally illusory,\nso one is taught to leave behind all forms.\nWhen all forms are left behind, what remains?\nThis is called the supreme, ultimate truth.\nIf you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,\npractice equal compassion and relieve suffering.\nThough the bodhisattva’s original vow runs deep,\ntake care not to grasp at anything within appearances.\nThis is the perfection of both merit and wisdom,\nand in the future, you will be the first to receive the prediction.\nEven the slightest stain of eternalism or nihilism\ncuts you off from all Buddhas.\nYet when one reflects on the delusions of ordinary beings,\nall are tainted by the dust of attachment and habit.\nSimply because craving and clinging run deep,\nthey are constantly reborn in womb, egg, transformation, or moisture.\n\nTo study the Way, you must be fierce and resolute,\nyour heart of non-attachment hard as iron.\nEven if you have sons, daughters, wives, and concubines,\nwhat difference is there between them and others?\nConstantly guard the single sphere of radiant light,\nseeing nothing desirable to contemplate.\nWhen all dharmas are simultaneously unattached,\nwhat need is there to speak of hell or heaven?\nThen my life is in my own hands,\nand in emptiness, there is no ascent or descent.\nI emerge and vanish among the Buddha-lands,\nyet never leave the original seat of bodhi.\nGuanyin’s thirty-two transformations—\nI too shall realize them within this.\nManifestations beyond conception\nall arise from the nature of carefree ease.\n\nI am a Chan practitioner without intention,\nindifferent to all things.\nOnce a black ox,\ntoday my whole body is white.\nSometimes I sing, sometimes I laugh—\nothers say I lack sense.\nHow would they know that beneath these coarse robes\nlies a priceless treasure?\nIf they see me speak of emptiness,\nit is as if they swallow a jujube whole.\nOnly the Buddha can truly know this Dharma;\nhow could the foolish and ignorant comprehend its signs?\n\nMoreover, there are those who claim to practice Chan,\nyet only learn to match words and seal lips.\nThey boast of my quick wit in question and answer,\nyet fundamentally do not recognize the host.\nThey merely pluck branches and pick leaves,\nfailing to thoroughly investigate the root.\nWhen the root is attained, branches and leaves flourish;\nwithout the root, branches and leaves cannot endure.\nThey flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,\nyet remain entangled in self and other.\nWith my wondrous awakening at the source of mind,\nthey are separated by a thousand miles.\nSuch people are pitiable and laughable—\nthey speak of years spent studying the Way,\nyet their pride prevents them from asking others,\nwasting their whole lives in vain.\nThey are dull and deluded, with heavy karmic obstructions—\nif they do not awaken in this life,\nhow will they avoid sinking in the next?\n\nThis song of over a hundred lines\ndistills the meaning of these four verses:\n*\"The Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—\nwhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn activity and rest, ever serene and clear—\nnot only when sitting is this so.\"*\n\nFor the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature\nis utterly pure in essence,\nas clear as water,\nwithout wind or waves,\nunstained by dust or grime.\nWhether active or at rest,\nit is always thus—\nnot only when sitting is it settled.\nTo mistake sitting for Chan\nis not true Chan,\nbut the Chan of lifeless, dull emptiness,\nwhich cannot be called the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature.\n\nTrue Chan\nunites concentration and wisdom,\nits wondrous function boundless,\nmind and Dharma both forgotten,\nall forms left behind.\nIt adorns the Buddha-land,\npractices equal compassion,\nblends with the world’s radiance while mingling with the dust,\ndwells in the world yet transcends it,\nis Chan without being Chan,\nsettled without being settled.\nAll those who seek realization through silent sitting,\nor who seal their lips without recognizing the host—\nsuch wild-fox Chan, half-awake yet still muddled,\nhow could they know the true Chan-nature of the wondrous awakening at the source?\n\n*Reading the Song from the Ancestral Record of Chan Master Xuedou*\n\nA single stream from Caoxi divides into a thousand branches,\nilluminating past and present without obstruction.\nYet scholars of late do not seek the source,\nmistaking hoofprints and puddles for the great ocean.\n\nMaster Xuedou, teacher of the true essence,\nsounded the thunderous roar of the Dharma drum.\nThe lion-king emerged from its den with a mighty roar,\nand the hundred beasts and thousand demons all trembled in fear.\nNow in song, now in verse,\nhe earnestly points out the path for the deluded.\nHis words are bold, his meaning profound,\nstriking jade and ringing gold through the ages.\nAlas, the deluded cling to appearances,\nchasing after words and seeking names and forms.\nThe true suchness of the Buddha-nature is beyond words,\nwithout high or low, without boundaries.\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor a duality of the two,\nthe ten directions’ dust and lands are a single perfect sphere.\nTrue concentration is never divided by speech or silence,\nneither to be grasped nor abandoned.\nSimply do not cling to any appearances—\nthis is the true principle of the Tathāgata.\n\nTo dispel delusion by opposing it with truth\nonly obscures truth if delusion does not cease.\nOnly when you know that both truth and delusion are not real\ndo you attain the unobstructed true mind.\nUnobstructed, you are free—\na single awakening dissolves eons of transgressions.\nWithout effort, you realize bodhi,\nand from then on, forever leave the sea of birth and death.\n\nMy teacher’s recent words flow smoothly,\nleft in the world as a model.\n\nLast night, I summoned him before me,\nthreaded his nostrils, and hung him upon my staff.\nI asked him of the foremost truth—\nhe replied, \"All speech is but slander.\"\n\nThough this song praises the *Ancestral Heroes Collection*,\nit truly conveys the form of true suchness.\nAmong its lines, the couplet:\n*\"Simply do not cling to any appearances—\nthis is the true principle of the Tathāgata.\"*\nencapsulates the essence of the entire work.\nNot clinging is no-mind;\nno-mind means neither truth nor delusion arises.\nWhen neither truth nor delusion arises, there is no obstruction;\nno obstruction brings freedom,\nfreedom preserves the true reality,\nand one forever leaves the sea of birth and death.\n\nThe line *\"Last night, I summoned him before me,\nthreaded his nostrils, and hung him upon my staff\"*\nholds deeper meaning beyond the Immortal’s words.\nScholars, ponder this:\nWhat is summoned? What is threaded?\nTo \"summon\" is to call forth the nature of true suchness and real form.\nTo \"thread the nostrils\" is to pierce the mind beyond form and emptiness.\nWhen this nature is awakened and this mind known,\nthe staff in hand upholds heaven above and earth below,\nwithout front or back,\nperfectly round, radiant,\npure, bare, unadorned—\nthis is the foremost truth from the West.\nWhat more is there to say?\n\n**Precepts, Concentration, Wisdom**\nPrecepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous functions of the Dharma.\nThough the Buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them,\nthose who do not comprehend cling to their words.\nHere, I briefly explain to aid awakening:\nWhen mind and environment are both forgotten, and not a single thought stirs—this is *precepts*.\nWhen awareness is perfectly clear, inwardly and outwardly luminous—this is *concentration*.\nWhen responding to conditions with inexhaustible marvel—this is *wisdom*.\nThese three depend on one another, each the substance and function of the others,\nnever separated even for an instant.\nLike the sun, which relies on light to illuminate,\nand light, which relies on illumination to shine—\nwithout light, there is no illumination;\nwithout illumination, there is no shining.\nAt their root, precepts, concentration, and wisdom arise from one nature;\nlight, illumination, and shining arise from one sun.\nIf even \"one\" is not truly one, how can there be three?\nWhen three and one are both forgotten, there is only serene purity.\n\nThe Immortal’s explanation has entered the samādhi of precepts, concentration, and wisdom—\nhis words are concise, his meaning clear.\nIf practitioners can uphold them, they may directly ascend the other shore.\nYet, though the Immortal’s words are clear,\nI fear students may lack broad vision or sufficient strength,\nunable to advance toward awakening the primal source.\nThus, I add this annotation to guide future seekers,\nleading them from shallow to deep, from low to high, that they may succeed.\n\nPrecepts mean facing circumstances without attachment, unstained by the dusts.\nConcentration means utmost sincerity without falsehood, unmoved and unshaken.\nWisdom means adapting to situations without bias or partiality.\nWhen one can uphold precepts, concentration, and wisdom,\nthe three work in harmony,\nshifting from effort to spontaneity,\nmerging into a single nature,\nreturning to the state of unknowing, unperceiving purity.\nYet when purity is attained, even \"one nature\" is not held—\nhow then could there be the three of precepts, concentration, and wisdom?\nThus it is said: *When three and one are both forgotten, there is only serene purity.*\nIf, upon reaching purity, the three are still employed,\nthen upon true purity’s attainment, the three naturally dissolve.\nTo retain even three or one is not the purity of Chan.\nThe verse states:\n*\"When the mind is deluded, rely on the Dharma for illumination;\nwhen the mind is awakened, even that is no longer needed.\"*\nFor all dharmas of the mind are to be forgotten,\nand all appearances utterly relinquished—\nthis is the meaning of *three and one both forgotten, serene purity*.\n\n**West River Moon (Twelve Poems)**\n**I**\nDo not forcefully extinguish delusive appearances,\nnor need you seek the true—what is there to pursue?\n\nThe original nature and the Buddha-nature are cultivated as one—\ndelusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.\nAwakening is instantaneous Buddhahood;\ndelusion is eons of sinking in the flow.\nIf but a single thought accords with true cultivation,\nthe sins and defilements as countless as the Ganges’ sands are extinguished.\nThe original nature is the Buddha-nature.\nThe Buddha-nature has neither delusive thoughts nor true suchness.\nOnly because worldly beings alternate between delusion and awakening\ndo the names of delusive thoughts and true suchness arise.\nTo be deluded about one’s nature is to give rise to delusive thoughts;\nto awaken to one’s nature is to return to true suchness.\nAwakening to true suchness is instantaneous Buddhahood;\ngiving rise to delusive thoughts is eons of sinking in the flow.\nDelusive thoughts and true suchness exist only between delusion and awakening.\nIf, without awakening, one forcibly extinguishes delusive thoughts\nor seeks true suchness, how can true suchness be seen?\nThe closing line states: *\"If but a single thought accords with true cultivation,\nthe sins and defilements as countless as the Ganges’ sands are extinguished\"*—\nthis can be clearly understood.\n\n**II**\nOriginally there is neither arising nor ceasing—\nwhy insist on distinguishing arising and ceasing?\nEven sin and merit have no root;\nhow could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?\nI possess a luminous mirror,\nwhich has long been obscured by dust.\nToday, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth—\nthe ten thousand images shine forth, none can hide.\nThe true suchness of the original Buddha-nature\nis neither arising nor ceasing, neither to be increased nor diminished.\nYet through the defilements of the dusts,\nthere is arising and ceasing, like a luminous mirror obscured by dust.\nIf one morning the accumulated grime and old stains are polished away,\nit remains the same perfectly bright and undiminished thing.\nWhen it illumines heaven and earth,\nthe ten thousand images shine forth, none can hide—\nhow then could there be arising or ceasing?\n\n**III**\nMy nature enters the Buddha-nature of all;\nthe Buddha-nature in every realm is thus.\nA solitary cold reflection shines in a cold spring—\none moon appears in a thousand pools.\nSmall as an invisible hair-tip,\nvast as the filling of the three thousand worlds.\nHigh or low, it naturally conforms to square or round—\nwhy speak of long or short, deep or shallow?\nMy nature and the Buddha-nature,\nthroughout the ten thousand lands and the nine continents,\nthe nature of all beings in every realm—\nnone is different.\nIn the sage it does not increase,\nin the ordinary it does not decrease,\nlike a single luminous moon appearing in a thousand pools.\nThis nature may be small or vast,\nhigh or low, square or round,\nshallow or deep, long or short—\nyet it does not fall into the traces of great or small,\nhigh or low, square or round, long or short, deep or shallow.\nOnly the common people use it daily yet do not know it.\n\n**IV**\nDharma upon dharma—originally there is no dharma;\nemptiness upon emptiness—this too is not emptiness.\n\nSilence and clamor, speech and stillness—originally the same,\nwhy trouble to speak of dreams within dreams?\nIn use there is non-use,\nin effortless action, action is applied.\n\nJust as fruit ripens and naturally turns red,\nask not how to cultivate the seed.\nWhen the Tathāgata preaches the Dharma, there is truly no Dharma;\nwhen the Tathāgata speaks of emptiness, it is truly not emptiness.\nThe Dharma without Dharma—this is called the true Dharma;\nthe emptiness that is not emptiness—this is called true emptiness.\nTrue Dharma, true emptiness—\nsilence and clamor, speech and stillness—\nunknowing, unperceiving,\naccord with the Emperor’s rule and that is all.\nWhat Dharma is there to preach, what emptiness to discuss?\nIf one forces preaching or forced talk of emptiness,\nit is like speaking of dreams within dreams—\nhow could one know the nature of true Dharma and true emptiness,\nserene and unshaken, responsive and thus penetrating?\nResponsive and thus penetrating,\nserene and unshaken—\nis this not \"in use there is non-use, in effortless action, action is applied\"?\nIn use there is non-use—the Dharma is fundamentally empty;\nin effortless action, action is applied—within emptiness there is Dharma.\nThe Dharma is fundamentally empty, emptiness contains Dharma,\nneither substantial nor void, neither existent nor nonexistent,\nperfectly luminous and unobscured,\nlong since self-liberated—\nlike fruit ripening on the branch,\nthere will naturally come a day of maturity.\nThis itself is the cultivation of the true seed of Buddha-nature;\nno need to ask how to cultivate the seed.\n\n**V**\nGood and evil—both forgotten in an instant,\nprosperity and decay—no concern at all.\nDarkness and brightness, concealment and revelation—let them rise and sink,\neat when hungry, drink when thirsty, as one’s portion allows.\nThe spirit, serene and profoundly still,\nundisturbed whether sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.\nA pool of autumn water, deep and clear—\nthough the wind stirs, do not be startled, let it be so.\n\nThe essence of the verse lies in these two lines:\n\"The spirit, serene and profoundly still,\nundisturbed whether sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.\"\nFor when the spirit is still,\ngood and evil, prosperity and decay,\ndarkness and brightness, concealment and revelation, rising and sinking—\nnone enter the heart.\nLiving according to conditions,\nsitting, lying, singing, chanting,\ncarefree and at ease,\nthoughtless and unburdened—\nlike a pool of autumn water, deep and clear.\nThough the wind blows, there are no waves—\nwhat cause is there for anxiety or fear?\n\n**VI**\nFacing circumstances, no need to forcibly extinguish them;\nprovisional names are established as expedient means to bodhi.\nForm and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal,\ndo not divide truth and illusion into two bodies.\nAwakening brings immediate clarity to the Pure Land,\nno need for distant lands like India or Cao Creek.\nWho says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies to the west?\nRealization itself is Amitābha’s advent.\n\nThe original nature of the Tathāgata\nis perfectly round, radiant, pure, bare, and unadorned.\nNeither form nor emptiness,\nneither brightness nor darkness,\nneither truth nor illusion.\nOne who awakens becomes a Buddha in an instant—\nwhy forcibly extinguish the dust of emotions before a mirror?\nBecause most people do not awaken,\nthe buddhas and bodhisattvas provisionally establish bodhi as an expedient,\nguiding beings from gradual to sudden enlightenment to realize buddhahood.\nBodhi, in the language of China, means the correct path—\nturning from the crooked to the straight, gradually awakening.\n\n**VII**\nSelf and others, sentient beings and lifespan—\nwhy distinguish between high and low?\nThe Dharma naturally illuminates, without \"I\" or \"they,\"\nthought after thought—no need to seek.\nSeeing is not necessarily seeing,\nhearing is not necessarily not hearing.\nAll functions have never known one another—\nwho can obstruct you in life and death?\n\nSelf and others, sentient beings and lifespan,\nhigh and low, \"I\" and \"they,\" seeing and hearing, right and wrong—\nall are provisional appearances.\nIf one can thoroughly illuminate and see through these,\nletting them go into unknowing—\nin life it is thus, in death it is thus,\nlife is acceptable, death is acceptable,\nlife and death are unobstructed—\nnaturally one transcends life and death.\n\n**VIII**\nPracticing generosity while attached to forms,\nthe karmic retribution does not transcend gods and humans.\nIt is like shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds—\nwhen its force is spent, it falls.\nHow much better to embody the true mark of non-action,\nreturning to the source, reverting to simplicity, restoring purity.\nForgetting circumstances, exhausting emotions, following one’s natural truth—\nthus attaining the patience of the unborn Dharma.\n\nThe formless form is the true mark.\nThe true mark does not arise from practicing generosity while attached to forms—\nit emerges from reverting to simplicity and restoring purity,\nfrom forgetting circumstances and exhausting emotions.\nRecognizing the true mark,\nevery movement and stillness is natural truth—\nnaturally one attains the patience of the unborn Dharma.\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:\n\"This person immediately attains the patience of the unborn Dharma.\"\nThe commentary explains: true thusness is called the unborn,\nthe Dharma is without outflows, true wisdom is called patience.\n\n**IX**\nIf fish and rabbit come into your hands,\nnaturally you forget the trap and snare.\nThe raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—\nonce there, all are discarded.\nBefore awakening, one relies on words and speech;\nafter awakening, words and speech become false.\nThough these four phrases belong to non-action,\nthey too must be transcended.\n\nThe trap is for catching fish—once the fish is caught, the trap can be forgotten;\nthe snare is for catching rabbits—once the rabbit is caught, the snare can be forgotten.\nThe raft is for crossing the river—once the river is crossed, the raft can be abandoned;\nthe ladder is for ascending heights—once the height is reached, the ladder can be discarded.\nWords are for explaining principles—once the principle is understood, words can be forgotten.\nYet these four phrases—\"forget the trap,\" \"forget the snare,\" \"abandon the raft,\" \"discard the ladder\"—\nthough they teach the awakening of true nature and belong to non-action,\none cannot simply remain in empty non-action to conclude the matter.\nIf one only abides in empty non-action,\nhow can one reach the ground of true thusness and wondrous awakening?\nOne must transcend even this non-action to deeply attain self-realization.\n\n**X**\nOnce awakened, do not seek extinction;\nfollow conditions and guide the deluded multitudes.\nCut off views of permanence and annihilation, and lead them—\nexpediently point to the ultimate reality.\nThe five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,\nthe six perfections and myriad practices—cultivate them all equally.\nA single sphere of perfect light, a precious mani jewel—\nbenefiting others while also aiding oneself.\n\nThe Buddha-Dharma takes awakening to one’s nature as primary;\nit is not that once awakened, one does nothing.\nOne must apply this empty nature to concrete reality—\nonly then is it true Buddha-nature.\nThus it is said:\n\"Once awakened, do not seek extinction;\nfollow conditions and guide the deluded multitudes.\"\n\nGuiding the deluded multitudes is precisely how one practices expedient means and establishes meritorious deeds.\n\nThe five eyes are: the heavenly eye, the wisdom eye, the Dharma eye, the Buddha eye, and the fleshly eye. The three bodies are: the pure Dharma-body, the perfect Reward-body, and the hundred-billion Transformation-bodies. The four wisdoms are: the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Wisdom of Equality, the Wonderful Observing Wisdom, and the Wisdom of Accomplishing What is to be Done. The six perfections are: generosity, moral discipline, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. The myriad practices encompass all expedient meritorious deeds.\n\nThe five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms, six perfections, and myriad practices—cultivated both internally and externally—refine and clarify the true suchness of one’s original nature. Like a precious mani jewel, its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the obscure and revealing the luminous, benefiting others while also aiding oneself. How could it be merely empty?\n\n**XI**\nI see people nowadays speak of nature,\nboasting swiftly in verbal exchanges.\nYet when encountering circumstances, they grow confused—\nhow do they differ from the foolish?\nWhat is spoken must be practiced;\nonly then is it called flawless in word and deed.\nWielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—\nthis is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.\n\nThe crux lies in these two lines:\n*\"Wielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—\nthis is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.\"*\nThe Tathāgata’s true wisdom is all-pervading—\nthis is the wisdom-sword.\nBecause true wisdom can dispel delusion and return to sincerity,\nit is called the wisdom-sword.\nBecause true wisdom is perfectly luminous and never obscured,\never-present,\nit is called the mani.\n\"Severing the mani\" does not mean cutting it off,\nbut rather harnessing it,\npreventing its radiance from being misdirected outward.\nIn essence, it is the mani;\nin function, it is the wisdom-sword.\nThe wisdom-sword, mani, and true wisdom\nare all one—\nnot three separate things.\nThis true wisdom is not attained through mere words;\none must cultivate and refine it through embodied practice.\nIf the body does not act,\nand one only engages in verbal sparring,\nresponding with clever retorts,\nclaiming to have seen one’s nature—\nwhen encountering situations, one becomes instantly bewildered.\nWhat good does that serve?\nThus it is said:\n*\"Wielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—\nthis is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.\"*\nOnly one flawless in word and deed possesses true wisdom;\nthose who hastily parry with words do not.\n\n**XII**\nTo realize the wondrous Dao of non-arising,\nnothing more is needed than to see one’s true mind.\nThe true body is without form or sound—\nonly thus is the pure Dharma-body.\nThis Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,\nnor is it to be sought in the middle.\nAbandoning both extremes and the center—\nseeing this is called the highest attainment.\n\nSeeing the true mind *is* the wondrous Dao;\nthere is no need to seek it elsewhere.\nThe true mind is unstained and unattached,\nunmoving and unshaken,\nwithout form or sound—\nit is also called the pure Dharma-body.\nThis mind *is* this body.\nNeither existent nor non-existent,\nyet both existent and non-existent—\nit cannot be sought in existence,\nnor grasped in non-existence,\nnor taken from the neither-existence-nor-non-existence.\nSince all three are negated,\nwhat then is this thing?\nSeeing this thing,\none instantly transcends non-arising—\nthis is called the wondrous Dao of the supreme vehicle.\nThe true body and true mind are originally one.\nIn essence, it is called the true body;\nin function, the true mind.\nEssence and function are inseparable,\nbody and mind undivided,\nform and spirit both wondrous,\nin perfect union with the Dao—\nis this not what is meant by non-arising?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix: Reading the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***\n\nThe wondrous workings of the Great Elixir follow Qian and Kun;\nQian and Kun move, and the five phases divide.\nWhen the five phases flow in sequence, the common Dao arises and perishes;\nwhen the five phases move in reverse, the elixir’s body remains eternally numinous.\nFrom the formless, a sign emerges;\nthe Two Modes arise from the One Root.\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies;\nthe Eight Trigrams beget one another as parent and child.\nMyriad phenomena arise from change and movement;\nfortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are thus

images are entrusted to this text.\nWhen Pi and Tai alternate, yin and yang ascend or descend;\nwhen Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn or dusk.\nKan and Li are male and female,

      "translated_text": "*The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*\n*A Preface to the Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*\n\nThe Dao of cultivating reality is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and attaining destiny. Thus, to fulfill one’s nature, one must first exhaust the principle of that nature; to attain one’s destiny, one must first exhaust the principle of that destiny. Only by clarifying its principle can one gain true knowledge and firm insight, avoiding delusion by the false, thereby fulfilling one’s nature and attaining one’s destiny. Otherwise, without exhausting its principle, right and wrong remain indistinguishable, the deviant and the upright unseparated. One enters side paths and crooked trails, clinging to emptiness or fixating on forms—this is not the cultivation of reality but the pursuit of the false. Such pursuit of the false distances one daily from the Dao, merely misleading one’s nature and destiny. How then can one cultivate and preserve them?\n\nThis is why the Immortal Elder Ziyang composed the *Awakening to Reality*. Its verses delve into the profound and subtle, drawing from afar and near, comparing and illustrating in myriad ways. Its original intent was for all to awaken to reality and each to cultivate the Dao. Yet alas, later generations of deluded fools, failing to receive the true transmission, cling to forms and adhere to words, making wild guesses and private conjectures. Some regard it as inner alchemy, others as external refinement; some suspect it of emptiness and stillness, others fall into fixation on forms—greatly betraying the compassionate intent of the Immortal Elder to deliver the world.\n\nAmong the annotations of earlier awakened ones, there are indeed fine interpretations. Fine though they may be, they remain explanations of symbols by symbols, comparisons by comparisons, concealing the head while revealing the tail, hiding the mother while speaking of the child. They dare not plainly reveal the truth, leaving learners bewildered and unable to awaken. These are not *awakenings* to *Awakening to Reality* but mere *retellings* of it.\n\nAlas! The more annotations there are, the more obscure the principle becomes; the more books proliferate, the more people are confused. The true Dao declines daily, while deviant paths flourish; genuine learning is buried, while false teachings arise—strange and ever stranger. No wonder Confucians regard Daoism as heterodoxy!\n\nI myself, having inhaled the fragrant breeze from the incense burner of the hermitage, recognize this book as the treasury of the principles of Dao cultivation and the celestial ladder to attaining reality. Its roots in nature and destiny, its fire phases and sequences—none are lacking. Yet for too long, it has been obscured by deviant interpretations, like the sun veiled by dark clouds, its radiance unmanifest.\n\nAs a humble student fortunate enough to draw near the gate, I cannot bear to withhold this true treasure from fellow seekers. Thus, I name this work *The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*. I do not presume to claim I have grasped the truth but merely offer it to rescue the true.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, the cyclical year *jiwei*, by the Plain-and-Simple Man of Dwelling Cloud Mountain, Awakened Primordial One, Liu Yiming, in his *Abode of Ease*.\n\n*Original Preface to the Awakening to Reality*\nAlas!",

      "translated_text": "The human body is hard to obtain, yet the passage of time is swift; who can fathom its span or escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken early to this truth but merely resigns to awaiting the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads may plunge one into the three evil destinies—then, drifting through kalpas of dust, there shall be no end to suffering. At such a time, though one may repent, what use is it?\n\nThus, the elders of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means through the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate and refine themselves to escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, one transcends directly to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one ascends immediately to sagehood. But if one fails to illuminate the original nature, one remains bound to the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains words on exhausting principle, fulfilling *xing*, and attaining *ming*; the *Analects* speaks of \"no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no self-absorption\"—this, too, is Confucius’ profound attainment of the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words often brief and not expounded in detail? It is because he sought to order human relations and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music—all active virtues. Thus, he did not explicitly speak of the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of *ming* within the images of the *Changes* and blended the methods of *xing* into subtle words.\n\nAs for *Zhuangzi*, who explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi*, both approached the subtleties. Later, Wei Boyang of the Han dynasty drew upon the *Changes*’ principle of the union of yin and yang to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of Loyalty prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the origin and end of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?\n\nAlas! In later generations, the followers of the Yellow and the Black robes each clung to their own traditions, mutually rejecting one another, causing the essential purport of the three teachings to be lost amid deviant paths, unable to merge and return to unity.\n\nMoreover, people today believe that the Daoist gate emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two paths: one easy to encounter but difficult to accomplish, the other difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the five sprouts, ingesting the light of the seven luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and commanding talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, preserving spirit and holding breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, and practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining metals, minerals, herbs, and trees—all belong to the category of the easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish.\n\nIf one diligently applies effort to the above methods, though they may fragmentarily benefit the cultivation of the body, the results remain unverifiable despite great exertion. At best, they may help avoid illness and avert misfortune. Yet once discontinued, the previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such practices merely prolong the years without ensuring success. How, then, can one hope for a single attainment to become permanent, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and ascend in flight? Is this not exceedingly difficult? Truly, it is a cause for deep sorrow!\n\nMost modern practitioners cling blindly to misconceptions, failing to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that all who attain the Dao do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of heavenly secrets, they instead attribute their success to various other practices. Among these, only the method of holding the breath—if one can forget scheming and still the mind—resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If practiced diligently, it may lead to entering samadhi and projecting spirit. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must constantly employ methods of transference. Without mastering the Dao of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones and exchange yang, ascending to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three *xing* in the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible boils, and the golden furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this occurs in but a moment’s effort, yet secures boundless ease and joy forever.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and contemplating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing correctness and maintaining fullness, one must hold to the feminine and embrace the One. Naturally, the *qi* of returning yang will arise, and the form of slaying yin will be shed. Once the nodal *qi* is complete, one sheds the womb and transforms spirit, is inscribed in the registers of immortals, and titled as a Perfected One—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, point to the viscera as the five phases, divide heart and kidney into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lung as dragon and tiger, use spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and cling to fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they know the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang’s mutual employment? All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returning Elixir? Is this not exceedingly difficult?\n\nFrom youth, I have been fond of the Dao, delving into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, and extending my studies to law, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and fate—nothing has escaped my careful inquiry. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, white metal and black tin, the *li* male and *kan* female, capable of forming the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Yet none reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor expound on the methods of fire phases, the standards of cultivation, or the aims of nurturance.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded followers, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad errors. Not only do they disorder the immortal classics, but they also mislead and confuse later learners.",

      "translated_text": "I, having yet to meet a perfected one and seldom encountered oral instructions, grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withered and waned. Though I sought far and wide across land and sea, consulting the wise and foolish alike, none could fathom the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* era, I followed Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu. Unwavering in my long-held resolve and ever more reverent in my sincerity, I at last moved a true person to impart the secrets of the Golden Elixir—its ingredients, medicines, and fire phases. His words were spare, his essentials uncluttered, such that pointing to the stream revealed the source, one phrase awakened a hundred insights, mist dispersed to reveal the sun’s brilliance, dust settled to mirror perfect clarity. Compared with the immortal classics, they matched as tally and seal.\n\nI reflected that of those who study immortality, eight or nine in ten pursue it, yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essentials. Having encountered this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it in silence? I poured forth all I had received, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them: sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the number of two eights; sixty-four jueju verses aligned with the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*; one pentasyllabic poem to symbolize the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics to correspond to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully set forth the hierarchy of vessels, the weights of medicines, the advance and retreat of fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of life and death, and the auspices of fortune, regret, and remorse.\n\nYet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and solidifying form, leaving the original awakening of true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that ancestral masters had attained enlightenment upon hearing the strike of bamboo. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I now append to the end of the volume. May this suffice to convey the Way of realizing the root and illuminating nature.\n\nMy hope is that like-minded readers, upon perusing these, may perceive the branch and awaken to the root, abandoning delusion to follow truth.\n\nWritten on New Year’s Day of the *Yimao* year of the *Xining* era of the Great Song, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai.\n\n**Postscript to *Awakening to Reality***\n\nI observe that human birth arises from deluded passions, which give rise to this body. With this body comes suffering; without it, whence would suffering arise? To escape suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao; to embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind. Thus, the mind is the substance of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe nature, the luminous and perfect substance will manifest of itself, and the effortless function will spontaneously arise. Without need for contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. How could this occur unless the mind-mirror shines resplendently and the spirit-pearl radiates clarity, such that all phenomena instantly dissolve, not a speck of dust adheres, the mind-source remains free, and birth-and-death is decisively overcome?\n\nYet for those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao, the body cannot burden their nature, nor can circumstances disturb their truth. How then could blades and weapons harm them, tigers and rhinoceroses endanger them, or great fires and floods cause them concern? The enlightened one’s mind, like a mirror, reflects without grasping; responding to circumstances, they harmonize without leading. Thus, they master things without being harmed—this is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth.\n\nOriginally, the Dao had no name; the sages forcibly named it. The Dao had no words; the sages forcibly spoke of it. Yet if names and words were silenced, later generations would have no means to recognize its substance and return to its truth. Therefore, the sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao is made manifest through words, while words, through the Dao, return to oblivion.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature, cling to their bodies, loathing death and delighting in life, and thus rarely attain awakening. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life, following their desires to guide them gradually. Since the essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Daodejing* and *Yinfu Jing* flourished in the world—because people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound. Though scholars recite their texts, none comprehend their meaning. Without encountering a perfected one to transmit oral instructions, even if one were to speculate a hundred ways, one could never achieve its work or accomplish its task. Is this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns?\n\nIn the *Jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu and received the method of the Elixir. Thereafter, I transmitted it thrice to unworthy recipients and thrice suffered calamities, each lasting no more than twenty days. Recently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition: *\"If one day someone comes to loosen your bonds and shackles, you may transmit it to them; otherwise, you must not.\"* Later, wishing to dissolve my name from the registers, yet fearing that people would not believe in this Way, I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, setting forth the origins and ends of the Elixir method.\n\nOnce published, seekers flocked to me in droves. Seeing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse, and so I selected some to instruct. Yet those I instructed were none of great power or strength, capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning—none were magnanimous, outstanding, benevolent, or enlightened. Initially, I suffered calamities twice and remained ignorant of my errors; it was only at the third that I reflected on my past transgressions.\n\nThus, I know the Great Elixir’s method is most simple and easy. Even the dullest and most foolish, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to sagehood. Therefore, Heaven cherishes and guards it, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, Boduan, disregarded my teacher’s words and repeatedly divulged Heaven’s secrets. Because of this body, I have repeatedly incurred Heaven’s reproof and suffering—so swift and divine is Heaven’s admonition. How dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself?\n\nFrom this day forward, I shall seal my lips and still my tongue. Though cauldrons and blades were placed before me, though swords were laid upon my neck, I would never again dare speak of it.",

What need have they for Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In this, it is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous transmission.\n\nAs for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse on the matter of seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrous, awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its foremost task; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately arise. Alas, ordinary beings, bound by karma of varying depth and endowed with faculties sharp or dull, even upon hearing a single note, scatter into divergent views. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are but the One Vehicle, yet listeners, according to their capacity, comprehend it differently, naturally forming the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nHereafter, should a person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and may awaken to the myriad dharmas through a single word.

For those who cultivate the Great Dao, the yang within yin is true yang, corresponding to the first quarter; the yin within yang is true yin, corresponding to the last quarter.

      "translated_text": "How then is this called \"return\"? \"Return\" speaks of what has gone and yet comes back; \"restore\" means what was lost and yet is regained. That the numinous root of original nature becomes obscured is all due to the disharmony of yin and yang, the mutual injury of the Five Phases. Should yin and yang truly unite as one, the Five Phases gather and cluster, and it remains the same unbroken, perfectly complete thing as of old.\n\nThese two things—one firm, one yielding; one strong, one compliant; one true knowing, one numinous knowing; one true feeling, one numinous nature—abide thus: true knowing resides in the mind of Dao, governing firmness and strength, issuing forth as true feeling; numinous knowing lies hidden in the human mind, governing compliance and softness, containing within it numinous nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing separate, strength is no longer rightly strong, compliance no longer rightly compliant; firmness and softness lose their measure, and true feeling and numinous nature transform into false feeling and false nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing unite, strength is as it ought to be strong, compliance as it ought to be compliant; firmness and softness follow the moment. False feeling and false nature transform back into true feeling and numinous nature.\n\nThe Immortal Elder said: \"When the two things meet, feeling and nature unite—how could this not be perfectly clear?\"\n\nThe Five Phases are the five qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In the prenatal state, these five qi are the Five Primes: original nature, original feeling, original essence, original spirit, and original qi. In the postnatal state, they become the five entities: wandering soul, ghostly po, yin essence, conscious spirit, and deluded intent. The Five Primes possess the Five Virtues: humaneness, rightness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The five entities possess the Five Dispositions: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire.\n\nWhen the Five Phases are complete, prenatal and postnatal merge and gather, the Five Primes governing the five entities. The Dragon is yang, master of the impulse of life, belonging to Wood of the Eastern Direction, corresponding in humans to nature. The Tiger is yin, master of the impulse of destruction, belonging to Metal of the Western Direction, corresponding in humans to feeling. When the Five Phases are disharmonious, each strays from its nature: the Five Primes transform into the five entities, the Five Virtues into the Five Thieves. Dragon in the East, Tiger in the West—nature in chaos, feeling deluded—become false nature and deluded feeling, destructive qi eclipsing life qi. When the Five Phases are complete, all return to one nature: the five entities transform back into the Five Primes, the Five Thieves into the Five Virtues. Dragon coiled, Tiger crouched—nature settled, feeling forgotten—become true feeling and true nature, and even destructive qi becomes life qi.\n\nThe Way of Elixir refinement is nothing more than harmonizing firmness and softness, ensuring strength and compliance are in balance, nature and feeling united. When nature and feeling unite, yin and yang meet, the Five Phases are complete, and it is once more the undifferentiated principle of Heaven, supremely good without evil, luminous knowing and innate ability—original things restored—and the Golden Elixir returns.\n\nYet after the original prenatal state scatters, nature drifts east, feeling west; firmness and softness no longer respond. Without a harmonizing agent to convey messages back and forth, they remain cut off, forever unaware of each other. This harmonizing agent is the two earths of wu and ji. Wu earth governs movement and belongs to yang; ji earth governs stillness and belongs to yin. That which is utterly still is ji earth; that which responds upon sensing is wu earth. The two earths of wu and ji correspond in the Five Virtues to true trust. True trust abides within, and nature is settled; true settledness is applied without, and feeling is harmonized. When nature is settled and feeling harmonized, nature and feeling return to their root, like husband and wife in joyful union. Humaneness, rightness, propriety, and wisdom return to one trust; nature, feeling, spirit, and essence converge in one qi. The Three Families meet, the five qi pay homage to the origin, returning to the root and restoring the origin—the Golden Elixir congeals, also called the Sacred Embryo. With further effort directed upward, one moves from effortful practice to effortless attainment.\n\nFor ten months, the embryo is nurtured, firmly sealed and secured. Excess in strong feeling is drawn out, deficiency in compliant nature is replenished. Using the natural true fire, one practices \"morning Layering, evening Delving,\" refining away postnatal yin qi. From formlessness, form arises; from the subtle, the manifest. Qi becomes full, spirit complete—with a thunderous crack, the golden cicada sheds its husk, a body appears beyond the body.

      "translated_text": "The seven kinds of cinnabar are tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and humors. The instability of these seven kinds of cinnabar all stems from the instability of the numinous awareness of the human heart. Yet the instability of the human heart’s numinosity arises from the loss of the heart of Dao, which fails to stabilize it. If one wishes to retain the numinous awareness of the human heart, one must first apply this true knowing of the heart of Dao. Once the true knowing and true seed are established, there is an inner sovereign that is not deluded by杂 qi, and the numinous awareness of the human heart naturally congeals without scattering. Borrowing the heart of Dao to restrain the human heart, aligning the human heart with the heart of Dao, using true knowing to govern numinous knowing, and employing numinous knowing to nurture true knowing—hard and soft correspond, strength and compliance unite, nature and emotions harmonize. Within half a *shi* (an hour), they coalesce into a single luminous and radiant pearl. Its numinous light shines brightly, and no yin or malevolent qi can harm it. Thus it is said: *\"The divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor; a single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\"*\n\nThe \"divine work\" refers to the subtle operation of numinous clarity and the practice of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude). \"Fire\" refers to the harmonious qi of true knowing and numinous knowing united in hardness and softness. \"Firing\" means being cautious where nothing is seen and fearful where nothing is heard—applying this true knowing and numinous knowing, uniting hardness and softness, ensuring not a trace of impurity lingers within the heart. This divine fire of the work is like casting a shadow with a pole or echoing a voice in a valley. If one resolutely applies it, without waiting a full day, one can reverse yin to return to yang, like the sun over a deep pool, where yin qi naturally retreats.\n\nThe most crucial part of the verse lies in the four characters \"欲留\" (*desiring to retain*) and \"先下\" (*first applying*). Within them lies the principle of \"striking first to control others,\" where righteousness does not yield to guests. Grasping this principle, the inversion of yin and yang, the harmonization of the four images, becomes as easy as turning one’s palm. This is the symbolic method of *waidan* (external alchemy).\n\n*Waidan* is another name for *huandan* (returning elixir), for it has departed and then returns, has been lost and is regained, moving from without to within—hence it is called *waidan* or *huandan*. Once returned, it becomes *neidan* (internal elixir); this is the distinction between internal and external.\n\n---\n\nThe fifth verse:\n*\"Tigers leap and dragons soar—waves and winds rage rough;\nAt the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born.\nThough fruit on the branch will ripen in time,\nHow can the child in the womb be different?\"*\n\n*\"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms;\nMorning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—\nWhy seek deep mountains to guard solitary stillness?\"*\n\nThis poem speaks of the matter of the returning elixir, while the previous verse speaks of the Dao of the great elixir. The Dao of the great elixir is the work of a single moment. In this moment, one’s virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, one’s clarity merges with the sun and moon, one’s order merges with the four seasons, and one’s fortune merges with spirits and gods. It is difficult to encounter yet easy to err; the slightest carelessness, and the primordial true unity of qi is gained and then lost. This primordial true unity of qi is the returning elixir. Because the returning elixir is formed from the union of hard and soft qi, it is called the true unity of qi—there is no true unity of qi beyond the returning elixir.\n\nWhen the returning elixir is attained, the heart of Dao is firm and strong, the human heart is soft and compliant, true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, round and luminous—returning to the state at the beginning of life, where good knowing and good ability are quiescent and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated, the original face of things. This thing, due to its firm nature, is called true lead; due to its robust qi, it is also called the male tiger. True lead and the male tiger are both the vast and upright qi, utterly good without evil, the innate celestial truth of good knowing and good ability.\n\nHaving regained this celestial truth, one must return it to the state before parents were born, where the five phases do not reach, to forge an enduring and indestructible celestial truth. Thus, when celestial truth is restored, one must warm and nurture it, seal and store it securely, emptying to the utmost and stilling profoundly. When yang qi is abundant and stillness reaches its peak, movement arises, and the numinous sprout appears—the time when, as Ancestor Lü said, *\"The midnight hour lingers, the lead cauldron warms, and light pierces the curtains.\"*\n\nAt this moment, the yang light emerges from its cave like a tiger, vigorous and unstoppable. One must swiftly use the spark of empty numinous fire from true nature to meet it. This empty numinous fire is called the female dragon. *\"Tigers leap and dragons soar\"* symbolizes the struggle of yin and yang. *\"Waves and winds rage rough\"* signifies the wind rising as the tiger leaves its cave and the waves surging as the dragon leaves the pool—the contention of yin and yang. When dragon and tiger unite, nature and emotions harmonize, merging into one and entering the center. The primordial qi comes from emptiness, congealing into a single millet-like pearl—the sacred embryo takes form.\n\nThe sacred embryo is the valley spirit; the valley spirit is the numinous union of *xuan* and *pin*. Yang *xuan* is the tiger’s emotion; yin *pin* is the dragon’s nature. When nature and emotion unite, the sacred embryo forms; when the primordial *pin* is established, the valley spirit is born. At this stage, the work of action is complete, and the work of non-action manifests—no further effort is needed; one lets it be. Like fruit on the branch, it will ripen in time; like the child in the womb, it will be born in due course.\n\nYet even as the sacred embryo congeals, one must still guard against danger and risk—this cannot be ignored. *\"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms\"* means the south is fire, the north is water; when the sacred embryo congeals, harmonious qi steams and permeates, water and fire return to their source, naturally refining each other. One practices the work of neither forgetting nor forcing. *\"Morning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot\"* means morning is the beginning of the day, when yang qi governs; evening is the beginning of the night, when yin qi governs.",

      "translated_text": "The celestial pivot is the dynamic of yin and yang qi—when yang is due, one employs yang; when yin is due, one employs yin. The firing process advances and retreats, subtly aligning with the mechanisms of morning and evening, the ceaseless vigilance of day and night. Neither forgetting nor forcing, this day-and-night vigilance, this gentle nurturing over ten months, transforms the postnatal trigrams and sheds the prenatal dharmakāya. My life is governed by me, not by Heaven.\n\nThis Dao is cultivated among humanity and practiced amid the dust of the marketplace. Its great function and true application lie in concrete effort, not in empty, effortless extinction. Thus it is said: *One must know the great hermit dwells in the city’s bustle—why seek solitude in deep mountains?*\n\n**Sixth Stanza**\nEvery person possesses the elixir of immortality,\nYet deluded seekers heedlessly cast it aside.\nWhen sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite;\nWhere the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li merge.\nThe well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists;\nThe fence-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.\nWhen the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house—\nWhy search for herbs to burn as straw?\n\nThe three preceding poems elucidate the great elixir of returned cinnabar, its ingredients, and firing times in full and clear detail. Yet lest practitioners mistakenly assume the golden elixir is forged by refining common substances, this poem follows closely to correct such errors.\n\nThe golden elixir is none other than the original nature of innate knowing and innate ability, bestowed upon each person. This nature is complete in all, perfectly realized in each—unchanged in sages, undiminished in ordinary beings. It requires no external pursuit, for it is inherently one’s own. With a resolute heart, one ascends directly to the sacred realm; with nature stabilized and life congealed, it endures unbroken. This original nature of innate knowing and ability is the great elixir of immortality.\n\nAll deluded seekers, failing to investigate the true principles of sages and worthies, neglecting the root of nature and life, abandon the near to chase the distant, discard the real to grasp the false. They pass their lives in vain, achieving nothing by old age—heedlessly casting away what is most precious. How lamentable! How tragic!\n\nHuman life is endowed with the vigorous virtue of innate knowing, received from Heaven—this is Heaven itself. It is also endowed with the compliant virtue of innate ability, received from Earth—this is Earth itself. The originally empty, luminous spirit is the numinous nature, transformed from Earth’s qi—this is fire. The originally pure, unadulterated essence is true feeling, transformed from the qi of Heaven’s unity—this is water.\n\nWhen one unites vigor and compliance as one, Heaven and Earth within the body merge, like sweet dew sprinkling the heart, instantly dissolving afflictions. When one preserves spirit and essence without dissipation, Kan and Li within the body unite, like the yellow sprout naturally arising, restoring primordial qi.\n\nSweet dew descends when the heart is clear. The yellow sprout arises when the mind is still.

      "translated_text": "Hearing talk of medicinal substances and firing times, one may suspect these to be the strange and bizarre techniques of burning and refining in the Mao school, with no limit to their eccentricities. Yet they know not that in the great elixir’s cultivation, when the day of ripening arrives, gold and jade fill the hall—life preserved, form perfected, wealth and honor incomparable. How could one cling to the dross of worldly things?\n\n**Its seventh [poem] states:**\n*Know well the source where the medicine is born—*\n*Only in the southwest recognize your homeland.*\n*When lead meets the arising of gui, swiftly gather;*\n*Gold past the full moon is no longer fit to taste.*\n*Send it to the earthen crucible, sealed fast;*\n*Then join with the flowing pearl in proper match.*\n*A pound of medicine requires two times eight;*\n*Adjust the firing time, entrusting to yin and yang.*\n\nThis verse speaks of the elixir of longevity present in every person, yet does not specify where or when the medicine arises. Thus, this poem clarifies the precise origin of its birth, so that practitioners may work in accord with the time and carefully tend the firing.\n\nThe southwest is the direction of *kun*, where the moon’s waning reaches its extreme and revives—where yin at its utmost generates yang. In the human body, this is the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and first stirs. This stirring at stillness’s extreme is when the great medicine appears. Yet this stirring is not the movement of external guest qi or emotional desires, nor the inner stirring of the heart’s thoughts and intentions. It is the stirring of the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing, the stirring of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. This Heavenly Heart and innate knowing, this Dao-Heart and true knowing—because they can transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, raise the dead and restore life—they are symbolized as the medicinal substance. Because at the moment of extreme stillness, when the ten thousand conditions are all stilled, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing reveal a glimmer of light at their inception, they are symbolized as the place where the medicine is born. Because the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing arise from darkness as whiteness, emerge from emptiness, and stir from stillness like a river with its source, they are symbolized as the river-source where the medicine is born.\n\nThis medicine is, in the prior heaven, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing; in the posterior heaven, it is the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. The Dao-Heart is the reflection of the Heavenly Heart; true knowing is the reflection of innate knowing. Because the Heavenly Heart, submerged in the posterior heaven, cannot always abide and only occasionally appears, it has another name: the Dao-Heart. Because innate knowing, sunk in the sea of desire, has its radiance dimmed and only intermittently remains unobscured, it has another name: true knowing. Yet after the return to the origin, the Dao-Heart is still the Heavenly Heart, and true knowing is still innate knowing. When it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, this is the homeland of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. For in the place where it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, a spark of the prior heaven’s true unity and vital impulse resides. By relying on this spark and reversing the course of cultivation, how could one not restore the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing? Yet the restoration is not difficult—what matters is knowing the stirring at stillness’s extreme, the river-source.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\"* The *Book of Changes* states: *\"The Way of return: in seven days it comes back.\"* Both refer to the river-source where the Dao-Heart’s true knowing is born.\n\nOnce the river-source of the medicine’s birth is known, one must understand the moment to begin. The marvelous work of elixir refinement is simply to take the Dao-Heart’s single flavor as the mother of the elixir. Because the Dao-Heart is firm and strong, possessing the sentiment of true knowing, it is symbolized as true lead—lead containing silver, black without and white within. The Dao-Heart contains true knowing, dark without yet bright within, which is why the immortals all compare the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to true lead. They are unwilling to point it out directly, valuing and honoring it, lest it be stolen by the unworthy.\n\nThis Dao-Heart’s true knowing, buried and drowned by emotions and desires, cannot emerge on its own. Yet once the river-source is known, it can be gradually gathered and restored. The method of restoration must still be sought within emotions and desires. True knowing is born of Heaven’s one, a pure and perfectly clear yang water—*ren* water. Emotions and desires are born of Earth’s six, a turbid and utterly impure yin water—*gui* water. *Ren* water is hidden within *gui* water; without *gui* water’s arising, *ren* water does not appear, and true lead is not seen. *\"When lead meets the arising of gui\"* refers precisely to the joining of yin and yang qi, when *gui* has just arisen but has not yet taken effect. *Ren* water has not dispersed, true knowing has not dimmed—swiftly gather it and return it to the suspended womb crucible, and emotions and desires will have no place to act and will naturally vanish. This is what Zhang Sanfeng meant by *\"plucking the fresh blossoms beyond the wall.\"*\n\n*\"Gold past the full moon\"* refers to having obtained the return of true knowing. Relying on this single spark of true knowing’s true sentiment, it is augmented again and again, advancing toward firmness, strength, centrality, and purity—like refining white gold from lead, its color full and bright. At this stage, innate knowing and innate ability shine unobscured, responding to things with flexibility, moving or stilling at will. Walking freely, every step is the Way—like a bright moon hanging in the sky, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, penetrating the hidden and reaching the obscure. One may then abandon the work of augmentation, leave effortful practice, and enter effortlessness.\n\nYet if one does not know the firing time and fails to stop at fullness, the round will inevitably wane, brightness at its extreme will turn to darkness—like the moon past fullness, where yang generates yin. True knowing is harmed, the true dims and the false arises, and what remains is the dross of the posterior heaven—how could it be fit to taste? Thus, when true knowing has returned to fullness, swiftly send it to the central earthen crucible, seal it firmly to prevent the slightest leakage, then match it with the single drop of numinous flowing pearl from one’s original nature. Borrowing yin to aid yang, using emptiness to nourish fullness, one guards against danger and considers risk. The goal is to reach the state where firmness and softness are as one, yin and yang in perfect balance.",

      "translated_text": "When the dual eights reach their full count—neither more nor less—advance until the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure, without a trace of qi-quality remaining. Yet to fulfill the dual eights, one must rely entirely on regulating the firing time, discerning maturity from tenderness, knowing when to stop at sufficiency, distinguishing fortune from misfortune, and recognizing urgency from slowness. When the time calls for advancing yang, advance yang; when the time calls for moving yin, move yin. Neither great nor small is harmed, and both states are preserved whole. Naturally, the true unified qi of the prior heaven emerges from emptiness, coalescing without dispersion—thus the sacred embryo takes form.\n\nRegulating the firing time precisely adjusts the ceaseless interplay of firmness and softness. When the medicine weighs one jin, firmness and softness both return to central equilibrium; the dual eights align, yin contains yang, yang contains yin, yin and yang merge as one, firmness and softness wholly transform. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating—once responsive and instantly penetrating, still and unmoving, it becomes an indestructible thing forever.\n\nAlas! The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the hour’s arrival at midnight lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The medicine’s nature is inherently difficult to know, and the firing time is likewise not easily understood—how can the seeker not urgently seek a true teacher?\n\nThis poem encompasses the medicine, the firing time, the wondrous workings of the returning elixir and the great elixir, all contained within.

Yet some may suspect the golden elixir to be a tangible worldly substance, forged through smelting—thus the poem immediately declares: *\"Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking myriad herbs is even less the truth.\"* The Three Yellows are sulfur, realgar, and orpiment; the Four Spirits are cinnabar, mercury, lead, and saltpeter. The Three Yellows, Four Spirits, and all herbs are not of our kind—how could they sustain life? How could they refine nature? Failing to sustain life and refine nature, all is in vain, not the true Way.\n\n*The Three Categories* states: *\"Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike seed, no achievement is made.\"* Humans, endowed with heaven and earth’s yin and yang qi, possess within their bodies the qi and virtue of yin and yang.

When firmness and softness both return to the center, yin and yang are in perfect balance, neither leaning nor tilting—they naturally unite, intimately bound, merging into a single qi, congealing without dispersion. When yin and yang find their kind, and the two-and-eight are balanced, the postnatal returns to the prenatal: the Dao-heart is firm, the human heart is gentle, true knowing and numinous knowing merge, and the original, single spark of innate knowing and ability emerges from the void of thought.\n\nLike the crimson sun rising from the pond’s depths—yin’s illusions vanish;\nLike the pale moon hanging high on the mountain’s peak—the elixir sprouts fresh.\nFor when the upright qi arises, deviant qi naturally retreats; when the true returns, the false instantly dissolves.

With the celestial heart restored, knowing and ability are both refined—this is the golden elixir. This golden elixir is the true yin and true yang originally possessed, conjoined in firmness and softness, the true treasure of fulfilling nature and attaining life—how could it be forged from common cinnabar or quicksilver?\n\n**Poem Nine**\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;\nCultivating but one thing only weakens the body.",

Ten**\nDiligently seek true lead with intent,\nLest time slip by in vain.\nBut capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury,\nAnd the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal.\nThis may be called: the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nIt may be said: virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.\nOnce you know longevity equals heaven and earth,\nNo vexation shall ever arise in the heart.\n\nThe preceding poem teaches one to thoroughly investigate the source of birth,\nTo return to the origin and restore the primordial.\nYet to do so, one must recognize the one great medicine—true lead.\nRecognizing true lead means all ten thousand affairs are complete;\nAll else becomes easy.\nTrue lead is no other thing—\nIt is the true knowing of the heart-mind’s Dao, as mentioned before.\nTrue knowing is also called the true seed.\nWithout recognizing the true seed, cultivation lacks a root,\nAnd all efforts are in vain.\nThus it says: *Diligently seek true lead with intent*—\nThe phrase *with intent* contains the work of investigating things and attaining knowledge, the effort of exhausting principle.\nIf one wishes to cultivate the great Dao,\nFirst thoroughly investigate real principle.\nOnce real principle is penetrated, the work of cultivation yields immediate results.\nWithout such penetration, vainly hoping for celestial treasures\nIs like grasping at emptiness—wasting time in vain.\n\nEarthly po and watery metal are yang within yin,\nAll images of true knowing.\nCelestial hun and cinnabar mercury are yin within yang,\nAll images of numinous knowing.\n*But capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury*—\nThis means using true knowing to restrain numinous knowing.\n*And the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal*—\nThis means using numinous knowing to nurture true knowing.\nTrue knowing is firm, belonging to yang, the husband;\nNuminous knowing is yielding, belonging to yin, the wife.\nWhen the husband restrains the wife, the wife naturally submits;\nWhen the wife submits, the husband also cherishes her.\nHusband and wife in harmony, the vital mechanism endures.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The great yang’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart;\nOnly when it obtains golden radiance does it turn and abide.\"*\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing, two united as one,\nFirmness and softness return to the center.\nTransformed into good knowing and good ability,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive to all things—\nThe sacred embryo takes form.\nAt this stage, the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;\nVirtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.\nLongevity equals heaven and earth,\nAnd what vexation could ever trouble the heart?\n\n**Poem Eleven**\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find—\nThe discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct.\nThe four images and five phases all depend on earth;\nThe three origins and eight trigrams how could they leave ren?\nRefining the numinous essence, others cannot recognize it;\nDissolving yin demons, ghosts dare not intrude.\nWishing to leave this secret formula among humankind,\nYet not a single soul is a true confidant.\n\nThe preceding poem speaks of the Dao’s loftiness and virtue’s weight,\nWhere dragons, tigers, ghosts, and spirits all submit—\nThus, one with the Dao must not lack virtue,\nAnd one with virtue must not lack the Dao.\nThe supreme Way is not complex;\nThe great medicine is not distant.\nWhite clouds lie near at hand;\nYellow sprouts grow within the household.\nIf one has the will, it may be grasped effortlessly—\nThus it says: *not hard to find*.\nYet this Way transcends the mundane to enter the sacred,\nRevives the dead, and is the rarest thing under heaven.\nThough not hard to find, only those of great virtue and conduct can know it—\nThus it says: *the discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct*.\nIf one is truly a virtuous gentleman or noble man,\nIt will not be hard to find.",

This golden elixir is the true yin and true yang originally possessed, conjoined in firmness and softness, the true treasure of fulfilling nature and attaining life—how could it be forged from common cinnabar or quicksilver?\n\n**Poem Nine**\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;\nCultivating but one thing only weakens the body.",

      "translated_text": "The Four Symbols are the four qi of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, which together with Earth form the Five Phases. The Three Origins are Heaven Origin, Earth Origin, and Human Origin. Alternatively, Upper Origin, Middle Origin, and Lower Origin also constitute the Three Origins. The Eight Trigrams are the yin and yang of the Four Symbols and Five Phases: Qian is yang Metal, Dui is yin Metal; Kan is yang Water, Gen is yin Water; Zhen is yang Wood, Xun is yin Wood; Li is yang Fire, Kun is yin Fire. Though the Eight Trigrams correspond to the yin and yang of the Four Symbols, Kun and Gen also contain the two Earths, wu and ji. Kun is yin Earth, Gen is yang Earth, and the qi of the Five Phases is also within them. In humans, the Five Phases manifest as the five origins of nature, emotion, essence, spirit, and qi, which unfold into the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The Three Origins in humans are original essence, original qi, and original spirit, while the Eight Trigrams in humans correspond to the five origins, five virtues, and the nature of hardness and softness. In sum, the Four Symbols, Three Origins, and Eight Trigrams are all transformations of the Five Phases—there are no Four Symbols, Three Origins, or Eight Trigrams beyond the Five Phases.\n\nWhen Metal in the Four Symbols and Five Phases relies on Earth, it is like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all depending on trust to be complete. How can the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from ren? This is like nature, emotion, spirit, and qi not departing from the unity of essence. The Yellow Sprout is the vital force of Earth, with trust at its core. The White Snow is the light clarity of Water, with essence reaching unity. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom return to trust, holding fast to the center, and the Yellow Sprout gradually grows. Nature, emotion, spirit, and qi return to unity, being only essence and unity. As the White Thunder soars into the void, essence and unity hold the center. Through cultivation and refinement, the longer one practices, the stronger the effort. The mind of Dao remains ever-vigilant, the human mind ever-still. True knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, and a single luminous pearl hangs in the emptiness. Constantly responsive, constantly still, form and emptiness unbound, manifesting or hidden as the time requires—before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; after Heaven, it accords with Heaven’s timing. If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less so humans? How much less so ghosts and spirits? Though people may not recognize it and ghosts cannot invade, is this mere empty talk?\n\nThis Dao is utterly simple and effortless, concise and unburdened. Those who know it ascend to sagehood in an instant, without waiting three years or nine refinements. Yet in the world, there are few virtuous gentlemen, no true men—most merely grasp the axe to hew the axe-handle, still thinking it distant.

      "translated_text": "Twelve\n\nYin and yang in grasses and trees stand paired as one;\nLack but a single half, and fragrance is undone.\nFirst unfurl green leaves, yang’s primacy proclaimed,\nThen bloom red blossoms, yin in quiet train unnamed.\nThis common Way is daily life’s unchanging course,\nYet who returns to this true source with conscious force?\nI say to all who seek the Dao, take heed and hear:\nWithout yin-yang’s discernment, act not without fear.\n\nThe former poem spoke of virtue’s cultivation due;\nThis poem speaks of the Dao’s illumination true.\nThe *Yi* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.”\nIt also says: “Heaven and earth in misty union blend,\nThe myriad things in harmony transform and mend.\nMale and female in essence meet,\nThe myriad things in life complete.”\n\nThe Way of Golden Elixir relies entirely on yang’s vigor and yin’s compliance for its operation. When yin and yang unite as one, the elixir is born and life extended; when yin and yang diverge, discord arises and life is forfeit. Observe the insensate grasses and trees: first, green leaves emerge as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers follow as yin comes in train. Yin and yang never part, and by analogy, all sentient beings in the common Way achieve nothing outside yin and yang—only that the common Way flows with them while the immortal Way reverses their course. To flow with them is to follow yin and yang; to reverse them is to invert yin and yang’s operation. Worldly people know only the Way of following; they do not know the Way of inversion. Thus they chase illusory realms, lose the true source, and when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—when yin reaches its peak, death follows.\n\nFor scholars, the first step is to recognize the two things: yin and yang. Once yin and yang are known, the true source is likewise known. The true source is the Gate of Mystery and Darkness, where yin is born, where yang is born, where following and inversion both reside. Know the constant and return to the root, and you ascend to sagehood in an instant.\n\nYet yin and yang are not uniform: there are prior-heaven yin and yang, posterior-heaven yin and yang; there are yin and yang of fate, yin and yang of nature; there are true yin and yang, false yin and yang; there are outer yin and yang, inner yin and yang. All these must be thoroughly investigated until clarity is achieved before daring to proceed. Without recognizing true yin and true yang, acting recklessly leads to abandoning the real for the false, squandering one’s nature and life.\n\nThirteen\n\nNot knowing inversion’s turn within the mystery’s core,\nHow can one plant lotuses in fire’s embrace more?\nLead the White Tiger home to tend with care,\nAnd bear a luminous pearl bright as the moon’s sphere.\n\nDo not idly watch the furnace, tending flame and hour,\nBut still the spirit’s breath and let nature take its power.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens true,\nLeap from the cage of mortal bounds to live ten thousand years anew.\n\nThe former poem taught recognition of yin and yang;\nThis poem teaches the investigation of their function’s span.\nFunction is the method of inverting yin and yang.\nWithout knowing this inversion’s art, how grasp the lotus in fire’s fang?\n\nWhat is inverted? What is turned? The White Tiger, metal-aligned,\nIs the pure, unyielding qi of Qian’s palace, named the mind of Dao,\nWhich, when invested, becomes the true knowing’s emotion.\nYet through posterior-heaven’s exchange, the human mind takes sway,\nThe mind of Dao grows dim, true feeling fades and false arises,\nAs the White Tiger leaves its home to roam and harm afar.\nTo invert is to return from false feeling to the true,\nTo pair it with true nature, as the White Tiger homeward drew.\n\nWhen true feeling moves, true nature appears,\nAnd nature and feeling in love unite.\nThe prior-heaven’s true unity of qi arises from the void,\nForming a precious pearl, round as the moon’s full light,\nIts radiance illuminating mountains, rivers, and the earth entire,\nAs if held within the palm—this is the Golden Elixir’s sign.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: “When metal returns to nature’s dawn,\nIt is called the Returned Elixir,” and so it is drawn.\n\nOnce the Returned Elixir is formed,\nInnate knowing and ability, in stillness, act not,\nIn motion, follow nature’s course, at ease within the Way.\nMedicine is fire, fire is medicine,\nThe work of gathering is unneeded.\nSimply still the spirit’s breath and let nature hold its sway.\nWithin the furnace of creation, yin and yang in harmony blend,\nTrue fire refines away the posterior-heaven’s yin,\nTransforming it to pure yang—this is the elixir’s ripening.\nSwallow and ingest it, shed the mortal coil,\nLeap from the mundane cage, your life span heaven’s to share,\nAnd live forever, deathless, beyond compare.\n\nFourteen\n\nThree, five, one—just three words compose the key,\nYet from ancient times to now, few truly see.",

gathering the five phases into one qi\nTo enter the sacred foundation.\nYet to gather the five phases,\nOne must first recognize the prior-heaven’s true singular qi.\nThe single yang within Kan\nIs the firm, strong, and upright qi of Qian’s house,\nThe true knowing of the Dao-heart,\nSymbolized as true lead—born of heaven’s one.\nIt holds the prior-heaven’s true singular qi,\nThe ancestral qi that gives life to all things.\nWithin it lies the potential to become a sage or immortal,\nTo become a buddha or transcendent—\nIt is the root of sages and worthies,\nThe seed of immortals and buddhas,\nThe true ancestor of the golden elixir.\nAs the saying goes, \"Know the one, and all affairs are complete.\"\nWithout recognizing true lead, one lacks an ancestor,\nAnd the elixir has no root.\nAll practices—abandoning one’s wife, fasting,\nRefining herbs, metals, or silver,\nIngesting clouds, mist, sun, or moon,\nExpelling turbid qi, or visualizing images—\nEither cling to emptiness or grasp at forms,\nAll efforts are wasted,\nAnd how do they relate to the golden elixir?\n\nSixteen\nThough ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures exist,\nThe golden elixir has but this one root.\nRely on Kun’s position to form the body,\nPlant it in Qian’s palace of mutual resonance.\nDo not fault the celestial mechanism for being revealed,\nFor it is learners’ own ignorance that blinds them.\nIf one grasps the meaning of this poem,\nOne will immediately meet the Three Pure Ones and the Most High.\n\nThe preceding fifteen poems,\nWhether speaking of the sequential or the reverse,\nWhether divided or unified,\nWhether pointing to the medicine or indicating the firing times,\nDistinguishing true from false,\nOr setting forth right and wrong in detail—\nTheir subtle layers, though scattered, are not yet whole.\nFearing that people might doubt the complexity of the work\nAnd find progress difficult,\nThis poem summarizes the meaning of the fifteen,\nRevealing the utmost simplicity and ease of the Dao.\n\nSince ancient times, the perfected immortals,\nIn their scriptures and Daoist texts,\nHave used a thousand metaphors and a hundred analogies,\nEstablishing images and crafting words\nTo exhaustively describe and clarify the marrow of the Dao.\nThough their expressions differ,\nTheir principles are the same—\nAll illuminate the root of the golden elixir.\nYet in later ages,\nThe more books there are, the more people are confused.\nEach clings to their own views,\nStraying into side doors—\nHow could they know that the root of the golden elixir\nLies in \"taking from Kan to fill Li,\"\nRelying on Kun to return to Qian in one move?\n\"Kun’s position forming the body\" refers to the single yang within Kan;\n\"Qian’s palace of mutual

      "translated_text": "By the age of sixteen, yang reaches its peak and generates yin, entering the postnatal realm where yin-qi prevails. Principle and desire intermingle, firmness and compliance fall out of balance, hardness and softness lose their measure. Thus yang is trapped by yin, the celestial truth becomes obscured—like Qian uniting with Kun, Qian’s single yang line enters the Kun palace, and Kun’s solidity transforms into Kan. Yin usurps yang’s position, knowledge gradually awakens—like Kun uniting with Qian, Kun’s single yin line enters the Qian palace, and Qian’s emptiness transforms into Li.\n\nWhen the celestial truth is obscured, the Dao-heart hides and becomes faint; when knowledge awakens, the human heart arises and becomes perilous. Faintness means near-absence, for yang cannot overcome yin; peril means responding to appearances with emotion, for yin overcomes yang. Yet though the Dao-heart is faint and the human heart perilous, the Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished, nor is the human heart entirely dominant. The Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished because at times a spark of clarity may arise within darkness—this is called true knowing, though it flickers and vanishes. The human heart is not entirely dominant because it can respond to circumstances with adaptability—this is called numinous knowing, though it merely borrows numinosity to generate delusion.\n\nThe Way of cultivating the elixir is to return yang within yin, extracting the true knowing of the Dao-heart and refining the numinous knowing of the human heart. When numinous knowing returns to truth and true knowing returns to numinosity, the Dao-heart becomes firm and strong, the human heart becomes yielding and compliant; yin and yang interact, hardness and softness respond; firmness and compliance align, true and numinous knowing remain undispersed. Thus one restores the original face of innate knowing and ability from the Qian era—this is called \"extracting Kan to fill Li,\" or \"planting in Kun to cultivate Qian.\" In truth, it means relying on Kun’s position to form the body and sowing in Qian’s palace of interaction—this is precisely the meaning of \"extracting Kan to fill Li.\" Extracting Kan releases the yang trapped within, restoring Kun; filling Li transforms the yin mixed within, restoring Qian. When the bodies of Qian and Kun are complete, the Mysterious Female is established and the Valley Spirit abides; the Golden Elixir coagulates, nature and life are attained, and one is no longer bound by postnatal transformation. This is the celestial mechanism transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe ancient immortals refused to speak of it plainly. The Immortal Elder, in his great compassion, revealed in sixteen poems what the ancients had left unsaid—truly \"uprooting the celestial root and chiseling the cavern of principle.\" In the closing lines, he directly points to the root and origin of the Golden Elixir, fully disclosing the celestial mechanism. If one awakens to the marvelous meaning in these poems, one may ascend directly to the sacred realm and immediately behold the Three Pure Ones—how could this be empty words?\n\n*Direct Pointers to Awakening the Truth*, Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains, Corresponding to the Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. On the Cauldron and Furnace (Two Poems):\n\n**I**\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel,\nThen gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.\nOnce these two things are driven back to the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Golden Elixir fail to be born?\n\nQian is firmness, symbolizing Heaven; Kun is compliance, symbolizing Earth. In humans, they are the natures of hardness and softness. The sun contains the Crow—yang within yin—corresponding to the hexagram Li, which is yang outside and yin within; its inner yin line is true yin, in humans the numinous knowing hidden in the human heart. The moon contains the Hare—yin within yang—corresponding to the hexagram Kan, which is yin outside and yang within; its inner yang line is true yang, in humans the true knowing inherent in the Dao-heart.\n\n\"First take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel\" means using firmness and compliance as the foundation for elixir-cultivation. \"Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine\" means employing true knowing and numinous knowing as the function of elixir-cultivation. Refining true knowing until nothing is untrue restores hardness to central correctness; refining numinous knowing until nothing is obscured restores softness to central correctness. When both hardness and softness return to central correctness, the Dao-heart is firm and the human heart compliant; true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, like driving the Crow and Hare back to the Yellow Path.\n\nThe Yellow Path is the Central Path, the sun’s course. The sun travels the Central Path, while the moon travels nine paths. The nine paths consist of four pairs—blue, red, white, and black—each extending beyond the Yellow Path, making eight paths in total. When the moon meets the sun, they interact and travel together, forming nine paths. The place where the sun and moon interact is called \"the two things returning to the Yellow Path.\"\n\nAt the beginning of human life, there is only one true and numinous nature of innate knowing and ability, with no human heart or Dao-heart. After entering the postnatal realm, the human heart and Dao-heart become distinct, as do true knowing and numinous knowing. The human heart encompasses all perception and movement—perception is numinous knowing; the Dao-heart encompasses all situations without delusion—non-delusion is true knowing. The human heart can only possess numinous knowing, not true knowing, and its nature is soft, hence called yin. The Dao-heart possesses true knowing and can also employ numinous knowing, and its qi is hard, hence called yang.\n\nEven sages have a human heart, and even ordinary people have a Dao-heart. Sages have a human heart because they cannot eliminate perception; ordinary people have a Dao-heart because they occasionally have moments of clarity. What distinguishes sages from ordinary people is that their true and numinous knowing remain unified, perceiving and aware, yet constantly undeluded. What distinguishes ordinary people from sages is that their true and numinous knowing are separated, perceiving and aware, yet unable to remain undeluded.\n\nFor the human heart harbors the consciousness-spirit, which borrows numinosity to generate delusion, responding to appearances with emotion and riding the winds to stir waves. Numinosity returns to falsity, and the human heart becomes perilous. When the human heart is perilous, deviant qi flourishes while upright qi weakens; the Dao-heart is not manifest, and the Dao-heart becomes faint. In cultivating the Dao, one refines the hardness of the Dao-heart’s true knowing to return it to central correctness...",

      "translated_text": "To temper the human heart’s numinous knowing in its softness and return it to central correctness is to unite hardness and softness, balance vigor and compliance, be utterly refined and singular, and hold fast to the center. Here, innate knowing and innate ability merge with Heavenly Principle, and a single qi flows unimpeded. How could the Golden Elixir fail to arise? The Golden Elixir is formed by the coagulation of the two qi of hardness and softness; when true knowing and numinous knowing return to central correctness, Heaven and human merge as one, like a single precious pearl suspended in emptiness, illuminating all without exception. The Golden Elixir has form, growing from the subtle to the manifest, from raw to ripe—how could one not attain liberation?\n\n**Second Stanza**\n*Setting the furnace and establishing the crucible, emulating Qian and Kun,*\n*Tempering essence to refine the po and hun.*\n*Gathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, transforming without cease—*\n*Who dares treat the profound and wondrous as commonplace?*\n\nThe furnace serves to circulate fire, the crucible to temper the medicine. In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, one models the furnace after Kun’s soft compliance, advancing step by step; one patterns the crucible after Qian’s firm vigor, applying fierce fire and urgent refinement. Able to be hard, able to be soft; able to be vigorous, able to be compliant—with resolve and thought unwavering, the longer the effort, the greater the strength. When the crucible and furnace are stable, unmoving and unshaken, one may then gather the medicine and circulate the fire.\n\nThe human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, like the essence of the sun, its radiance shining outward. The Dao-heart’s true knowing is like the splendor of the moon, its brilliance concealed within. Numinous knowing, outwardly yang, pertains to the hun; true knowing, outwardly yin, pertains to the po. Numinous knowing and essence-hun are what is called \"spiritual and yet spiritual\"; true knowing and splendor-po are what is called \"not spiritual and yet spiritual.\" \"Spiritual and yet spiritual\" contains falsity within; \"not spiritual and yet spiritual\" holds truth within falsity. To temper essence is to burn away the falsity within the human heart’s numinous knowing and refine the truth within the Dao-heart’s falsity. When false numinosity departs and true numinosity settles, the hun does not fly and is thus mastered; when true knowing appears and false knowing vanishes, the po does not scatter and is thus mastered. Once hun and po are mastered, true knowing and numinous knowing, emotion and nature, converge as one, congealing into a single qi. Misty and harmonious, gathering and dispersing, transforming without end—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and immediately penetrating—every step and movement is Heaven’s mechanism. The wondrousness herein cannot be captured in words.\n\n**Two Poems on the Crescent-Moon Furnace**\n\n**Third**\nDo not cling to alchemical hearths and waste effort—\nTo refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.\nIt possesses a natural, true firing time—\nNo need for firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath.\n\nThe crescent moon appears on the third day of each month, its sliver of light emerging in the Kun direction, its glow upturned—hence the name. In the human, within utmost stillness, a single point of yang light breaks through, resembling the crescent moon. In the hexagrams, this is Zhen, as in the saying: *\"On the third day, Zhen issues forth Geng; by the winding riverbank, the moon’s splendor gleams.\"* This point of yang light is nothing other than the light of the Dao-heart. What is hardest to attain in the Dao of the Elixir is the Dao-heart. Once the Dao-heart appears, Heavenly Principle shines forth, the qi of firmness gradually revives, and mountains, rivers, and the great earth—all become spiritual medicine. Grasped at will, every touch is the Dao. The medicine is the fire, the fire is the medicine; it possesses a natural alchemical furnace and true fire—why labor over hearths, firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath?\n\n**Fourth**\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout;\nIn the cinnabar crucible, mercury lies level.\nOnly after the fire’s power is harmonized\nDoes the yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\nThe crescent-moon furnace is what was earlier called the Dao-heart. The jade bud: jade is a gentle substance, belonging to yin; the bud is a luminous substance, belonging to yang. The jade bud is yang within yin, an analogy for the Dao-heart’s true knowing. The cinnabar crucible is the human heart. Mercury is a fluid, unstable substance, belonging to yin—yang within yin, an analogy for the human heart’s numinous knowing. When the Dao-heart is ever-present and true knowing undimmed, the human heart’s numinous knowing naturally calms, unable to soar. Applying the work of harmonization, one uses the true fire inherent in the Dao-heart to burn away the false numinosity within the human heart, returning it to empty numinosity.",

      "translated_text": "When heaven and humanity unite in emanation, true knowing and numinous knowing become as one. When knowing reaches its fullness and intention becomes sincere, this is called the \"yellow sprout.\" The yellow sprout is the seed of true numinosity, which, nurtured by the warmth of earth, emerges like grass from the soil—first as a sprout of yellow hue, hence the name \"yellow sprout.\" After the fire’s power harmonizes true knowing and numinous knowing, they return to central equilibrium, entering the upper crucible of the central palace. Applying the work of nurturing with true intention, after ten months when qi is full, it naturally ripens and transforms.\n\nSpeaking of true lead, four verses begin:\n\n**Five**\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi—this is human practice,\nYet only with the proper substance can creation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks the true seed,\nOne merely boils an empty cauldron with water and fire.\n\nThe Dao-heart’s true knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, symbolized as lead—the true seed for becoming a sage, worthy, buddha, or immortal. If one wishes to refine the great elixir, apart from this true seed, there is nothing else. Yet deluded fools of the world, practicing only upon their bodily forms and tangible substances—swallowing saliva and absorbing qi, believing themselves to cultivate the Dao—do not realize that what the body produces are merely postcelestial dregs. How can these give birth to the primordial, most numinous and sagely elixir? This is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire, for the crucible holds no true seed.\n\n**Six**\nTo harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,\nNeither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole.\nIf you ask what true lead is,\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\n\nThe golden elixir is formed from the Dao-heart’s true knowing as true lead and the human heart’s numinous knowing as true mercury. To refine the golden elixir, first harmonize lead and mercury. The Dao-heart is firm, belonging to yang, and is great; the human heart is gentle, belonging to yin, and is small. Without the Dao-heart, the human heart borrows its numinosity to generate delusion and obstruct the Dao. Yet if the Dao-heart governs it, numinous clarity remains undimmed and can assist the Dao. The Dao-heart cannot be lacking, nor can the human heart be extinguished—only its false numinosity must not be misused. The ancients taught \"putting the human heart to death,\" meaning to extinguish its false numinosity, not its true numinosity. If one fails to distinguish true from false and extinguishes all, one falls into the study of dull emptiness and annihilation. Harming the small harms the great; with yin and yang isolated, how can the vital breath of life-force give rise to the great Dao of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: neither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole. When both realms are whole, the human heart’s numinous knowing and the Dao-heart’s true knowing merge as one—true knowing governs numinous knowing, and numinous knowing submits to true knowing. True and numinous knowing remain undispersed, returning to innate knowing and innate ability, wholly embodying heaven’s principle, perfectly illuminating original nature, and the golden elixir is complete.\n\nFor true knowing and numinous knowing are the totality of innate knowing and innate ability. In the primordial, they are called innate knowing and innate ability; in the acquired, they are called true knowing and numinous knowing. When the acquired returns to the primordial, true knowing is innate knowing, and numinous knowing is innate ability. True knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family, no different. Yet upon entering the acquired, a speck of heaven’s true purity in innate knowing becomes lost externally, possessed by another household. The numinous ability remaining in one’s own household becomes impure and unstable. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek the whereabouts of the true within false knowing and guide it back to one’s own household, so that numinous knowing remains undimmed. This true knowing is the most firm and vigorous substance, hence symbolized as true lead. True knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, also symbolized as gold within water and as moonlight. Gold within water and moonlight both signify yang within yin. Yet this true knowing, before being restored, still belongs to another household and is not one’s own, hence the saying: \"The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\" The moon contains a golden toad, and the toad’s light is the moon’s light—an analogy for true knowing’s outer darkness and inner brightness. Shining all day upon the west and not the east clearly means its radiance lies there. The immortal’s later verse says: \"The Metal Lord was originally the eastern householder’s child, sent to the western neighbor to lodge and grow.\" This precisely captures the meaning of \"the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.\" If the practitioner can truly recognize that the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—knowing the whereabouts of true knowing—then it can shine eastward and meet with numinous knowing. Alas! Going with the flow brings death; reversing it brings life. Often, one is taught to seek yet cannot find—how easily can true knowing be known?\n\n**Seven**\nBefore refining the returned elixir, do not enter the mountains,\nFor within and without the mountains, there is no lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet fools fail to recognize it fully.\n\nWithdrawing from the world and leaving the dust to dwell in the mountains and nurture stillness are matters for after the elixir’s return. Those who do not understand enter the mountains to nurture stillness, believing this can bring longevity. Yet the way of longevity requires obtaining the single flavor of true lead to be effective. But true lead must be sought within the dusty world. If one enters the mountains to cultivate the Dao, within and without the mountains are entirely yin qi—where can one find the true lead of utmost yang? True lead is the primordial numinous root, also called the heavenly root, the true unity’s essence, the true unity’s qi, the lead of the watery realm, gold within water, white within black, the hun within the po, the black tiger, the Metal Lord, and the other household’s elixir of immortality. The ancients employed many symbols, but in essence, they all describe the single substance of the Dao-heart. This Dao-heart, when active, manifests as the wondrous existence of true knowing; when concealed, it is the true emptiness of the unified essence. It is possessed by all, perfectly complete in each—neither increased in sages nor diminished in commoners—existing in every household.",

      "translated_text": "Yet though it exists in every household, it is not possessed by one’s own household—this is because what is seen cannot be used, and what is used cannot be seen. Precisely because it exists in every household yet is not one’s own, fools encounter it without recognition, passing it by even when face to face. In the late Ming, Peng Haogu, failing to grasp this principle, took the phrase \"existing in every household\" as a direct reference to the \"female crucible,\" while in recent times, Zhiji Zi has annotated it with the Three Peaks’ art of bedchamber warfare. Such benighted delusions mislead later learners—no greater transgression exists!\n\n**VIII.**\nWhen bamboo splits, bamboo must be used to mend it;\nTo hatch a chick, an egg must serve the task.\nAll else is but vain labor, disparate kind—\nHow could it match true lead uniting with the sage’s mechanism?\n\nWhen bamboo splits, bamboo repairs it; when hatching a chick, an egg is used—this is seeking by kind. *The Three Kinds* states: \"Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike kind, skill is hard to achieve.\" If not of its kind, it is not the true seed—all exertion is but vain labor. Thus, the great Way of the golden elixir is the sage’s affair. To learn from the sage, one must seek the sage’s seed, which is the true knowing of true lead. Cultivating the great Way with this true knowing, none will fail to unite with the sage’s mechanism. The sage’s mechanism is nothing other than the undifferentiated heavenly principle—true knowing without a single thing unknown, without a single thing untrue, able to restore the heavenly principle. Hence it is called \"uniting with the sage’s mechanism.\" Once united with the sage’s mechanism, one is a sage—why then do learners refuse to humble their hearts?\n\n**On the Use of Lead**\n**IX.**\nEmpty the heart and fill the belly—both meanings run deep,\nYet emptying the heart first requires knowing the heart.\nBetter to refine lead and fill the belly first,\nThen gather gold to fill the hall.\n\nThe Way of the golden elixir involves emptying the heart and filling the belly—two distinct endeavors. To empty the heart is to empty the human heart, the work of cultivating nature; to fill the belly is to fill the Dao-heart, the work of cultivating life. These two—emptying the heart and filling the belly—are the unfolding of nature and life, each bearing profound meaning. If one wishes to empty the heart, one must first know the heart. For the heart has two aspects: the human heart and the Dao-heart. The human heart should be empty, not full; the Dao-heart should be full, not empty. If one fails to distinguish the true and false, right and wrong of the heart, emptying it indiscriminately, one will not only fail to complete life but also fail to complete nature. If one knows the heart, there is no need to empty the human heart first—one must refine the Dao-heart of true lead to fill the belly. When the belly is full, righteousness gathers and arises, guest qi naturally dissipates, and the human heart empties of itself. The four images harmonize, the five phases converge, gold and jade fill the hall, the treasure of life is in hand—then one may empty the human heart to nourish the Dao-heart, completing the lineage of nature and returning to the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\n\n**On Not Using Lead**\n**X.**",

      "translated_text": "**On Using Lead**\n\nOne must not use common lead; having used true lead, one must also discard it. This is the true esoteric principle of using lead—\"using lead without using it\" is no empty word.\n\nThe method of refining the elixir depends solely on gathering true lead as its essential step. Yet lead is not all the same: there is common lead, and there is true lead. Common lead is that which is mined from mountains, a turbid substance of form, without affinity to the self. True lead is stored within the garden of the household, the formless Dao-heart, of the same kind as the self. Since ancient times, those immortals who have transcended the mundane to enter sagehood have all relied on the power of this true lead, the Dao-heart—hence the saying, \"One must not use common lead.\"\n\nYet though the Dao-heart is a primordial treasure, it arises from the postnatal realm. There is a time for its use, and a time when it must not be used. Before the elixir coalesces, one must rely on the true knowing of the Dao-heart to restrain the numinous knowing of the human heart. Once the human heart is settled and its numinous knowing unobscured, Dao-heart and human heart move and rest as one; true knowing and numinous knowing respond in emptiness and fullness. When the sacred embryo has formed, one must swiftly withdraw the hardness of the Dao-heart to gently nurture the fetal breath.\n\nThe purpose of employing the Dao-heart is to restrain the human heart. Once the human heart is stilled and the consciousness of the senses extinguished, innate knowing and innate capacity remain quiescent and unmoving. Yet when stirred, they respond with perfect clarity; the true spirit abides alone, luminous and undimmed. The Dao-heart is no longer needed, and one may stand where being and nonbeing are both negated, where self and other dissolve entirely into emptiness.\n\nLu Ziye said: \"The method of using lead is like the trap and snare for catching fish and hare.\" Fish and hare are obtained by means of the trap and snare, but once obtained, trap and snare are of no further use. The esoteric principle of using lead lies precisely here. If one does not grasp the secret of using lead and, after the elixir has formed, still clings to the Dao-heart, one will inevitably employ the Dao-heart only to rouse the human heart again. The true spirit scatters once more, and the golden elixir, though gained, is lost again—hence the saying, \"Having used true lead, one must also discard it.\" The secret of \"using lead without using it\" may be understood from this.\n\n**On Lead and Mercury**\n**XI**",

      "translated_text": "The Maiden roams with a method all her own—\nHer forward path must be short, her return path long.\nWhen she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nAnd weds the Metal Elder as her old lord.\n\nThe Maiden is the numinous knowing of nature, as explained in the previous verse. Once she enters the postnatal realm, the mind of man harbors the consciousness-spirit, and the true inevitably mingles with the false. From the numinous arises delusion, and at the sight of fire she takes flight, wandering without constancy—this is what is meant by “coming and going without fixed time, no one knowing her homeland.”\n\nTo refine the Golden Elixir, one must first guide this single spark of numinous nature to roam in the directions it ought to go. Empty its numinosity without obscuring its numinosity, and the numinous will return to true numinosity. The forward path must be short: this is using nature to seek emotion. The return path must be long: this is using the numinous to nurture the true. Using nature to seek emotion is the marvel of forming the elixir in an instant—hence it is called short. Using the numinous to nurture the true is the work of ten months’ gentle cultivation—hence it is called long. Where it should be short, be short; where it should be long, be long—this is what is meant by “having a method all her own.” Follow this method in practice, and the Golden Elixir may be attained.\n\nBut first, one must dismiss cunning and destroy cleverness, turning the light around to reflect inward. Place this single spark of numinous nature in the central, correct position—this is what is meant by “coming back to enter the Yellow Dame’s abode.” The Yellow Dame’s abode is the dwelling of impartiality and centrality, neither leaning nor biased. When numinous nature is centered and correct, the heart is upright and the intent sincere; when the intent is sincere, trust in the true arises, and one no longer roams outside. Thus, using nature to seek emotion, emotion returns to nature, and nature and emotion yearn for each other, merging into a single qi—this is what is meant by “wedding the Metal Elder as her old lord.”\n\n“Old lord” is no ordinary phrase—it carries profound meaning. In the Dao of elixir refinement, one first uses numinous nature to summon true emotion. When true emotion returns, numinous nature remains unshaken, and numinous nature itself naturally returns to the true. Then, one must use numinous nature to restrain true emotion, nurturing true emotion in a realm of pure yang without yin until the end. Like an old husband and an old wife, they grow old together, never allowing discord or a broken mirror along the way. This is precisely the meaning of “the return path must be long.” Scholars must delve deeply into this.\n\nOn Fire Times, Two Poems:\n\nTwenty-Seven\nThough you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.\nThe whole depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.\n\nThe Dao of the Returned Elixir relies solely on taking two medicinal substances, cinnabar and black lead, and forging them into a treasure to extend life and nature. Cinnabar is the single spark of empty numinous qi within *li*, that is, numinous knowing, belonging to the human heart. Black lead is the single spark of firm and upright qi within *kan*, that is, true knowing, belonging to the Dao-heart. Because the human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly bright and inwardly dark, brightness pertains to fire, and fire is red—hence it is symbolized as cinnabar. Because the Dao-heart’s true knowing is outwardly dark and inwardly bright, darkness pertains to water, and water is black—hence it is symbolized as black lead. These are the cinnabar and lead without form or image, not the cinnabar and lead of the mundane world with form and image.\n\nOnce you recognize the cinnabar and lead of true knowing and numinous knowing, you can gather them at will without difficulty. However, gathering them requires forging them. If you know the medicine but not the method of forging it, it is no different from not knowing at all. Thus it is said: *Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.* The Golden Elixir relies entirely on the fire times of cultivation to be accomplished. “Fire” is the power of cultivation, and “times” are the sequence of cultivation. When gathering the medicine, one must know its maturity; when forging the medicine, one must know the seasons. There are the fire times of gentle refinement, the fire times of fierce forging, the fire of initial application, the fire times of cessation and rest, the fire times of advancing yang, the fire times of retreating yin, the fire times of the Returned Elixir, the fire times of the Great Elixir, the fire times of increase and decrease, and the fire times of gentle nurturing. With so many fire times, one must achieve great awakening, knowing the beginning and the end, to succeed. If one errs by a hair’s breadth, the mistake spans a thousand miles, and forming the elixir becomes difficult.\n\nTwenty-Eight\nThe契论 and scriptural songs expound the utmost truth,\nYet they do not set the fire times down in writing.\nTo know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysterious,\nYou must discuss them carefully with an immortal.\n\nSince ancient times, the true immortals’ *契论* and scriptural songs have spoken of the medicine and fire times of cultivating the true in the most detailed and precise way, utterly genuine and without falsehood. Though they discuss them, the discussion does not reach the core; though they speak of them, the words do not exhaust the meaning. How could they not set the fire times down in writing? But the *契论* and scriptural songs are profoundly abstruse: sometimes they speak of nature, sometimes of life; sometimes of medicine, sometimes of fire; sometimes of the fire times of cultivating life, sometimes of the fire times of cultivating nature; sometimes of external fire times, sometimes of internal fire times. They do speak of fire times, but their words are scattered and disordered. Without encountering an enlightened teacher to organize the net and grasp the outline, to fold the clothes and lift the collar, one cannot understand.\n\nThus it is said: *they do not set the fire times down in writing.* And again: *You must discuss them carefully with an immortal.* This teaches one to study the *契论* and scriptural songs while also seeking an enlightened teacher for verification. One must not set aside the *契论* and scriptural songs to rely solely on a teacher, nor should one take the *契论* and scriptural songs as self-realization and neglect seeking a teacher. If the *契论* and scriptural songs contained no fire times, how could they be said to *expound the utmost truth*?\n\nGenerally speaking, the student must both read the *契论* and scriptural songs and seek an enlightened teacher. Reading the *契论* and scriptural songs allows one to distinguish the true from the false, the orthodox from the heterodox, and to broaden one’s understanding, so that when seeking an enlightened teacher, one can verify the principles one has discerned. Self-study and seeking a teacher are both indispensable.\n\nOn Gathering the Medicine and Fire Times:\n\nTwenty-Nine",

In holding the city or waging wild battle, one knows fortune and misfortune, and the numinous cinnabar fills the crucible red.\n\nThe moon itself has no light but borrows the sun’s radiance. In a year, it meets the sun twelve times; in a month, thirty days; between the last and first days, one meeting occurs. When a person’s true knowing lies buried, pure yin without yang, it is like the moon without light—it must borrow numinous knowing to generate illumination. When numinous knowing and true knowing meet, it is like the sun and moon converging after thirty days.\n\nThe perfected emulate the image of their meeting, condensing thirty days into a single day, and that day into a single hour. In that hour, they rouse the firm qi, borrowing the human heart to generate the Dao-heart, using the Dao-heart to govern the human heart; relying on numinous knowing to produce true knowing, and using true knowing to dismiss numinous knowing. They gather the primordial qi of the undivided Hongmeng as the mother of the elixir, aligning with the divine mechanism of yin-yang transformation as the fire-timing.\n\nThis Dao involves both civil refinement and martial tempering. Holding the city is civil refinement; waging wild battle is martial tempering. When civil is called for, be civil; when martial is called for, be martial—this is fortune. When civil is needed but martial is used, or martial is needed but civil is used—this is misfortune.\n\nCivil fire is the turning of light back to illuminate, dismissing cleverness and destroying cunning, concentrating the mind to nurture the upright qi, like holding a city. Martial fire is restraining anger and blocking desire, eliminating delusion and preserving sincerity, fiercely expelling guest qi, like waging wild battle. Knowing the proper use of civil and martial, discerning fortune and misfortune, one employs martial fire when there is action and civil fire when there is none.\n\nThrough civil fire and martial tempering, yin qi is exhausted and yang qi purified; true knowing and numinous knowing unite, transforming into innate knowing and innate capacity, the wondrous awakening of original nature. Round and luminous, bright and resplendent, pure and bare, unadorned and free—still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating. Responsive and penetrating, yet still and unmoving, utterly imbued with heavenly principle, utterly devoid of human desire. It is like the numinous cinnabar filling the crucible red.\n\nWhen cinnabar reaches its numinous state, its material form is entirely transformed—neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being—purely the qi of clear yang. Ingesting it dispels illness and extends years, averts calamity and avoids misfortune, restores original nature, and preserves the unobscured and luminous, the true emptiness and wondrous being. Creation cannot limit it, yin and yang cannot constrain it, and the myriad things cannot harm it—it is just like this.\n\nYet in the world, are there not those who know fortune and misfortune but are unwilling to devote themselves to divine efficacy?",

If one relies on this to interpret *Pi*, *Tai*, *Tun*, *Meng*, and the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, how can all be made to align?\nTo exhaust all lines in pursuit of perfect alignment—is this not a vain waste of spirit?\nThe ancient immortals said: *\"No need to seek* zi *and* wu *at the edge of the sky—within the body, a single yang is born.\"* This should serve as clear proof for those who practice hexagrams and lines. Scholars must reflect deeply.\n\n**Thirty-Seven**\nHexagrams set forth images to model forms;\nGrasp the meaning, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.\nYet the world’s deluded cling only to images,\nPracticing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.\n\n*Grasp the meaning* (one version reads *grasp the image*);\n*Cling to images* (one version reads *fixate on images*).\n\nThe sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Zhouyi* merely clarify the images of yin and yang, their centeredness or lack thereof.\nIf one comprehends the meaning of yin and yang, centeredness or lack thereof, one can harmonize yin and yang, naturally aligning with the hexagrams.\nYet how is it that the world’s deluded disciples, failing to investigate meaning, cling instead to images, insisting on practicing *Tun* in the morning and *Meng* in the evening, beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, following hexagram qi in hopes of attaining the Dao and ascending in flight? This is utter folly.\n\nLittle do they know that the ancient immortals’ references to \"morning *Tun*\" and \"evening *Meng*\" were teachings to recognize that when yang is born, it is *Tun*, and when yang is trapped, it is *Meng*.\nYang’s birth is like the dawn of day; yang’s entrapment is like the dusk of night.\nWhen yang is born, advance the yang fire to gather yang—this is \"morning *Tun*.\"\nWhen yang is trapped, employ the yin tally to nurture yang—this is \"evening *Meng*.\"\nAs for *Jiji* and *Weiji*, they teach that when yin and yang have united, it is *Jiji*; when they have not united, it is *Weiji*.\nWhen yin and yang unite, the golden elixir congeals, the work of yang fire is complete—*Jiji* must guard against failure, and the function of the yin tally is essential.\nWhen yin and yang do not unite, the golden elixir does not form, the yin tally is useless—*Weiji* urgently requires fulfillment, and the work of yang fire must be undertaken.\nThis is the meaning hidden within the hexagrams, the intent of these four hexagrams. Extending this to the remaining sixty hexagrams, all are but transformations of a single yin and yang. Thus it is said: *Grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.*\nIf one understands the meaning of the hexagrams, the heavenly gate is in hand, the earthly axis is at heart—walking freely, every step is the Dao. There is no need to cling to hexagram images, for one naturally aligns with them.\n\nAlas! The golden toad, the jade crow—recognize the true, and you are the master.\n\n**On Geng and Jia: Thirty-Eight**",

      "translated_text": "To grasp the method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir, one must plant the seed within the homestead. No need for forced breath or exertion—naturally, the elixir ripens and the true embryo sheds its husk.\n\nThe method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir lies in the nearest great medicine, not afar; the practice is concise, not cumbersome. The homestead itself holds the medicinal ingredients, which may be planted at any time. No external crucible or bellows, no labored firing, is required—it ripens and transforms of itself.\n\nThe elixir is the primordial, formless, true Unity-qi, the numinous root sundered at the dawn of chaos, the ancestral qi of all life. Contained, it becomes true emptiness; manifested, it becomes wondrous being. Employed, it is the Dao-mind; nurtured, it is the Valley Spirit. Utterly non-being yet containing utter being, utterly void yet containing utter fullness, it holds the qi of the Five Phases yet lacks their substance. Concealed within the Five Phases, it does not fall into their constraints. Sage or worthy, buddha or immortal—all arise from this.\n\nThis is no other thing but our original, neither form nor emptiness, the innate goodness of constant norm. Only through entanglement with the postnatal does the consciousness-spirit take charge, burying and obscuring it. If a true teacher points it out, one realizes the homestead’s own possession, not obtained from another. Once planted, it grows from subtle to manifest, ripening naturally.\n\nThe Immortal Elder said: *\"One must plant the seed within the homestead.\"* All heterodox paths seeking outside the body may now awaken and turn back.\n\n**On the medicine coming from without:**\n*Forty-eight*\nAbandon artifice and false effort,\nRecognize the deathless formula of another’s house.\nIn the flask, ever replenish the wine of extended life;\nIn the tripod, gather the nectar of returning soul.\n\nThe earlier verse spoke of planting the seed within the homestead, lest one cling to solitary cultivation. Thus, it immediately follows: *\"Abandon artifice and false effort, recognize the deathless formula of another’s house.\"*\n\nThe \"planting within the homestead\" refers to the elixir’s medicinal ingredients—unchanged in the sage, undiminished in the commoner, possessed by all, perfected in each, not sought elsewhere, for the homestead holds them already.\n\nThe \"deathless formula of another’s house\" refers to the postnatal qi, where consciousness-spirit dominates, and yang is trapped by yin—like one’s own property now held by another. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must employ the method of pursuit and gathering, so that the departed primordial true yang may be reclaimed, and what has come remains one’s own.\n\nWhat has not yet come belongs to another; what has come belongs to me. Because there is a time before and after arrival, there is a distinction between another’s house and one’s own. Thus, before its arrival, one must tread firmly, gradually gathering and refining, ever replenishing and collecting, performing the work of effort.\n\nThough called \"effort,\" it is truly effortless. \"Effort\" here means subtly harnessing yin and yang, seizing the transformations of creation—not the artifices of others, but the natural operation of things.\n\n\"Ever replenish the wine of extended life\" means augmenting the true knowing of the Dao-mind to secure destiny. \"Gather the nectar of returning soul\" means emptying the numinous knowing of the human mind to nurture nature.\n\nThe wine of extended life is golden juice; the nectar of returning soul is wooden liquid. Replenishing the gold and gathering it, metal and wood merge, emotion and nature unite, true knowing and numinous knowing congeal, and the elixir’s origin takes form.\n\nThe four words *\"ever replenish, gather\"* carry profound meaning. For yin and yang have long been scattered and dispersed; without gradual replenishment and collection, metal and wood cannot merge, nature and emotion cannot harmonize. Only through constant replenishment and gathering, vigilance day and night, neither forgetting nor forcing, with time and deep practice, do metal and wood naturally merge, nature and emotion naturally harmonize. Then one may extend life, return the soul, and enter the realm of deathlessness.\n\n**On the inner and outer elixirs:**\n*Forty-nine*\nA fine ghee from Snow Mountain,\nPoured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of creation.\nIf it passes northwest beyond Kunlun,\nZhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\n\nSnow Mountain lies in the west, representing metal and primordial emotion. Ghee, as water, represents primordial essence. The Eastern Sun, as wood, represents primordial nature; the crucible of creation, as fire, represents primordial spirit.\n\nTake the metal-water of primordial emotion and essence, pour it into the wood-fire of primordial nature and spirit. Refine metal-water with wood-fire, and restrain wood-fire with metal-water. Punishment perfects virtue, virtue fulfills punishment—both employed, metal and wood merge, water and fire harmonize, the Four Great unite, and the elixir returns.\n\nThis is the outer elixir’s symbolic method.\n\nKunlun Mountain lies in the northwest of heaven and earth, the ancestral vein of all mountains, akin to the primordial true Unity-qi, the ancestral qi of all life. The northwest belongs to Qian, the highest place on earth, where height is yang.\n\nZhang Qian is yang; Ma Gu is yin. When the reversion elixir has formed, transformed into the true Unity-qi, growing from subtle to manifest, yang-qi flourishes, the great medicine arises, imbued with Heavenly principle, firm and upright, central and correct. A single grain of utmost yang elixir emerges.\n\nUsing this elixir to touch the postnatal yin of the body is like a cat catching a mouse: false yin dissolves, true yin appears, yin and yang blend, forming the sacred embryo. Thus: *\"If it passes northwest beyond Kunlun, Zhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\"*\n\nThe three words *\"first meets\"* encompass layers of practice. Before the elixir reaches the extreme of yang, Zhang Qian is not permitted to meet Ma Gu. Only when nurtured to the yang extreme does Zhang Qian first meet Ma Gu.\n\nTrue yin and true yang meet; the Dao-mind and human mind both transform into the good mind.

belly—\nOnly then does one know my fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nMedicines of the same qi and kind are the true yang of true knowing and the true yin of numinous knowing.\nWhen true yin and true yang merge and unite,\nOnly then can they condense from formlessness into form.\nWhat cannot be heard is called the subtle;\nWhat cannot be seen is called the unseen.\nUnheard and unseen, the Dao returns to emptiness,\nA single qi harmonious and flowing,\nWithout thought, without action,\nStill and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—\nAll under heaven unfolds without force,\nIn accord with nature.\n\nFirst, yin and yang condense;\nThen, yin and yang merge into oneness.\nA single grain of numinous elixir hangs in the void,\nIlluminating mountains and rivers across the great earth.\nSwallowed and ingested, its light arises within the five viscera,\nDispelling all yin influences,\nTransforming the post-heaven trigrams—\nOnly then does one know my fate is ruled by me, not by heaven.\n\nThe first two lines proceed from effort to naturalness;\nThe third line emerges from naturalness to sudden awakening.\nWhen the numinous elixir enters the belly, this is the meaning of sudden awakening.\nIn the state of sudden awakening through Dao cultivation,\nBoth being and non-being dissolve,\nHeaven and earth return to emptiness.\nOne leaps beyond yin and yang,\nNo longer bound by them,\nFate governed by the self, not by heaven.\nIf one has not reached the river of sudden awakening,\nStill moving in and out of yin and yang,\nFate remains subject to heaven—\nThe word \"only\" makes this clear.\n\nOn the Ease of Forming the Elixir:\nFifty-Five\nResplendent golden elixir forms in a single day—\nThe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three,\nIt is all procrastination, wasting time.\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir\nIs possessed by all, ready in every household.\nIf one can thoroughly investigate its true principles,\nSeek out an enlightened teacher,\nRecognize the two medicines of true knowing and numinous knowing,\nAnd discern the primal aperture,\nWith sincere resolve, one may swiftly reach the other shore.\nIn a single day’s effort, the radiant yang elixir may be formed—\nWhy wait three years or nine?\n\nThese are the words of the ancient immortals, not falsehoods.\nYet while the elixir coalesces in an instant,\nIts nurturing requires ten months.\nWithout the work of nurturing, the golden elixir will not stabilize,\nAnd one may gain it only to lose it again.\nThe \"single day\" refers to the union of yin and yang,\nNot the maturation of the golden elixir.\nMaturation demands the work of yin tally and yang fire,\nAdding and reducing, increasing and diminishing,\nUntil there is nothing left to add or diminish—\nOnly then is the radiant yang elixir complete.\nIf it were truly a mature elixir,\nHow could it mature in a single day?\n\nThe immortal elder’s earlier poem says:\n*\"Though you know cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.\"*\n\nThe later verse says:\n*\"To refine the nine transformations,\nFirst refine the self and hold the mind.\"*\n\nFrom this, one may understand the meaning of the golden elixir forming in a day.\n\nFifty-Six\nThe great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—\nKnow that it depends on me, yet also on heaven.\nWithout cultivating virtue and accumulating hidden merit,\nDemons will arise at every turn to obstruct the path.\n\nThe previous poem speaks of the elixir forming in a day, which seems easy.\nBut I fear students may treat the great Dao lightly,\nNeglecting virtue and conduct,\nYet vainly hoping for immortality.\nThus, this poem clarifies the importance of virtue.\n\nWhat heaven bestows upon humanity is virtue;\nWhat humanity offers in return to heaven is also virtue.\nWith virtue, heaven rejoices,\nAnd the cultivation of fate becomes easy, governed by the self.\nWithout virtue, heaven is displeased,\nAnd the cultivation of the Dao becomes difficult, governed by heaven.\n\nWhy is this so?\nWithout virtue or conduct, even spirits and gods will not tolerate it.\nAt every turn, demonic obstructions arise,\nAlong with calamities, illnesses, and setbacks,\nInevitably leading to abandonment halfway.\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao must prioritize cultivating virtue.\nWith weighty virtue, learning the Dao becomes easy,\nAnd cultivating the Dao becomes effortless—\nFor heaven rejoices, and demonic obstructions naturally dissolve.\n\nOn Stealing the Mechanism:\nFifty-Seven\nThe Three Powers steal from one another in due time—\nWithin this mechanism lie the Dao, virtue, and immortality.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nThe hundred bones are ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\nThe Three Powers steal from one another:\nHeaven and earth steal from the myriad things,\nThe myriad things steal from humanity,\nAnd humanity steals from the myriad things.\n\n\"In due time\" means:\nThe myriad

      "translated_text": "The *Yinfu* treasures surpass three hundred characters,\nThe *Daode* sacred scriptures fill five thousand.\nFrom ancient times to now, immortals number without end—\nAll attain the true essence within these very texts.\nThe *Yinfu* and *Daode*, twin scriptures of the Dao,\nReveal heaven and earth’s transformative mechanisms,\nExpose the secrets of yin-yang and life-death.\nFrom antiquity to the present,\nSuperior scholars and perfected beings\nHave delved into these two classics to fathom true principle,\nTo grasp the real essence and fulfill nature and life.\nEven the Immortal Elder’s *Wuzhen* was composed\nUpon the foundation of *Yinfu* and *Daode*.\nIf scholars can awaken to truth,\nThe meanings of *Yinfu* and *Daode* will become perfectly clear.\n\nOn Seeking a Teacher:\nFifty-Nine\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true teacher, do not force conjecture.\nFor the golden elixir lacks oral transmission—\nWhere then can you conceive the spiritual embryo?\n\nThe preceding section speaks of *Yinfu* and *Daode*\nAs treasured characters and sacred scriptures,\nWhich scholars should thoroughly investigate.\nYet I fear disciples may cling to alchemical texts,\nPresuming themselves correct and refusing to seek others—\nThus this poem urges the swift search for a true teacher.\nAlchemical classics and philosophical works\nContain every ingredient and firing process,\nEmploying myriad metaphors\nTo make all understand this principle,\nTo make each know this Way.\nBut the study of nature and life is subtle and profound,\nNot easily discerned as true.\nIf one has insights or awakenings,\nOne must seek a teacher’s verification.\nWithout seeking a teacher,\nRelying on one’s own brilliance,\nForcing conjecture and private interpretation—\nWill this not squander one’s nature and life?\nHence it is said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, / Without a true teacher, do not force conjecture.*\n\nThe Way of nature and life\nRelies on gathering primordial qi as its essential task.\nBut primordial qi is formless and imageless,\nInvisible, inaudible, untouchable—\nHow then to cultivate it?\nHow then to return it?\nAlchemical classics and philosophical works\nHave never failed to speak of this qi,\nNever failed to speak of cultivation,\nNever failed to speak of return.\nYet no matter how strenuously they describe it,\nTheir words fall short of its image;\nNo matter how forcefully they discuss it,\nTheir discourse fails to reach it.\nOnly through a true teacher’s oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction\nCan one recognize the ingredients,\nUnderstand the firing process,\nAnd proceed directly without hindrance.\nOtherwise, without seeking the teacher’s oral instructions,\nMerely following the words of alchemical texts,\nSlightly diverging into branches and leaves,\nPresuming great enlightenment and awakening,\nThen acting arbitrarily—\nWhether clinging to emptiness or grasping at forms—\nWhere can the spiritual embryo be conceived?\nThus the true teacher’s oral instructions cannot but be urgently sought.\n\nOn Quieting the Mechanism:\nSixty\n\nOnly when the heart-ape is thoroughly stilled,\nThe mind’s mechanism fully quieted,\nCan three thousand meritorious deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally, the cauldron will refine dragon and tiger—\nWhy cling to home, yearn for wife and children?\n\nDisciples fail to realize the Dao and attain the Dao\nDue to the heart’s instability and their unsteady roots.\nIf all conditions are truly emptied,\nAll things viewed with detachment,\nReduced again and again to non-action,\nThe square inch of the heart purified—\nThen inner cultivation is achieved.\nFurther accumulating virtue and practice,\nHardship for oneself, benefit for others,\nEverywhere offering convenience,\nUnmoved by wealth or honor,\nUnshaken by poverty or low status,\nUnbowed by power or force,\nWholly devoted, living with circumstances,\nAll afflictions extinguished—\nThen outer cultivation is accomplished.\nWith inner cultivation achieved and outer cultivation complete,\nThree thousand merits fulfilled,\nVirtue matching heaven,\nOne may attain longevity equal to heaven.\nAs it is said: *Those of great virtue must attain their alignment.*\n\nWithin the heart’s square inch,\nNot even a speck of dust can be tolerated.\nThe slightest dust disrupts the harmony of nature and emotion,\nDragon and tiger rage wildly,\nGiving rise to all manner of dangers.\nBut if the mind’s mechanism is entirely eradicated,\nEmpty and open,\nNo need to seek another cauldron—\nThis very self is the cauldron.\nOnce the cauldron is established,\nEvery movement and stillness,\nUnknowing and unperceiving,\nFollows heaven’s principle.\nNature and emotion unite,\nHarmonious qi steams and rises—\nThis itself is the refinement of dragon and tiger,\nNo need to ask further.\nThis Way—\nIngredients are ever-present,\nThe cauldron naturally exists.\nThose who know it,\nThough foolish or humble,\nThrough diligent practice may ascend to sagehood.\nYet worldly people fail to see through worldly affairs,\nFail to recognize true nature and life,\nClinging to wife and children,\nEntangled without end,\nExhausting their minds,\nOil dried, lamp extinguished,\nMarrow depleted, life lost—\nAlas!\n\nOn Knowing Contentment:\nSixty-One",

kind,\nWith two distinct functions in nurturing and refining.\n\nWithin resides the natural true fire,\nIn the furnace, blazing and ever-red.\nThe outer furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort,\nFor nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed in subtlety.\n\nThe inner elixir is the numinous knowing of numinous nature,\nThe outer elixir is the true knowing of true essence.\nAs numinous knowing resides in the human heart,\nWhen the heart takes charge, it borrows the numinous to generate delusion—hence the inner elixir.\nAs true knowing abides in the Dao-heart,\nWhen the Dao-heart retreats, true knowing remains unmanifest—hence the outer elixir.\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family,\nEmerging from the same source with different names—thus the inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir.\n\nThe inner elixir serves to cultivate nature, and one must thoroughly understand it;\nThe outer elixir serves to cultivate life, and one must also thoroughly understand it.\nAs the ancient scripture says:\n\"To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost flaw in practice,\nTo cultivate nature without cultivating life makes it difficult for the yin spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas.\"\nThus, when the inner is unobstructed, the outer must also be unobstructed.\n\nNature is yin, life is yang.\nThe great elixir of golden liquid is attained by taking the true yin and true yang—qi of the same kind from the two arcs—\nAnd harmonizing them into one.\nIf one cultivates life without cultivating nature, or cultivates nature without cultivating life,\nIt is solitary yin or solitary yang, and the great elixir will not form—\nThus nature and life must be cultivated together.\n\nYet nature has its own function, and life has its own function;\nNature pertains to the Dharma-body, life to the illusory body.\nThe two functions of nurturing and refining differ greatly—\nThus the work must proceed in two stages.\n\nThe Dao of cultivating nature is the Dao of non-action,\nNon-action emphasizes stillness, requiring no deliberate effort,\nOnly guarding the center and embracing the One.\nWithin the inner furnace, true fire naturally blazes, ever-red—\nThis is the use of the gentle fire for nurturing.\n\nAs for the Dao of cultivating life, it is the Dao of action;\nAction emphasizes movement, requiring the outer furnace’s increase and decrease,\nDiligent effort in forging and refining—\nThis is the use of the martial fire for decoction.\n\nTo increase is to augment the insufficiency of true knowing—\nTo firmly uphold what is good.\nTo decrease is to reduce the excess of numinous knowing—\nTo cast aside cleverness and destroy cunning.\nWhen increase reaches its limit, and decrease reaches its end,\nNature stabilizes and life congeals, the true seed is attained—\nOnly then is it wondrous beyond compare.\n\nThese two functions of nature and life,\nOnce the outer elixir is accomplished,\nAre gathered into the tripod to become the inner elixir.\nFor what has not yet arrived is outer, and what has arrived is inner—\nThus when metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returned elixir.\n\n**Second**\n\nThis elixir is most divine and sacred,\nYet I fear your karmic endowment is too meager to bear it.\nHarmonizing lead and mercury need not take a full morning—\nEarly signs of the mysterious pearl will soon appear.\n\nIf a determined practitioner can refine it,\nWhy not dwell in the marketplace or court?\nThe work is easy, the medicine not distant—\nYet if one reveals the secret, others may laugh.\n\nThe previous verse clarified the inner and outer elixirs;\nThis verse speaks of the practice of the outer elixir.\nThe Dao of the golden elixir is most divine and sacred,\nIts cultivation yields immediate results, swiftly elevating one to sagehood—\nBut I fear one’s karmic endowment may be too shallow to receive it.\n\nWhat is hardest to obtain in the golden elixir\nIs the true lead of true knowing and the true mercury of numinous knowing.\nIf one recognizes true knowing and numinous knowing and harmonizes them,\nThen hardness and softness balance, nature and essence become one.\nWithout waiting for a full morning,\nThe signs of innate knowing and innate ability will soon appear—\nLike a dark pearl suddenly shining with light.\n\nFor the root of innate knowing and innate ability,\nBuried for so long, cannot emerge on its own.\nNow, with true knowing and numinous knowing united as one,\nThough the root of innate knowing and innate ability may not yet be fully restored,\nA spark of life already takes form in the realm of the indistinct and obscure.\nWith this spark of life, from subtle to manifest,\nIt can gradually be restored to wholeness.\nThe \"signs\" are the foretaste of wholeness.\n\nIf a determined practitioner diligently cultivates it,\nThere is no need to flee the world or leave the dust—\nWhy not dwell in the marketplace or court?\nFor the Dao of the golden elixir has its medicine ready at hand,\nThe work is simple and easy, requiring no external pursuit—\nIt lies within the very person.\nYet if one reveals it, others may laugh.\n\nFor laughter is the shared path of the mundane and the sage:\nHeaven and humanity share the same principle—\nThe difference lies only in compliance or defiance.\n\n**Third**\n\nThe White Tiger’s first classic is a supreme treasure,\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\nKnow that the source of the highest good runs deep—\nNot to be compared with ordinary medicines.\n\nIf one wishes to refine the ninefold transmutation,\nFirst refine the self and hold the heart.\nFollow the time to gather it, determining its floating or sinking,\nAdvance the fire with caution to avoid peril.\n\nThe previous verse spoke of harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir.\nYet to harmonize lead and mercury,\nOne must first recognize the great medicine of true knowing—true lead—\nBefore proceeding.\n\nTrue knowing is true essence,\nIn symbolic terms, the White Tiger’s first classic,\nOr the Flowery Pond’s divine water—\nTrue essence hidden within delusive emotion.\nEmotion pertains to metal, hence the White Tiger.\nThough true essence is concealed within delusive emotion,\nIt sometimes reveals itself—\nThe heart of heaven and earth reappears, sprouting the seed of life—\nHence the first classic.\n\n\"First\" means beginning, \"classic\" means the constant Dao.\nThe beginning of the constant Dao is the arising of something from nothing,\nYin containing yang, the mother of all things—\nThis is the spark of life.\nThis spark of life is the root of sagehood and worthiness,\nThe foundation of buddhahood and immortality—\nHence it is called the supreme treasure.\n\nThis spark of life is also called the Flowery Pond’s divine water.\nThe Flowery Pond is the single aperture of the primal pass, the gate of

      "translated_text": "The spark of life, refined by fire and tempered, congeals without scattering, enduring unbroken—hence it is called true gold. The first classic, divine water, and true gold are all but one thing: the nature of supreme goodness.\n\nSupreme goodness is perfect goodness. Perfect goodness is without evil, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, like water with its source—deep-rooted and far-flowing, benefiting all things without exhaustion. This is the medicine that preserves life and completes form, the most authentic remedy, unlike ordinary medicines of herbs, trees, metals, or stones.\n\nYet this remedy lies hidden within the acquired, appearing only fleetingly, vanishing as soon as it arises, unable to remain long. If one wishes to refine it through nine cycles and make it eternally indestructible, one must first temper the self and hold the heart, dissolving the guest qi and worldly passions, gathering it at the proper time to stabilize its floating and sinking.\n\nAwareness resides in the human heart; when the human heart stirs, awareness takes flight, tending to float. True knowing abides in the Dao-heart; when the Dao-heart is obscured, true knowing hides, tending to sink. Tempering the self and holding the heart means refining away the awareness of the human heart, causing the floating to sink. Gathering at the proper time means drawing forth the Dao-heart, causing the sinking true knowing to float.\n\nReversing floating and sinking, the Dao-heart governs the human heart, the human heart submits to the Dao-heart, true knowing commands awareness, and awareness nourishes true knowing. When the human heart is still and the Dao-heart abides, true knowing and awareness share the same qi, like branches of one tree—then the golden elixir may be attained.\n\nYet while the medicine is easy to recognize, the firing times are most difficult. The work of advancing the fire must discern whether the medicine is ripe or tender, whether the timing is urgent or leisurely, auspicious or inauspicious. If one acts recklessly, not only will there be no benefit, but harm will follow—hence it is said, \"Advancing the fire, one must guard against great danger.\"\n\n---\n\nIf you would have true lead retain mercury,\nThe lord must not part from his minister.\nWood and metal, though sundered, meet not by chance—\nAll depends on the matchmaker’s summoning.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness.\nThey devour and yet embrace each other,\nOnly then does the man-child conceive.\n\nThis verse speaks of gathering the medicine through the work of tempering the self. Tempering the self aims to bring the three families into union. The way of the golden elixir is simply the two words: firmness and softness.\n\nThe central firmness of firmness is true knowing, symbolized as true lead; the central softness of softness is awareness, symbolized as true mercury. Taking these two substances and uniting them forms the elixir. But if true knowing does not manifest, awareness easily scatters—thus true knowing is the substance that restrains awareness. Yet while true knowing can restrain awareness, awareness in turn nourishes true knowing—thus awareness is the minister of true knowing.\n\nIf awareness is not first stabilized, true knowing will not appear—hence it is said, \"If you would have true lead retain mercury, the lord must not part from his minister.\" The lord refers to the union of true knowing and awareness, firmness and softness in harmony. True knowing is the sovereign; awareness is the minister. If the minister is disobedient, the sovereign cannot act.\n\nFor true knowing and awareness contend in the space of a hair’s breadth: when awareness is exhausted, true knowing appears; when true knowing abides, awareness submits. When true knowing abides, it is firm and strong; when awareness is still, it is soft and yielding. Firm strength and soft compliance—nature and feeling unite.\n\nThus the Dao of the elixir takes true lead and true mercury as its two medicinal ingredients. The lead of true knowing pertains to metal in its essence; the mercury of awareness pertains to wood in its nature. In the acquired, essence moves west and nature moves east. Like metal and wood, they are sundered, each in its own domain, unable to meet.\n\nWere it not for true nature as the medium, true essence and true nature would not appear, true knowing and awareness would not unite. True sincerity is true intention, also called true earth. When true earth appears, metal and wood naturally merge; when true sincerity flows, nature and essence naturally unite—thus true sincerity is the matchmaker of true essence and true nature.\n\nTrue nature is wood, governing compliance and kindness; true essence is metal, governing firmness and righteousness. When nature and essence are harmonized by sincerity within, wood’s nature loves metal’s essence and submits to righteousness, metal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness. Nature and essence unite, firmness and softness respond, kindness and righteousness are complete, true knowing and awareness share the same qi.\n\nThey devour and yet embrace each other, nature settles and essence is forgotten. The qi of the primordial arises from emptiness, congealing into a single grain of millet—thus the sacred embryo takes form, what is called \"the man-child conceives.\"\n\n---\n\nWho is the maiden of sixteen?",

      "translated_text": "Within the span of a year, in the month of *yin*, Heaven’s qi ascends while Earth’s qi descends, forming *Tai*; in the month of *shen*, Earth’s qi ascends while Heaven’s qi descends, forming *Pi*. Within the span of a day, the hour of *zi* marks the dawn’s beginning—at *zi*, yang qi stirs within as yin qi emerges outward, forming *Zhun*; the hour of *wu* marks the dusk’s beginning—at *wu*, yang qi halts without as yin qi arises within, forming *Meng*. *Pi* and *Tai* are the yearly ascent and descent of yin and yang in spring and autumn; *Zhun* and *Meng* are the daily ebb and flow of yin and yang at dawn and dusk. Observe the alternation of *Pi* and *Tai* as Heaven and Earth meet, and you will recognize the waxing and waning of *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk. For the daily rhythm of yin and yang mirrors the yearly rhythm of yin and yang. Yet whether in a year or a day, yin and yang are but a single qi, circulating in perpetual motion.\n\nThe cultivator of the Dao models the seasonal nodes of *Pi* and *Tai*, aligns with the moments of *Zhun* and *Meng* at dawn and dusk, advances the yang fire when yang arises, and moves the yin tally when yin prevails. Yang’s firmness and yin’s softness, timed without error, gather power and amass the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images. Like thirty spokes converging at the hub to form a wheel, like a thousand streams flowing together toward the sea, all becomes a single qi, and the golden elixir congeals. Though the marvel of the golden elixir’s congealment lies entirely in the art of drawing and adding: *drawing* removes false yin and false yang; *adding* replenishes true yin and true yang. When false yin departs, true yang appears; when false yang dissolves, true yin arises. True yin and true yang return to central equilibrium, merging into one. True knowing and numinous knowing unite, nature and emotion harmonize, and the original face of innate knowledge and innate ability is restored. How wondrous is the work of drawing and adding!\n\nIn cultivating the elixir, one must first discern true yin and true yang, and further recognize the primordial, undifferentiated qi of the One. This qi existed before the chaos of *Hongmeng* divided, when yin and yang had not yet separated. Contained, it is true emptiness; expressed, it is wondrous existence. Its image is gold within water; its essence is Heaven’s inherent goodness; its function is the mind of the Dao, rooted in essence and unity. The elixir method seeks only this single great medicine of the Dao-mind. Though this Dao-mind is but one flavor, it governs the qi of the Five Phases and embodies their virtues. For the Dao-mind arises from the water of the One—the beginning of all numbers—one containing five, five returning to one. Yet when it returns to the One, it can no longer be called the Dao-mind, but only the undifferentiated principle of Heaven.\n\nThus the Confucians call this undifferentiated principle the Supreme Ultimate; the Daoists call it the golden elixir; the Buddhists call it perfect enlightenment. The ancient scriptures’ saying, “Attain the One, and all things are complete,” refers precisely to this. Once the One is attained, the treasure of life is already in hand, and there is no need to distinguish north, south, east, or west, nor to employ the method of amassing and gathering. One need only guard the Dao-mind against the human mind, reducing and reducing again. All guest qi of the human mind must be transformed away, leaving only the soft, compliant numinous knowing—then the human mind, too, becomes the Dao-mind.\n\nFor the human mind is inhabited by the consciousness-spirit, which carries the impressions of past kalpas, the accumulated habits of this life, and the perverse qi of one’s physical constitution. If these roots of calamity are not entirely diminished, even a trace left behind may seize an opportunity to arise, causing leaks in the treasure of life and wasting all prior effort. Hence the caution: “guard the prior work,” and “the treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.” The ancient immortals said: “If a single speck of yang qi remains, one does not die; if a single speck of yin qi remains, one does not ascend.” Thus, after obtaining the elixir, one must uproot the seeds of beginningless kalpas and the cycle of birth and death, ensuring the treasure of life belongs entirely to oneself and remains eternally unbroken.\n\nIts ninth:\nAt the winter solstice, the yang returns with one yang line;\nOver three decades, each line adds one yang.",

dawn.\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the work of drawing out and adding,\nTeaching one to emulate the creative transformations of heaven and earth at dusk and dawn.\nIn a year’s cycle of dusk and dawn:\nAt the winter solstice of the eleventh month, one yang is born,\nEach thirty days adding one yang line.\nThus, in the eleventh month, the *zi* branch sees one yang born, forming *Fu* (䷗);\nIn the twelfth month, the *chou* branch sees two yang born, forming *Lin* (䷒);\nIn the first month, the *yin* branch sees three yang born, forming *Tai* (䷓);\nIn the second month, the *mao* branch sees four yang born, forming *Da Zhuang* (䷡);\nIn the third month, the *chen* branch sees five yang born, forming *Guai* (䷪);\nIn the fourth month, the *si* branch sees six yang born, forming *Qian* (䷀)—\nThese are the six yang hexagrams.\nBy the fifth month, the *wu* branch sees one yin born, forming *Gou* (䷫),\nEach month adding one yin line for thirty days.\nIn the sixth month, the *wei* branch sees two yin born, forming *Dun* (䷠);\nIn the seventh month, the *shen* branch sees three yin born, forming *Pi* (䷋);\nIn the eighth month, the *you* branch sees four yin born, forming *Guan* (䷌);\nIn the ninth month, the *xu* branch sees five yin born, forming *Bo* (䷖);\nIn the tenth month, the *hai* branch sees six yin born, forming *Kun* (䷁)—\nThese are the six yin hexagrams.\nThe six yang months are dawn; the six yin months are dusk—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a year.\n\nWithin a single month, between the dark and new moon,\nThe sun and moon conjoin, the moon receives the sun’s light,\nAnd after three days, yang light begins to emerge from the sea,\nThe tides responding as *Fu*.\nEvery two and a half days, one yang line is added.\nBy the fifteenth day, the moon and sun face each other,\nIts radiance full and round as *Qian*.\nFrom the first to the fifteenth day—these are the six yang hexagrams.\nWhen the full moon wanes and *Qian* ends,\nFrom the sixteenth to the eighteenth day, one yin is born,\nThe yang light waning as *Gou* begins to portend.\nEvery two and a half days, one yin line is added.\nBy the thirtieth day, the moon’s light is entirely gone,\nLeaving only its dark body as *Kun*.\nFrom the sixteenth to the thirtieth day—these are the six yin hexagrams.\nTwo and a half days make one *hou*,\nTwelve *hou* traverse the six yang and six yin hexagrams—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a month.\n\nWithin a single day, it further divides into cold and heat.\nEach day at midnight, the *zi* hour, one yang is born as *Fu*,\nEach hour adding one yang line.\nBy the *si* hour, six yang are born as *Qian*.\nAt noon, one yin is born as *Gou*,\nEach hour adding one yin line,\nBy the *hai* hour, six yin are born as *Kun*.\nThe twelve hours traverse the six yin and six yang hexagrams—\nThis is the dusk and dawn of a day.\n\nThe sage transposes the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a year into a month,\nThe yin-yang dusk and dawn of a month into a day,\nAnd the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a day into a single hour.\nOne hour has eight *ke*,\nEach *ke* fifteen *fen*,\nEight *ke* totaling one hundred twenty *fen*.\nThe first four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yang,\nThe latter four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yin.\nFurther transposing the yin-yang dusk and dawn of an hour into a single *ke*,\nDividing it into fifteen *fen*:\nThe first seven and a half *fen* are yang,\nThe latter seven and a half *fen* are yin.\nWithin a fleeting moment, the great medicine is gathered,\nReturned to the crucible of creation,\nRefined with yang fire and yin tally into the elixir—\nThis is what is meant by “within the unbroken hour, distinguish *zi* and *wu*;\nwithin the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*.”\nOne must only recognize the dusk and dawn of yin’s birth and yang’s birth.\nKnowing dusk and dawn,\nThe creative transformations of a day, a month, a year\nAre present within a single hour and *ke*.\nThose blind fools of the world,\nSome sit in *zi-wu* meditation for a day,\nSome practice qi circulation at the new and full moon,\nSome cultivate at the winter and summer solstices—\nHow could they understand the principle of dusk and dawn?\n\n---\n\nIts tenth:\nWithout discerning the Five Phases and Four Images,\nHow can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?\nBefore ever hearing of the firing times of elixir refinement,\nThey rashly claim reclusive mastery.\nUnwilling to reflect on their own errors,\nThey further teach others their mistaken path,\nLeading them astray into eternal delusion—\nHow can such heartless deceit be endured?\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of the need to know yin-yang dusk and dawn in elixir refinement;\nThis verse follows closely, addressing those who do not understand yin-yang dusk and dawn.\nThe Dao of immortality originally aims to perfect oneself and then others,\nTo cultivate the Way and then virtue.\nYet those lost on the path\nDo not grasp the true principles of the Five Phases and Four Images,\nNor comprehend the allegories of cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver.\nUnclear about the medicine, ignorant of the firing times,\nThey dabble in peripheral minor arts,\nPresuming themselves enlightened and claiming reclusive mastery.\nUnwilling to reflect on their own errors,\nThey further teach others their mistaken path,\nOne blind man leading many blind—\nMisguiding others into eternal delusion,\nNever to transcend.\nSuch heartless deceit\nCondemns them to the Avīci Hell,\nWith no hope of escape—\nHow can they ever attain the Dao?\n\n---\n\nIts eleventh:\nVirtue cultivated beyond eight hundred,\nHidden merits accumulated to three thousand.\nEqualizing self and others, friend and foe,\nOnly then does one fulfill the immortal’s original vow.\nTigers and rhinos cannot harm,\nThe inescapable fire and burning house cannot bind.\nAfter the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to heaven,\nSteadily riding the phoenix chariot and simurgh carriage.\n\nThe preceding verse speaks of peripheral paths and external teachings,\nThose who obscure the Dao and only harm virtue, unable to cultivate it.\nThis verse speaks of cultivating the Way and then necessarily cultivating virtue.\nCultivating the Way is the work of self-perfection;\nCultivating virtue is the work of benefiting others.\nThe cultivation of the Way has limits,\nBut the cultivation of virtue is boundless.\nThus, after attaining the immortal Dao,\nOne must fulfill three thousand merits,\nComplete eight hundred deeds,\nForget self and others,\nTreat friend and foe as one—\nMeasuring with heaven and earth,\nEncompassing the ten thousand things,\nVirtue and power both perfected,\nOnly then is the original vow fulfilled.\nAt this stage,\nInner and outer are both

cannot bind.",

embryo.\nFrom non-being to being,\nFrom being to non-being,\nShedding the illusory body to emerge in the true body—\nOnly then can one attain the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.\nIf a cultivator seeks this enduring constancy,\nApart from true yin and true yang, there is no other method.\n\n*Appended: \"Moon Over the West River\" (to symbolize the moon’s radiance)*\nThe elixir is

another life—\nBefore one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\nEver since the Dragon Girl accomplished this work,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\nThis lyric and the five following quatrains,\nAccording to the Immortal Elder’s preface,\nAre not part of the main collection of *Awakening to Reality*,\nBut belong to the external collection.\nExamining their meaning,\nThey expound the Dao of first cultivating life, then cultivating nature.\nThe three commentaries by Xue, Lu, and Chen,\nBecause they discuss the cultivation of life,\nInclude them in the main collection—here, we follow their example.\n\nMaster Yuanduzi said:\n\"A single spark of yang essence,\nHidden within the mountain of form,\nNot in the heart or kidneys,\nBut in the primordial pass of the One Aperture.\"\nThis single spark of yang essence is the elixir.\nHidden within the mountain of form,\nIt is the supreme treasure of the physical body.\nThe elixir is no other thing—\nIt is the primordial, supremely yang spark of essence,\nAlso called the primordial true unity of qi,\nOr the vast and upright qi.\nConcealed, it is true emptiness;\nManifest, it is wondrous being.\nIts substance is innate goodness,\nIts function is the mind of Dao—\nThe supreme treasure within the human form,\nNot a thing possessed by heart or kidneys,\nBut stored within the primordial pass.\nThe One Aperture of the primordial pass\nHas no location, no place,\nNo form, no image.\nThis elixir, too, has no location, no place,\nNo form, no image.\nIt moves and rests freely,\nUnbound by form or emptiness,\nVibrant and alive,\nLike refining fire forging something solid.\nConstantly responsive, constantly still,\nConstantly still, constantly responsive,\nTransforming endlessly,\nIts wonders unfathomable.\nThough even heaven and earth’s spirits cannot grasp it,\nIt resides within the physical form,\nAble to transmute it—\nThis is what is called the Dharma-body.\nThus, the ancient immortals said,\n\"The creation of life depends on the body.\"\nDepending on the body means depending on the Dharma-body.\nWhen the Dharma-body is accomplished,\nThe sacred embryo is complete,\nThe foundation of life is firm.\nWith the work of effort completed,\nThe work of non-effort becomes manifest—\nThen one may cultivate nature.\nThe true origin of nature is the wondrous function of non-arising.\nCultivating life enables longevity,\nCultivating nature enables non-arising—\nNon-arising means no death.\nWithout arising, without ceasing,\nOne becomes one with the Great Void,\nForm and spirit both wondrous,\nForever freed from the cycle of rebirth,\nTranscending beyond heaven and earth.\nNo need to await another life—\nBefore one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\n\nFor the Dao of non-arising is sudden awakening and perfect penetration,\nAll things empty,\nDirectly transcending to the other shore.\nAt the assembly on Vulture Peak,\nThe World-Honored One expounded the Dharma.\nA seven-year-old Dragon Girl emerged from the earth,\nOffered a precious pearl,\nAnd instantly attained Buddhahood.\nThe Immortal Elder cites the case of the Dragon Girl offering the pearl\nTo illustrate the cultivation of the true emptiness of nature.\nCultivating the true emptiness of nature\nIs like the Dragon Girl offering the pearl.\nAwakening to true emptiness,\nWithout arising, without ceasing,\nIs attaining the spiritual powers of the Buddha.\nYet if the principle of life remains uncultivated,\nThe principle of nature is difficult to complete.\nDifficult to complete means that,\nThough one may attain sudden awakening and perfect penetration,\nAnd nurture the true nature,\nOne still moves within the postnatal realm,\nHaving not undergone the great fire’s refinement,\nWith slight leaks remaining,\nAnd thus cannot avoid the peril of discarding one body only to enter another.\nAfter cultivating life, one then cultivates nature.\nEmerging from the great furnace’s refinement,\nAll impurities are transformed.\nFrom this point, one practices the Dao of non-effort to cultivate nature,\nProgressing gradually to suddenness,\nAscending directly to the most supreme, wondrous awakening—\nHow then could one discard one body only to enter another?\nThus it is said:\nNo need to await another life—\nBefore one’s

      "translated_text": "One knows then that in the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, one first cultivates life before cultivating nature. Five seven-character quatrains are presented, corresponding to the Five Phases of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.\n\n**I**\nThough you may comprehend the Suchness of True Thusness,\nYou still cannot avoid discarding one body only to enter another.\nWhy not further refine the Great Medicine?\nThen suddenly transcend the leakless and become a true person.\n\nThe Suchness of True Thusness is the celestial truth in its natural state, utterly free from contrivance, a nature neither form nor emptiness—what is called \"not knowing, not perceiving, yet accordant with the Emperor’s decree.\" To cultivate this nature, one must first awaken to it; having awakened to it, one must then refine it into an indestructible vajra-substance, only then can one attain liberation. If one has awakened but does not refine, life remains subject not to oneself but to heaven; when the great limit arrives, with nothing to sustain one, discarding one body to enter another cannot be avoided. After sudden awakening, one does not abandon the work of gradual cultivation: employing the yang fire and yin tally to refine the Great Medicine, transmuting the host of yin, shedding the borrowed vessel, and revealing the true body. Then one enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, is unharmed by tigers or rhinoceroses, untouched by blades or weapons, and becomes a leakless true person. In former times, after the Sixth Patriarch received transmission from the Fifth, he concealed himself among hunters in Sihui, blending with the world while preserving his light, and thus attained the true fruit. Zixian suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, yet knew this was not the ultimate matter; only after receiving transmission from Apricot Grove did he achieve great completion—all for the sake of refining the Great Medicine. If awakening to True Thusness were itself enlightenment, then what did the Fifth Patriarch transmit to the Sixth in the dead of night after the latter had awakened to \"fundamentally not a single thing\"? And why did Zixian, having suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, still seek out Apricot Grove? One knows then that sudden awakening and gradual cultivation are indispensable, whether one first awakens suddenly and then cultivates gradually, or first cultivates gradually and then awakens suddenly. Nature and life must be cultivated together, and the work must proceed in two stages. This verse moves from nature to life, from suddenness to gradualness.\n\n**II**\nEntering the womb, seizing the dwelling, or relocating—\nThose who abide in the old are called the Four Fruits’ followers.\nIf you can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger,\nWhen will the house built of true gold ever wither?\n\nEntering the womb means foreseeing a pregnant woman of wealth and nobility and, at the moment of her delivery, entering the womb oneself. Seizing the dwelling means that when a pregnant woman is about to give birth, a yin spirit always waits to enter the aperture; one preempts it and enters first, seizing the dwelling. Relocating means that when one’s body decays, one selects a robust living person and secretly exchanges bodies. Abiding in the old means that when a robust person dies suddenly, one borrows the warm corpse and enters the aperture, residing in the old dwelling. Entering the womb and seizing the dwelling are largely the same with minor differences; relocating and abiding in the old are also largely the same with minor differences. All four involve the adept manipulation of the yin spirit for free entry and exit. Buddhists call these the Four Fruits’ followers, also known as external paths, derived from the teachings of the Two Vehicles, not the supreme vehicle of awakening to True Thusness. Their distinction from ordinary people lies merely in their clarity of coming and going. In the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, when the eastern household is subdued, the dragon of true nature is tamed in the western household; the tiger of true emotion returns emotion to nature and nurtures emotion with nature. When nature and emotion unite, dragon and tiger meet, giving birth to the sixteen-foot Dharma-body, like a house built of true gold, enduring as long as heaven and earth, forever an unwithering substance—how could there be any matter of moving from this to that?\n\n**III**\nThe method of inspecting form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—\nArduous for beginners, yet smooth for those who follow.",

If emptiness were not wondrous, it would be mere quiescent, inert emptiness—not the true nature of the Tathāgata. How could it pervade the Ganges’ sands? How could the myriad forms be unobstructed and unimpeded?\n\nBecause it is wondrous and not empty, its body pervades the Ganges’ sands, nowhere impassable. Because it is empty and truly so, the myriad forms, vast arrays, cannot obstruct or impede it. Because it pervades the Ganges’ sands without obstruction or impediment, it is called the Dharma-eye of perfect penetration.\n\nPerfect means without beginning or end, without front or back, without above or below, without inside or outside—it is the Tathāgata.

there no perfect penetration in radiant clarity?\nRoot, dust, mind, and dharmas—all are without substance.\nOnly in wondrous function does one know they are one with things.\n\nThe nature of true emptiness is perfectly penetrating, unimpeded.\nIts brilliance shines everywhere, and nothing can deceive it.\nNot empty, yet naturally empty;\nempty, yet not empty—\nit is merely constant response, constant stillness,\nconstant stillness, constant response.\n\n---\n\n**Following-Him Verse**\n\nThe ten thousand things lie scattered before the eyes,\nlet them move or be still, let them have their way.\nRadiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—\never untainted,\nlike a lotus rising from water, dry of itself.\n\nThough this verse has four lines,\nits meaning is contained in the single phrase:\n\"Radiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—ever untainted.\"\nRadiant clarity is wondrous being;\nsamādhi and wisdom are true emptiness.\nTrue emptiness naturally abides in the ten thousand things\nyet is not tainted by them.\nWondrously, it naturally encounters the ten thousand things\nand responds to them.\nConstant response, constant stillness—\nat ease wherever it goes,\nlike a lotus rising from water,\nborn in the mire yet unstained.\n\n---\n\n**Moon-in-the-Sky Verse**\n\nA single bright moon hangs in the empty sky,\nits pure light shines on all lands without obstruction.\nGather it—its light does not condense;\nscatter it—its light does not disperse.\nPush it forward—its light does not advance;\ndraw it back—its light does not retreat.\nThat which it illuminates is not distant,\nthis which it shines upon is not near.\nThe light on the surface is not external,\nthe light within is not internal.\nGathering and scattering, advancing and retreating,\ndistance and nearness, surface and interior—\nthough the illumination differs,\nthe light is the same.\nWithin sameness there is difference,\nwithin difference there is sameness.\nOne source scatters into the ten thousand distinctions,\nthe ten thousand distinctions return to the one source.\nUnfurled, it fills the six directions;\nrolled up, it retreats into secrecy—\nlively and free,\nlike a puppet show.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Pearl**\n\nA poor man wears a pearl in his robe,\nbright and perfectly round from the start.\nNot knowing to seek it himself,\nhe counts the treasures of others.\n\nCounting others’ treasures brings no benefit—\nit only makes you waste your strength in vain.\nBetter to recognize your own jewel,\nworth gold beyond measure.\n\nThis pearl’s light is greatest,\nshining throughout the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.\nIt has never lacked even a fraction,\nonly obscured by floating clouds.\n\nSince recognizing this cintāmaṇi,\nwho still clings to bubbles, illusions, or flowers?\nThe Buddha’s pearl is one with my pearl,\nmy nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.\n\nPearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—\nthe mind’s vastness embraces the dharma-realm.\nThough clamor and dust fill your eyes,\nsamādhi and wisdom remain radiantly clear, ever at ease.\n\nNot emptiness, not form—\nwithin and without, resplendent and unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers, wondrous and boundless—\nself-benefit and benefiting others, how could they be exhausted?\n\nSeeing is completion, all affairs are finished.\nBeyond learning, without doing, one passes the days.\nTranquil as an unborn infant,\nmovement and stillness follow conditions, without fixation.\n\nNeither cutting off delusion nor cultivating truth—\nthe minds of truth and delusion both belong to dust.\nFrom the beginning, the ten thousand dharmas are without form;\nwithin formlessness, there is the dharma-body.\n\nThe dharma-body is the natural Buddha,\nneither human nor thing.\nVast, it fills the space between heaven and earth—\nonly subtlety and indistinctness, shadowy and vague.\n\nStains do not taint it, its light shines of itself.\nNo dharma does not arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—\nthen one knows sin and merit were never substantial.\n\nNo Buddha to cultivate, no dharma to expound—\na true person’s wisdom and insight are naturally distinct.\nSpeaking, one roars like a lion,\nnot like a wild fox debating birth and death.\n\nThis song hinges on the line:\n\"If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease.\"\nDharmas here are not the dharmas of the Buddha-dharma,\nbut the myriad thoughts, delusions, and false imaginings of the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, the ten thousand dharmas are empty.\nThe nature-pearl shines constantly,\nsamādhi and wisdom are perfectly clear,\nwithin and without, resplendent.\nBubbles, illusions, flowers—\nwhat is there to cling to?\nThough clamor and dust fill your eyes,\nthey cannot obstruct you.\nBeyond learning, without doing,\nlike an unborn infant,\nmovement and stillness follow conditions,\nwithout the illusions of truth and delusion.\nThe dharma-body is ever manifest,\nthe natural Buddha appears—\nfilling heaven and earth,\nilluminating the great-thousand worlds.\nWhat floating clouds could obscure it?\n\n---\n\n**Song on Chan Meditation to Dispel Delusion**\n\nThe Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—\nwhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn activity and rest, ever serene and clear—\nnot only when

sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.\nWithin this emptiness, not a single thing exists,\nnor any trace of the subtle or indistinct.\nIf you chase after the subtle and indistinct,\nthe search itself becomes a deviation.\nYet even these two words—deviation—\ncannot be grasped as evidence.\nThe original mind is already empty;\nhow could gain or loss ever touch it?\n\nSimply cast aside all dharmas,\nleaving nothing behind.\nSuddenly, perfect clarity appears of itself—\nthen you are no different from the Buddhas.\nThis colored body is but my fetters;\nfor now, blend with the world’s radiance and mingle with the dust.\nIn all actions, be without intention—\nwhy quarrel over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?\nThis borrowed form is but a temporary abode,\nwhile the host of this inn is Vairocana.\nVairocana neither comes nor goes—\nthus one knows birth and death leave no residue.\n\nShould someone ask what Vairocana is like,\nit is simply that all forms fail to describe it.\nBefore your eyes, every speck of dust is active,\nyet dust and activity are neither the same nor different.\nSeeing this dust and activity in every particle,\neach one is Śākyamuni, each one is Kāśyapa.\nIf they differ, the ten thousand sounds all resound;\nif they are one, a single wind gathers all.\nIf you wish to recognize the wish-fulfilling jewel,\ndo not say you must attain the Dharma first.\nWhen ill, use medicine to heal;\nonce healed, what need is there for medicine?\nWhen the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;\nwhen the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.\nLike a tarnished mirror polished bright,\nblemishes and grime vanish of themselves.\n\nAll dharmas are fundamentally illusory,\nso one is taught to leave behind all forms.\nWhen all forms are left behind, what remains?\nThis is called the supreme, ultimate truth.\nIf you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,\npractice equal compassion and relieve suffering.\nThough the bodhisattva’s original vow runs deep,\ntake care not to grasp at anything within appearances.\nThis is the perfection of both merit and wisdom,\nand in the future, you will be the first to receive the prediction.\nEven the slightest stain of eternalism or nihilism\ncuts you off from all Buddhas.\nYet when one reflects on the delusions of ordinary beings,\nall are tainted by the dust of attachment and habit.\nSimply because craving and clinging run deep,\nthey are constantly reborn in womb, egg, transformation, or moisture.\n\nTo study the Way, you must be fierce and resolute,\nyour heart of non-attachment hard as iron.\nEven if you have sons, daughters, wives, and concubines,\nwhat difference is there between them and others?\nConstantly guard the single sphere of radiant light,\nseeing nothing desirable to contemplate.\nWhen all dharmas are simultaneously unattached,\nwhat need is there to speak of hell or heaven?\nThen my life is in my own hands,\nand in emptiness, there is no ascent or descent.\nI emerge and vanish among the Buddha-lands,\nyet never leave the original seat of bodhi.\nGuanyin’s thirty-two transformations—\nI too shall realize them within this.\nManifestations beyond conception\nall arise from the nature of carefree ease.\n\nI am a Chan practitioner without intention,\nindifferent to all things.\nOnce a black ox,\ntoday my whole body is white.\nSometimes I sing, sometimes I laugh—\nothers say I lack sense.\nHow would they know that beneath these coarse robes\nlies a priceless treasure?\nIf they see me speak of emptiness,\nit is as if they swallow a jujube whole.\nOnly the Buddha can truly know this Dharma;\nhow could the foolish and ignorant comprehend its signs?\n\nMoreover, there are those who claim to practice Chan,\nyet only learn to match words and seal lips.\nThey boast of my quick wit in question and answer,\nyet fundamentally do not recognize the host.\nThey merely pluck branches and pick leaves,\nfailing to thoroughly investigate the root.\nWhen the root is attained, branches and leaves flourish;\nwithout the root, branches and leaves cannot endure.\nThey flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,\nyet remain entangled in self and other.\nWith my wondrous awakening at the source of mind,\nthey are separated by a thousand miles.\nSuch people are pitiable and laughable—\nthey speak of years spent studying the Way,\nyet their pride prevents them from asking others,\nwasting their whole lives in vain.\nThey are dull and deluded, with heavy karmic obstructions—\nif they do not awaken in this life,\nhow will they avoid sinking in the next?\n\nThis song of over a hundred lines\ndistills the meaning of these four verses:\n*\"The Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—\nwhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn activity and rest, ever serene and clear—\nnot only when sitting is this so.\"*\n\nFor the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature\nis utterly pure in essence,\nas clear as water,\nwithout wind or waves,\nunstained by dust or grime.\nWhether active or at rest,\nit is always thus—\nnot only when sitting is it settled.\nTo mistake sitting for Chan\nis not true Chan,\nbut the Chan of lifeless, dull emptiness,\nwhich cannot be called the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature.\n\nTrue Chan\nunites concentration and wisdom,\nits wondrous function boundless,\nmind and Dharma both forgotten,\nall forms left behind.\nIt adorns the Buddha-land,\npractices equal compassion,\nblends with the world’s radiance while mingling with the dust,\ndwells in the world yet transcends it,\nis Chan without being Chan,\nsettled without being settled.\nAll those who seek realization through silent sitting,\nor who seal their lips without recognizing the host—\nsuch wild-fox Chan, half-awake yet still muddled,\nhow could they know the true Chan-nature of the wondrous awakening at the source?\n\n*Reading the Song from the Ancestral Record of Chan Master Xuedou*\n\nA single stream from Caoxi divides into a thousand branches,\nilluminating past and present without obstruction.\nYet scholars of late do not seek the source,\nmistaking hoofprints and puddles for the great ocean.\n\nMaster Xuedou, teacher of the true essence,\nsounded the thunderous roar of the Dharma drum.\nThe lion-king emerged from its den with a mighty roar,\nand the hundred beasts and thousand demons all trembled in fear.\nNow in song, now in verse,\nhe earnestly points out the path for the deluded.\nHis words are bold, his meaning profound,\nstriking jade and ringing gold through the ages.\nAlas, the deluded cling to appearances,\nchasing after words and seeking names and forms.\nThe true suchness of the Buddha-nature is beyond words,\nwithout high or low, without boundaries.\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor a duality of the two,\nthe ten directions’ dust and lands are a single perfect sphere.\nTrue concentration is never divided by speech or silence,\nneither to be grasped nor abandoned.\nSimply do not cling to any appearances—\nthis is the true principle of the Tathāgata.\n\nTo dispel delusion by opposing it with truth\nonly obscures truth if delusion does not cease.\nOnly when you know that both truth and delusion are not real\ndo you attain the unobstructed true mind.\nUnobstructed, you are free—\na single awakening dissolves eons of transgressions.\nWithout effort, you realize bodhi,\nand from then on, forever leave the sea of birth and death.\n\nMy teacher’s recent words flow smoothly,\nleft in the world as a model.",

The six perfections are: generosity, moral discipline, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom.

      "original_text": "金公偏好骑白虎，姹女常驾赤龙身， 虎来静坐秋山里，龙向潭中奋身起。 两兽相逢战一场，波浪奔腾如鼎沸。 黄婆丁老助威灵，撼动乾坤走神鬼。 须臾战罢云雨收，种个玄珠在泥底， 从此根芽渐长成，随时灌溉抱真精。 十月脱胎吞入口，不觉凡身已有灵。 此个事，世间稀，不是等闲人得知。 夙世若无仙骨分，容易如何得遇之。 得遇之，宜便炼，都缘光景急如箭。 要取鱼时须结罾，莫只临川空叹羡。 闻君知药已多年，何不收心炼汞铅。 莫教烛被风吹灭，六道轮回莫怨天。 近来世上人多诈，尽着布衣称道者。 问他金木是何般，噤口不言如害哑。 却云伏气与休粮，别有门庭道路长。 君不见，破迷歌里说，太一含真法最良， 莫怪言辞多狂劣，只教时人难鉴别， 惟君心与我心同，方敢倾怀向君说。 石桥歌 吾家本住石桥北，山镇水关森古木， 桥下涧水彻昆仑，山下饮泉香馥郁。 吾居山内实堪夸，遍地均栽不榭花。 山北穴中藏猛虎，出窟哮吼生风霞。 山南潭底藏蛟龙，腾云降雨山蒙蒙。 二兽相逢斗一场，元珠隐伏是祯祥。 景堪羡，吾暗喜，自斟自酌熏熏醉。 醉弹一曲无弦琴，琴里声声教仔细。 可煞醉后没人知，昏昏默默恰如痴。 仰观造化工夫妙，日还西出月东归。 天是地，地是天，反覆阴阳合自然。 识得五行颠倒处，指日升霞归洞天。 黄金屋，白玉掾，玉女金童日侍前。 南辰北斗分明布，森罗万象现无边。 无昼夜，要绵绵，聚散抽添火候全。 若问金丹端的处，寻师指破水中铅。 木生火，金生水，水火须分前后队。 要辨浮沉识主宾，铅银砂汞方交会。 有刚柔，莫逸意，知足常足归本位。 万神齐贺太平年，恁时国富民欢喜。 此个事，好推理，同道之人知此义。 后来一辈学修真，只说存养并行气。 在眼前，甚容易，得服之人妙难比。 先且去病更延年，用火烹煎变阳体。 学道人，去思己，休问旁门小法制。 只知目下哄得人，不觉自身暗憔悴。 劝后学，须猛鸷，莫徒抛家住他地。 妙道不离自家身，岂在千山并万水。 莫因循，自贪鄙，火急寻师觅元旨。 在生若不学修行，未知来生甚胎里。 既有心，要终始，人生大事惟生死， 皇天若负道心人，令我三途为下鬼。",
      "translated_text": "The Metal Elder prefers to ride the White Tiger,\nthe Mysterious Maiden often mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form.\nThe Tiger comes to sit quietly in autumn mountains,\nthe Dragon stirs its body in the depths of the pool.\nThe two beasts meet and wage a battle,\nwaves surging like a boiling cauldron.\nThe Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their divine might,\nshaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.\nIn an instant, the battle ends and clouds and rain disperse,\nplanting a mysterious pearl deep in the mud.\nFrom this, roots and sprouts gradually grow,\nnurtured in season with the embrace of true essence.\nAfter ten months of gestation, it is swallowed into the mouth—\nunaware, the mortal body already possesses spirit.\nThis matter is rare in the world,\nnot something ordinary people come to know.\nIf in past lives one lacks the bone of immortality,\nhow could one easily encounter it?\nHaving encountered it, one should refine it at once,\nfor time flies swift as an arrow.\nTo catch fish, one must cast a net—\ndo not merely stand by the river sighing in vain.\nI hear you have known of the medicine for many years,\nwhy not still your heart and refine mercury and lead?\nDo not let the candle be blown out by the wind—\nlament not the six paths of rebirth when heaven is blameless.\n\nOf late, many in the world are deceitful,\nall donning the robes of Daoists.\nAsk them what Metal and Wood truly are—\nthey fall silent, mute as the afflicted.\nYet they speak of \"subduing qi\" and \"abstaining from grain,\"\nclaiming other paths and distant roads.\nHave you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?\nThe method of the Great One containing truth is most excellent.\nDo not fault my words for their wildness—\nit is only that people today find it hard to discern.\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\ndare I pour out my thoughts to you.\n\n*Song of the Stone Bridge*\nMy home lies north of the Stone Bridge,\nwhere mountains guard and waters seal, ancient trees standing dense.\nBeneath the bridge, the stream flows clear to Kunlun,\nbeneath the mountain, the spring’s fragrance is rich and lush.\nMy dwelling within the mountains is truly worthy of praise,\neverywhere blooms the flower of non-withering grace.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave hides a fierce tiger,\nemerging from its den with roars that stir wind and mist.\nSouth of the mountain, the pool’s depths conceal a flood dragon,\nsoaring clouds and descending rain shroud the peaks in haze.\nThe two beasts meet and clash in battle—\nthe hidden pearl of primal essence is an auspicious sign.\nThe scene is enviable, and I rejoice in secret,\npouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.\nDrunk, I pluck a tune on the stringless zither,\neach note in the music teaching with care.\nAlas, in my drunkenness, none understand—\ndull and silent, I seem like a fool.\nGazing up, I marvel at the workings of creation:\nthe sun returns west as the moon rises east.\nHeaven is earth, earth is heaven—\nyin and yang reverse in harmony with nature.\nGrasp where the Five Phases invert,\nand soon you’ll ascend in rosy clouds to the grotto-heaven.\nA house of gold, jade rafters,\njade maidens and golden lads attend before you.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are clearly arrayed,\nthe myriad phenomena manifest boundless.\nNo day or night, only ceaseless continuity,\ngathering and dispersing, adding and withdrawing—fire and timing complete.\nIf you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,\nseek the teacher who points to lead within water.\n\nWood gives birth to fire, metal gives birth to water—\nwater and fire must distinguish their order.\nTo discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,\nlead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.\nThere is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,\nknowing contentment, ever content, return to the root.\nAll spirits celebrate the era of great peace,\nwhen the nation prospers and the people rejoice.\nThis matter is worthy of reflection—\nthose of the same path understand this meaning.\nLater generations learning the cultivation of truth\nspeak only of \"preserving and nourishing\" and \"circulating qi.\"\nBefore their eyes, it seems so easy,\nyet those who attain it are wondrous beyond compare.\nFirst, it banishes illness and extends years,\nusing fire to refine and transform the yang body.\nLearners of the Dao, set aside your own thoughts,\ndo not inquire of side doors and minor methods.\nThey only know how to deceive others in the moment,\nunaware of how their own bodies wither in secret.\nI urge later students to be bold and resolute—\ndo not idly abandon your home to wander distant lands.\nThe wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body—\nhow could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?\nDo not procrastinate, do not cling to baseness—\nhasten to seek a teacher and grasp the primal decree.\nIf in this life you do not learn to cultivate,\nwho knows what womb you’ll enter in the next?\nSince you have the heart, see it through to the end—\nthe great matter of life and death is all there is.\nIf the August Heaven betrays those with the heart for Dao,\nit would make me a lowly ghost in the three evil destinies.",
      "overlap_context": "main in this world?\nTo remain in the world, there *is* a way,\nbut people today lack the capacity.\nThey race into the mountains to seek herbs and trees,\nsubduing lead and refining mercury to concoct cinnabar.\nConcocting cinnabar—how different the task!\nOne must seek the crimson blood within Kan.\nSeize it, bring it to Li’s position to restrain the yin essence,\nand blend them in due season.\nWhen the season is right, employ the matchmaker:\nthe Metal Elder and the Mysterious Maiden unite in marriage.",
