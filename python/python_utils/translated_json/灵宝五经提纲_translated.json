the Dao—\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Realized Enlightenment.\nThe Supreme’s subtle words reside in the Five Scriptures,\nThe Five Scriptures bestow upon the world as if in cinnabar and azure.\nWith earnest exhortation, they are once more proclaimed and expounded,\nTo liberate the departed spirits from the darkness of the night-shouldered realm.\n\nWe now reverently acknowledge:\nThat which

supplicate:\n\nThe Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement;\nThe Jade Dawn Dao Lord;\nThe Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao;\nThe August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Heavenly Lord of the Vast Sky;\nThe Eastern Ultimate Azure Mystery Compassionate Father, the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy;\nThe Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, Savior from Suffering;\nThe Nine Heavens Life-Generating Emperor;\nThe Five Elders of the Five Directions;\nThe Great Dharma Masters of the Thirty-Six Sections of the Mysterious Worthy Scriptures;\nThe Three Primordials and Three Officials Emperors;\nThe True Sovereigns of the Nine Dark Realms for Deliverance;\nThe Yang and Yin Clerks of the Five Sacred Peaks, Ten Lands, and Earthly Courts;\nAnd all the responsive and perceptive deities within and beyond the Three Realms—\nMay they all, in their boundless compassion, deign to look down and perceive with penetrating clarity.\n\nTo guide one toward the correct Dao and out of the paths of delusion,\nOne must rely on the torch of wisdom;\nTo cross the sea of suffering and ascend to the other shore,\nOne must depend upon the bridge of Dharma.\nThus, the Heavenly Worthy, with a mind of expedient means, established provisional and ultimate teachings for sentient beings,\nRevealing the purport of the Five Scriptures,\nServing as the guiding thread for all existence.\nTheir profound texts are resplendent,\nTheir grand models towering;\nTheir admonitions and wondrous instructions\nMust be devoted to the Dao,\nAnd grounded in virtue—\nOnly then can one fathom their depths.\nTheir arcane meanings and marvelous phrases\nCannot be glimpsed by those who merely speak and hear,\nFor today, we perform this rite for the deliverance of so-and-so,\nThus, we have reverently assembled the pure assembly before us,\nAnd shall now recite:\n\n*The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Chapters from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure*;\n*The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao’s Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*;\n*The Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal from the Highest Heaven*;\n*The Supreme’s Cavernous Mystery Scripture

beings,\nReturn to the gateless gate of the formless.\nThe assembly, with utmost sincerity, joins in praise and chant.\n\n---\n\n**Recitation of *The Scripture of the Life-Generating Chapters***\n\nWe look up to *The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Chapters*,\nWhich is the qi of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery,\nCongealing in emptiness to form Sanskrit,\nSpontaneously composing its text—\nThus, it is capable of opening heaven and earth,\nAnd generating all beings.\n\nGenerally speaking, the birth of humans\nAll receives the qi of the Nine Heavens,\nForming the embryo, placenta, hun, and po.\nAs for the five viscera, six bowels,\nSeven orifices, eight luminous scenes,\nAnd the thirty-six thousand spirits—\nNone are not born through its fusion and congealment.\nIf there is any obstruction,\nThe principle of continuous generation is incomplete,\nAnd there are those who, though heavily pregnant, miscarry.\n\nThe qi of the Nine Heavens,\nWhen followed and allowed to flow,\nForms an ordinary embryo and becomes human;\nWhen reversed and cultivated,\nForms a sagely embryo and becomes an immortal.\nThough the sagely and the ordinary differ,\nThe Dao they embody is one and the same.\n\nMoreover, heaven holds the yang;\nNine is a yang number.\nThose of pure yang are immortals,\nThose of pure yin are ghosts.\nThe perfected person, by using yang to dissolve yin,\nAscends to heaven and becomes an immortal;\nThe common person, by using yin to dissolve yang,\nDescends to earth and becomes a ghost.\nOnce a ghost,\nThey undergo torment in Fengdu,\nTheir hun and spirit scattered and dispersed.\nWithout relying on the divine chapters to gather their wandering souls,\nThere is no means to extricate themselves from the eternal night\nAnd return to the realm of luminous yang.\n\nThus, those who practice refinement and deliverance\nHold this text in the highest regard.\nSince the departed so-and-so has heard the numinous sound,\nThey should now immerse themselves in the cavernous wisdom,\nConcentrate their spirit to guard the true dwelling,\nRefine the embryo to return to the original beginning.\nNaturally, their hun and po will harmonize and soften,\nThe qi of the Nine Heavens will merge with the Mysterious Female,\nAnd the Dao of the embryonic immortal will be accomplished.\nOnce the Dao of the embryonic immortal is accomplished,\nThey shall ride the dragon chariot,\nAscend at dawn in broad daylight—\nThis is called uniting with the virtue of the Nine Qi.\nHow can one not exert oneself?\nHow can one not exert oneself?\n\nTo further expound, we chant a verse:\n\nThe wondrous qi of the Nine Heavens comes from the void,\nCongealing in emptiness to form the sagely embryo.\nA body beyond the body, capable of transformation—\nTranscending the Three Realms, escaping the wheel of rebirth.\n\n**Assembly responds:** *The Scripture of Life-Generating is rare to encounter.*\n\n---\n\n**Recitation of *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness***\n\nWe look up to *The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao’s Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*,\nWhich, when the Most High Lord Lao journeyed west to the Windy Terrace,\nHe expounded to the Queen Mother of the West—\nIt is the heart-method of the Great Dao.\n\nLet us briefly discuss:\nThat which all under heaven and earth reveres is the One Dao;\nThe myriad volumes of scriptures and books elucidate the One Heart.\nThe Dao has its Great Constancy,\nThe heart has its true and false.\nTo cultivate the Dao, one must cultivate the Great Dao;\nTo discuss the heart, one must first discuss the true heart.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and formless,\nYet capable of transforming all existence;\nThe true heart is quiescent and unmoving,\nYet capable of establishing the myriad dharmas.\nWithout the heart, one cannot perceive the entirety of the Dao;\nWithout the Dao, one cannot perceive the wondrous function of the heart.\nBeyond the Dao, there is no heart;\nBeyond the heart, there is no Dao.\n\nThus, the ancients who cultivated the Dao\nFirst cultivated their hearts.\nHow does one cultivate the heart?\n\nThe answer lies in purity and quiescence alone.\nHow does one attain purity and quiescence?\nThe answer lies in emptiness alone.\nIf one can render the square inch of the heart empty,\nthen not a speck of dust will cling,\nnot a single thing will linger.\nStill and serene, ever pure and ever quiescent,\nthe solitary spirit moves,\nits wondrous responses boundless.\nThus may one transcend the cycle of birth and death—\nthis is called attaining the Dao.\n\nIf the square inch of the heart cannot be made empty,\nthen a hundred paths and a thousand byways\nwill labor and toil without,\nwhile the seven emotions and six desires\ntumultuously disturb within.\nEntangled with external things,\nthe heart battles daily,\ndrifting endlessly through the cycle of birth and death,\nhow then can purity and quiescence be attained,\nor the Dao be grasped?\n\nIf I, though now lost in the Great Yin,\ncould awaken to this truth,\nsettle the mind to seek purity,\ndispel desires to seek quiescence,\nforget form and things to seek emptiness,\nand accumulate these practices over time,\nnaturally a single spark of numinous light\nwould penetrate heaven and earth—\nwhat is called \"form and spirit both wondrous,\nuniting with the Dao in truth.\"\nRoaming the Three Realms,\nascending the Golden Gate,\nhow could the Left Mysterious Immortal Lord have deceived me?\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nThe true heart, pure and quiescent, takes the Dao as its宗,\nLike the precious moon at mid-heaven.\nSweeping away delusive clouds, leaving no trace of obscurity,\nIts light fills the vast emptiness of the Great Void.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Scripture of Purity and Quiescence.*\n\nReciting the *Heart Seal Scripture*\nWe reverently consider the *Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Wondrous Scripture*,\nwhich the Supreme Thearch uttered from his golden mouth,\nand which is the true standard of the Great Elixir Way.\nIt is said that among the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao,\nonly the Great Dao is the orthodox lineage,\nand among the three thousand six hundred side doors,\nonly the Golden Elixir is the true transmission.\nThe books on the Golden Elixir are as vast as the sea,\nbut none are as concise and luminous as this scripture.\nTo name it the *Heart Seal*—is this not fitting?\n\nIn general, the three supreme treasures of the human body are:\nspirit, qi, and essence.\nThose who cultivate and refine take these as the foundation of the elixir,\nhence they are called the \"upper medicines.\"\nThe terms in elixir texts—red lead and black tin,\nquicksilver and cinnabar,\ngold essence and wood liquid,\n*jia-geng*, dragon and tiger,\n*kan-li*, crow and hare,\ninfant and maiden,\nyellow woman and earthen crucible—\ntheir names cannot be fully enumerated,\nyet all refer to these three.\n\nIf one obtains the Dao of returning wind and merging,\ngathering, taking, uniting, and binding them,\nrefining with fire,\nand then nurturing with warmth,\nthe foundation is established in a hundred days,\nthe embryo is formed in ten months,\nand after twelve years, the work is complete.\nShedding the mortal form, the spirit transforms—\nonce attained, it is eternally attained,\nand the Dao of the Golden Elixir is perfected.\n\nThese upper medicines are not only present in the human body;\nheaven and earth, the myriad things—none lack them.\nOnly the wise can unite their own spirit with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,\ntheir own qi with the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,\ntheir own essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.\nThus they can conceal or reveal themselves naturally,\nsharing the lifespan of the Great Void—\nthis is called attaining the Dao.\n\nGreat indeed is this medicine!\nIs it not the supreme treasure of the wondrous Dao?\n\nThough I have now sunk into the Great Yin,\nand the so-called upper medicines no longer remain,\nif one could take the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own spirit,\ntake the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own qi,\ntake the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own essence,\nthen one would witness the dead revived,\nwhite bones restored to life.\nThe upper medicines, though scattered, would reunite;\nthe supreme treasure, though lost, would be regained—\nhow joyous would this be!\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nThe upper medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—reside within the body,\nPossessed fully by all, neither lacking nor overflowing.\nWhoever knows the Dao of merging and returning wind,\nIn the golden crucible, the yellow sprout grows day by day.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Heart Seal Scripture.*\n\nReciting the *Scripture of Salvation*\nWe look up to the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation and Deliverance from Suffering*,\nwhich originates from the hidden texts of the Azure Empyrean,\nand is the secret scripture of refinement and deliverance.\nIts essential principles are four, with the crux lying in \"presiding over light\" alone.\n\nFirst, *entrusting qi to establish*.\nThe Primordial Beginning divided the One Qi to separate heaven and earth,\ngoverning the transformation of yin and yang,\nthe root of the myriad things.\nThis is what Master Zhou meant when he said:\n\"The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang,\nquiesces and generates yin;\nyang transforms, yin unites,\nand water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born.\"\n\nSecond, *following qi to generate*.\nOnce heaven and earth were separated and yin and yang established,\nhumans received the harmonious qi between them to come into being.\nThis is what Master Zhou meant when he said:\n\"The essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal;\nthe way of Qian forms the male,\nthe way of Kun forms the female,\nand the myriad things are transformed and generated.\"\n\nThird, *completing the myriad dharmas*.\nOnce the human way was established,\nsages and worthies emerged among them,\nsetting forth guiding principles and establishing institutions,\nrectifying virtue, benefiting use, and enriching life—\nthus the human way would not be exhausted.\nThis is what Master Zisi meant when he said:\n\"Cultivating the Dao is called teaching\"—\nhis intent was the same.\n\nFourth, *presiding over light*.\nThis light is the substance of nature.\n\"Presiding\" means honoring it as a ruler.\nIf one can honor this light,\nalways making it the master of the body,\nso that movement and stillness, speech and silence all obey its command,\nthen naturally the space between the spirit terrace will be\nbright, open, and penetrating,\nnothing able to obscure it,\nand the substance of the Dao will be complete.\nThis is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls \"revering the power of nature,\"\nwhat the *Great Learning* calls \"illuminating the luminous virtue,\"\nand what *Zhuangzi* calls the \"true ruler\"—\nall refer to this.\n\nThis light is possessed by all,\nnot present because of Yao nor absent because of Jie,\nnot increased for Yan nor diminished for Zhi.\nGrasping it, one is wise;\nabandoning it, one is foolish.\nAttaining it, one ascends to heaven;\nlosing it, one sinks into hell.\nAll the burning, boiling, slaughtering, and cutting in hell,\nthe myriad forms of bitter suffering—\nall arise from losing this light.\n\nThus, when the Heavenly Worthy delivers sinful souls, He first bestows upon them divine wisdom, enabling them to turn their gaze inward to the source of the heart-mind, that they may recognize their past lives. At the moment of their repentance and awakening, the guilty are instantly pardoned, the imprisoned instantly freed, all sufferings dissolve, and body and mind attain peace—just as a traveler who loses his provisions mid-journey, left to wander hungry and cold along the road, suddenly finds treasure, and all needs are met at once, all sorrows dispelled. Such is the grace of the Heavenly Worthy’s deliverance from suffering.\n\nShould the departed soul, upon encountering this light, know its joy and refine it with diligent cultivation, then in a single morning’s success, a separate body will arise within the emptiness, capable of transcending the three realms’ tribulations and ascending directly to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning—how then could the torments of hell remain?\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nCountless delusions are the root of suffering,\nWhen the root of suffering is cut away, the root of goodness remains.\nRelying on the might of the sword of wisdom,\nOne leaps beyond the Five Gates of Suffering in the wheel of rebirth.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering.*\n\n---\n\nReciting the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*\n\nWe reverently contemplate the *Most High Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, which the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning revealed to all heavenly beings as the swiftest path of cultivation. The transmission of the wondrous Dao begins with words and ends in wordlessness; the cultivation of heavenly blessings begins with action and ends in non-action. This sutra opens both the sudden and gradual gates, fully expounding the principles of beginning and end—truly the ladder to the Dao and the steps to ascension.\n\nTracing the sutra’s intent, the effort of practice comprises six stages:\nFirst, at the outset of entering the Dao, one observes fasting and precepts to strengthen faith.\nSecond, one widely establishes fields of merit, refining wondrous practices without attachment to myriad conditions.\nThird, one constantly maintains right mindfulness, ensuring inner thoughts do not stray outward nor outer thoughts intrude, thereby eliminating afflictions and karmic obstacles.\nFourth, one nurtures true qi, filling the body with supreme harmony, illuminating inner and outer with light.\nFifth, one reduces and regulates diet to nourish the true origin, dispelling the corpse-demons and severing cravings.\nSixth, one purifies the six senses and empties the five aggregates to attain the subtly wondrous.\n\nThose who faithfully practice these six will find the heart congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly dissolved, enabling them to roam the great void and survey the myriad transformations. Only then will they perceive the complete truth of the Dao’s substance, for the wondrous heart begins in action and ends in non-action—here, silent recognition arises naturally.\n\nShould the departed soul apply themselves to this path, accumulating merit day by day, they will one day join the immortals hand in hand among the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, carefree and at ease, only then regretting their late encounter with this sutra.\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nThe Dao, with no-mind, delivers sentient beings,\nAll expedient means reveal the cultivation of truth.\nShould one return to the ground of sagely wisdom and perfect penetration,\nThey become one who ascends to heaven and attains the Dao.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven.*\n\n---\n\n**Concluding the Sutra | Turning the Merit**\n\nWe, your servants, reverently contemplate the Three Pure Lords Supreme, the multitude of august ones in the Golden Towers, and the true numina of the three realms invoked in this sutra assembly. May they, in their vast compassion, deign to gaze upon us with all-seeing clarity. May the merit of reciting the Five Sutras of the Most High be wholly dedicated to delivering the soul of the departed, awakening their Dao-nature, and uprooting their suffering.\n\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirit*, may they know the source of life’s endowment and cultivate the wondrous practice of returning to the origin.\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, may they suddenly awaken to the nature-school and empty all appearances.\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of the Heart Seal*, may they personally refine the study of destiny and forge the inner elixir.\nUpon hearing the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering*, may they hold fast to this single point of light and not sink into hell.\nUpon hearing the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, may they dually cultivate merit and wisdom, directly ascending to heaven, roaming the courts of wondrous being, and reveling in the realms of the primordial chaos—one truth undimmed, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThus, the sutras first guide the lost, and in the end, words are forgotten as meaning is attained—like boarding a boat to cross the sea of suffering, once the far shore is reached, the boat serves no further purpose; like holding a torch to illuminate a lost path, once the right way is found, the torch is no longer needed. This is the ultimate fruition of sutra merit, the great completion of the Dharma assembly.\n\nThe assembly, with utmost sincerity, having heard the sutras, now praises and chants.\n\n**Threefold Hearing of the Sutra**\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings arouse the mind of dedication, ever upholding faith and reverence.\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, and transmit them.\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings universally ascend the Dharma-bridge without hindrance.\n\nThe *Compendium of the Five Numinous Treasure Sutras* concludes.",

three supreme treasures of the human body are:\nspirit, qi, and essence.\nThose who cultivate and refine take these as the foundation of the elixir,\nhence they are called the \"upper medicines.\"\nThe terms in elixir texts—red lead and black tin,\nquicksilver and cinnabar,\ngold essence and wood liquid,\n*jia-geng*, dragon and tiger,\n*kan-li*, crow and hare,\ninfant and

own qi,\ntake the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own essence,\nthen one would witness the dead revived,\nwhite bones restored to life.\nThe upper medicines, though scattered,

Deliverance from Suffering*,\nwhich originates from the hidden texts of the Azure Empyrean,\nand is the secret scripture of refinement and deliverance.\nIts essential principles are four, with the crux lying in \"presiding over light\" alone.\n\nFirst, *entrusting qi to establish*.\nThe Primordial Beginning divided the One Qi to separate heaven and earth,\ngoverning the transformation of yin and yang,\nthe root of the myriad things.\nThis is what Master Zhou meant when he said:\n\"The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang,\nquiesces and generates yin;\nyang transforms, yin unites,\nand water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born.\"\n\nSecond, *following qi to generate*.\nOnce heaven and earth were separated and yin and yang established,\nhumans received the harmonious qi between them to come into being.\nThis is what Master Zhou meant when he said:\n\"The essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal;\nthe way of Qian forms the male,\nthe way of Kun forms the female,\nand the myriad things are transformed and generated.\"\n\nThird, *completing the myriad dharmas*.\nOnce the human way was established,\nsages and worthies emerged among them,\nsetting forth guiding principles and establishing institutions,\nrectifying virtue, benefiting use, and enriching life—\nthus the human way would not be exhausted.\nThis is what Master Zisi meant when he said:\n\"Cultivating the Dao is called teaching\"—\nhis intent was the same.\n\nFourth, *presiding over light*.\nThis light is the substance of nature.\n\"Presiding\" means honoring it as a ruler.\nIf one can honor this light,\nalways making it the master of the body,\nso that movement and stillness, speech and silence all obey its command,\nthen naturally the space between the spirit terrace will be\nbright, open, and penetrating,\nnothing able to obscure it,\nand the substance of the Dao will be complete.\nThis is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls \"revering the power of nature,\"\nwhat the *Great Learning* calls \"illuminating the luminous virtue,\"\nand what *Zhuangzi* calls the \"true ruler\"—\nall refer to this.\n\nThis light is possessed by all,\nnot present

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the Heavenly Worthy delivers sinful souls, He first bestows upon them divine wisdom, enabling them to turn their gaze inward to the source of the heart-mind, that they may recognize their past lives. At the moment of their repentance and awakening, the guilty are instantly pardoned, the imprisoned instantly freed, all sufferings dissolve, and body and mind attain peace—just as a traveler who loses his provisions mid-journey, left to wander hungry and cold along the road, suddenly finds treasure, and all needs are met at once, all sorrows dispelled. Such is the grace of the Heavenly Worthy’s deliverance from suffering.\n\nShould the departed soul, upon encountering this light, know its joy and refine it with diligent cultivation, then in a single morning’s success, a separate body will arise within the emptiness, capable of transcending the three realms’ tribulations and ascending directly to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning—how then could the torments of hell remain?\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nCountless delusions are the root of suffering,\nWhen the root of suffering is cut away, the root of goodness remains.\nRelying on the might of the sword of wisdom,\nOne leaps beyond the Five Gates of Suffering in the wheel of rebirth.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering.*\n\n---\n\nReciting the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*\n\nWe reverently contemplate the *Most High Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, which the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning revealed to all heavenly beings as the swiftest path of cultivation. The transmission of the wondrous Dao begins with words and ends in wordlessness; the cultivation of heavenly blessings begins with action and ends in non-action. This sutra opens both the sudden and gradual gates, fully expounding the principles of beginning and end—truly the ladder to the Dao and the steps to ascension.\n\nTracing the sutra’s intent, the effort of practice comprises six stages:\nFirst, at the outset of entering the Dao, one observes fasting and precepts to strengthen faith.\nSecond, one widely establishes fields of merit, refining wondrous practices without attachment to myriad conditions.\nThird, one constantly maintains right mindfulness, ensuring inner thoughts do not stray outward nor outer thoughts intrude, thereby eliminating afflictions and karmic obstacles.\nFourth, one nurtures true qi, filling the body with supreme harmony, illuminating inner and outer with light.\nFifth, one reduces and regulates diet to nourish the true origin, dispelling the corpse-demons and severing cravings.\nSixth, one purifies the six senses and empties the five aggregates to attain the subtly wondrous.\n\nThose who faithfully practice these six will find the heart congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly dissolved, enabling them to roam the great void and survey the myriad transformations. Only then will they perceive the complete truth of the Dao’s substance, for the wondrous heart begins in action and ends in non-action—here, silent recognition arises naturally.\n\nShould the departed soul apply themselves to this path, accumulating merit day by day, they will one day join the immortals hand in hand among the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, carefree and at ease, only then regretting their late encounter with this sutra.\n\nTo expound further, I chant a verse:\nThe Dao, with no-mind, delivers sentient beings,\nAll expedient means reveal the cultivation of truth.\nShould one return to the ground of sagely wisdom and perfect penetration,\nThey become one who ascends to heaven and attains the Dao.\n\n*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven.*\n\n---\n\n**Concluding the Sutra | Turning the Merit**\n\nWe, your servants, reverently contemplate the Three Pure Lords Supreme, the multitude of august ones in the Golden Towers, and the true numina of the three realms invoked in this sutra assembly. May they, in their vast compassion, deign to gaze upon us with all-seeing clarity. May the merit of reciting the Five Sutras of the Most High be wholly dedicated to delivering the soul of the departed, awakening their Dao-nature, and uprooting their suffering.\n\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirit*, may they know the source of life’s endowment and cultivate the wondrous practice of returning to the origin.\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, may they suddenly awaken to the nature-school and empty all appearances.\nUpon hearing the *Scripture of the Heart Seal*, may they personally refine the study of destiny and forge the inner elixir.\nUpon hearing the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering*, may they hold fast to this single point of light and not sink into hell.\nUpon hearing the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, may they dually cultivate merit and wisdom, directly ascending to heaven, roaming the courts of wondrous being, and reveling in the realms of the primordial chaos—one truth undimmed, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThus, the sutras first guide the lost, and in the end, words are forgotten as meaning is attained—like boarding a boat to cross the sea of suffering, once the far shore is reached, the boat serves no further purpose; like holding a torch to illuminate a lost path, once the right way is found, the torch is no longer needed. This is the ultimate fruition of sutra merit, the great completion of the Dharma assembly.\n\nThe assembly, with utmost sincerity, having heard the sutras, now praises and chants.\n\n**Threefold Hearing of the Sutra**\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings arouse the mind of dedication, ever upholding faith and reverence.\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, and transmit them.\nAfter hearing the sutras, may all beings universally ascend the Dharma-bridge without hindrance.\n\nThe *Compendium of the Five Numinous Treasure Sutras* concludes.",
