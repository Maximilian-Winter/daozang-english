  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation, the Wondrous Upper Scripture**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation, the Wondrous Upper Scripture*. Composed by the Yuan-dynasty Daoist Chen Zhixu (courtesy name Guanwu). Three fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings, the Wondrous Upper Scripture**\n\nThe Supreme One embraces the true *qi*, which is indeed the wondrous Dao and immortal lineage. The *Scripture of Salvation* of the Mysterious Treasure is called the supreme scripture of the *Dongxuan* tradition.\n\nIt engenders and nurtures Heaven and Earth, opens and closes *yin* and *yang*, enabling the transformations of creation to flow and the primordial workings to extend boundlessly. It illumines the sun and moon, revolves and steers the stars, universally propagates the divine spirits, and transforms and gives birth to the ten thousand kinds.\n\nIn the *Dao De Jing*, non-action (*wuwei*) is primary, while action (*youwei*) is secondary. Supreme *de* is non-action; lesser *de* is action. Supreme *ren* is non-action; supreme *yi* is action. This *Scripture of Salvation*, however, takes action as its beginning and non-action as its end.\n\nThe floating of the mysterious seat in emptiness is action; the dark wisdom of the pure cavern is non-action. The cessation of the jade armillary sphere’s turning is action; the solemn stillness of the ten directions and the silence of rivers and seas is non-action.\n\nThus, when the recitation of the scripture is completed ten times, withered bones become human, and meritorious deeds are reported above to the heavens—then the myriad spirits pay homage. The thirty-two heavens and their thirty-two emperors reveal the transformations of the ancestral kalpas and the hidden mysteries of the heavens. The hidden names of the heavens are concealed lest the heavenly beings leak and slight them. Leaking and slighting bring calamity upon the seven ancestors, while diligent practice leads to ascension as an immortal elder.\n\nFor ten thousand kalpas, it was not transmitted, treasured by the heavens above—why is it called the Mysterious Treasure? *Qi* is called *ling* (numinous); essence is called *bao* (treasure). Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—this is *ling*. Having no ancestor above, with the Dao alone as its body—this is *bao*. When *qi* unites and essence gathers, it is called the upper scripture. When spirit communes and the Dao merges, it is called the salvation of beings. Thus, the Mysterious Treasure is essence and *qi*. Essence and *qi* are mercury and lead. Mercury and lead are *yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* are *li* and *kan*.\n\nWithout attaining the Dao of action, how could *li* and *kan* be harmonized and congealed into the pearl the size of a millet grain? When a person is first born, they unite the non-being with being, stealthily seizing the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s entwined breath to clothe and endow their form. Nurtured for ten months, they shed the womb and sever the umbilical cord, nourished by day with milk and by night with essence—then their form is complete and their spirit flourishes, their spirit is whole and their essence refined, their essence full and the *qi* of perfect harmony abundant.\n\nThe ancient sages said: One whose *qi* is whole does not think of food; one whose spirit is whole does not think of sleep; one whose essence is whole does not think of desire. At this time, it is called pure *yang*. Pure *yang* is *qian*. The superior person, practicing the Dao of supreme *de* and non-action at this stage, cultivates inner refinement and outer merit—then demon kings revere their form, and they attain immortality.\n\nYet those of shallow learning, who do not delight in the immortal Dao, are few in preserving the true and many in confusion. They dwell in the realm of drunken living and dreamlike death, inflamed in the land of the sea of desire and the river of love—thus, the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth they originally received stealthily flees and lodges in *kun*. From this point onward, *kun* seizes *qian*’s one *yang* to become *kan*, while *qian*, broken by *kun* and lacking one *yang*, becomes *li*.\n\nExamine this: desire arises from love, love follows emotion, and emotion is disordered by circumstances. Moreover, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, anxiety, sighing, change, and fear alternate day and night before one, clashing and grinding with things. How could they know the saying that \"things come endlessly, but my heart has its limits\"?\n\nThus, the immortal Dao is difficult to secure, while the demonic path is easily perverted. When the fate of extinction arrives, the body passes through the Great Yin, its return delayed without end—how can one not feel sorrow and pity? The perfected immortals, having encountered a true teacher and suddenly awakened to the human Dao, know that the heart cannot rely on others. At the time when the *qi* is subtly depleted, they early practice the Dao of the Mysterious Treasure’s salvation of beings to restore it.\n\nWhat, then, is restoration? It is the Dao of action of lesser *de*, the Dao of acting through supreme *yi*, the Dao of the Primordial Beginning’s suspended pearl, the Dao of flowing *wu* to approach *ji*, the Dao of descending the dragon and subduing the tiger, the Dao of refining lead and drying mercury, the Dao of golden liquid returning to the true, where form and spirit are both wondrous.\n\nOnly when one comprehends this does one truly believe in the marvel of Earth Treasury’s revelation and the merit of gold and jade manifesting their forms. Preserving their original years, they all attain longevity, transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Great Void—all matters within their allotted share. How could this not be due to accumulating virtue and establishing merit?\n\nExamining this scripture in detail, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, at the beginning of the Dragon Han era when Heaven and Earth first divided and the jade script emerged, composed this scripture. At that time, he wrote it in purple ink upon the Azure Forest, each character a *zhang* in length, and bestowed it upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. The Jade Dawn bestowed it upon the Mysterious Unity Perfected, who bestowed it upon the Heavenly Perfected August One. The August One transcribed its text in fine script to establish the correct pronunciation and concealed it in secrecy.\n\nDuring the time of the Yellow Emperor, the August One met with the Three Immortals of Grand Clarity at Mount Emei. The Yellow Emperor bowed and inquired of the Dao, and the August One bestowed upon him the text of the Five Teeth and Three Ones, along with the upper fascicle of the *Scripture of Salvation*. The Yellow Emperor cultivated it and ascended as an immortal.\n\nLater, Emperor Ku received the *Root Chapters* and *Jade Calendar Chapters* at the Pastoral Virtue Terrace from the August One. During the *Yuanfeng* era of the Western Han, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed the upper fascicle and the two chapters upon Emperor Wu, completing the entire scripture. In the Eastern Han, the Supreme One descended to bestow upon Gan Ji the *Upper Scripture of the Numinous Writ*, along with the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred and fifty fascicles. During the reign of Emperor Huan, the Old Lord descended to Shu and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the *Scripture of Salvation*, the *Northern Dipper*, and over a thousand fascicles of scriptures and records.\n\nIn the *Haotian* era, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One bestowed upon Ge Xuan, the Left Palace Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate at Mount Shangyu in Kuaiji, the *Scripture of Salvation*, expanding it with the *Middle Fascicle of the Numinous Writ*. The Perfected Zheng Siyuan transmitted the original text to Ge Hong, the Master Embracing Simplicity, further augmenting it with the *Upper and Lower Fascicles of the Numinous Writ* and the *Postface of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One*, thus forming the present complete edition. During the Jin dynasty, Wang Zuan encountered the Lord of the Dao, who bestowed upon him this scripture along with dozens of other scriptures. In the Northern Wei, Kou Qianzhi resided on Mount Song to cultivate the Dao, whereupon the Supreme One revealed this scripture to him, along with over sixty fascicles of additional scriptures.\n\nAs this scripture spread through the world, people knew to recite and pray for blessings, yet remained unaware of the Way of returning cinnabar and attaining longevity. From the *Imperial Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* onward, scholars such as Xue Youqi, Yan Dongqi, Cheng Xuanying, and Li Shaowei produced commentaries. In the early *Baoqing* era, Xiao Guanfu expounded the *Inner Meaning and Cinnabar Essentials of the Scripture of Salvation*. All these were those who delved deeply into its ultimate truths.\n\nBy virtue of karmic affinity with my Perfected Teacher, I received the secret of the *Golden Liquor Great Return Fire Talisman*. Wishing to make this Way known to all, I have annotated the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, and composed the *Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Subsequently, integrating the Dao’s application with worldly methods, I have divided and annotated this scripture, citing the insights of earlier sages to corroborate its teachings. May those who seek to avert misfortune learn to recite diligently and turn toward goodness; may those who transcend creation know to cultivate the Dao and ascend to Perfection.\n\nAlas! All people delight in life and detest death. Yet having detested death, they ought to seek the means to escape it. Instead, they bury themselves in the pursuit of fame, profit, and desires, heedless of remorse—thus hastening their demise. Having delighted in life, they ought to seek the Way of long life and enduring vision. Instead, they fail to seek a true teacher to reveal the principles of longevity and return, blindly wandering side paths and errant trails—thus shortening their lives.\n\nWhether in mountain forests or among the wise in cities, those who recite this scripture should seek within it the swift path to the golden elixir and eternal life. For the Supreme One, in employing the Way of the Numinous Treasure to deliver beings, desires precisely that people practice this Way. If one advances in cultivation and diligent practice, one shall ascend to the formless realms of the Upper Clarity and attain the pure conduct of the Brahma-realm.\n\nWritten on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *Bingzi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era by Chen Guanzhi, the Upper Yang Master of the Purple Empyrean Crimson Palace on the Northern Gold Conch Mountain.\n\n---\n\n**Annotations to the Supreme Pervasive Numinous Treasure Immeasurable Scripture of Salvation, Upper Fascicle of the Most Exalted Grade**\n*By Chen Guanzhi, the Upper Yang Master*\n\nThe Upper Yang Master says: *Supreme* (太) is that which the Dao alone makes greatest; *Exalted* (上) is that which heaven and earth alone revere. *Pervasive* (洞) is that which nothing fails to penetrate; *Mysterious* (玄) is that whose subtlety defies description. *Numinous* (灵) is that whose transformations are unfathomable, responding and communicating without obstruction. *Treasure* (宝) is that which is difficult to obtain, cherished by all. *Immeasurable* (无量) is that which cannot be conjectured; *Deliverance of Beings* (度人) is that which leads from the mundane to the sacred. *Upper Grade* (上品) is that which has no equal under heaven; *Wondrous* (妙) is that which nurtures the essence of all living things. *Scripture* (经) is that which serves as the raft across the river and the ladder to heaven.\n\nIn summary: the most revered and precious, the pervasively numinous and transformative, the true and primordial Way of the One that completes the elixir. The above is expounded for those of great root and superior capacity—this is the *application of the Dao*.\n\nNow, this scripture encompasses both the *application of the Dao* and *worldly methods*. The *application of the Dao* is that by which one cultivates and ascends as an immortal; *worldly methods* are those by which one recites diligently and seeks blessings. If interpreted through *worldly methods*, then *Supreme* (太上) is a title of towering reverence. *Pervasive Mystery* (洞玄) refers to the three grades of the Three Caverns—*Cavern of Perfection* (洞真), *Cavern of Mystery* (洞玄), and *Cavern of Spirit* (洞神)—signifying the Way of the Primordial Beginning that pervades the ultimate and the mysterious One. *Numinous Treasure* (灵宝) refers to the Lord of the Jade Dawn who, receiving the primordial qi of the Primordial Beginning, was transformed and born, bearing the exalted title of Numinous Treasure. *Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings* (无量度人) means that since the beginningless kalpas, the Primordial Beginning has generated the myriad heavens and brought forth the ten thousand existences, delivering countless beings beyond reckoning. *Upper Grade* (上品) signifies that among the thirty-six sections and eighteen thousand fascicles of the Daoist Canon, spanning four hundred thousand scrolls, this scripture stands foremost. *Wondrous* (妙) is that which cannot be named in words; *Scripture* (经) is the true path of the Dao. This is the interpretation through *worldly methods*.\n\nFor those of great cultivation, the *application of the Dao* and *worldly methods* proceed in tandem: the *application of the Dao* conceals *worldly methods*, while *worldly methods* fulfill the *application of the Dao*—this is the dual cultivation of *nature* and *destiny*. The world says that Buddhists cultivate *nature* while Daoists cultivate *destiny*; even the wise and sagacious cling to this view. Yet how could they know that this scripture fuses *nature* and *destiny*, uniting form and spirit in wondrous perfection? The Upper Yang Master has but revealed a celestial mechanism, exposing the essence and function of *nature* and *destiny* in this scripture.\n\n*Supreme* (太) is the essence of *nature* and the response of *destiny*—the very essence of the sovereign mandate of creation; its function is the power to generate the myriad heavens. *Pervasive* (洞) is that which the true nature shares in common. *Mysterious* (玄) is the hidden profundity of its workings. *Numinous* (灵) is the transformation of *nature*. *Treasure* (宝) is the product of *destiny*. *Immeasurable* (无量) is not something the ordinary can comprehend. *Deliverance of Beings* (度人) requires beings to deliver one another. *Upper Grade* (上品) means there is no second Way under heaven, and those of the same kind find it easy to apply effort. *Wondrous* (妙) is the first stirring of yang, when the ten thousand things burgeon with spring. *Scripture* (经) is that which possesses principles and provides the path of cultivation. Such forthright revelation—how could it not be direct?\n\nThe *Veritable Records of the Primordial Beginning* states: In the *Longhan* kalpa, the Lord Lao divided his body to teach and transform, manifesting the true writ in the Central Heaven Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, the Southern Culmen Vermilion Brightness Kingdom, the Eastern Culmen Floating Black Kingdom, the Western Culmen Western Na Kingdom, and the Northern Culmen Yudan Kingdom. Within these five kingdoms, all received the teachings of the Numinous Treasure. The Western King of the Hu inquired: \"What is the Dao?\" The Lord Lao replied: \"It is the Supreme Numinous Treasure, born before heaven and earth, vast enough to embrace all, subtle enough to contain all.\"\n\nThe heavens attain it and become clear; the earth attains it and becomes tranquil; spirits attain it and become numinous; things attain it and come to life; humans attain it and take form. Should humans cultivate it, they may become immortals, ascending in flight to the Jade Capital—hence it is called the Supreme.\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind* from the *Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure* intones:\n*The Supreme abides primordially before the Great Ultimate,\nExisting ere father and mother gave birth.\nTo save humankind, the true scripture is required—\nIf you ask of the true scripture, *gui* is lead.*\n\nThe Dao declares: Long ago, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, within the azure void’s resounding hymns of the Great Floating Li Land, the *Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Upper Scripture on Salvation* was received. When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Only then did he ascend the throne.\n\nCelestial perfected spirits, lofty sagely worthies, wondrously practiced perfected ones, and countless hosts arrived borne upon the void, soaring on cinnabar clouds, jade chariots, and feathered canopies casting shade, their flowing essence and luminous jade radiance in five vibrant hues billowing forth, illuminating the vast heavens for seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the myriad heavens—all celestial wheels—halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, the sky cleared of drifting veils, and the four qi shone in clarity. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees leveled as one, no longer high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue, as the assembled perfected ones attended the throne.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: In worldly terms, this recounts the origins of the scripture; viewed through the Dao’s application, it is entirely the wondrous discourse of the primordial Mysterious Unity’s great elixir.\n\n*Laozi* states: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth—it is named the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally wordless; words are but a means to reveal its function. Thus it is said: The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.\n\nIn worldly interpretation, the Dao Lord expounds the scripture’s meaning, simply calling it “the Dao declares.” In the Dao’s application, the Dao itself took form before the primordial darkness, becoming the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate, within the hidden and obscure, divided into yin and yang. Once yin and yang took shape, they became nature and life; at the moment of their effervescence, they are called spirit and qi. When the primordial chaos shattered, spirit and qi were named lead and mercury. Lead and mercury, passing through the gate of *wu* and *ji*, become the Mysterious Female. Thus the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth—this is called the Dao. To follow and employ the Dao is what is meant by “declares.” Hence the scripture’s opening directly states: *The Dao declares: Long ago, in the Azure Beginning Heaven.*\n\n“Long ago” refers to before the Great Ultimate; “Azure Beginning Heaven” is the origin of all things. “Azure void’s resounding hymns” marks the inception of creation; “Great Floating Li Land” is the source from which all things arise. Receiving the *Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Upper Scripture on Salvation* is to practice the great elixir of the Mysterious Unity—this is the Dao’s application.\n\nIn worldly terms: “Long ago” refers to the beginning, when the Azure Beginning Heaven—the first heaven of the eastern direction, above the Heaven of Seed-People—was filled with azure radiance, hence called the Azure Void Heaven. There, qi surged as divine winds, resonating like hymns in the empty vastness. Below lay the kingdom of Great Floating Li.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Great Floating Li Land reveals the inception of creation—things arise from earth and return to earth. The *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* says: Fire is born from wood, and calamity arises when it overcomes. Those who know this and refine it are called sages. Fire within wood, if unleashed without restraint, reduces all to ash and smoke, obliterating its original nature. Those who restrain it, though fire consumes wood to embers, may gather it into earth, preserving its original nature.\n\nThe Azure Beginning Heaven is the direction of wood; the azure void’s resounding hymns are the image of fire; the Great Floating Li Land is the root of earth. Earth is the foundation of the returned elixir. The returned elixir is the Dao of returning to the origin. The scripture says: Attain utmost emptiness, guard utter stillness—when the myriad things arise together, I observe their return. All things flourish and return to their root; returning to the root is called stillness, stillness is called the restoration of life—this is the principle of return.\n\nIn the *Book of Changes*, the hexagram *Return* says: In returning, one sees the heart of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth are the bodies of yin and yang; the “heart” reveals their function. Heaven moves, earth is still; yang moves, yin is still. When heaven’s movement reaches its extreme, yin is born; when earth’s stillness reaches its extreme, yang is born. Thus, when decay reaches the top, return begins below—through the waxing and waning of movement and stillness, their heart is revealed. Humans are the same.\n\nThe hexagram *Return* has one yang beneath five yin, its body *Zhen* below and *Kun* above. *Zhen* is wood, the Azure Beginning Heaven; wood generates fire, the azure void’s resounding hymns. Fire generates earth, thus *Kun* earth is the Great Floating Li Land. Earth is the root of creation, and from earth comes metal, called the “qi-void metal embryo”—truly the ancestral qi of the prior heavens.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning: *Yuan* means mysterious; *shi* means one. “Heaven” is the most exalted of the one qi, the supreme designation of the ten thousand existences. In the Dao’s application, it is the ancestral qi of the Dharma-body, also called the original face, the indestructible primordial spirit. Thus the *Elixir Scripture* says: The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning is none other than myself. When he expounded this scripture, in the Dao’s application, the scripture *is* true lead.\n\nLord Lao said to Master Wen Shi: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete. He also said: The One is lead, lead is the sovereign; the Two is mercury, mercury is the minister. If lead is not true, mercury cannot draw near. If lead is true, the household minister does not stray.\n\n“Circumambulating ten times to summon the ten directions”: In worldly terms, the Celestial Worthy expounds the scripture to summon the perfected and call forth the numinous. “Circumambulating” means universal proclamation; “ten times” means comprehensive summons. “Summoning” governs the practice across the ten directions.\n\n“Ascending the throne”: In the Dao’s application, this refers to the nine revolutions and ten months of elixir refinement. “Only then did he ascend the throne” signifies the golden elixir’s completion within the chamber.\n\nThe great practitioner, upon entering the chamber to commence work, pursues the two qi along the Yellow Path, unites the three natures within the Primordial Palace, revolves through the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial passes, and gathers the three thousand six hundred upright qi—is this not the celestial perfected and supreme sages, their countless hosts converging upon the elixir crucible, their spokes assembling around the golden embryo? Is this not riding the void to arrive, uniting spirit with qi, refining with qi?\n\nIs this not soaring through vermilion clouds in the celestial vault, feathered canopies casting shade, golden radiance gleaming, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is this not the flowing essence and jade light, five hues billowing in profusion, illuminating the great void?\n\nIn worldly terms, the Celestial Worthy’s numinous efficacy in summoning response—how could it be limited to this? Seven days and seven nights: in the great transformations of heaven and earth, ten months are pure yin without yang. Only in the eleventh month, belonging to *zi*, though yang exists, it has not yet returned. After another seven days, yang first revives—this is the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The moon becomes full at the fifteenth day, and by the twenty-seventh night, the moon is black without yang. By the third day of the following month at the *shen* hour, the moon’s one yang revives at *geng*—this is the yin and yang of the sun and moon. All revive through seven.\n\nHeaven’s one generates water, earth’s six completes it—this is the seven of the Five Phases. In the Dao of the golden elixir, the number of convergence and gathering: one hour contains six seasonal nodes, each node governing five days. At the time of gathering the medicine, only one and a half nodes are used—seven days and seven nights. The *Book of Changes* states: “Hard and soft are the images of day and night.” The former worthies said: “Hard and soft are the going and coming of one qi.” A person’s exhalation and inhalation are the going and coming of one qi. One exhalation and one inhalation make one breath; within one breath, yin and yang are divided. Exhalation, bright, is yang; inhalation, dark, is yin. The seven orifices’ exhalation is the seven days; the seven orifices’ inhalation is the seven nights.\n\nWhen the Golden Mother’s merit is accomplished, the celestial mechanism does not move, spirit is suspended in fixed gaze, pulse ceases, heart stills—thus it is called seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the revolving jade pivot, all halt their wheels; breath does not enter or exit. The numinous phoenix is silent, qi does not ascend or descend—like mountains and seas concealing clouds. Delusive conditions are entirely purified, as if the heavens were without floating obscurities. The six roots are greatly stabilized, called the four qi’s clarity and purity. At this point in the Dao’s application, the wondrous fusion of nature and life is revealed.\n\nA kingdom’s land: in worldly terms, it is the Floating Black Soil; in the Dao’s application, it is the one body. A person takes the body as the kingdom, essence as the people, qi as the ruler, and spirit as the commander. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all within the body. When truly still and serene, it is as if all were leveled equally, without further high or low. Nature, like jade’s lustrous purity—how is it different from having color?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: “Soil is nature and emotion. Nature, empty and transformative, generates spirit, stored within the chamber—this is *wu* soil. Qi, stirred and aroused, has emotion, gathered within the cauldron—this is *ji* soil.” After *wu* and *ji* have united, spirit is joyful and qi is still; nature returns to the darkness of emotion. Like the azure qi’s flawless hue, like jade’s purity without admixture—thus it is said that all soil becomes azure jade, without differing colors.\n\nWithin the heart and eyes, the true qi is inwardly observed; the three *hun* return to the body, the seven *po* return to the true. The heart-monarch is at peace, and the myriad spirits obey commands—thus it is said the host of perfected attend the seat. All this pertains to the Dao’s application of active effort.\n\nIf interpreted through worldly dharma, the Celestial Worthy’s awe-inspiring power transforms the celestial spirits, earthly deities, sun, moon, and stars, who respond according to conditions—such is the spectacle.\n\nThe ode says:\nIn the azure vault, the most wondrous sound sings through emptiness,\nThe great Floating Black Soil sought in *kun*.\nFlowing essence illumines brightly, the numinous wind is still,\nSerene and still, the subtle yang refines the five yin.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy, upon the dark seat floating in space atop a five-colored lion, expounded the scripture once—all the celestial great sages simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all the deaf and ailing men and women of the kingdom had their ears opened and hearing restored. When the scripture was expounded a second time, the blind had their eyes brightened. A third time, the mute could speak. A fourth time, the lame and those with chronic ailments could all rise and walk. A fifth time, those with long-standing illnesses had their forms restored at once. A sixth time, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. A seventh time, the old reverted to youth, and the young became strong. An eighth time, women conceived, and birds and beasts carried young; whether born or unborn, all were brought to completion. A ninth time, the earth’s treasuries opened, and gold and jade were revealed. A tenth time, withered bones revived and all arose as complete persons.\n\nAt that time, all men and women of the kingdom, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: In the Dao’s application, the Primordial Celestial Worthy is the primordial spirit. The Purple Clarity White Perfected said: “This spirit is not the spirit of thought and deliberation; it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.” The *Inner Meaning* states: “The dark seat is the spirit chamber; floating in space is the dharma-body. The five colors are the qi of wondrous transformation; the lion is the knowing heart.” When the primordial spirit is in the chamber, moving the heart to gather qi, the dharma-body is empty and still, the knowing heart is bright and wondrous. The spirit’s control of qi, the heart’s likeness to a charioteer—is this not the Celestial Worthy’s Dao-form? And is it not also one’s true nature? Thus, the dark seat floating in space is profound stillness and true serenity, yet also constant response and constant stillness.\n\nWhat is most difficult for a person to subdue is the heart and nature. The scripture says: “The spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, but desires pull it.” Spirit is the true nature; when the heart is still, the spirit is naturally clear. The work of entering the chamber is to subdue the heart like taming a fierce beast. The former worthies compared lead and mercury to dragon and tiger, speaking of how difficult they are to restrain. Pure Yang said: “The gentle lead crucible, its light penetrating the screen.”\n\nThe workings of creation race onward, tiger and dragon in union—advancing the fire-work at the perilous point of Ox and Dipper. Moreover, the lion is king of the hundred beasts; to sit floating in space above it, even the slightest negligence brings extreme danger. The Perfected of Azure Prime from the Eastern Sea said: “One must first subdue it and then sit above it, emptying the heart and externalizing the form—only then can the Dao respond, and this becomes the foundation of transcendence.” After one recitation of the scripture, all the celestial worthies and great sages simultaneously proclaimed its excellence.\n\nThose who cultivate the Mysterious Unity, the Perfect Numinous Treasure, the Great Returning Elixir—all sages revere and protect them, all heavens honor them, demon kings escort them, and spirits look up to them. How much more, then, to be present at the scripture-seat—would this not be proclaimed excellent? In terms of the Dao’s function, reciting the scripture once brings all the spirits within the body to joyful ease. In a kingdom, men and women with deafness and ear ailments all regain their hearing; after a second recitation, the blind see clearly; after a third, the mute speak. Viewed through worldly methods, this may seem shallow, but understood through the Dao’s function, its principle is most precise.\n\nWhy is this so? Ordinary people cannot quietly listen to nurture qi, withdraw their vision to preserve spirit—thus their ears are confused by sounds, their eyes disturbed by colors, their mouths enslaved by flavors. Over time, without awakening, they inevitably become blind, deaf, mute, and dumb. As *Laozi* says: “The five tones deafen the ear, the five colors blind the eye.” The great cultivator listens to the soundless and grows ever more acute; gazes upon the formless and grows ever more clear; abstains from mixed flavors and grows ever more refined. How much more, then, in the moment of entering the chamber—how should one’s five senses fear or falter?\n\nMaster Wei the Perfected said: “The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—seal them tightly and do not let them open. The perfected one hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass within.” After a fourth recitation, the lame and those bound by chronic illness all rise and walk. Compared to worldly people who do not cultivate the Dao, they are like the lame who cannot walk. “Chronic illness” means entanglement—accumulated habits reaching their limit. Due to their profound ignorance, they are ensnared by worldly defilements, bound by ingrained habits. Now, to say they “rise and walk” means they rouse their resolve and cultivate the Dao.\n\nAfter a fifth recitation, long-standing chronic diseases all restore their form at once. There are those who believe in the Dao but whose hearts lack firmness. Those who do not believe in the Dao harbor hearts of disbelief as hard as metal or stone; no amount of persuasion can turn their hearts to trust the Dao. This is called long-standing chronic illness. Yet if they suddenly come to believe in the Dao and practice without doubt, this is called restoring their form at once. Some explain that Kan (Water) corresponds to the ear and restores hearing, while Li (Fire) corresponds to the eye and restores sight. Others say that Zhen (Thunder) startles and restores hearing, Li (Fire) attaches and restores sight—how is this not transcendence? The scripture’s circulation in the world truly preserves the Dao. Without the vessel and insight of one who truly treads the path, how can one speak of this?\n\nAfter a sixth recitation, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regrow. When blood flourishes, hair thrives; when essence abounds, teeth are firm. After a seventh recitation, the old regain their youth, the young grow strong. If the primordial Mysterious Unity’s qi is restored, the old revert to infancy and regain their vigor. If the Perfect qi is complete, the young all grow strong. As *Laozi* says: “Compared to a newborn babe, bones weak and sinews soft yet with a firm grip, unaware of the union of male and female yet the organ stirs”—is this not the meaning of the young growing strong?\n\nAfter an eighth recitation, women conceive, birds and beasts carry young—whether already born or not yet born, all attain birth and completion. After a ninth recitation of the scripture, the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form. After a tenth recitation, withered bones revive, all rise as complete humans. Here, the Dao’s function and worldly methods coexist. In worldly terms, one follows the scripture’s words without needless repetition. In the Dao’s function, for those cultivating the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, if they have not obtained the primordial qi, their entire body is yin. If the center of Li (Fire) is empty, is this not called a woman? As the Perfected of Purple Yang said: “The sun resides in the Li position, yet when inverted, it becomes the woman; Kan (Water) pairs with the toad palace, yet it is the man.” Having obtained the Golden Fluid’s woman-vessel, above and below one guards with the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, left and right with the White Tiger and Azure Dragon—is this not birds and beasts carrying young? “All attain birth and completion” means the golden vessel’s embryo is complete and qi is full.\n\n“Earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form” means both form and spirit are wondrous. “Withered bones revive, all rise as complete humans” means the perfected one appears, with a body outside the body, a thousand or a hundred million transformations. The *Inner Meaning* says: “Birds and beasts carrying young” refers to cinnabar containing mercury’s essence, resembling pregnancy. Mercury meets lead and congeals; qi meets form and blends. The already-congealed qi grows ever stronger; the arising qi blends and congeals again, not scattering with things but nurturing the sacred embryo—thus, whether already born or not yet born, all attain birth and completion.\n\nMoreover, the ninth recitation corresponds to earth producing metal, heaven completing it at nine. Returning to the west, the Dui (Lake) direction is metal, where Kun (Earth) and Dui unite to form metal in the soil. This is lead returning to the earthen crucible to become treasure. As the *Triple Concordance* says: “When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the Returning Elixir”—this is the qi returning to the origin. Heaven’s one generates water, first giving rise to the golden embryo from empty qi, though its metallic essence is not yet visible. Earth’s four produces metal, still a transformative mechanism; at this stage, it returns to the origin and restores its nature, residing in the central palace—this is the elixir’s body with its mysterious image. The central palace is earth; earth is the land, and the metal mother dwells within it—thus, “the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form.”\n\nMaster Celestial Han’s preface to the *Scripture of the Golden Fluid Divine Elixir* says: “The immortal’s path, the subtle words, the principle beyond principle, the great reality beyond all realities.”\n\nThis has already been recorded in the profound tradition, not to be conveyed by even the slightest measure.\n\nThe Most High likewise expounded this subtle and empty Dao. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts toward it. The land is the body; man and woman are yin and yang. \"Turning their hearts\" means resonance by kind—just as the primordial qi unites with the postnatal breath to form the elixir, and when merit is complete and qi is full, it is said that all receive protection and deliverance, attaining longevity.\n\nAs explained above, these all pertain to the functioning of the Dao. If viewed through worldly methods, the exposition has already been made clear in the verses:\n\n*The empty seat of mystery floats with the five-colored master,\nThe blind, deaf, mute, and lame all depart from their afflictions.\nWhen the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form,\nSoaring through the void, the banner of victory is seized.*\n\nThe Dao speaks: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture once, the boundless hosts of perfected great spirits from the Eastern Direction of the Infinite arrived floating through the void. When he expounded it a second time, those from the Southern Direction arrived; a third time, those from the Western Direction; a fourth time, those from the Northern Direction; a fifth time, those from the Northeast; a sixth time, those from the Southeast; a seventh time, those from the Southwest; an eighth time, those from the Northwest; a ninth time, those from the Upper Direction; a tenth time, those from the Lower Direction.\n\nWhen the ten recitations were complete, the boundless hosts of perfected great spirits from the ten directions arrived all at once. Every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in reverence, and those who came were like fine rain or dense mist—so vast was the multitude that they filled half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, beyond all restraint.\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the empty void five *zhang* above the earth. He led the perfected great spirits, the exalted sages, the high worthies, the subtle-practiced perfected ones, and the boundless hosts of the ten directions’ primordial and ultimate perfected great spirits—all entered into the pearl. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging motion as they entered through the pearl’s opening. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown.\n\nThe people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven. After the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding the scripture within the pearl, the host of perfected ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The dharma rites were perfectly accomplished, and the various heavens returned to their places. In an instant, all was silent, without a trace of lingering sound.\n\nAt that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered, preserving their destined years without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all cultivating good hearts—no killing, no harm, no envy, no jealousy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no resentment. Their words were free of embellishment, their mouths free of harsh speech. They were united in compassion, transforming even strangers into kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony.\n\nWhen the scripture first emerged to teach the land, those who had beforehand devoted sincere hearts, revered and upheld it with devotion, all attained deliverance across the ages.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This encompasses both the functioning of the Dao and worldly methods. In worldly terms, the Heavenly Worthy expounds the scripture, summoning the boundless hosts of perfected ones from the ten directions—the Eastern Direction’s Brahma-Monitor Xuyan Heaven and others in the Zhen Palace’s *mao* position, an innumerable host; the Southern Direction’s Yudan Wuliang Heaven and others in the Li Palace’s *wu* position; the Western Direction’s Linghua Fanfu Heaven and others in the Dui Palace’s *you* position; the Northern Direction’s Dongyuan Huayingsheng Heaven and others in the Kan Palace’s *zi* position; the Northeast’s Gaoxu Qingming Heaven and others in the Gen Palace’s *yin* direction; the Southeast’s Poluonimi Bujiaole Heaven and others in the Xun Palace’s *si* direction; the Southwest’s Jiran Doushu Heaven and others in the Kun Palace’s *shen* direction; the Northwest’s Shangshan Shanwu Lian Shoutian and others in the Qian Palace’s *hai* direction; the Upper Direction’s Nine Heavens, Upper Clarity, Jade Perfected Thirty-Six Heavens, and others; the Lower Direction’s Formless Realm, Form Realm, Desire Realm’s Thirty-Two Heavens, down to the boundless hosts of the Three Origins and Nine Earths—all assembled in the Primordial Azure Heaven’s Fuli Land to hear the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expound the scripture.\n\nThe number ten signifies the ultimate. In terms of the Dao’s functioning, ten is the number of heaven and earth’s generation: the two earths of *wu* and *ji* combine to form ten. Heaven and earth unite, and the myriad things interact; yin and yang unite, and the myriad things are born; lead and mercury unite, and the golden elixir is formed.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, one gathers the three thousand six hundred breaths of upright qi, reverses the seventy-two seasonal nodes, distinguishes the three hundred eighty-four lines, and assembles the five stars and twenty-eight constellations. One drums the twenty-four breaths of yang fire, moves the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, guards the three *hun* to protect the form, and returns the seven *po* to the body. The twelve thousand spirits within the body all heed the command—this is the boundless host from the ten directions arriving floating through the void, all at once.\n\nMen and women turning their hearts in reverence is the union of yin and yang qi. The fine rain and dense mist are the true qi’s steaming. As the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"When golden sand enters the five viscera, the mist scatters like wind and rain.\"* The earth sinking unevenly refers to the two earths of *wu* and *ji*—*wu* and *ji* are the gate of the Mysterious Female. When gathering the medicine, dragon and tiger contend, metal and wood are separated. If control is lost even once, the medicine will surely flee and be lost.\n\nFor what is gained in me is lost in the other, and what is lost in me is gained in the other—hence the term \"uneven sinking.\" At this moment, only the most sagely and spirit-like adept, having refined the self to perfection, can prevent this loss of balance. The precious pearl, no larger than a grain of millet, admits the thronging host of perfected beings with vigor. Viewed through worldly eyes, how could this not be divine transformation? Yet from the perspective of the Dao’s workings, it is no larger than a millet grain.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, the size of a millet grain, within the empty mystery, five *zhang* above the earth—this clarifies the Dao’s workings. The pearl dwells in empty mystery, where spirit and Dao unite; five *zhang* above the earth, for \"earth\" here denotes soil, and soil refers to *wu* and *ji*. The golden elixir coalesces from *wu* and *ji*, and once the elixir is formed, it departs and distances itself. *Wu*-soil is already separated by the Western Heaven, while *ji*-soil remains five *zhang* away—this must be transmitted orally and cannot be disclosed openly. Looking back at what lies five *zhang* below, one sees only the Five Defiled Evil Realms.\n\nSome explain the pearl’s five-*zhang* distance as analogous to the heart’s five-*cun* separation from the spleen—this is utterly foolish and mistaken. Others take the pearl as essence and the five *zhang* as the number of the Five Phases; still others speak of the distance from the cinnabar field to the Mysterious Pass, unaware of the wondrous transformations of the primordial *qi* in forming the immortal embryo. The Primordial Beginning ascends and guides the host of perfected beings into the pearl. Once the primordial spirit is stabilized, the ten thousand spirits all return, merging with emptiness and uniting with the formless, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous.\n\nThe Azure Perfected One said: \"The Dao’s subtlety and wonder originate in emptiness and nothingness. The body of celestial perfection, how could it admit obstruction?\" Yet it cannot escape simultaneous confusion and mixture, so the suspended pearl responds to changes, demonstrating that the formless returns to nothingness. \"Ascends\" means to rise and proceed; \"guides\" means to point out and transform through instruction. Celestial and human beings look up to those who have attained the true Dao, following them into the pearl’s mouth—yet if celestial beings bear burdens, they cannot accompany them. Once inside the pearl’s mouth, their whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAll this is the Primordial Beginning’s manifestation of the divine transformations of the golden elixir’s Dao: from nothingness into being, and from being back to nothingness; merging the hundred spirits into one heart, gathering the ten thousand existences into a single breath. Then the perceptions of celestial and human beings differ—how could they know the wondrous transformations within the pearl? When the sutra’s exposition is complete, the host of perfected beings oversees the transmission and bestows it upon me.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"The White Tiger’s first scripture is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold.\" He also said: \"Swallowing and devouring each other, yet growing closer—only then does one realize the truth of male and female conception.\" Does this not describe the sutra’s exposition as complete? And does it not mean it was bestowed upon me? At this moment, joy and celebration defy expression. Nature and emotion both attain perfect clarity, and today I rejoice in receiving the transmission.\n\nThe ritual matters are roughly understood, and the celestial beings return to their positions. \"Ritual matters\" refers to affairs of deliberate action. As the scripture says: \"The highest principle acts, yet does so with intention.\" The *Great Treasury of Prajñā* states: \"After the elixir is formed, abandon it and depart—then the celestial beings return to their positions, and the principle is evident.\"\n\nOnce the celestial beings have returned to their positions, Bodhidharma too enters the Shaolin Temple to sit in cold meditation. Such pointers having been given, how could all you aspiring immortals not rejoice in this swift attainment! In an instant, all is silent, without a trace of lingering sound. \"In an instant\" describes extreme swiftness. A single breath consists of five such instants. In the span of one instant, there is no time even to blink—this is worldly speech. But if you consider the Dao’s workings, do not pass lightly over the phrase \"in an instant.\" Each word must be pondered with full awareness.\n\nThe refinement of the golden fluid’s great elixir is the swiftest of affairs. Thus, the elixir scriptures speak of taking the month from the year, the day from the month, the hour from the day, the *hou* from the hour, and the *ke* from the *hou*—gathering the seventy-two *hou* into a single day, dividing each hour into six *hou*. In the moment of refining the elixir, not even two *hou* are needed; indeed, half an hour is not required before the returning elixir is obtained. Thus, Subhūti asked the World-Honored One: \"Is this matter swift?\" The World-Honored One replied: \"This matter is exceedingly swift.\" Yet the meaning of \"lingering sound\" must be examined in detail. This word \"silent\" offers boundless application.\n\nAt this time, celestial and human beings encounter the scriptural Dharma and universally attain deliverance—this should be interpreted through the Dao’s workings. \"Celestial and human beings\" must be distinguished, and \"scriptural Dharma\" also bears two meanings. Why? Because those with talent receive the village, those with the Dharma receive the Dharma, and those with the medicine receive the elixir. Those who hear the scriptures receive the Dharma—thus, scripture and Dharma are both clarified, and Dharma and talent are both engaged. Both are called \"two,\" referring to celestial and human beings, and to scripture and Dharma. Celestial and human beings embody the entirety of heaven and earth’s substance, while scripture and Dharma embody the entirety of the great elixir’s function. Each preserves its original years without harm or injury.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Those who attain it know its spirit and cherish it, understand its *qi* and treasure it—only then is it called complete.\" Turning the earth in reverence and all practicing good hearts, refraining from killing and harming—this should be interpreted through worldly principles. There are no inherently unvirtuous people; all are obscured by material desires, their original nature obscured. Thus, evil grows daily while goodness diminishes. Now, having encountered the scriptural Dharma, all turn their light inward, return to the root, and revert to the origin, practicing the good heart of their original nature.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: \"Hearing its voice, one cannot bear to eat its flesh.\" Thoughts, perceptions, sights, and sounds all constitute killing; damaging or injuring anything is harm; destroying another’s good abilities is jealousy; resenting another’s wealth and honor is envy; failing to sever delusive thoughts is lust; taking what is not rightfully one’s is theft; insatiable covetousness is greed; seeing things and generating thoughts is desire; slandering those superior to oneself is hatred; doubting and suspecting the upright is obstruction; false and deceitful speech is florid embellishment; unregulated and unchecked words are evil speech.\n\nAmong the ten evil deeds, lust and desire are the foremost. Those who cultivate the Dao must first eliminate them. The Perfected One of Everlasting Spring, addressing the Emperor Taizu, placed desire as the first precept. The *Sacred Writ of the Great Mystery* ranks desire as the chief of the ten failures.\n\nThe method of cultivation requires nothing more than truly and utterly severing desire—all else is but an easy matter. The world deems the severance of desire exceedingly difficult, yet this is the view of the foolish and deluded, who know not that the method is in fact quite simple; it is merely that people have not yet tested it. To test is to refine the self. For beginners, this trial begins in secluded places, walking alone and dwelling apart, while abstaining from wine. By day, one should constantly study the *Canon of the Elixir*; by night, maintain a mind of purity. With no external distractions to disturb the senses, internal delusive thoughts will naturally dissipate. Should demonic obstacles arise, one’s resolve must only grow firmer. Externally, avoid hunger and thirst; internally, nourish and replenish without cease. After half a year or a full year, when essence and qi are firmly consolidated within, desire will vanish of its own accord. If desire has not yet been eradicated, it is because essence remains incomplete—one must then further fortify it. As the *Canon of the Elixir* states: *\"One whose spirit is whole does not crave sleep; one whose qi is whole does not crave food; one whose essence is whole does not crave desire.\"* So it is indeed.\n\nOnce essence is whole and can be preserved and guarded for the long term, only then may one proceed to refine the returning elixir. Let people test this method, and they will witness its efficacy. Cultivating the self in seclusion is called \"lesser reclusion\"; once lesser reclusion is mastered, one may then achieve \"greater reclusion\" amidst the dust of the marketplace. If one severs external distractions yet fails to eliminate internal thoughts, reacting to every encounter, this is not true practice—it is mere empty talk of purity while the conduct remains impure, and such a one is but a seed of hell.\n\nThose who sever desire are secretly protected by the highest sages, revered in the unseen by gods and spirits, and the Dao of the elixir naturally comes to fruition. In ancient times, the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness and the Perfected Lord Mao examined the successes and failures of true immortals across the world. Among them, forty-seven had fallen, while only two had ascended. Their downfall was due to desire not yet being extinguished. If the sin of desire is eradicated, the ten evil deeds all cease. With universal compassion and love, self and others are embraced as one; even those of different bones become kin. By benefiting oneself, one benefits others; the nation is at peace, and the people prosper in joyful harmony. The \"nation\" is the body; the \"people\" are the essence and qi within it.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao transmitted to Gan Ji the *Essentials of Great Peace*, saying: *\"Heaven bestows spirit upon humanity, Earth bestows essence, and the Center bestows qi. If one treasures essence, severs desire, consolidates qi, and cherishes spirit, then internally, the body attains longevity; externally, the nation achieves great peace.\"* Moreover, what is within inevitably manifests without. By completing one’s nature, the body becomes pure; by completing one’s life, the elixir is perfected. Internally, nature and life are both cultivated; externally, virtuous deeds flourish, bringing blessings to the nation and peace to the people, resulting in joyful harmony.\n\nWhen the teachings first emerged, a nation that embraced the Dao, with sincere devotion, reverence, and respect, would see all its people delivered across the ages. The *Inner Meaning* states: *\"Humans are born endowed with the qi of the Dao—how could the heart be without it? It is only through attachment to illusions and delusion that one becomes benighted and confused. Upon encountering the scriptures and their teachings, this heart is illuminated anew.\"* It is like pointing to the cinnabar elixir—this is one’s original substance, not something that was absent before and now exists. Though obtained after hearing the Dao, it was in truth present before hearing it. Thus, it is said: *\"previously possessed with sincere devotion.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Azure Primordium said: *\"Revering and upholding this scripture is to seek deliverance. 'Reverence' means honoring this scripture as one would a father, mother, teacher, or elder—fearing and loving it, ever wary of negligence. 'Respect' means treasuring this scripture as one would gold, jewels, pearls, or jade—cherishing it without parting, ever fearful of losing it.\"* Having fully devoted the four hearts, all attain deliverance across the ages and achieve longevity.\n\nThe ode says:\n*A pearl like a millet grain hangs in empty space,\nThe highest sages and lofty worthies all appear before it.\nThough the pearl’s mouth may hold boundless multitudes,\nOnly then does one know the scripture’s wondrous mystery.*\n\nThe Dao states: *\"What the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds in the scriptures are the hidden, rhymed names of the Emperors of the various heavens, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits—these are not the common words of the world.\"* Only the perfected immortals who have attained the highest sageliness, who fathom the profound and investigate the subtle, can fully comprehend its verses. Reciting it ten times, the heavens echo in response, and the ten thousand emperors pay homage. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The sun and moon pause in their course; the celestial pivots cease to turn. All demons bind their forms; ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead are revived; white bones become living beings.\n\nFor those earnest in their studies, reciting it ten times summons the Five Emperors to stand guard, the Three Realms to bow in reverence. Demon spirits lose their sight; ghostly apparitions vanish. The dying are delivered; the perishing are restored to life. This is because, though the student’s impure qi has not yet dissipated and their body has not fully attained the true, their invocation can command the ten directions. Though their power does not yet govern the celestial administration, their virtue can subdue the earthly deities, bind demonic spirits, and even reverse death—though they cannot restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. To offer reverent devotion and honor brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through the generations, forging good karmic connections. Ten thousand calamities will not encroach; divine spirits will guard the gate.\n\nThis scripture is most exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and stands as the root of the ten thousand Daoist paths. Vast and majestic is the Great Brahma—its virtue is beyond measure.\n\nMaster of Supreme Yang said: *\"What the Celestial Worthy expounds in the scriptures, when interpreted through worldly terms: the taboos of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors are the hidden, rhymed names of the Emperors of the various heavens. For example, the Demon King of the Azure Heavens, Bayuan Choubo, is one of the demon kings’ taboos. The Venerable Lord of No-Flourishing, Taokang, and Heyan are among the hundred spirits’ concealed names.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Azure Primordium said: *\"The *Numinous Treasure* is the ancestor of the Dao’s qi; the *Deliverance of Humanity* is the foremost of the ten thousand methods. The Primordial Beginning contained the wondrous Dao, and as the Dharma flowed forth, it scattered into written words, fashioned into rhythms and tones—unmatched by the inferior seven literary forms. Lesser and middling immortals cannot even glimpse its chapters and verses; only the highest perfected immortals, who have deeply penetrated the mysteries of the Dao, can fathom its profound subtleties. When the Dao is employed to translate this scripture, it is the returning elixir.\"*\n\nThe *Laozi* states: *\"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* The hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Supreme Gods spoken of in the scriptures—Perfected Lord Taiyi’s *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: *\"If there is something that is indeed the Dao, it is Taiyi containing the true qi.\"* Is not Taiyi itself an inner name? The ancient sages said: *\"Within Heaven and Earth, amid the cosmos, there is one treasure, concealed within the mountain of form.\"* This is the hidden rhyme. Perfected Lord Zhengyang said: *\"The gate that gives me life is the door that takes my death.\"* This is the inner taboo of the demon kings. Perfected Lord Boyang said: *\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss.\"* The Buddha said: *\"Above the seat sits a true person without position.\"* These are the concealed names of the hundred spirits. All the above are profoundly mysterious; unless one is a perfected immortal who has personally cultivated, practiced, and attained the Dao, how could an ordinary person comprehend and fathom them? The meanings of the three words—*comprehend* (通), *fathom* (究), and *master* (悉)—how can they be glossed over or left unexplained?\n\n*Comprehend* means to grasp the scripture’s meaning; *fathom* means to delve into the elixir path; *master* means to perfect the firing times. These three matters share a single principle, yet within them lie countless evenings of subtle mysteries. For instance, the inner names of the medicine in the *Elixir Scripture*: solar essence and lunar marrow, metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, golden liquid and flowing pearl, divine water of the flower pool, intersecting pears and fiery jujubes, phoenix marrow and tortoise essence—all these are the inner names of the medicine.\n\nAgain, the hidden taboos of the cauldrons and vessels: the Heaven-Earth crucible, the Kan-Li frame, the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture, the Taiyi divine furnace, the divine chamber and yellow room, the primordial elixir crucible, the suspended embryo and inverted moon, the golden tripod and jade furnace—all these are the concealed names of the vessels.\n\nAgain, the hidden names of the yin-yang firing times: the Supreme Simplicity’s Zi and Gui, the return, arousal, difficulty, and obscurity, the mother concealed in the child’s womb, the knife-point matchmaker, the gathering of moments, the interplay of emotion and nature, host and guest, white and black, male and female, the new moon and full moon, the waxing and waning qi, inversion and floating, extraction and replenishment, bathing, refining, tempering, nurturing, weights and measures, hexagrams and talismans, shedding the embryo and changing the crucible—all these are the hidden names of the firing times.\n\nAgain, the hidden rhymes of the returning elixir: the dim and obscure, the primordial Supreme Ultimate, the third day forming Zhen, the moon appearing on Gengshen, finding companions in the southwest, the foremost treasure of the primary scripture, civil and martial, reverse and forward, closing the pass on the solstice, rending the vast chaos, cleaving open the primordial darkness, establishing the banks and shores, creating the crucible, entering the void from existence, flowing Wu to meet Ji, guarding against danger and averting peril, returning to life and reverting to the root, tortoise-breathing and heel-sound, a thousand myriad transformations—all these are the hidden rhymes of the returning elixir, none other than the wondrous subtleties of the primordial unity’s ancestral qi.\n\nThe scholar must seek a luminous teacher to comprehend the profound and fathom the subtle, attaining precise and deep understanding. Only then may one request the highest perfected immortals to fully grasp its chapters. To recite it ten times is to speak of the success of the returning elixir, a metaphor for the Dao’s loftiness and virtue’s abundance. If an ordinary person, failing to understand the scripture’s meaning, merely recites it ten times in vain hope of distant celestial chanting, the myriad emperors offering rites—as the scripture describes—this is surely impossible. If one cultivates the returning elixir to completion and the Dao is perfected, then its numinous responses shall far exceed such things.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *\"The myriad emperors offering rites\"* refers to what *Zhuangzi* called *\"tranquil and boundless, with all excellences following.\"* It is the virtue of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of the sage. *\"Rivers and seas\"* compare to the river of love and the sea of suffering. When the human heart is deluded by illusions, love arises from emotion, and suffering comes from perception. If one cultivates the golden elixir, aligning virtue with Heaven and Earth and the Dao with the perfected immortals, then the river of love shall still and the sea of suffering fall silent.\n\n*\"Mountains and peaks conceal clouds.\"* The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *\"The qi of the Five Peaks billows and swells.\"* This refers to the qi of the five viscera; the true person’s breath is deep, and when deep, the qi of the five viscera fills like mountains concealing clouds. *\"Sun and moon\"* are the two eyes; *\"radiance\"* is light—it is the spirit.\n\nThe perfected person’s spirit does not stray outward; though the eyes see things, they remain still and unmoving—thus it is called *\"halting the radiance.\"* The *\"jade pivot\"* is the Northern Dipper. The human heart, when it mirrors the ultimate, revolves without shifting; though it observes and examines, it seems unmoving. The perfected person follows nature, responding to things while the heart remains profoundly tranquil—thus it is called *\"not moving.\"* When myriad demons swarm in confusion and ten thousand threads of delusion arise, if my heart follows nature, it responds as though nothing has occurred—thus it is called *\"binding the form.\"*\n\n*\"Ghostly essences\"* are the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses are not expelled, the Dao will surely be difficult to accomplish. One who embodies purity and simplicity will naturally sever the Three Corpses—thus it is said *\"extinguishing the luminous.\"* *\"Reversing the corpse to raise the dead\"* and *\"transforming white bones into a person\"*—those who have attained the elixir do not merely perfect themselves but should extend their merit to others, delivering the dead and saving the living. The *Scripture of Pure Clarity* states: *\"When my elixir is complete, transformation is at will. What remains lacking is only the celestial decree; thus I accumulate merit to await the true mandate.\"* When Master Wu of Wu suddenly revived the deceased at Qing, was this not *\"reversing the corpse to raise the dead\"*? Those who pursue the study must diligently advance without retreat.\n\nThe *\"Five Emperors\"* are the spirits of the five viscera: the liver’s *hun*, the lungs’ *po*, the heart’s *shen*, the kidneys’ *jing*, and the spleen’s *yi*. When a person is serene, the spirit is settled, the *hun* is clear, the *yi* is at peace, the *po* is calm, and *jing* is not lost. When a person is restless and competitive, the spirit is weary, the *hun* is turbid, the *yi* is disordered, the *po* is scattered, and *jing* dissipates and depletes. Though people desire peace and longevity, daily interactions weary the spirit, and when the Three Corpses and Nine Worms become pests within, the true qi of the cinnabar field is disturbed. Those who advance with dedication must eliminate the Corpses and Worms; when the spirits of the five viscera each fulfill their roles, it is called *\"attending in guard.\"*\n\nThe *\"Three Realms\"* are the Three Corpses—three regions of turbid, dark, and perverse qi within the human body, belonging to the three demonic realms. The Upper Corpse, Peng Ju, dwells in the head; the Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, resides in the intestines; the Lower Corpse, Peng Qiao, inhabits the feet. All human cravings, lusts, and myriad evils are instigated by these corpse-demons. On days such as Gengshen, they ascend to the celestial courts to report every human transgression, omitting nothing. They delight in hastening death. Ge Zhichuan said: *\"Can you sever the enmity of the Three Pengs?\"* An ancient immortal’s poem states: *\"Of all the boundless methods in the world, only the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\"* The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Since ancient times, the decrees of Geng and Jia have been clear: only by slaying the Three Corpses can the Dao be attained.\"* This is to dissolve evil and cultivate goodness, to transform the stubborn and follow virtue. Once subdued, they protect my practice—thus it is called *\"bowing in reverence.\"*\n\n*\"Demon essences lose their eyes, ghostly spirits extinguish their luminous.\"* Demon essences have but one eye and are formless; ghostly spirits possess luminous essence but lack substance. Why do ordinary people, drunk on life and dreaming in death, suffer harm from demons and ghosts yet mistake it for joy? It is because the Six Desires and Seven Emotions remain uneliminated. Those who cultivate greatly forget the Seven Emotions and purify the Six Roots; thus demon essences lose their blind eyes and transform into eyes of wisdom, while ghostly spirits extinguish their luminous essence and manifest divine powers. Those of superior capacity, steadfast in advancement, may even prolong life when on the verge of death—how much more so for the young and vigorous!\n\nThe Perfected One of Azure Origin said: *\"Myriad entanglements arising within are inner demons; calamities and hardships pressing from without are outer demons. Inner demons unsevered are called *essences*; the Seven Emotions and Six Desires are called *ghosts*. They disturb and invert, obstructing my virtue and power—these are what we call *demonic illusions.*\"* Those who pursue the study with unwavering hearts will not be hindered by these demonic illusions.\n\nBeginners may lack inner distractions, but when external circumstances suddenly arise, the heart becomes disordered—how then can they refine the elixir? Thus the scripture states: *\"You, as a student, have not yet dispelled your impure qi.\"* Those given to lust cannot purify themselves or recognize their own impurity. When they encounter practitioners, they should swiftly withdraw to avoid offending their true qi and inviting misfortune. Beginners whose desires remain uneliminated are also impure in body; their qi cannot penetrate the true Dao, nor can they summon and command the ten directions. Though they accumulate minor merits and inch-long deeds, they cannot yet govern the seven celestial bodies of the heavens. For those who refine the golden elixir, their conduct aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth and the luminosity of the sun and moon; the Celestial Stem points the way, and the Northern Dipper stands before them.\n\nIf the elixir is not yet complete, their power cannot govern the celestial bodies—this is called an *\"initial immortal.\"* If one has not yet cultivated but has accumulated profound virtue, this is called an *\"earth immortal,\"* whose power can only subdue earthly spirits. Those who *\"bind demonic spirits\"* do so because they do not comprehend the wondrous precelestial Dao. Instead, they rely on visualization, talismans, and rituals to command spirits and ghosts, often inhaling the qi of yin gates and ghostly realms—these are called *\"ghost immortals.\"* Through unceasing accumulation of practice, they may extend their lifespan—thus it is said they *\"merely avert death\"* but cannot *\"revive further.\"* Though their bodies endure long life, if they cease practice even for a day, calamity will swiftly strike.\n\nThose who know the Dao yet do not practice it, and recklessly discuss it with others, are said to *\"frivolously recite this chapter\"*—their bodies will suffer misfortune. The *Inner Meaning* states: *\"The essence of the golden elixir lies entirely in diligent harmonization. Diligence ensures clarity; perseverance ensures success. First, be diligent in gathering; next, be vigilant in maintaining fullness. Await the completion of the crucible and the readiness of the medicine, then proceed with the talisman, advance the fire, adjust the mercury and lead, aligning the hours and seasons without error. Thus the qi of yin and yang will be sufficient, the pearl of Kan and Li will be round, the spirit will transform into truth, and one will attain long life and enduring vision.\"*\n\nIf, however, one is hasty in emotion and lazy in heart, acting recklessly and carelessly, missing the proper times and failing to align with the seasons, then *\"midwinter brings scorching heat, midsummer brings bitter frost; the maiden flees, the red dragon escapes.\"*\n\nOnce spirit and essence are lost, the golden elixir becomes unattainable; qi withers, the body weakens, and life perishes. Yet with reverent offerings and devout worship—honoring the perfected immortals and sacred masters day and night—coupled with steadfast cultivation and utmost sincerity, one’s dwelling flourishes outwardly while inwardly, body and mind attain tranquility. Every movement aligns with auspiciousness, and divine spirits guard the gate.\n\nMaster Gaoxiang Xian, pondering the truth day and night, unknowingly ascended in soul to the Jade Capital. The Celestial Emperor, moved by his devotion, commanded the Lady of Western Florescence, the Great Unity, to reveal the secret of the golden elixir. Its verses declare:\n\n*\"Qian and Kun are the gates of yin and yang.\nThe Way of Qian is male; the Way of Kun is female.\nYet mortals know not true yin and yang,\nVainly seeking dragon and tiger across heaven and earth.\"*\n\nFrom this, one sees that the gates and dwelling reside within the self. This scripture is most sacred and peerless, unmatched in the Jade Capital.\n\nThe *Seven Lots of the Scriptural Teachings* states: *\"The Three Caverns embody the wondrous essence of the One Vehicle and the profound words of the Three Luminaries. Mastery leads the highest sages to ascend; awakening allows the loftiest perfected to transcend. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals reveal the finest exegesis of the supreme principle; jade tablets and golden writs guide the essential arts of returning to the origin. Moreover, this scripture crowns the Three Caverns, hence it is called peerless in the Jade Capital. From ancient times to the present, no immortal or perfected sage has ever attained realization without relying on it. Of the myriad methods and thousand gates, none lie beyond its scope. Vast and boundless, it defies description in words or thought.\"*\n\nIts ode proclaims:\n*\"The inner name is hidden, ineffable;\nThe positionless true one is uniquely revered.\nOnly by realizing the inner name may one receive its use,\nThen know eternal abiding through kalpas unending.\"*\n\nThe Dao states: *\"Whoever recites this scripture ten times shall summon all heavens to arrive. Countless generations of ancestors—bound spirits and suffering souls—shall all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace. After nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn, becoming noble beings. Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, shall all attain immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall likewise be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years and attain long life, later achieving the Way of corpse liberation. Though their souls temporarily dissolve, they shall not pass through hell but swiftly regain form, roaming the vast heavens. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings; all celestial and human realms receive its blessings. Immeasurable fortune arises, and the cycle of birth and death is graced with its favor. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted, offering gold and treasures, swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it. Those who lightly disclose or profane it shall bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to serve as ghost officials, attending the scripture under the Five Emperors, with twenty-four jade lads and maidens guarding the sacred text and protecting the recipient.\"*\n\nMaster Shangyangzi said: *\"Ten recitations complete the number, signifying the scripture’s merit is fulfilled and all heavens arrive.\"* The Perfected of Azure Origin stated: *\"Countless generations of ancestors—parents and forebears from time immemorial, bound spirits and suffering souls long confined in darkness—shall all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace.\"*\n\nIn the southern cinnabar heavens lies the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, within which is the Vermilion Mound Prefecture, containing the Flowing Fire Court—the realm where refinement, transformation, and deliverance of immortals occur. Those who attain transcendence pass through this palace, undergoing the great forging of the Three Fires to purge the five impurities of form. The radiance of the King’s Eyes refines their qi and substance; the Yellow Flower’s waters wash away the corpse’s form. Then, inwardly nurturing the numinous true, they follow their karmic transformation to be reborn anew.\n\nThe refinement and deliverance follow three grades: scholars of the highest learning achieve deliverance in three years; those of middling wisdom, in nine; and the least learned, in twenty-four. The \"nine years of refinement\" refers generally to the middle grade, a worldly interpretation. In the practice of the Dao, one must seek it within the self.\n\nThe \"ten recitations\" correspond to the principle of the ten months; \"all heavens arriving\" signifies the myriad spirits merging into primordial unity. \"Countless generations of ancestors\" are the transient unions of parents; \"bound spirits and suffering souls\" are the turbid qi arising after embodiment. All are delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace—refining and transforming the turbid qi of transient unions, transcending into the realm of purity and radiant light, reborn as noble beings. This means refining the turbid qi of transient unions into yang spirit, transforming it into true qi, unifying the myriad spirits into one spirit and the myriad qi into one qi, nurturing the sacred embryo.\n\nScholars who reach this stage have attained wholeness of spirit and sufficiency of qi, prolonging life and attaining longevity. Yet this is not yet what may be called immortality. Only those who diligently study the scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, may attain the rank of immortals. To truly speak of immortality, one must cultivate both inner work and outer conduct. Inner work is the Way of fire timing and embryo liberation, the path of spirit transformation. Outer conduct involves aiding others and benefiting beings, as seen in the examples of the Han Celestial Master discerning humans and ghosts, Master Ge delivering bound spirits, and Perfected Xu slaying dragons and demons.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"Though a scholar may uphold the Dao, without performing meritorious deeds, they cannot attain the Way. Only when the inner elixir is complete and outer conduct is cultivated shall merit be fulfilled and virtue perfected, allowing one to soar to the Golden Gates and roam the Jade Capital—this is no empty claim.\"*\n\nScholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall all be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. \"Scholars of the highest learning\" are those who hear the Dao and practice it diligently. As *Laozi* says: *\"The highest scholar, hearing the Dao, practices it diligently.\"* Diligence yields merit, leading to ascension to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years and attain long life, later achieving the Way of corpse liberation.\n\n\"Mortals\" refer to the common folk. Perfected Ziyang said: *\"The method of the great elixir is most simple and easy; even the foolish and ignorant may practice it and ascend to sagehood.\"* Corpse liberation takes four forms: the first is liberation by weapon, as when Ji Kang was executed in the marketplace or Huainan met his end in prison.\n\nThe second is liberation by literary means, as when Ciqing transformed his essence into shoes or Changfang borrowed form from bamboo. The third is liberation by water or fire, as when Feng Yi drowned in the great river or Fengzi was burned in the great tree. The fourth is seated liberation: though appearing dead, the feet do not turn blue, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes do not dim, and the limbs remain pliable at another’s touch. This is called \"Refining the Form in the Great Yin,\" where the flesh remains uncorrupted for over a hundred years before reviving as a living person.\n\n*The True Sayings* states: \"Those who achieve corpse-liberation as immortals cannot ride the flowered canopy, mount the dragon, or ascend to the Great Ultimate; they merely avoid death.\" Thus, it is said that the hun-soul and spirit temporarily vanish, bypassing hell, and swiftly regain form to roam the great void. Some explain that in corpse-liberation, the bones become lustrous and light, the essence and blood remain unchanged, and if the corpse is cast into famous mountains or great rivers, after a hundred years it transforms into pearls and jade.\n\nThis scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings; all heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings. Interpreted through the Dao, this scripture is the supreme treasure, the Golden Elixir. Its subtlety is the White Tiger, the Two Sevens. As Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: \"The Two Sevens gather and assist.\" Through the subtle power of this scripture, when followed, it gives life to beings; when reversed, it forms the elixir. It broadly saves the sentient and universally delivers the boundless. All heavenly and mortal beings—great cultivators—are like the two weights of gold and cinnabar, or the dual substances of dragon and tiger in the golden elixir, none fail to receive its blessings. Heavenly and mortal beings employ both method and medicine, thus all receive its blessings. When the scripture’s merit is complete and the elixir’s path is perfected, how could one merely receive the grace of long life for oneself? Even ancestors widely receive the favor of transcendence.\n\nThis is treasured by Heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. This is explained through worldly methods. Master Qingyuan said: \"When the perfected ascend to present their reports, they must recite this chapter in song.\" Heaven truly treasures and does not transmit it to the lower world. Only because later sagely rulers earnestly requested it to guard against the calamities of Jia and Shen did the sages pass it down through generations, excluding the common folk. Only the most refined scholars, offering gold and treasures as tokens of sincerity, pledging their hearts and swearing oaths to the heavens, may receive its transmission. Why? Because what people cherish most are gold and treasures. Gold is a substance of firmness and hardness; the Most High established this to make people relinquish what they love, breaking their stingy hearts, and through this offering, turn their minds toward devotion, demonstrating sincerity as firm as metal and stone. If lightly leaked or recklessly transmitted, calamity will extend to nine generations.\n\nWhen serving this scripture, the Five Emperors, twenty-four Jade Boys, and twenty-four Jade Maidens attend—this is the Daoist interpretation. The scripture is the ancestral qi. The Five Emperors wondrously transform the qi of the Five Phases; the twenty-four maidens unite the inner and outer two luminaries, the true spirits and true qi, nourishing and protecting the elixir body, safeguarding those who receive the scripture to perfect the great elixir. Formerly, when Xu Jingsun refined the returning elixir, he moved the Emperor Above to dispatch five immortal boys wielding swords to descend to Jingsun, daily sparring with him, and later he achieved the Dao. Was this not to protect the body of one receiving the scripture?\n\nA verse says:\n*Heaven’s treasured scripture is not lightly passed,\nOnly those who receive it directly may ascend to Heaven.\nWhat value lies in offering gold as sincerity?\nThis scripture’s subtlety brings boundless fortune.*\n\nThe Dao states: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past lives’ souls and deliver them to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain immortality, with one’s name recorded in the heavens; the Yellow Register and White Slips erase death and inscribe life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture to secure the kingdom’s ruler, ministers, fathers and sons, stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve Heaven’s eternal existence, and ensure the lineage of rulers continues unbroken, ever reigning as sovereigns, pacifying their lands, with the people enjoying great peace.\n\nOn the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s life-destiny day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the hun-soul and spirit, eternally preserve the myriad qi, avoid suffering, radiate light from the body, receive the attendance of the Three Realms, the Five Emperors’ welcoming, the homage of myriad spirits, with one’s name inscribed in Heaven. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Upper Clarity.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: According to worldly methods, during the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture. The first month is the beginning of the year, the first of the four *meng* months, the month of the Heavenly Official’s Upper Prime grand celebration. Unwavering focus is called \"long,\" vigilant mindfulness is called \"fast\"—this is the long fast of the first month. Vocalizing aloud is called \"recitation,\" continuous chanting while walking or sitting is called \"chanting\"—this is reciting and chanting this scripture.\n\nMaster Qingyuan said: The first month is the beginning of the four starts, when Heaven and Earth communicate and all things renew. Riding the Heavenly Official’s examination standard, the long fast and scripture recitation deliver past lives’ souls, severing the suffering of earthly bonds and delivering them to the Southern Palace. In Daoist practice, this is the month of advancing the fire and gathering the medicine, all for the purpose of beginning inner cultivation.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: The first month belongs to *yin*. In elixir refinement and medicine gathering, *yin* and *shen* are the phases of rise and fall. *Yin* is the phase of yang’s arising; if one wishes to act at the *jia* hour, one must first guard at the *yin* hour, then apply at the *jia* hour. The long fast is purifying the mind; reciting the scripture is gathering qi. Purifying the mind and gathering qi is gathering the medicine. The souls of past lives are the accumulated yin qi within the body. Though yang qi arises from *zi*, one yang lies beneath five yins; by the *yin* hour, yin and yang are still intertwined, yin above and yang below, pent-up and not yet free—hence the term \"earthly bonds.\" By the *jia* hour, through the method’s steaming, yang qi vigorously rises and ascends into the *Li* Palace. Is this not severing earthly bonds and delivering to the Southern Palace? Thus, the scripture’s references to the Vermilion Palace, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, Vermilion Mound, or Southern Palace all denote the *Li* Palace.\n\nThe *Li* Palace corresponds to the *Kan* position, hence Master Zhang’s saying: \"Take the solid center from the *Kan* position and refine the yin within the *Li* Palace’s belly.\" By observing the long fast in the seventh month and reciting this scripture, one attains immortality. The seventh month belongs to *shen*, a time when yang lies concealed. To practice at the *geng* hour, one first guards at the *shen* hour; by the *geng* hour, mercury is set in motion to merge with lead, forming the treasure within the crucible—this is also called \"gathering the medicine\" or \"casting the crucible.\" As yang qi grows daily stronger, yin qi wanes. Pure yin is a ghost; pure yang, an immortal. When yang qi is robust, one gradually attains immortality. With practice complete and qi full, the spirit transforms and the embryo is released—thus the true person emerges, hence \"attaining immortality in body.\" Those who achieve the Dao have their names stricken from the registers of death in Fengdu and inscribed in the ledgers of immortality, receiving charts and registers, thereby ascending. Thus it is said: \"The heavens record names on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death to grant life.\"\n\nIn the tenth month, observe the long fast and recite this scripture. The *Inner Meaning* states: \"When the medicine is fully gathered and the crucible is cast to perfection, enter the chamber in the tenth month to harmonize spirit and qi. Beginning fifteen days before the winter solstice, fast and store the spirit within the kidneys—this is called 'fortifying the numinous root.' Thus, the root and origin are established, and spirit and qi arise together. The body is like a nation: the spirit is its lord, qi its minister. When spirit is full and qi abundant, the hundred bones are all ordered. The elixir is completed, the form is shed, and one attains long life and enduring vision. Bone and flesh ascend together, form and spirit unite in subtlety—just as the scripture declares.\"\n\nOn the days of the eight nodes, recite this scripture to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces. The eight nodes correspond to the eight trigrams. Entering the chamber to circulate the talisman and advance the fire, take the *zi* hour of the winter solstice as the starting point, storing the spirit in the kidneys. As the yang fire moves, the spirit follows in its wake. The kidneys are the root; the spirit chamber, the girdle. From root to girdle, root and girdle move in concert, forming the embryo and ripening the fruit. One cycle encompasses three hours: from *zi* to *chou*, from *chou* to *yin*, metal and fire press forward, returning to the spirit chamber, and the golden elixir gradually coalesces. This corresponds to the winter solstice and the beginning of spring, nodes governed by the *Kan* and *Gen* trigrams. By the *mao* hour, one bathes; by the *chen* hour, the fire advances. By *si*, metal and fire press forward, returning to the sea of marrow. This corresponds to the spring equinox and the beginning of summer, nodes governed by the *Zhen* and *Xun* trigrams. When the yang fire reaches its peak, at the *wu* hour, the talisman is circulated. From *wei* to *shen*, metal and water propel the movement, entering the chamber via the magpie bridge at the double pass, enclosing and securing the mysterious pearl. This corresponds to the summer solstice and the beginning of autumn, nodes governed by the *Li* and *Kun* trigrams. By the *you* hour, one bathes; by *xu* and *hai*, the talisman is circulated, and true qi returns to its source, as one yang revives. This corresponds to the autumn equinox and the beginning of winter, nodes governed by the *Dui* and *Qian* trigrams. The cycle repeats endlessly, condensing a year’s work into a single day to correspond with the eight nodes. All applications of yang fire and yin talismans return to the central palace to nurture the sacred embryo. After ten months, when qi is full and the treasure crucible’s work is complete, the embryo is released and the spirit transforms—this is the True Person.\n\nThe eight trigrams are arrayed in a circle, solid without and hollow within, with the elixir body residing at the center. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The eight trigrams are arrayed, and their images lie within.\" This is why one becomes a True Person of the Nine Palaces. In worldly custom, the days of the eight nodes are when the Great Unity’s Controller of Destiny, along with various officials, records the merits, transgressions, blessings, and faults of mortals. Merits are rewarded; faults, punished. On these days, reciting the scripture allows one to seize the opportunity for commendation and become a True Person of the Nine Palaces.\n\nOn one’s life-destiny day, recite this scripture to purify the hun-spirits and rectify the myriad qi, ensuring their enduring presence. The human body possesses three hun-spirits: one resides in the celestial offices, belonging to one’s natal constellation; one dwells in the earthly prison; and one abides within the body. The seven po-spirits constantly inhabit the body. The seven po-spirits cause confusion and indulgence, while the three hun-spirits delight in goodness. On one’s life-destiny day, the hun-spirits descend into the body to join the corpse, circulating in unbroken union. Thus, the living person remains peaceful, and calamities and illnesses do not arise. On this day, by purifying the body, one unites hun and po. The hun belongs to yang; the po, to yin. When yin and yang harmonize, the Dao’s qi descends within, the root of life is fortified, and the body is at peace.\n\nIf one’s form is befuddled by wine and lust, the hun-spirit, upon appearing, retreats seven paces from the body and cannot unite. Polluted and defiled, the hun departs. The seven po-spirits, unable to unite with the hun, grow ever more dominant, stirring and indulging their desires. If one is befuddled thrice and the hun cannot unite with the po, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the seven po-spirits commune with yin ghosts, fostering only lewd thoughts. The seven po-spirits each have names: Corpse Dog, Crouching Corpse, Sparrow Yin, Swallowing Thief, Flying Poison, Removing Filth, and Fetid Lung. Corpse Dog governs greed; Crouching Corpse, gluttony; Sparrow Yin, lust; Swallowing Thief, theft; Flying Poison, delusion; Removing Filth, corruption of goodness; and Fetid Lung, all afflictions. Because they are unwholesome, their names are likewise vile. If one’s thoughts are impure, they are drawn into depravity—indulging in wine and lust, wandering in dreams among evils, engaging in filthy and defiled conduct, lost in confusion and excessive sleep, depleting essence and exhausting spirit, dissipating qi and multiplying illness, vexing and disturbing until death—while they, by contrast, find ease.\n\nWhen on one’s life-destiny day one diligently cultivates goodness, recites scriptures, and practices the Dao without weariness, advancing without retreat, so that one’s virtuous deeds reach heaven—then, as the scripture promises, when merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends in flight. In Master Xu’s *Method of the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Scripture for Delivering Humanity*, there are ten \"Do Nots Forget.\" The most essential is \"Do not forget firmness and purity.\" Firmness means having resolve and not indulging in lewdness; purity means maintaining precepts and not craving food and drink. Avoiding lewdness prevents harm to body and spirit; abstaining from gluttony prevents the taking of lives.\n\nThus, those who indulge in wine and lust while reciting scriptures and discoursing on the Dao commit the gravest transgression. These are but worldly interpretations of the Dharma. Yet if one speaks of the application of the Dao, there lies a wondrous principle.\n\nThe day of one’s life-destiny is the day of gathering the medicine and entering the chamber; it is the day of returning to the origin and reverting to the root; it is the day of returning to the foundation and restoring life. Therefore, within a year, there is only this one day; within this day, only one hour; within this hour, merely two *ke*. This is the method of gathering the clan. One condenses the seventy-two seasonal nodes into a single day, clusters the thirty-six thousand breaths of primordial qi into one hour—each hour encompassing six nodes, yet only two are used for reciting scriptures and refining the elixir. Thus, within that hour, four nodes remain, reserved for other wondrous applications, transmitted only in secret teachings. Such is the day of one’s life-destiny.\n\nMaster Peng said: At first, there is no form or substance, as in the primordial chaos of *hongmeng*. Once the fire is kindled and the talismans are activated, the first year of cultivation begins to flourish—this is the day of one’s life-destiny, the inception of receiving qi. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"At the capping and marriage, qi intertwines; in the first year, the sprout flourishes.\" The *Inner Meaning* says: \"When the fire’s timing is complete, the way of shedding the mortal coil and transforming the spirit is achieved.\" The sacred embryo resides within the sea of marrow, with a cycle of sixty days; the life-destiny completes one revolution to match the number of the celestial cycle. Suddenly, like the crack of thunder, the Gate of Heaven splits open, the sacred embryo emerges, the mortal husk is shed, and one becomes an immortal—attaining eternal life. The Demon Kings bear witness, the hosts of heaven welcome, merit is fulfilled, virtue is exalted, and ascension awaits.\n\nLi Changling said: \"Merit is the practice of daily conduct; virtue is the renewal of each day.\" If one is as earnest as a farmer awaiting the harvest, as diligent as a merchant amassing wealth—accumulating virtue today, piling merit tomorrow—then the three hundred virtues of an Earth Immortal may be completed in a single year, and the one thousand three hundred virtues of a Heavenly Immortal in four years. Yet though many begin the practice, most falter midway, for their resolve is not steadfast.\n\nThe Purple Void Primordial Sovereign said: Master Fu, from youth, loved the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao for seven years, where he suddenly encountered the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, who bestowed upon him a wooden drill and bade him bore through a millstone. The master warned: \"When the stone is pierced, I shall deliver you.\" The stone was over five feet thick, yet Fu drilled without cease. After forty-seven years, the stone was suddenly pierced through, and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One indeed came to deliver him. Such was the utmost firmness of his resolve—how much more so for those who recite scriptures and practice the Dao with diligence!\n\nA hymn says:\n*For three months, maintain the fast and chant this scripture,*\n*The host of heaven’s sages shall inscribe your name.*\n*Though men know the day of life-destiny for chanting scriptures,*\n*In daily practice, they act in folly.*\n\nThe Dao teaches: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, observe abstinence, enter the chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart. Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, inwardly and outwardly shrouded in mist. Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber; a radiant halo appears above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all must be vividly perceived.\n\nThe secret incantation says:\n*Tanluo Yuluo, Fuwu Sutuo.*\n*Great Thoroughfare, Supreme Ultimate,*\n*Yin Heart—no wine, no lust,*\n*Change garments, burn incense,*\n*Recite scriptures, practice goodness,*\n*Sit without sleep, Yang envelops Harmony.*\n*Exiting existence, entering non-existence,*\n*Entering life, exiting death.*\n*Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom,*\n*Transformations arise naturally.*\n*Primordial Hunqi, Mystery within Mystery.*\n*Above, it reaches the End; below, it penetrates the Great Abyss.*\n*Recite once, and chronic illness heals itself.*\n*Refine the hun-soul, bathe the po-soul,*\n*True Yang is preserved whole.*\n*Observe abstinence, perform rites, recite—*\n*Ten thousand repetitions, and one ascends as an immortal.*\n*This supreme secret incantation grants an enduring mandate.*\n*Recite the heart incantation again:*\n*Tanluo reveals the light.*\n*Jade Clarity, Supreme Pole,*\n*Brahma qi suffuses and steams.*\n*Dispense the numinous, spread the qi,*\n*Bestow and infuse the body.*\n*Form and spirit both wondrous,*\n*Merge with the Dao and become true.*\n*This servant attains the Dao,*\n*Seven ancestors ascend as immortals.*\n*Like golden statutes, they descend,*\n*Commanding the ten thousand spirits.*\n*Hasten! As the Law of the Primordial Mystery and the Mystic Capital decrees.*\n\nThe Most High Primordial Supreme Lord of the Dao summons from this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officers—thirty-two each. They are to relay the words spoken today: a day of auspicious celebration, a hall of purity and fasting, the cultivation of this supreme scripture, the deliverance of boundless beings, the turning of the scriptures to receive rebirth. May the prayers ascend directly to the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens before the august throne.\n\nAfterward, draw qi thirty-two times and recite the scriptures facing east.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This scripture truly reveals the essence of cultivation and demonstrates the truth of the ancestral qi. Thus, it speaks of \"the day of practicing the Dao\" rather than \"the day of reciting scriptures,\" for one must know: the scripture is the elixir, the elixir is the Dao, and the Dao is the scripture. Without the Dao, the scripture does not emerge; without the scripture, the elixir does not emerge; without the elixir, the Dao is not accomplished. This is an immutable principle, with no alternative path. Here, the application of the Dao and the worldly Dharma are expounded together.\n\nThere are two kinds of practicing the Dao: internal and external. First, the external practice: bathing, observing abstinence, solemnly arranging the altar, burning incense, reciting scriptures, pacing the void, and offering morning and evening praises—this is the external practice of the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Primordial Sovereign of the Eastern Sea said: Using five-fragrance water and reciting incantations to wash the body is the great external bathing in Brahma qi, which circulates through the ten directions. Internally, it harmonizes the five qi and unites the hundred spirits—this is internal bathing.\n\nAbstinence does not merely mean refraining from meat and impurity; one must first sever lustful desires. Only then can the heart be aligned to avert misfortune, and the nature be restrained to dispel calamity.\n\nEntering the chamber means entering stillness, free from worldly dust, with body and mind wholly concentrated—thus may one commune with the divine spirits. The east is the direction of long life, where one summons the qi of generation; the method of knocking the teeth: the left is the Heavenly Bell, the right the Heavenly Chime, to summon the immortals. The center is the Heavenly Drum, used to offer morning praises to the Most High. Heart-bowing means the body remains unmoving while the mind is wholly intent on reverence. Closing the eyes means withdrawing vision to gaze inward, so that qi settles into profound stillness.\n\nAzure is the qi of the Mysterious One, yellow the qi of the Primordial One, white the qi of the Original One. The significance of these three colors is drawn from the Three Pure Ones. Sitting in meditation upon them, the divine numina will naturally appear. Inner visions and outer realms merge in misty oneness.\n\nNext, visualize the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver and residing on the left; the White Tiger emerging from the lungs and residing on the right; the Vermilion Bird emerging from the heart and residing in front; the Dark Warrior emerging from the kidneys and residing behind. Visualize six lions and six cranes emerging from the six bowels, dividing left and right.\n\nThe left eye transforms into the solar orb, radiating nine layers of purple-red light; the right eye transforms into the lunar orb, radiating seven layers of yellow-white light. These orbs stand three feet from the body, their brilliance resplendent, shining into the nose, passing through the back of the brain, entering the Golden Flower Palace, and coalescing into a wheel of light as large as a chariot wheel. The three colors—azure, yellow, and white—intermingle within it, forming the Nine-Colored Round Image. With this radiance, illuminate the ten directions, then recite the preceding esoteric incantation. \"Esoteric\" means not vocalizing aloud. After the incantation, perform the closing announcement as before.\n\nOnce the closing announcement is complete, face east and sit upright. Visualize the four spirit-beasts and other gods emerging from within the body, arrayed before you to listen to the Dharma and hear the scriptures. Then recite aloud with resonant clarity, without straying thoughts, idle conversation, or interrupting the scriptural recitation. As if before a sovereign or father, allow no trace of negligence—strive to achieve thorough resonance with Heaven. This is the external practice of the Dao, the natural course of worldly methods.\n\nIf one practices the internal Dao, however, it becomes the application of the Dao. The matter is entirely distinct—why? When ordinary people read scriptures, they merely read through them without realizing that the scripture itself is a great practice, teaching one to follow the Dao within it. Thus, it is called the day of practicing the Dao, not the day of reading scriptures. In refining the internal elixir, there is the work of entering the chamber and applying effort, hence it is called entering the chamber facing east, not ascending the altar. Ascending the hall refers to the teachings of refining the returning elixir.\n\nNow, the scripture is reverence. The Heavenly Worthy expounds the scriptures to enable the foolish to know where to return. Reverence inclines the heart toward goodness, prevents wrongdoing, and through storing spirit and nurturing qi, one may avoid disaster. If one recites without bathing, observing abstinence, or changing garments before entering the chamber, one will instead invite misfortune and condemnation. Yet if a superior person or perfected being practices the Dao within the scripture, it is called the day of practicing the Dao. The scripture is the Dao, and the Dao is the elixir—only in refining the elixir does the matter of entering the chamber arise, hence it is called entering the chamber facing east.\n\nIn refining the returning elixir, one must first refine the self and stabilize the mind, hence the term \"bathing.\" A person of the Dao first severs desires, hence the term \"abstinence.\" The foolish, unaware of this, merely recite loudly without understanding. What is practicing the Dao? It is refining the returning elixir. What is the returning elixir? It must be taught by a master. Thus, the Perfected One of Pure Yang said: \"Without a master’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know.\" Laozi said: \"I am not a sage; I obtained this through learning.\" Therefore, to learn the elixir, one must first seek a master and not recklessly speculate.\n\nHaving received the master’s transmission, one must first refine the self. What is refining the self? It is eliminating desires and nurturing essence and qi. Thus, Pure Yang said: \"First refine the self and await the time.\" Having refined the self, one must find a fellow practitioner to serve as external protection. Liu Haichan said: \"This matter is no ordinary matter; seeking a person, one has not yet found the right person.\" Chen Ninwan said: \"Without like-minded companions to guide one, when awakened, one may fear the fire-timing in the crucible is amiss.\"\n\nHaving found a companion, first seek the furnace and cauldron. The *Awakening to Reality* states: \"First take Qian and Kun as the furnace and vessel; next, gather the Crow and Hare as the medicine to refine.\" Having obtained the furnace and cauldron, then select the day. What is selecting the day? The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"When lead encounters the birth of Gui, one must swiftly gather it.\" He also said: \"When the sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite.\" This is the meaning.\n\nHaving obtained the day, one must also obtain the hour. Then proceed with the hexagram qi. Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says: \"Take the solid center of the Kan position and transform the yin within the Li palace.\" Therefore, knocking the teeth thirty-two times and bowing thirty-two times corresponds to the sixty-four hexagrams. Closing the eyes in still contemplation—Master Boyang said: \"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be closed and not allowed to leak.\" The Perfected One dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass within.\n\nSitting amidst the azure, yellow, and white clouds of qi—my master Yuanduzi said: \"The primordial qi of the prior Heaven comes from the realm of emptiness and non-being. Azure qi is mercury, white qi is lead, and yellow qi is earth. Before mercury and lead unite, they rely on earth to combine them.\" The *Preface by Purple Yang* states: \"Pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the palace of non-being, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images. When the dragon intones and the tiger roars, husband and wife follow in succession, then one knows the inner and outer merge in misty oneness, the four beasts arrayed, the sun and moon shining brightly, illuminating the chamber within. A wheel of light appears above the nape—so vividly clear.\"\n\nThe esoteric incantation refers to the great sound that is soundless. This is called practicing the Dao, this is called reciting scriptures, this is called the inner and outer two visions. Once the elixir is refined, then perform the closing announcement, and the hun and po within the body will all transform into spirits.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe work of entering the chamber severs deluded emotions,\nReciting scriptures and practicing the Dao—begin cultivation early.\nIt is said that the Jade Maiden first makes the announcement,\nThen one ascends through the thirty-two heavens in sequence.\n\nThe *Supreme Esoteric Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, First Scroll* concludes.\n\n*The Supreme Esoteric Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery, Middle Scroll*\nCommentary by Chen Guanwu of Shangyang\n\nShangyangzi states: \"Scripture\" is the Dao, and it is reverence. The Dao is to be honored in practice, and reverence is to be upheld without lapse. The world knows what to revere: the Three Treasures. These Three Treasures are indeed the essence of the wondrous Dao. Explained through the Dao’s function, they are called the Three Treasures within the body; explained through worldly dharma, they are called the Three Treasures within the teachings. Regarding the Three Treasures within the body, there are two matters. Regarding the Three Treasures within the teachings, there are two interpretations.\n\nHere, the Three Treasures within the teachings are the Dao, the scriptures, and the master. There are two interpretations: the present canon and the ancient canon. The Dao is the primordial qi of the Mysterious Unity of Primordial Beginning, which gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings—this is the Treasure of the Dao. The scriptures are the teachings expounded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord from the Dao of the Mysterious Unity of Primordial Beginning, serving as the ladder and raft for all ages—this is the Treasure of the Scriptures. The master is Lord Lao, who descended to bestow the scriptures and registers upon Heavenly Master Zhang, transmitting the teachings through the world—this is the Treasure of the Master. The origin and transmission of the teachings truly follow the Heavenly Master, yet there are also two interpretations. Thus, the Three Treasures of the earlier canon are called the present canon, while those of the later canon are called the ancient canon, and their designations differ.\n\nThis is the worldly method of transforming customs. If speaking of the Dao’s function, then it is the Three Treasures within the body, which also comprise two matters. The essence of the Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Unity and utmost perfection is called the Heavenly Treasure, also known as the Treasure of the Dao. The precelestial qi of the Golden Liquor of Supreme Clarity is called the Numinous Treasure, also known as the Treasure of the Scriptures. The spirit of the Primal Chaos and the Ultimateless is called the Spirit Treasure, also known as the Dharma Treasure. Without these Three Treasures within the body, one cannot return the elixir, cannot become a buddha, cannot attain immortality. The *Great Golden Book of the Three Treasures* states that the Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Spirit Treasure all transform through qi—these are also the Three Treasures within the body.\n\nIf discussing the Dao of the golden liquor and returning the elixir, then the Three Treasures within the body have two further interpretations: spirit, qi, and essence are the inner Three Treasures, while the ears, eyes, and mouth are the outer Three Treasures. If one honors the outer Three Treasures and does not act recklessly, then the inner Three Treasures will coalesce to form the returned elixir and nurture the fetal immortal. Thus, the true writs and precious talismans, the dragon scripts and phoenix seals, the jade tablets and golden books, the profound classics of the Three Caverns, and the thirty-six sections of eighteen thousand chapters all emerge from the Three Treasures—these are called scriptures. Therefore, scripture is the elixir, the primordial qi of the precelestial.\n\nThis *Scripture of Limitless Salvation* was expounded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord from the Dao of Primordial Beginning and transmitted to the Perfected of Mysterious Unity. The Perfected of Mysterious Unity transmitted it to the Heavenly Perfected August Person, who, following the Dao Lord’s transmission, inscribed it into scripture. Thus, each chapter begins with the words of the Dao, except for this chapter and the two chapters of the *Jade Calendar*, where the August Person directly inscribed the Dao of Primordial Beginning. Yet all derive from the Dao Lord’s transmission. Today, some mistakenly regard chapters with the words of the Dao as prefaces and those without as the scripture itself. To recite only the two chapters while omitting the preceding scripture is even more erroneous.\n\nThe title *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity* was bestowed by the August Person. This title, *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, was bestowed by the Dao Lord. Though the origins and transmissions of the scriptures differ, all scriptures emerge from the Dao Lord, and thus the Dao Lord is the Treasure of the Scriptures. The scriptures embody the Dao in practice, and the Dao functions through the scriptures. If discussing the golden liquor and returning the elixir, then the scriptures precede the elixir in practice, and the elixir follows the scriptures in function. Borrowing the scriptures to represent the elixir, it is called the *Precelestial Supreme Numinous Treasure Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir*. Borrowing the Dao to expound the scriptures, it is called the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe spirit, qi, and essence of Primordial Beginning’s precelestial,\nIts wondrous workings boundless, most numinous.\nTo save others and oneself, one must be saved by others—\nThe supreme elixir’s method is the wondrous scripture.\n\nThe primordial Cavernous Mystery, the original chapter of the Numinous Treasure,\nThe supreme wondrous beginning, ten cycles of salvation,\nA hundred demons concealed in rhyme, naturally converging and parting,\nThe crimson writ of the Chaotic Abyss—\nThe Ultimateless, the Supreme Perfected, the Primordial Beginning’s kalpas,\nGiving birth to all heavens, illuminating the Three Luminaries,\nThis is the root of heaven.\nAbove, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\nThe five writs unfold and expand, universally planting numinous spirits.\nWithout writ, there is no radiance; without writ, there is no illumination;\nWithout writ, there is no establishment; without writ, there is no completion;\nWithout writ, there is no salvation; without writ, there is no birth—\nThis is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven,\nThe Jade Capital of Yu Luo, the Supreme Capital of the Jade Mountain.\nUtmost above the utmost, the Great Canopy of Jade Clarity.\nVast kalpas stretch into the distance, as if absent, as if present.\nThe Three Flowers part, the wondrous court of Great Existence.\nGolden towers and jade chambers, the pure expanse of the forest of principles.\nThe great circulation of Brahmā qi revolves through the ten directions.\nWithin it are the spirits who save humanity, the deathless gods,\nWithin it is the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,\nWithin it is the Great God Sima who saves the world,\nWithin it is the Venerable Han Jun who cherishes life,\nWithin it are the exalted gods of the Southern Supreme who govern destiny, record deeds, extend life, increase years, and save from calamity—\nThey turn back bones and revive the dead, boundlessly saving humanity.\n\nToday, the collation is recorded. All heavens descend in attendance.\n\nThe Master of Supreme Yang says: This chapter is wholly the functioning of the Dao.\nThe Primordial Beginning—before the Great Ultimate divided—was the ancestral qi of prior heaven.\nThe Cavernous Mystery encompasses the three caverns’ profound secrets, the true source of the myriad methods.\nThe original chapter of the Numinous Treasure is essence, being, substance, the response of life, the root of the mysterious.\n*Laozi* says: There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth.\nThus it can generate things and generate humans.\nThe wondrous chief of the highest grade is life, non-being, function, the response of essence, the gate of the female.\nThe Perfected of Purple Yang says: The *White Tiger’s Chief Scripture* and the *True Scripture of Divine Water from the Flowery Pond* are supreme treasures, for they can generate buddhas and generate immortals.\n“Return” means to revert, to restore.\nIn scripture it is called “delivering people ten times”; in alchemy it is called “the ninefold return of golden elixir.”\nThis scripture stands as the crown of the Three Caverns precisely because of the word “deliver.”\nTo seek immortality or buddhahood, one must first understand the word “deliver,” only then can one restore this primordial yang true qi to congeal the returning elixir.\nThe hundred demons conceal their rhymes: the six roots entering perception, the three hun and seven po, the three divisions and eight scenes, the twenty-four spirits—those who do not know how to practice the Dao are all confounded by them, their mind-monarch led astray into the realm of desire, hence called the hundred demons.\nNow that one refines the great elixir, the hundred demons are subdued, no longer vexing or testing; separation and union occur naturally.\nFor although the Way of the returning elixir is called “having action,” it is not forced action.\nEvery separation and union arises from the natural workings of creation.\n*The Awakening to Reality* says: When the two things meet, essence and life unite; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil—this is it.\nThe *Crimson Text of Primal Chaos* is the original true nature, the indestructible primordial spirit.\nThe Perfected of Azure Prime says: The primordial is the root of the myriad things, established at the head of the great image, operating endlessly.\nThe beginning is the inception of the vague and indistinct, existing before the myriad transformations, uniquely honored and ever-changing.\nThe Cavernous Mystery is the profound vision of the One, transforming and delivering heaven and humanity.\nThe Numinous Treasure: in heaven it is numinous, in the world it is treasure.\nThe original chapter contains the foundation of cultivating truth and uniting with the Dao.\nThe highest grade alone attains the mysterious, expounding teachings with expedient means.\nThe wondrous chief is the chief of all wonders, the source of the myriad methods.\nHeaven and earth are empty and wondrous yet clear; yin and yang share the same wonder yet are pure.\nSun and moon contain wonder and shine; the five phases unite in wonder and are refined.\nThe myriad things are all wondrous and true.\n*The Inner Meaning* says: The wondrous chief of the highest grade is the golden liquid returning elixir, the crown of the supreme wondrous Dao.\n“Delivering people ten times” is the work of ten months, delivering the world to become immortals.\n“The hundred demons conceal their rhymes” is another name for the elixir.\n“Separation and union occur naturally” compares the interval between metal and wood, which can again merge; water and fire, which oppose each other, can again achieve harmony—naturally completing creation.\nThe *Crimson Text of Primal Chaos* is the original source of the myriad things, the true nature of all beings.\nThe ancestor of the one qi, the ancestor revered by the myriad spirits.\n*The Scripture of Western Ascent* says: The empty and non-being generates the natural; the natural completes the great Dao.\nAs for the Dao, it is formless and without substance, the one qi of prior heaven that transforms and generates the myriad things, the foundation of heaven and earth’s creation.\nThose who refine the golden elixir embody the workings of creation through emptiness and naturalness.\nThe true one qi of prior heaven is called “empty qi.”\nThe golden womb, born of the golden mother, serves as the foundation of the elixir.\nThis qi, before father and mother united, shared the same body with chaos, hence called “primal chaos.”\nAfter father and mother joined in essence, this qi responded and attached itself, called “yang essence.”\nIt is likened to silver ore, named “original spirit,” stored in the Palace of Earth, thus called “nature,” the original face.\nBefore birth it is called “yin metal”; after birth it is called “yang lead,” the mother of the five metals.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: Directly pointing to the spirit-root of heaven and earth, taking it as the ancestor of medicine; clearly showing the holy mother of yin and yang, using it as the foundation of the elixir.\nBefore heaven and earth’s chaos, this qi congealed into jade characters, hence called “crimson text.”\nIt is the supreme, unsurpassable, most true and wondrous Dao, thus called the “true of the non-being and non-non-being.”\nIn the primordial kalpa of the Primordial Beginning, the primordial qi of the various heavens was generated.\nThe beginning qi of the ancestral kalpa initially divided into three qi, generating the Three Heavens: the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Heaven of Yu Remainder, and the Heaven of Great Crimson.\nThe qi of the Three Heavens further divided into nine qi, generating the Nine Heavens: the Heaven of Beginning Azure, the Heaven of Azure Prime, the Heaven of Beginning Cinnabar, the Heaven of Great Cinnabar, the Heaven of Beginning Simplicity, the Heaven of Great Simplicity, the Heaven of Beginning Mystery, the Heaven of Great Mystery, and the Heaven of Azure Tenuity.\nThe Brahmā qi of the Nine Heavens further divided to generate the Nine Firmaments and Nine Heavens: the Heaven of Great Firmament Radiant Flowing Light and Pure Scenery, the Heaven of Azure Firmament Primordial True Treasure Radiance, the Heaven of Azure Firmament General Life Opening Spirit and Transmitting Dao, the Heaven of Crimson Firmament Great Peace Response and Transformation Dao Lord, the Heaven of Cinnabar Firmament Central Culmen Supreme Wondrous Empty Transformation, the Heaven of Jade Firmament Luminous Prime Majestic Virtue Shining Crystal, the Heaven of Jade Firmament Flying Azure Prime Pass Transmitting Salvation, the Heaven of Purple Firmament Conjoined Scenery Double Gates Transformation Body, and the Heaven of Divine Firmament Jade Purity Wondrous Scenery Great Existence.\nThe Brahmā qi of the Nine Firmaments further divided to generate the Nine Heavens below, namely the Nine Heavens of Spirit Generation:\n1. The Heaven of Southern Fragrance Immeasurable Abundance;\n2. The Heaven of Northwest Meditation Goodness Immeasurable Longevity;\n3. The Heaven of Eastern Brahmā Surveillance Prolonged Extension;\n4. The Heaven of Southwest Serene Constellation Tuṣita;\n5. The Heaven of Southeast Pāramitā Secret Joyous Non-Pride;\n6. The Heaven of Northern Cavernous Prime Transformation Response Sound;\n7. The Heaven of Western Numinous Transformation Brahmā Assistance;\n8. The Heaven of Northeast Lofty Emptiness Pure Brightness;\n9. The Heaven of Central Non-Thought Non-Knot Non-Attachment.\nBelow these, the Thirty-Six Heavens of Great Existence, Jade Purity, and Supreme Purity were generated, and below them the Four Heavens of Seed People.\nOne million three hundred fifty-eight thousand li below the Heavens of Seed People lie the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm.\n\nBeneath the Formless Realm, at a distance of three hundred sixty thousand *li*, lie the Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm. Within the Form Realm are six Heavens of Light Dust, six Heavens of Fine Dust, and six Heavens of Coarse Dust.\n\nBelow the Form Realm, at a distance of three hundred thousand *li*, lie the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm. Beneath the Desire Realm, five hundred twenty billion ten-thousand *li* distant, five hundred million heavens are transformed and generated, along with the Eight Round Worlds.\n\nAbove the Four Heavens of Seed People, the sun, moon, and stars are arrayed, governing and sustaining the myriad things—hence called the Three Luminaries of Illumination.\n\nHuman birth follows a similar pattern. Father’s essence and mother’s blood gather within the mother’s womb. Before essence and blood congeal, they resemble a pearl or dewdrop; after congealing, the fivefold form takes shape: the head and the four limbs. In males, the left kidney forms first, followed by the right Gate of Life. In females, the reverse occurs. The root of inherent nature continues the lineage between the two kidneys, and the wondrously transforming *qi* naturally arises. Next, the divine waters of the two pupils form above, followed by the generation of the five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, hundred vessels, sinews, bones, teeth, and hair. When *qi* is sufficient and the form is complete as metal, the fetus emerges from the womb.\n\nThus, Lord Lao said: \"Heaven and Earth unite their essence; yin and yang spread and transform. In the first month, it is the embryo—essence and blood congeal. In the second month, it is the fetus—form begins to take shape. In the third month, the yang spirit becomes the Three Hun, moving to give life. In the fourth month, the yin numen becomes the Seven Po, still to stabilize the form. In the fifth month, the Five Agents divide into the five viscera to settle the spirit. In the sixth month, the Six Pitches determine the six bowels to nourish the numen. In the seventh month, the Seven Essences open the seven orifices to convey radiance. In the eighth month, the Eightfold Splendor of the spirit is complete, descending with true numen. In the ninth month, palaces and chambers are arrayed to secure essence. In the tenth month, *qi* is sufficient, and the myriad images are complete.\"\n\nThus, when spirit spreads and *qi* fills the thirty-six thousand joints, the root-source and original beginning simultaneously generate the spirit. This is the transformation and generation of the myriad heavens, the Three Luminaries of Illumination—this is the Heavenly Root.\n\nThe *Fundamental Scripture* states: \"Only when the Dao attains three is it complete; thus, three unite to form virtue. If the Dao does not reach three, nothing can be accomplished.\" Internally, this refers to lead, mercury, and cinnabar. Directly pointing to the matter, it is our true nature, the wondrous transformations of daily use, and the union of yin and yang *qi* to form three. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is the body.\n\nThe *Scripture of Lord Lao’s Transformation of the Barbarians* states: \"The Dao is the primordial *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. Heaven and Earth follow it to generate the myriad things, which rely upon it for form—all are the wondrous transformations of the ancestral *qi*. In the Dao, this is called the Golden Elixir; thus, it is said, 'Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is the body.'\"\n\nThe Five Scripts open and expand, universally planting the divine numen. In the Elixir, the One *Qi* returns and transforms to generate the Five Agents; when the Five Agents are complete, the Golden Embryo forms. In the scriptures, the Jade Characters emerge and coalesce into the Red Script; when the Five Scripts are complete, they plant the divine numen.\n\nThe Five Agents are lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth. Heaven One generates water, and within Kan (☵) lies lead. Earth Two generates fire, and within Li (☲) cinnabar is produced. Heaven Three generates wood, and within Zhen (☳) the dragon governs mercury. Earth Four generates metal, and within Dui (☱) the tiger embodies silver. Heaven Five generates earth, and within the Central Palace the Elixir coalesces.\n\nThe Dao is not illuminated without these; the scriptures are not clarified without these; the body is not established without these; the Elixir is not completed without these; *qi* is not transcended without these; the medicine is not generated without these—this is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven. The Great Brahmā is the primordial *qi* congealed, with the Five Agents fully prepared. The Heaven within Heaven means there is a body within the body.\n\nYu Luo Xiao Terrace is the region of the brain. Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is the Muddy Pellet. The Utmost Supreme is the Great Canopy of Jade Purity and Supreme Mystery above the Muddy Pellet. Within the Supreme Mystery lies a secret mechanism called the High Ascent of Sun and Moon—the essential method for spirit transformation and shedding the embryo.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Ascending the sun and moon, I attain the Dao above, and behold the Jade Purity of Emptiness and Nothingness, the Ancient One.\" Vast and immeasurable, most high and most revered, it is as if absent, as if present. Thus, Master Zhang said: \"Gazing upon it, one cannot see its form; yet when calling it, it responds with the Three Flowers.\"\n\nLi (☲) corresponds to the crown of the head, belonging to the south. The south is originally the number three; the crown is the Flower Canopy, also called the Round Canopy. The south belongs to Li, and Li is the position of *wu* (午). The Three Flowers are Golden Flower, Jade Flower, and Ninefold Flower. When the Inner Elixir has coalesced, the crown bears the Three Flowers.\n\nThe Great Wondrous Court is the Upper Cinnabar Field—the cavity where the hundred passages converge. The Golden Gate and Jade Chamber: the Sun Palace is the Golden Gate, the left eye; the Moon Palace is the Jade Chamber, the right eye. The Forest of Stars refers to the constellations. It speaks of the sun, moon, and stars arrayed, and the nine orifices of the body becoming clear and luminous.\n\nThe Great Flowing Brahmā *Qi* is the wondrous primordial *qi*. \"Circulating through the ten directions\" describes the wondrous *qi* nourishing and protecting the Golden Embryo’s divine chamber, warming and nurturing the Great Elixir. The above are brief annotations of Daoist practice. There are yet more wondrous subtleties, which must be transmitted heart-to-heart.\n\nOnce the inner landscape is revealed, the outer landscape must also be understood. Now, I further explain in terms of worldly methods, so that the wise and foolish alike may each possess eyes and vision.\n\nThe Red Script of Primal Chaos emerges from the *qi* of primordial chaos congealing into the Red Script. Once the script emerges, the wondrous scriptures circulate. When the wondrous scriptures circulate, the ancestral *qi* resides within the human body, dispersing into the categories of things—this is called the Supreme Truth of No-Nothingness.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning transformed and generated the myriad heavens through the great kalpas. The Primordial Beginning, as the ancestor of the Dao, governs the great kalpas and, with the ancestral *qi*, transforms and generates the myriad heavens. The ancestral *qi* divides into the Three *Qi*, which belong to the Three Pure Realms of the Great Canopy. Thus, it is called the Three Luminaries of Illumination.\n\nKnow that this *qi* remains unharmed even through great kalpas—hence, it is called the Heavenly Root. This *qi* is the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate, which generates Heaven and Earth, the Five Agents, and the myriad beings. Thus, it is said, \"Above, there is no further ancestor.\" The Dao within the human body is like the *qi* within Heaven and Earth; thus, it is said, \"Only the Dao is the body.\"\n\nWhen the Crimson Zhangli stands, the Five Patterns unfold and expand; when the scriptural Dharma is practiced, spiritual beings are universally planted. Without scriptural texts, there can be no illumination, no establishment, no self-deliverance. This scripture, self-generated, is the Great Brahma, the sound of the highest rank, the Heaven within Heaven—it is the sacred realm of the Three Pure Ones within the Great Canopy. \"Great\" means it covers the myriad heavens; \"Canopy\" means it encompasses the Three Realms. Within it lies the Jade Capital Mountain, eighty thousand *li* in circumference, standing opposite Kunlun below. The mountain bears the Terrace of Lush Radiance, upon which rests a Seven-Treasures City. Above, beyond all bounds, stands the Jade Pure Palace, and further, the Three-Flowered Palace of Detached Convenience, the Great Wondrous Court—all places where the Heavenly Worthies repose and rest. Golden towers and jade chambers, jasper pools and emerald waters, arrayed in solemn order, all depend on the revolving circulation of Brahma-*qi* to endure and persist eternally. Within this realm dwell the spirits who deliver people from death—these are the emanations of the Primordial Beginning. The Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Great Emperor of Vermilion Numinosity, governs the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure and oversees the affairs of fire refinement. The Lord of World-Deliverance presides over the transformations of the Nine Hundred and Six Yang calamities. The Lord Sima oversees the eradication of evil and the repelling of trials. The Lord of Good Life, also known as the alternate name of Azure Florescence, presides over the verification and assessment. Lord Han oversees the ranks and studies of the disciples of Southern Prosperity. The Lords of Life and Record govern merit and transgression, bestowal and deprivation, extending lifespan and augmenting destiny. The Venerable Spirit of Deliverance from Tribulation presides over the pacification of calamities and the reversal of death. The Lord oversees the ascension and deliverance of the dead, raising the flying corpses to the dawn. Now, as the Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dharma and descends to the imperial terrace, examining charts and reviewing records, assessing and delivering disciples—it is as if the human body were no different from the Jade Capital. Golden towers and jade chambers, cinnabar fields and muddy pellets, arrayed in profound order: when the *qi* of the body’s spirits is full, the spirit of immortality dwells within, just as the Brahma-*qi* of the Jade Capital revolves without decay.\n\nThe ode says:\nOn Jade Capital Mountain’s Terrace of Lush Radiance,\nThe highest scriptures expound ten cycles.\nUniversally planting spiritual beings, the Brahma-darkness moves,\nThe Three Flowers detach, the Five Lines unfold.\n\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless East, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless South, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless West, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless North, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Northeast, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Southeast, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Southwest, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Northwest, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Above, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance;\nThe Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Boundless Below, Great Saints of Longevity and Immeasurable Deliverance—\nThe Perfected Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the Ten Directions, Great Spirits of Longevity and Immeasurable World-Deliverance,\nAll ride upon flying clouds, cinnabar chariots and green carriages,\nFeathered canopies and jasper wheels,\nDrawn by vermilion phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons,\nBearing nine-colored standards and ten mystic banners.\nAhead, nine phoenixes roar in unison;\nBehind, eight simurghs sing in harmony.\nLions and white cranes chant in melodious chorus,\nWhile the Five Elders clear the path and the host of immortals flank the procession.\n\nMyriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void,\nTheir radiant light turned back, they oversee the perfected and deliver the living.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi says: The Flying Heavenly Great Saints of the Ten Directions are all emanations of the Primordial Dao’s qi. Their taboo names are:\nEast: Zong\nSouth: Fei\nWest: Yun\nNorth: Wujing\nNortheast: Fan\nSoutheast: Nayu\nSouthwest: Duxian\nNorthwest: Jueqi\nAbove: Ying\nBelow: Luo\n\nThey are also called the Ten Directions’ Great Saints of Longevity, or the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering. By the mandate of the Primordial Beginning, they govern the weighing of merits and virtues across the Ten Directions and Three Realms, opening deliverance to the boundless, encompassing life and death, and refining the adepts.\n\nThe *Hidden Canon* records that in the heavens of the Eight Directions, there exist Boundless Great Thousandfold Worlds:\nThe Boundless Heavens of the East hold the Great Thousandfold World of Nadatangxiang, the Realm of Gathering Goodness;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the South hold the Great Thousandfold World of Wanlichengjing, the Realm of Forsaking the Worthy;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the West hold the Great Thousandfold World of Futangzhou, the Realm of Universal Conduct;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the North hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yudanye, the Realm of Purity;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Northeast hold the Great Thousandfold World of Fujidu, the Realm of Eternal Peace;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Southeast hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yuanfutian, the Realm of Employing the Worthy;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Southwest hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yanfuxiang, the Realm of Benevolent Stillness;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Northwest hold the Great Thousandfold World of Fudeye, the Realm of Extending Worthiness;\nThe Upper Heavens of Supreme Purity’s Jade Perfection hold the Thirty-Six Heavens of Xuandu, the Boundless World;\nThe Lower Heavens of Huangzeng hold the Thirty-Two Heavens of Bayuan, the Boundless World.\n\nThe boundless great spirits oversee the affairs of attaining the Dao, longevity, and world-deliverance.\n\nThe Perfected of Azure Origin says: Chariots, wheels, and canopies are formed from the qi of yang essence; phoenixes, cranes, dragons, and simurghs are transformations of the qi of yin essence. The perfected saints, possessing the constant Dao, harmonize their breath—gathering and dispersing at will, manifesting as they please. The harmony of yin and yang qi resembles song and melody, all wrought by qi, not external things. When a person’s returning elixir is complete, the yin demons are also transformed into yang spirits. With a single breath of primordial qi, the myriad spirits all heed; the spirits of the five viscera each appear in their directional colors. The chariots, carriages, and retinue come to welcome, the hundred bones’ host of spirits lead the way, and the following ascent to the Primordial is no different.\n\nThe Five Elders who clear the path are:\nThe Azure Spirit Elder of the East, surnamed Guan, taboo name Kai, style Lingweiyang;\nThe Cinnabar Spirit Perfected Elder of the South, surnamed Dongfu, taboo name Jiyan, style Chibiaonu;\nThe Primordial Spirit Primordial Elder of the Center, surnamed Tongban, taboo name Yuanshi, style Hanzhuniu;\nThe Radiant Spirit August Elder of the West, surnamed Shangjin, taboo name Changkai, style Yaopobao;\nThe Dark Spirit Mysterious Elder of the North, surnamed Heijie, taboo name Linghui, style Yinhouju.\n\nThe Great Saints of the Ten Directions, exalted in their Dao rank, thus evoke the Five Elders to clear the path while the host of immortals flanks the procession. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void—yet all are the divine bodies of the Dharma.\n\nThe *Elixir Canon* states: The spirit rides the qi, and the qi abides in form. Their radiant light turned back, jade light and flying clouds swirl around the Dharma-throne of the Heavenly Worthies, leading and overseeing the assembly of perfected, assessing and delivering the ranks of lords. In alchemical terms, “turning back the radiant light” signifies the completion of the Kan-Li union, the intercourse of yin and yang, the transformation and birth of the true spirit, and the nurturing of the embryo chamber—hence, “overseeing the perfected and delivering the living.”\n\nA hymn says:\nThe Heavenly Perfected of the Boundless gather in the Palace of Medicines,\nCinnabar and simurgh carriages ride the floating void.\nTurning back the radiant light, the host of immortals rejoices—\nYang grows, yin wanes: the wondrous work of transformation.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Heavens, the Supreme Palace of Nanchang, the Recorder Han, the Great Spirit Who Oversees Life—holding registers and grasping ledgers, they all arrive before the Emperor. According to whom deliverance is due, they strictly assess the heavens. Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Boundless Spirit Regions, the Yellow Springs’ courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources: the ancestors and forebears of a thousand kalpas, the kin of countless eons—swiftly erase their ledgers of sins, sever their roots of evil, and forbid their detention or coercion into ghostly throngs. By the talismanic mandate of the Primordial Beginning, they ascend in due time. From the Cold Pool of the Northern Capital, their forms and souls are escorted, demons restrained, and merits protected—delivered to the Southern Palace for ranking. The souls of the dead undergo refinement and transform into immortals; the living who receive deliverance endure through kalpas, everlasting. Through kalpas they revolve, their years equaling Heaven’s. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Supreme Purity.\n\nThe Heaven of Supreme Purity is the Realm of the Heavenly Emperor’s Jade Perfection, the Formless Realm of Brahma-conduct.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi says: This Dao employs both the methods of the Dao and the principles of the world—both must be understood.\n\nIn worldly terms:\nThe Chancellors of the Heavens—each heaven has its chancellor, also called the Great Luo Divine Duke. Nanchang is the world of the Cinnabar Heaven; the Supreme Palace is the Scarlet Numinous Fire Mansion. The Venerable One of the Han Bureau is the Controller of Destiny. He oversees the affairs of refining and delivering the records. The Recorder is the celestial minister who assists the Heavenly Emperor in recording. The Office of Registers oversees the forging of souls. When the Most High expounds the scriptures, each holds their ledgers and arrives before the Emperor to assess those due for deliverance. Some are destined by their names in the Mysterious Register or their bone configurations for immortality; others accumulate merits through cultivation, observance of precepts, or reverence for the Three Treasures, their good deeds piercing Heaven; still others make offerings to the masters and treasures, praised by the Three Offices. Those whose names are in the heavens undergo strict examination and assessment, their merits measured and ranks determined—according to their excellence, they receive ascent and deliverance.\n\nIn Daoist terms:\nHolding registers and grasping ledgers, the qi of the Primordial Beginning divides, and yin and yang separate; the Three Powers are established, and the records arise. The *Inner Meaning* states: Manifesting in benevolence, they become ledgers; concealed in function, they become yin and yang. Without ledgers in the hidden and manifest, how could merits and sins be recorded? Without yin and yang in Heaven and Earth, how could creation be accomplished? Thus, the Emperor’s presence is the divine chamber of the Central Palace, where the Emperor resides—all seas converge like spokes to a hub, where spirits abide—all qi coalesces in harmony.\n\nJust as yin and yang converge within the Central Palace’s divine chamber, so it is said: grasping ledgers and holding registers, all arrive in unison before the Emperor. The Heavenly Worthy’s scriptural teachings are no empty words—they urge people to practice the Way.\n\nThose who cultivate and study must first correct their faults and turn toward goodness, uphold precepts and guard against lust, abandon deceit and still their scheming, purify the heart and reduce desires. Alas! Worldly people chase the trivial and forget the fundamental, devalue life and treat the body lightly. The heroic and bold are enslaved by fame and merit; the wise and exceptional are shackled by ambition; the well-clothed and well-fed are trapped by their schemes; the poor and destitute are burdened by their bodily needs. Even those who leave the dusty world, delighting in ease and comfort, mistakenly believe that emptiness and non-action alone constitute cultivation—how could they ever attain the convergence of yin and yang within the divine chamber?\n\nAs for those who are to be delivered, the Way of the Golden Elixir demands true effort, and rewards follow according to merit. With ten parts effort comes ten parts reward; even a single lapse yields a corresponding deficiency. Though one’s practice may be most secret and one’s deeds unknown, in the vast Heaven of Great Purity, all is strictly examined and recorded.\n\nA universal proclamation is issued to the Three Realms—the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm—as well as to the Three Realms of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The boundless divine homeland, the ten directions’ infinite worlds, are also the divine courts of the Three Realms, the bureaus of the Temple of the Yellow Springs. In the north lies the great sea, where the viscera spirits manifest in colors corresponding to their directions.\n\nChariots and carriages, ceremonial guards come to welcome; the myriad spirits of the body lead the way, followed by ascension to audience with the Primordial. This is no different. The Five Elders open the path: in the east, the Azure Spirit First Elder, surnamed Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang; in the south, the Cinnabar Spirit True Elder, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chibiao Nu; in the center, the Primordial Spirit Primordial Elder, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Hanzhu Niu; in the west, the Radiant Spirit August Elder, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopo Bao; in the north, the Five Spirits Mysterious Elder, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled Yinhou Ju.\n\nThe great sages of the ten directions, whose Dao-ranks are most exalted, move the Five Elders to open the way, and the host of immortals flanks their carriage—countless chariots and myriad riders arrive floating through the void, yet all are the divine bodies of the Dharma. As the *Elixir Canon* states: “The spirit rides the qi, and the qi sustains the form.” The light pours forth, the chariot turns back; jade radiance and flying clouds swirl around the Heavenly Worthy’s dharma-seat. Leading and overseeing the host of perfected ones, they assess and deliver according to rank.\n\nIn elixir terms, the pouring forth of light and turning back of the chariot signify the completion of the Kan-Li union, the convergence of yin and yang, the transformation and birth of the true spirit, the nurturing within the womb-chamber—hence, “overseeing the perfected and delivering the living.” The ode says:\n*In the Infinite Heaven’s true alchemy palace,*\n*Elixir and karma-chariots ride the void.*\n*The light pours forth, the chariot turns—hosts of immortals rejoice,*\n*Yang grows, yin wanes: the wondrous work of transformation.*\n\nThe celestial chancellors of the various heavens, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Han the Controller of the Registers, the Great Spirit overseeing life—grasping ledgers and holding registers, all arrive in unison before the Emperor. According to those who are to be delivered, the heavens are strictly examined.\n\nA universal proclamation is issued to the Three Realms, the boundless divine homeland, the bureaus of the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources. Ancestral karmic bonds spanning kalpas are dissolved; sins are swiftly erased from the ledgers, evil roots severed. They must not be detained or forced into the company of ghosts. By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, they ascend in due time from the Northern Capital’s icy pools. Their forms and souls are guarded, demons restrained, merits protected, and ranks delivered to the Southern Palace. The dead souls undergo refinement and transform into immortals; the living receive deliverance and endure through kalpas, turning with the cycles of time, their years equaling Heaven’s. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Heaven of Upper Clarity is the Heavenly Emperor’s Jade Perfection, the formless realm of pure conduct. Master Shangyang said: “This concerns both the application of the Way and worldly principles—both must be made clear.”\n\nWorldly principles:\nThe celestial chancellors of the various heavens. Each heaven has its own chancellor, also called the Great Purity Divine Duke. Southern Prosperity is the Cinnabar Heaven world; the Upper Palace is the Vermilion Numinous Fire Bureau. The Venerable Han of the Controller’s Palace is the Director of Destinies. He oversees the refinement and deliverance of records. The Controller of the Registers is the Celestial Prime Minister who assists the Heavenly Emperor in managing records. The Bureau of Engraved Registers oversees the forging of souls and refining of spirits.\n\nThe Most High expounds the scriptures, each holding their ledgers and registers, all arriving in unison before the Emperor to assess those who are to receive deliverance. Deliverance comes to those whose names are inscribed in the mysterious charts of former lives, whose bone configurations align with immortality; or those who cultivate and uphold precepts, whose accumulated merits and virtues move Heaven; or those who revere the Three Treasures, whose good deeds reach the heavens, or who honor the master’s treasure and are commended by the Three Offices. Those whose names are recorded in the heavens undergo strict examination and assessment, their merits measured and ranks determined—according to their excellence, they receive ascent and deliverance.\n\nIn Daoist terms:\nHolding registers and grasping ledgers, the qi of the Primordial Beginning divides, and yin and yang separate; the Three Powers are established, and the records arise. The *Inner Meaning* states: Manifesting in benevolence, they become ledgers; concealed in function, they become yin and yang. Without ledgers in the hidden and manifest, how could merits and sins be recorded? Without yin and yang in Heaven and Earth, how could creation be accomplished? Thus, the Emperor’s presence is the divine chamber of the Central Palace, where the Emperor resides—all seas converge like spokes to a hub, where spirits abide—all qi coalesces in harmony. This illustrates the convergence of yin and yang within the Central Palace’s divine chamber, hence the saying: grasping ledgers and holding registers, all arrive in unison before the Emperor. The Heavenly Worthy’s scriptural teachings are no empty words—they urge people to practice the Way.\n\nThose of transcendent disposition who delight only in ease and comfort, supposing that purity and non-action alone constitute cultivation, are gravely mistaken. How could they attain the union of yin and yang within the divine chamber? In accordance with what each is destined to deliver, the Way of the Golden Elixir demands true effort, and rewards follow in proportion to merit. With ten parts of effort comes ten parts of fruition; even a single lapse yields but a fragmented reward. Though one’s practice be most secret and one’s deeds unknown, yet in the vastness of the Great Brahma Heaven, all is strictly examined and recorded.\n\nA universal proclamation is made to the Three Realms—Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm—which are also the Three Realms of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The boundless divine homeland, the ten directions’ infinite worlds, are likewise the divine courts of the Three Realms, the palaces of the sacred springs and hidden valleys. In the north lies the Great Sea, the bowstring-qi of the north. *Ming* (命) means the wondrous, the lead, the yang within yin, the bowstring-qi of the tiger. As the *Classic* states: “Abide in non-desire to observe its mystery; abide in desire to observe its gateway.” Thus the ancients said: “He who writes talismans without knowing the gateway invites the mockery of spirits.” *Laozi* says: “The gateway is dark and obscure, yet within it lies essence; this essence is most true; within it lies trust.” This trust is the talismanic trust. It is the primordial talismanic mandate, wherein the true qi of the Primordial Beginning harmonizes with the ancestral qi of the Gate of Life.\n\nWhy is this so? The human body is endowed with the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning at birth, yet in the prime of life, one stumbles into the realm of intoxication and dreams, and this qi flees and is lost. For the cultivator, one must first refine the yin within yang to retain true mercury, then refine the yang within yin to seek true lead. In a single moment of concentration, the Elixir coalesces, and one may hope for ascension and promotion. The Northern Capital is the root of nature, where true mercury flourishes. The Cold Pool is the Gate of Life, where true lead flourishes. When lead and mercury unite, nature and life merge, and one must seize the moment with a single thought to guard the body and the hun-soul. If the form is whole and the hun-soul restored, the pulse halts and qi ceases, the Reverted Elixir begins to form—thus one can subdue demons, ensure promotion, and pass through the Southern Palace for ranking. The so-called withered corpse and dying hun-soul, refined by this lead-fire, attain the wondrous transformation of divine immortality and become perfected beings.\n\nTo deliver the living body—this single phrase revealed by the Heavenly Worthy clarifies the essence of the Reverted Elixir. For this scripture speaks not only for the dead, but for the living practitioner who receives this true qi for deliverance. Moreover, in the living body, yin and yang may be made whole, and the workings of creation grasped. If the practitioner, within this mortal frame, can invert the Five Phases and cultivate this Great Elixir to become a lofty immortal, then one may endure for kalpas unending, revolving through the ages, sharing the lifespan of Heaven, forever escaping the Eight Difficulties, transcending the Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm, rising above the Four Kinds of Heavenly Beings, and roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.\n\nXue Youqi said: The Upper Clarity has thirty-six heavens, whose heavenly emperors are equal in Dao to the Primordial Beginning, their ranks arrayed in the Jade Clarity. Thus it is said that the Jade Perfected reside beyond the Formless Realm, outside the bounds of creation, moving by the qi of Brahmanic contemplation, passing in and out without obstruction. They are not like the thirty-two heavens confined within the Three Realms. Hence it is called the Brahmanic practice. The ode states:\n\nThe Heavenly Emperors and Jade Perfected of the six-six heavens,\nWhen the Elixir is complete and the Dao perfected, share Heaven’s years.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, their merit fulfilled,\nFor kalpas unending they endure as Upper Immortals.\n\nSome versions mistakenly attribute the name of this Heavenly Emperor to the *Primordial Numinous Writ, Upper Chapter*. Yet they fail to recognize that the *Heavenly Duke’s Scripture* states: The Great Brahma Heaven has its own *Numinous Writ, Upper Chapter*, along with the *Observing Awareness* and the *Coiled Dragon Seal Script*, contained within the *Numinous Writ, Middle Chapter*. The Former Shu edition sometimes places it in the Lower Chapter—this too is incorrect. The Azure Perfected said: One should follow the *Heavenly Duke’s Scripture*. This is correct.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East are formed from the Primordial Beginning’s accumulation of ninefold yang Brahmanic qi. Six heavens belong to the Desire Realm, and two to the Form Realm.

At first emerging, with worldly desires not yet extinguished, the people of these heavens touch things and become stained. In the first two heavens, bodily union is desire. In the next two, hand-clasping is desire. In the following five, speech is desire. In the next six, eye-gazing is desire. Because of desire for form, yin and yang intermingle, hence it is called the Desire Realm. Due to their indulgence in desire, signs of decay become apparent, lifespans end, and they sink back into the various destinies. If one gradually cultivates and abandons desire, ascending into the Form Realm, this is the Small Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns, fire arises from the root of Kunlun, burning the world. Flames surge to the Harmony-Sun Heaven, primordial qi disperses, and the heavens collapse. Passing through to the Vow-Swearing Heaven marks the Form Realm—this is the middle realm. The people of these heavens possess six colors and eighteen dusts. When one dust is purified, one ascends to a heaven; when all eighteen dusts are purified, one ascends to the Formless Realm. If one clings even slightly, one falls back into the Desire Realm—this is the Middle Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns with water, it arises from the Eastern Well, vast springs churning waves that flood to the Ultimate Wind Heaven. Primordial qi disperses, and the heavens collapse. From the Radiant Court to the Four Heavens of Elegant Joy is the Formless Realm—this is the upper realm. Only when all dust-stains are purified does one ascend to these heavens. The *Great Perfected Regulations* states: In the Formless Realm, the utmost perfected are without emotion, do not intermingle yin and yang, and if humans are transformed and born there, they only consume true qi, no longer possessing physical form. When one cultivates to a heaven, only the mind-consciousness remains; if the mind-consciousness is extinguished, one ascends step by step. When qi is observed and the Dao is accomplished, one penetrates into spontaneity, ascending to the Seed-People Heaven. The Buddhists call this the Bodhisattva-Striving Heaven—the Great Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns, neither water nor fire reaches it, only wind vast and surging. From Filial Might to the Six Heavens of Cloud-Soaring, the wind destroys them; from Primordial Cavern to Elegant Joy, primordial qi scatters and then recombines, with no further kalpas. From Constant Fusion to the Four Seed-People Heavens of Level Nurturance, penetrating into the true Dao, one ascends to these heavens—this is the Most Supreme Vehicle. When the great kalpa turns and the Three Realms are utterly destroyed, these heavens give birth again to sages as the seed of the people, hence they are called the Seed-People.\n\nThe secrets of the Heavenly Emperor, demons, spirits, and numinous chapters are all formed from the qi of emptiness and cavernousness. All spirits rely on them for transformation, just as the returning elixir depends on the primordial ancestral qi, the work of nine harmonizing with ten, to form the golden embryo. The embryo transforms, and the body enters the Upper Clarity. Of boundless mysteries, this elixir is the most wondrous and transformative, deeply hidden and beyond full explication.\n\n\"Scattering and spreading\" refers to the divine perfected dispersing the true scriptures, arranging them throughout the heavens, commanding them to be upheld, universally delivering heavenly beings and humans, all attaining the wondrous Dao. This is the comprehensive explanation of the Dao’s application and worldly dharma.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe thirty-two heavens in total are dust,\nWhen form and mind are both quiescent, the whole body appears.\nNine harmonizes with ten, the scriptural work complete,\nIn the Golden Watchtower Palace, one attends the Jade Emperor.\n\nToday, joyously celebrating this deliverance, passing through the barriers of all heavens, we request the eradication of the Three Evils, severing the root of earth, flying through the Five Passes, with one’s name recorded in the Great Mystery. The Demon Kings vouch for you, unbound by the Heavenly Gates. The Eastern Dipper governs lifespan, the Western Dipper records names. The Northern Dipper casts down death, the Southern Dipper bestows life, the Central Dipper’s Great Chief oversees all spirits. The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood. The Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transgress him.\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King is Ba Yuan Chou Bo.\nThe Vermilion Heaven Demon King bears the heavens and carries stones.\nThe White Heaven Demon King reverses mountains with six eyes.\nThe Black Heaven Demon King oversees the ugly and fragrant.\nThe Yellow Heaven Demon King bears the heavens with horizontal strength.\n\nThe Five Great Demon Emperors are the lords of all spirits, flying and drumming in procession, commanding ghostly soldiers. Waving banners and beating drums, they roam and observe the great void. Proclaiming themselves resplendent, all heavens share in the merit. Ascending to heaven to deliver people, they strictly govern the Northern Feng. The Divine Duke receives the mandate, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness. The Eight Mighties spew poison, fierce horses spread in four directions. Heavenly Soldiers lead the way, great marshals wield banners. Casting fire for ten thousand miles, flowing bells in eight directions. Should any dare to test or obstruct the perfected, the golden axes strike first, the giant天后 metes out punishment. Slaughtering and severing ghostly brilliance, wind and fire never cease. Thousands upon thousands of heads are cut off, ten thousand upon ten thousand forms are sheared. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not be monstrous. The Three Officials of the Northern Feng inspect the ghostly camps—none may conceal themselves, the golden horse’s courier route. Universally proclaiming without end, all spirits heed.\n\nThe Five Emperors of the Three Realms report to the Upper Clarity.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The earlier mention of \"today’s recording\" refers to the practitioner refining the self to accumulate merit. This mention of \"today’s joyous deliverance\" refers to refining qi to return the elixir. For the great cultivator, the rarest attainment is today; when lead meets the arising of gui, today; where the yellow sprout arises, today. Having attained today is having attained the proper time. Moreover, possessing both the talent and the person—this is the joyous deliverance.\n\nPassing through the barriers of all heavens, should one desire communion between heaven and humanity, one must first establish sincere communication, beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, sever false karmic ties, cut off the root of earthly existence, and fortify the true nature with steadfast resolve. Gathering and refining the primordial Brahman qi of the Origin, one soars through the Five Gates to return to the origin, thereby inscribing one’s name in the Great Mystery.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate is the Gate of Destiny. When entering the chamber, the Demon Kings oversee the true undertaking, ensuring the Gate of Destiny remains unobstructed. As the Green Yang first returns, the Dipper of the East governs reckoning. When the Golden Flower blooms, the Dipper of the West records names. Drawing the yang from Kan, the Northern Dipper marks death. Mending the deficiency in Li, the Southern Dipper bestows life. When qi returns to the Yellow Court, the Central Dipper oversees all spirits.\n\nThe Green Emperor, surnamed Chang, styled Jingming, guards the hun-soul and governs the liver. The White Emperor, surnamed Hun, styled Rushou, attends the po-soul and governs the lungs. The Red Emperor, surnamed Yan, styled Dongdan, nurtures qi and governs the heart. The Black Emperor, surnamed Xuan, styled Mingmeng, circulates blood and governs the kidneys. The Yellow Emperor, surnamed Ma, styled Zhongshen, presides over the Yellow Hall at the center, commanding all spirits.\n\nThe *Register of the Jade Emperor of the Great Cavern* states: The Five Emperors exist coeval with heaven and earth; when yin and yang first divided, they transformed and gave rise to the Five Phases. For the great cultivator, the Five Emperors descend their spirits to refine the golden liquid, infusing qi to congeal the fetal embryo.\n\nThe Demon King of the Green Heaven, surnamed Bin, styled Chicheng. The Demon King of the Red Heaven, surnamed Fo, named Yousu. The Demon King of the White Heaven, surnamed Chi, named Zhangshi. The Demon King of the Black Heaven, surnamed Xu, named Zhishi. The Demon King of the Yellow Heaven, surnamed Tianmen, named Bokuang. All preside over greed and desire, depleting and agitating the spirit-qi, hence they are called Demon Kings.\n\nThe Five Emperors and Great Demons are the Heavenly Kings, corresponding to the five organs of the human body. They bestow the power of generation and nurturing, presiding over the wondrous Dao of the golden elixir, carrying out the edicts of the Heavenly Worthy to subdue and command. Each manifests in imperial form, thus they are called the Five Emperors. Dwelling in the Desire Realm, they test practitioners with the demons of form, sound, scent, taste, and touch, hence they are called Great Demons, the ancestors of all spirits and the sovereigns of the body.\n\nLong ago, the Heavenly Worthy descended these five demons, and in the *Comprehensive Divine Writ for Subduing Demons*, commanded the talisman-officers of the Five Emperors to guard the five directions. The talisman-officer of the Green Emperor is named Qihua; of the Red Emperor, Mingzhen; of the White Emperor, Maocheng; of the Black Emperor, Shouyuan; of the Yellow Emperor, Shengming. Each secures their direction, safeguarding the divine writ to repel demonic trials.\n\nWhen the Dao is in practice, the Four Emperors and Great Demons submit to it, containing the primordial Brahman qi. They are also called the Myriad Heavens, the Golden Duke, the Grand Unity, or the White Tiger. Only the Great Demon of the Green Emperor of the East belongs here, wielding the handle of life and death. He is also called the Original Spirit of Destiny, the Positionless True Person, or the Vajra Divine King.\n\nSoaring in flight, drumming in procession, the Four Emperors and Great Demons traverse the Three Realms, rallying their retinues to assemble the ghostly troops of the Desire Realm, demonstrating the path of lustful folly. When demons test the practitioner, they brandish banners and beat drums. This Great Demon of the Green Emperor, waving his pennants and striking his standards, though dwelling in the Form Realm, is not swayed by desire. Endowed with the true mandate of primordial Brahman qi, he inspects evil and exhorts goodness, thus he is said to roam and observe the great void. He styles himself the sole sovereign of awe-inspiring majesty, sharing in the generative power of the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens.\n\nWhen the heavens deliver humanity, among the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens, the most virtuous is said to be the one who, in delivering humanity, ensures that wondrous transformation begins with strict conduct. He summons the Northern Capital of Fengdu, inspects and severs the root of attachment, to refine and return the elixir. Thus, the Divine Duke receives his mandate.\n\nThe Divine Duke is our original spirit, styled Malongshi, named Kuoyi. Endowed with the true mandate of primordial Brahman qi, he sweeps away all inauspicious ghosts of greed and lust. The Eight Mighties spew forth poison—the Eight Mighties being the six senses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, combined with the storehouse and transmission consciousnesses to form the eight consciousnesses, called the Eight Mighties. They expel the poisonous harm of form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas, preventing disturbance and disorder.\n\nThen the Vajra Divine King mounts a fierce steed with four steeds abreast, dispatching Heavenly Ding as vanguard, advancing with valor and discipline. The great marshal wields his banner, marching with steadfast resolve. Casting fire for ten thousand leagues, its light blazes brilliantly; the flowing bells of the Eight Directions resound with perfect roundness. Should the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens dare to interfere, obstructing the heavens’ deliverance of humanity and hindering the true qi of the primordial Origin from returning to the origin, the Vajra Divine King advances with his golden axe, while the mighty Heavenly Warriors wield their massive halberds in punishment. They slaughter the lustful demons of the Five Turbidities with the swiftness of wind and fire, without pause for even half an hour, emphasizing urgency and speed.\n\nA thousand thousand heads are severed, a thousand demons retreat in disarray; ten thousand ten thousand forms are cut down, ten thousand specters flee in terror. Those who do not interfere or transgress remain unharmed.\n\nThe Three Officials are the Three Origins. The Northern Fengdu is the true nature. Thus, the Three Origins exclusively govern the true nature, penetratingly illuminating and inspecting the lairs of ghosts and demons, allowing no concealment. The primordial Origin’s Brahman qi is the Golden Horse and the Yellow Path. The post route is swift transmission. This qi races along the Yellow Path to return to the divine chamber, universally proclaiming without end. Wherever this qi arrives, the myriad spirits heed its command. The Three Realms are the Three Fields and the Five Emperors, which are the Five Officials, all arrayed in speech to report their merits to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nBy worldly standards, as the scripture states, it is clear even without explanation.\n\nThe ode says:\nResplendent and majestic, the true command prevails,\nDemons dare not transgress, ghosts lose their might.\nOnce the ancestral qi returns and the elixir is complete,\nThe Three Realms report in ranks to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Primal Cavern Jade Chronicle* spans the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras. Through countless eons, within the primordial chaos, above there was no color, below no abyss. Wind and marsh pervaded the void, the Vajra qi rode the heavens. Between heaven above and heaven below, there was no darkness, no obscurity, no form, no shadow, no limit, no end. The vast Brahman qi stretched boundlessly, without light.\n\nWhen the Crimson Clarity unfolded the chart, the kalpas turned naturally. The Primordial Origin settled and stabilized, unfolding the Five Scriptures. Crimson writings on jade, the eight mighty dragon scripts, preserved and regulated the kalpic cycles, ensuring the heavens endured forever. The Brahman qi suffused the cosmos, myriad patterns unfolded, the primordial net flowed and evolved, forming the thirty-two heavens. Revolving without form, they circled the ten directions. The Dipper rotated past the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants. Thirty-five divisions gathered the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Sceneries merged in darkness, qi entered the profound mystery.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi said: This second chapter is the pulse of the scripture, the marrow of the elixir. Why? This chapter concerns the refinement of the golden liquid and the return of the elixir, thus revealing the crimson script as the tool for gathering the medicine. From the ten directions, they float through the void to arrive together before the Emperor, where they gather essence and unite spirit. Only today, rejoicing in deliverance, do they finally compose the elixir. Once the primordial qi returns to the origin, the Five Dipper Emperors within the body perform their duties, driving away evil and expelling the yin demons and ghostly qi, thus demonstrating the merit of \"ten thousand ten thousand forms cut down.\"\n\n*Laozi* says: \"Inferior virtue acts with deliberate purpose.\" This describes the present chapter. This chapter concerns the refinement of the jade liquid great elixir, thus revealing the *Jade Chronicle* as the beginning of the kalpic record. The absence of darkness and obscurity, form and shadow, arises because the qi, having just returned, has not yet settled. Once the Primordial Origin’s Brahman qi stabilizes, myriad patterns unfold, leading to the ascension of the myriad qi as immortals.\n\nThe *Nine Grades Scripture* says: In ancient times, during the primordial chaos before the division of the heavens, the Primordial Origin first took shape. In the fifth kalpa, the initial transformation began, and the Brahman Origin Ancestral Dawn Dao Lord was commanded to record the celestial origin, governing the five kalpas. Thus, the *Primal Cavern* signifies the completion of the ancestral qi, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin.\n\nFrom the division of the primordial qi, the three causes formed the nine. Like dragons or stalks, they coiled through the nine paths, boundless and infinite, encompassing the origin of the nine yang ancestral qi. The Most High then harmonized the Brahman qi, initiating the ancestral qi of the Azure Heaven. Thus, the East received nine qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Dragon Han. The South received three qi to divide its realm, the kalpa named Crimson Clarity. The Center received twelve qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Supreme August. The West received seven qi to divide its realm, the kalpa named Yan Kang. The North received five qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Kai Huang. Once the five kalpas had run their course, the vast heavens took form. The primordial qi merged with the Dao, the Eight Sceneries radiated light. The Eight Emperors manifested, the Nine Empyreans differentiated, coalescing the five yang qi of the Primal Cavern into the *Jade Chronicle*. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign was then commanded to record the initial kalpic cycles of the Primal Cavern, the origin of the revolving kalpas, and the merits of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People in cultivating immortality, along with the path of ascent and retreat.\n\nThe Azure Origin Perfected said: The formation of heaven and earth began in the Dragon Han and ended in the Yan Kang. How many times have they nearly formed, nearly collapsed? Beyond reckoning. Hence, it is called \"countless.\" With each kalpic destruction, heaven and earth dissolve, mountains and seas melt away, all phenomena vanish, leaving no trace of form or substance. Only the qi of the Primal Cavern remains undivided, indistinctly beginning its construction—this is called the primordial chaos. At this time, the true unity of water was enveloped in darkness, the five phases yet unformed. Above, there was no color; below, no abyss. Above, wind; below, marsh. The void was pervaded by emptiness, the Vajra qi bearing the root of heaven. \"Obscurity\" refers to what is hidden and manifest; \"form and shadow\" refer to phenomena. \"Limit\" refers to boundaries. \"Vast expanse\" describes boundless space.\n\nWithin the primordial chaos, between heaven above and heaven below, hidden and manifest, boundless and vast, phenomena were indistinguishable. Boundaries were undefined, only the vast Brahman qi stretched endlessly, without light or shadow. Later, when the golden wind qi rubbed to generate fire, the four images combined to produce earth, which bore heaven and earth and nurtured the myriad beings. This is called the Three Realms’ lofty perfected ones transcending calamitous kalpas. Compared to sentient beings, mired in birth and death, endlessly revolving, the return of the golden elixir to the origin is like enduring the trials of kalpic cycles. Now, fortunately, the Brahman qi has returned to the origin, yet remains without form or image.\n\nWhen the Crimson Clarity unfolded the chart, in the first year of Crimson Clarity, the *Jade Chronicle* established the record. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, phenomena and forms divided and grew—just as the elixir finds its place. The four seasons progressed, each in its proper order, thus it is called \"the kalpas turn naturally,\" akin to the primordial work of the elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Origin settled and stabilized, unfolding the Five Scriptures. The Primordial Origin observed the Brahman qi coalescing into form, carving jade into cloud-seal celestial scripts, bearing the five wondrous elements of the primordial spirit and true Dao. Thus, it is called the Five Scriptures. Those who awaken to its wonders enter its wonders; those who awaken to its origin enter its origin; those who awaken to its spirit enter its spirit; those who awaken to its truth enter its truth; those who awaken to its Dao enter its Dao.\n\nThus, exhausting wonder merges with the Primordial Origin; exhausting the Primordial Origin merges with spirit; exhausting spirit merges with truth; exhausting truth merges with the Dao.\n\nThe script is refined by fire, hence called the \"Red Writ.\" The Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts depict the forms of the Azure Dragon, Giant Wyrm, Golden Master, Qilin, White Tiger, Dark Leopard, Vermilion Serpent, and Great Xiezhi—these are the Eight Might. Their script safeguards against kalpic destruction, ensuring the heavens endure forever.\n\nThe Brahman qi pervades all, transformed from the primordial qi. Established before heaven and earth, it is the root of the Great Dao. The Primordial Origin relies upon it to govern the cosmos; heaven and earth depend on it for generation and completion. It blankets the Three Realms and envelops the myriad heavens. Once the Two Modes unfolded, all phenomena and forms spread forth—thus it is said, \"the ten thousand patterns open and expand.\" The Brahman qi is the guiding principle of primordial transformation, flowing through the Thirty-Two Heavens like a turning wheel. From the Formless Realm, it circulates through the ten directions, from the Dipper to the Winnowing Basket, revolving through the Five Constants. With the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations, it forms the Thirty-Five Divisions. Receiving the qi of the Supreme Heavenly Origin, the Eight Luminaries merge in profound obscurity to accomplish the mysterious work—thus it is said, \"qi enters the Mysterious of Mysterious.\" All this is likened to the elixir’s formation of the fetal embryo.\n\nThe ode states:\nThough formless and traceless, seek its thread,\nA single qi circulates, revealing sacred work.\nMost wondrous is the numinous elixir’s place—\nExpanding the ten thousand patterns, vast are its divine powers.\n\nWithin the Mysterious, the Supreme August One, the Lofty Perfected of the Emperor,\nDrifts upon the grand auroras, chanting the cavernous chapters.\nThe Golden Perfected shines resplendent, its echoes flowing through the cloud camps;\nJade tones gather qi, numinous winds amass mist.\nThe Purple Void flourishes in elegance, aiding the myriad immortals.\n\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected in truth;\nWithin truth dwells spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity.\nThe Peerless Duke, the White Prime Honored Spirit,\nThe Great One who Oversees Destiny, Peach Vitality and Union Longevity,\nGrasp talismans and hold registers, preserving life and rooting existence.\nAscending to the Supreme Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber,\nWithin the Eight Obscurities, amid the subtlest realms,\nThey descend to guard the human body, settling in the Muddy Pellet and Crimson Palace.\nCentering the five qi, blending the hundred spirits,\nTen revolutions return the numinous, ten thousand qi unite in immortality.\nThe immortal Dao values life, boundlessly delivering beings.\n\nAbove, the Eight Gates open, the Dharma Wheel of Flying Heaven turns.\nSin and fortune, prohibitions and precepts, karmic causes and conditions—\nUniversally received and delivered, the dead soul revives in a new body.\nOnce the body attains rebirth, its name ascends to the myriad heavens.\nAbove the heavens, each has its Gate of Life.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This elucidates the application of the golden elixir’s Dao.\nThe \"Mysterious Within\" is the Celestial Heart, the true center of the human body.\nThe \"Supreme August One\" is the Primordial Origin, the ancestral qi—called the Treasure of the Dao.\nThe \"Emperor\" is the Lord of the Dao, the Golden Mother—called the Treasure of the Scriptures.\nThe \"Lofty Perfected\" is the Venerable Lord, the elixir’s body—called the Treasure of the Dharma.\nTogether, they form the Three Treasures as One.\n\nThe Buddhist explanation speaks of the pure Dharma-body as essence, the perfect Reward-body as wisdom, and the thousand hundred million Transformation-bodies as practice. Essence and life unite; yin contracts while yang expands. Drifting upon the grand auroras, chanting the cavernous chapters—\nThe Brahman qi first arises, floating and swimming within primordial harmony.\nThe Golden Duke suddenly returns, joyously chanting the verses of the cavernous chapters.\nThe Golden Perfected shines resplendent, golden qi circulating, its echoes flowing through the cloud camps.\nQi camps in brilliance; jade tones gather qi—jade liquid refines lead, numinous winds amass mist.\nLead restrains mercury; the Purple Void flourishes in elegance—mercury congeals into purple blossoms, aiding the myriad immortals.\nWith external merits complete, a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions smelt into one mass—naturally perfected in truth.\nThe fetal embryo formed, within truth dwells spirit—the embryo has consolidated spirit.\nThe Everlasting Lord governs the heart; the Peerless governs the liver; the White Prime governs the lungs; the Great One governs the head; the Overseer of Destiny governs the spirit; Peach Vitality governs the spleen; Union Longevity governs the kidneys.\nGrasping talismans and holding registers, refining qi to unite with spirit,\nAscending to the Supreme Clarity, Brahman qi rises upward, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber from crown to sole.\nThe head has the Three Flowery Courts; the body has the Curved and Secret Chambers.\nWithin the Eight Obscurities, qi circulates everywhere; amid the subtlest realms, it reaches all places.\nDescending to guard the human body, ascending to the Muddy Pellet, descending to the Crimson Palace;\nCentering the five qi, dwelling in the Yellow Court, uniting the hundred spirits.\nTen revolutions return the hundred numinous powers to me; ten months unite the ten thousand qi in immortality.\nA body beyond the body—the Perfected One manifests.\nThe immortal Dao values longevity; the Most High boundlessly delivers beings.\nThe Eight Gates include the Gate of Longevity; the Dharma Wheel is the path of revolving transformation.\nThe worldly have sins and fortunes; the immortals of karmic destiny rely solely on precept merits and causal conditions.\nForm and spirit universally receive deliverance; all dead souls attain rebirth.\nThis body achieves longevity, its name ascending to the myriad heavens.\nThe heavens review merits and deeds, determining the Gate of Life according to rank.\nThose with great merit serve in the Golden Towers; those with perfected conduct ascend to the ranks of immortals.\n\nMaster Shangyang of the Southern Marchmount, attending Master Zhao, heard someone recite the *Scripture of Deliverance* and asked: \"What is meant by 'Vajra'?\"\nThe Heaven-Riding Master replied: \"Do not be confused. Let us begin from the start.\nFirst, I ask you: what is the *Chaotic Crimson Writ*?\"\nThe disciple bowed and asked: \"Upon hearing these four words, my whole body broke into a cold sweat.\"\nAt that moment, he awakened, penetrating this scripture in one stroke.\nThe master then said: \"Now you understand the Vajra Heaven-Riding.\"\nThe disciple replied: \"My entire body is drenched in sweat.\"\nThe master said: \"Inquiry must be true inquiry; awakening must be true awakening. Speak further of what lies beyond.\"\nThe disciple said: \"Now I have transcended the Formless Realm.\"\nThe master snapped his fingers and said: \"Thus, thus! Such words are the thrust of the sword’s edge. Neither sin nor fortune, prohibitions nor precepts—how recklessly you reveal them!\nThe scripture’s essence relies on this. In the future, even the Demon King of the Yutian Heaven will surely endorse you.\"\nThis scripture’s sublimity is beyond measure, hence it is the supreme treasure of the Three Caverns and the foremost of the Daoist Canon.\n\nYet the intent of the Primordial Origin lies solely in preserving the Dao/Way.\nExpounding scriptures clarifies the Dao/Way, that people may revere it;\nRevealing scriptures unfolds the Dao/Way, that people may practice it.\nThus the Dao/Way is the essence of scripture, and scripture the function of the Dao/Way.\nThrough scripture the Dao/Way is revealed; through the Dao/Way scripture is sought.\n\nWorldly commoners, upon hearing scripture, show reverence;\nUpon hearing the Dao/Way, they laugh.\nEncountering scripture, they chant it aloud with fervor;\nHearing the Dao/Way, they gather to slander it.\nYet the Dao/Way is the mother, scripture the child—\nNever has the world loved the child while reviling the mother.\n\nThe Dao/Way is that by which heaven and earth unfold,\nBy which sun and moon are raised,\nBy which wind and rain are dispensed,\nBy which thunder and lightning are commanded.\nYet when people hear thunder and lightning, they cover their ears;\nWhen they hear the Dao/Way, they ridicule it.\nThough the Most High is merciful and does not punish,\nHow dire is the self-inflicted downfall of such people!\n\nWhat is the Dao/Way? What is scripture?\nThat which completes the transformations of yin and yang is called the Dao/Way;\nThat which fulfills the essence and function of life and nature is called scripture.\nWithout yang to balance yin, it cannot be the Dao/Way;\nWithout function to complement essence, it cannot be scripture.\nThus the Dao/Way is the root of yin and yang,\nAnd scripture the function of life and nature.\nTo unite true nature with primordial life is to pair yin and yang;\nTo harmonize outer form with inner spirit is to complete essence and function.\n\nThe Dao/Way of the Primordial Origin’s returning elixir is akin to the conception of human life.\nWhen a person receives the essence and blood of ordinary parents,\nIt too begins as a formless, chaotic vastness.\nOnce essence and blood settle, in the first month it becomes an embryo;\nIn the second, a fetus;\nIn the third, the hun-soul is born;\nIn the fourth, the po-soul is fixed;\nIn the fifth, the five viscera take shape;\nIn the sixth, the six bowels open;\nIn the seventh, the seven orifices become clear;\nIn the eighth, the eight luminous scenes are complete;\nIn the ninth, the limbs are fully formed;\nIn the tenth, the qi is whole, and the child emerges from the womb.\n\nThe Dao/Way of the returning elixir follows the same pattern.\nWhen it receives the wondrous qi of the numinous father and sagely mother,\nOnly after nine harmonies and ten unions does the golden qi arrive—\nAlso a formless, chaotic vastness, an empty and boundless expanse,\nWithout color or depth to rely upon,\nWithout form or shadow to depend on.\nOnce the primordial qi is settled,\nThe five phases unfold,\nEnveloping and revolving in silent fusion,\nRadiant and resplendent,\nReturning to the void,\nGathering and nurturing,\nConceiving and bearing the true.\nThe five viscera are born,\nThe five qi are ordered,\nThe hundred spirits are united,\nThe fetal immortal is knit—\nThis is called the yang-spirit, emerging and transforming through divine power.\nYet while ordinary people receive the essence and blood of mortal parents to form their bodies,\nThe golden elixir is nurtured by the numinous father and sagely mother,\nEnabling transformation and flight—\nThis is the dual cultivation of life and nature, the wondrous union of form and spirit.\n\nA hymn says:\n*By this scripture, the hundred spirits merge in harmony;\nThis scripture’s sublimity is most clear.\nWithin the heavens, the celestial qi perfects the fetal immortal;\nThe myriad qi ascend together as immortals to the Jade Capital.*\n\nWithin it are the empty and resounding chants,\nThe demon-subduing scriptures of the numinous chapters,\nTheir verses attuned to the loftiest perfected beings.\n\nFirst, the celestial hymns of the Desire Realm in flight:\n*The human path is faint, the immortal path vast.\nThe ghostly path delights—yet it is the gateway of human life.\nThe heavenly path values life, the ghostly path values death.\nThe immortal path is ever auspicious, the ghostly path ever ominous.\nO exalted, pure, and numinous soul,\nSing your lament, resounding through the great void!\nI wish only for the immortal path’s fulfillment,\nNot for the human path’s exhaustion.*\n\n*The Northern Capital, the Spring-Curved Prefecture,\nHolds a host of ten thousand ghosts.\nThey seek only to cut short human destiny,\nTo sever the gateway of life.*\nThe adept sings the cavernous chapters,\nTo subdue the Northern Feng.\nBinding and dispatching demonic spirits,\nSevering the blades of the six ghosts.\n*The qi of the heavens surges boundlessly;\nMy Dao/Way flourishes day by day.*\n\nMaster Shangyang said: *The Scripture of Numinous Treasure Methods* states that the cavernous chapters are the *Cinnabar Yellow, Flying Mystery, Purple Writ* of Mount Gui—\nNot the work of demon kings.\nWhen Perfected Lord Yin attended the Most High on the Western Terrace of Mount Gui,\nHe entered the Seven Treasures Garden,\nObserved the proper method of its composition,\nAnd disseminated these three chapters to the world,\nThat people might awaken and transcend the Three Realms.\n\nIn ancient times, when the Heavenly Worthy subdued the demons,\nThe demon kings all bowed their heads and accepted their charge.\nThe Heavenly Worthy commanded Demon King Yumo to govern the Desire Realm,\nDemon King Moluo to govern the Form Realm,\nAnd Demon King Wuoming to govern the Formless Realm.\nEach sang their hymns,\nTransforming and soaring through the void,\nWarning and admonishing heavenly beings,\nBanishing desire-demons.\nThat people, upon hearing these celestial hymns in flight,\nMight turn from the suffering of sensual desire\nAnd return to the gate of purity.\n\nFrom the Yellow Citadel to the Mafi Realm is the Desire Realm;\nWhen the six desires are wholly purified, one ascends to the Form Realm.\n*The human path is faint, its yang lost in obscurity;\nThe immortal path is vast, lofty and hard to fathom.*\nThe *Gateway of Life* is the portal of human and all beings’ birth,\nThe gateway of becoming an immortal or a buddha.\nPerfected Lord Zhongli said:\n*The gate that gives me life is the door that takes my death*—\nThis is that very gate.\nIf one fails to awaken, desire-demons delight in this gateway.\n\nThe *Exalted, Pure, and Numinous Soul*—\nThe exalted one, with a pure heart and numinous nature,\nSings with forthright lament,\nPitying the deluded,\nTheir chants resounding through the great void.\nMaster Ge’s *Song of the Flowing Pearl* says:\n*Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,\nYou drive me to toil endlessly.\nHurrying, bustling,\nForgetting sleep and food.\nNow at sixty, I fear the three wretched destinies.\nA perfected one delivers me—\nIt takes a great man!*\nPondering these words,\nIs this not the lament resounding through the great void?\n\nThe intent of the Most High in leaving these scriptures\nIs that the world’s people cultivate and realize the immortal path,\nNot that they follow the deviant path to their ultimate ruin.\n\nThe *Northern Capital, Spring-Curved Prefecture*—\nThe world’s sea of desire—\nHolds a host of ten thousand ghosts,\nAll of the realm of sensual forms.\nIf one is lost in infatuation,\nThey will cut short one’s destiny and sever the root of life.\nThe adept, dwelling in the Form Realm,\nSings the cavernous chapters at times,\nSubduing Feng of the North.\nFor the Northern Feng is the root of human desire.\nWhen the root of desire stirs,\nFeng arises in billowing black clouds,\nThe six ghosts clash their blades,\nAnd demonic spirits rush forth in a deluge of suffering.\n\nWhen the adept reaches this stage,\nThey must subdue and transform it,\nTurning the Realm of Desire into Eternal Bliss,\nRefining the elixir to transmute ghosts and demons into the hosts of heaven.\nBy bestowing the numinous medicine,\nThe radiant qi of golden light billows forth,\nAnd my Dao of the elixir flourishes day by day.\n\nA hymn says:\nBusy day and night, sharp and clever,\nWho distinguishes hell from heaven?\nWith a cold eye, observe the floating world,\nAwaken the adept to sing the cavernous chapters.\n\n**Second: The Chapter of the Color Realm’s Demon Kings**\n\nLofty and vast, resplendent,\nLuminous qi soars in the four directions.\nThe Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions,\nBoundless great spirits—all arise from my body.\nI possess the cavernous chapters,\nTen thousand recitations make one an immortal.\nThe Dao of immortals values deliverance,\nWhile the ghostly path clings to the Realm of Color.\nHeaven and earth stretch boundless,\nDefiled qi swirls thickly.\nThe bliss of the Three Realms—\nPass beyond it to abide forever.\nWhen the body crosses my realm,\nIt merges with the natural.\nAt this moment of bliss,\nAll is by my grace.\nThe Dragon Han era flows on—\nHow can one discern the true?\nMy realm is hard to cross,\nThus I compose the cavernous scriptures.\nTransforming and soaring through the void,\nI test your body.\nSuccess or failure, slackening or retreat—\nHow few are those who cross!\nI laugh at those who do not cross,\nThus I sing this melody.\n\nFrom the Heaven of Self-Exceeding Conduct to the Heaven of Cloud Vows,\nEighteen heavens comprise the Realm of Color.\nThe people of these heavens possess form but no desire,\nDistinguished by coarse, fine, and subtle dust—eighteen specks in all.\nWhen the dust’s defilements are wholly purified,\nOne ascends to the Formless Realm.\n\nLofty and vast, the heavens of color stretch far and wide,\nLuminous qi soars in the four directions,\nBrahma-qi shines brightly,\nBoundless great spirits.\nMy body is tested by demons,\nThe cavernous chapters recited ten thousand times,\nAll habitual tendencies forgotten.\nThe Dao of immortals values deliverance,\nEmerging from the Realm of Color.\nThe ghostly path entices people,\nClinging to the Realm of Color.\n\nMaster Danyang, a wealthy man of the Eastern Land,\nIndulged in pleasure day and night.\nPatriarch Chongyang specially sought to deliver him.\nAt their first meeting, he said:\n“I come to support a drunken man.”\nDanyang angrily asked: “What is the Dao?”\nHe replied: “Where the five phases do not reach.”\nDanyang had a great awakening,\nFollowed him to study, and ascended as an immortal.\nIs this not the value the Dao of immortals places on deliverance?\n\nHeaven and earth stretch boundless,\nThe bounds of the color realm endless.\nThe *Nanhua Sutra* says:\nThings come without end,\nBut my mind has its limits.\nDefiled qi swirls thickly,\nCongealing and not dispersing.\nThe bliss of the Three Realms—\nPass beyond it to abide forever.\nBeyond this Realm of Color,\nTranscend the heavens of the Three Realms,\nAscend to the Upper Clarity,\nAnd there you may abide forever.\nWhen the body crosses my realm,\nIt merges with the natural,\nTranscending the forms of color,\nNo longer deluded by them.\nAttaining great freedom,\nAll is by my grace.\nThrough the scriptures, one awakens to the Dao.\nThe Dragon Han era flows on—\nTrue and false cannot be distinguished.\nMy realm is hard to cross.\nIf the forms of color are not eradicated,\nHow can one escape the demonic realm?\nThus I compose the cavernous scriptures to encourage you.\nAgain, transforming and soaring through the void,\nI test you with demons.\nFew succeed; many fail, slacken, or retreat.\nI laugh at those who cannot emerge from this realm of color,\nThus I sing this song.\n\nA hymn says:\nIn the heavens of the Color Realm, eighteen specks of dust—\nIf this mind is not pure, it is not true.\nTo know how hard my realm is to cross,\nAsk how many now cross it.\n\n**Third: The Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King**\n\nAbove the Three Realms,\nThe vast and distant Great Luo.\nNo root of color above,\nClouds tower in layers.\nOnly the Primordial Beginning,\nThe home of kalpas vast,\nGoverns my realm,\nPresiding over the Mysterious Capital.\nThose who transgress my realm\nEnter the Jade Void.\nI, the supreme king,\nRectify and govern the hosts of demons.\nTen thousand transformations in the void,\nDefiled qi blooms like flowers.\nFew preserve the true,\nMany are deluded.\nThe Dao of immortals is hard to stabilize,\nThe ghostly path easily turns deviant.\nThe human path lies in the heart—\nTruly, it does not depend on others.\nThe Dao of immortals values substance,\nThe human path values splendor.\nIf you do not delight in the Dao of immortals,\nHow can you pass the Three Realms?\nIf you turn to the five paths of desire,\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nFrom the Heaven of Luminous Courts to the Four Heavens of Elegant Joy is the Primordial Color Realm.\nThe *Statutes of the Supreme Perfected* says:\nIn the Formless Realm,\nThe utmost true are without emotion,\nBoth color and desire empty,\nNo longer troubled by form or substance.\nWhen cultivation reaches one heaven,\nOnly mind and consciousness remain.\nEntering the qi-observation,\nWhen qi-observation is perfected,\nOne ascends to the next heaven.\nAgain, one can eliminate mind and consciousness,\nAttaining non-action,\nAnd ascend further.\nIf the myriad dharmas reside in the mind,\nWhether existent or non-existent,\nOne ascends again.\nIf qi-observation becomes wondrous,\nAll habitual tendencies forgotten,\nMerging with the natural,\nOne ascends to the Heaven of Seed People.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Fundamental Limit* says:\nAfflictions are knots,\nLearning and practice are habits.\nWhen knots and habits are exhausted,\nOne transcends the rank of seed people,\nMerges with the Dao’s realm,\nAnd rises or falls with the qi,\nBeyond the reach of calamity.\n\nMaster Qingyuan of the Azure Origin says:\nThough in the Formless Realm one can leave defilement and forget color,\nOne still cannot dispel forgetfulness,\nAnd mind and consciousness remain a trouble.\nThus defiled qi blooms like flowers,\nAnd the ghostly path easily turns deviant.\nIf control is momentarily lost,\nOne falls into the Realm of Color.\nOne must forget the mind,\nNaturally dispel and observe emptiness to enter the wondrous.\n\nThe *Scripture of Lord Lao* says:\nWhat is empty is already non-existent,\nEven non-existence is non-existent.\nProfoundly and constantly quiescent—\nOnly then is it true stillness.\n\nFormerly, the Immortal Liu Changsheng of the Prodigal Son\nSpent three years in Luoyang,\nDaily observing emptiness and dispelling forgetfulness.\nWhen the root of attachment stirred,\nHe would recite:\n“The Northern Capital, Spring-Curved Prefecture,\nHolds a host of ten thousand ghosts.\nThey only desire to cut short one’s destiny,\nSever the gate of life.”\nReciting this song,\nThe root of attachment was suddenly severed.\nIs this not the adept singing the cavernous chapters\nTo subdue the Northern Feng?\n\nThis is true and solid work—\nWhat the Dao of immortals values as substance.\nThe world is all infatuated,\nNot delighting in the Dao of immortals.\nTurning the wheel of the five sufferings,\nWhat skill can one employ?\nWhat can be done?\n\nA hymn says:\nIn the heavens of the Formless Realm, so much grinding and nothingness—\nThis time, let your mind not be muddled.\nThese are not idle flowers and grasses,\nBut the true body entering the Jade Void.\n\nAbove the Three Realms,\nIn the midst of soaring through the void,\nThe demon kings’ songs,\nTheir melodies interwoven with the cavernous chapters.\n\nReciting it a hundred times, one crosses the Southern Palace;\nA thousand times, demon kings come to safeguard and welcome;\nTen thousand times, the Way is complete—ascending to fly through the Great Void.\nPassing beyond the Three Realms,\nOne’s rank attains that of an immortal lord.\n\nHearing the numinous sound,\nDemon kings show reverence in form,\nCommanding earth spirits to attend and escort.\nDrawn forth from the earthly gate,\nThe five sufferings and eight hardships are overcome.\nSeven generations of ancestors ascend,\nForever departing the demonic palace.\nThe soul crosses Crimson Mound,\nRefined and reborn—\nThis is called boundless,\nUniversally delivering the limitless.\n\nThere are secret celestial texts,\nRevered by all heavens.\nTo leak or slight them is to fall into hell,\nBringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.\n\nAbove the Three Realms,\nThere is nothing not inhabited by demon kings.\nAmidst flight through the void,\nEverywhere songs and hymns resound—\nDemons test one’s resolve,\nYet they may aid the wondrous Way,\nThus interweaving with the cavernous chapters.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounded the recitation of scriptures,\nEnlightening worldly people to practice the Way.\nReciting it a hundred times\nIs like the first return of primordial qi—\nThus it is called crossing the Southern Palace.\nA thousand times\nIs like the formation of the fetal embryo—\nThus demon kings safeguard and welcome.\nTen thousand times, the Way is complete,\nThe embryo transforms and the spirit departs—\nThus one flies and ascends to the Great Void.\n\nThis is called the completion of the Way.\nWithout cultivating the Way,\nMerely reciting it ten thousand times in hope of ascension\nWould be difficult indeed.\nWhen the merit of scripture is perfected,\nOne crosses the Three Realms;\nWhen the elixir’s work is fulfilled,\nOne’s rank attains that of an immortal lord.\n\nHearing the numinous sound—\nOnce in ten thousand kalpas—\nDemon kings show reverence in form,\nFor the Way is lofty and virtue profound.\nCommanding earth spirits\nIs the decree of primordial qi.\nEarth is the flowing *wu* of *wu* merging with *si*,\nReturning to the root and restoring the origin.\nDrawn forth from the earthly gate,\nYin dissolves and yang grows.\nThe five sufferings and eight hardships\nTranscend the reckoning of the five phases,\nUprooting the eight consciousnesses’ roots.\nForever departing the demonic palace,\nYin severs the gate of *kun*,\nThe soul crosses Crimson Mound,\nYang gathers in the palace of *li*.\n\nThere are secret celestial texts.\nFor those who study the Way,\nBeholding the scriptures, they treasure and cherish them;\nRefining the elixir, they cultivate in seclusion and secrecy.\nThis is called \"secret.\"\nRevered by all heavens,\nWhen the elixir’s Way and the scriptures are both complete,\nAll heavens revere and look up to them.\n\nWhat is meant by \"leaking and slighting\"?\nTo act carelessly and recklessly,\nHearing but not practicing,\nOr practicing without secrecy—\nAll incur the calamity of leaking and slighting,\nFearing a fall into hell.\nAs for bringing calamity upon ancestors,\nThis is to exhaust one’s primordial qi,\nThen blame the alchemical scriptures as false,\nOr call the Most High’s words empty—\nWould they not reflect upon their own fault in leaking and slighting?\n\nA hymn says:\nWhy do hymns interweave with cavernous chapters?\nOnly because of hell and heaven.\nKnowing that hell is created by the mind alone,\nOne should strive toward heaven in earnest.\n\nThe Dao says:\nThese two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Thearchs and the most numinous demon kings,\nAll words of the Great Brahma,\nNot common speech of the world.\nTheir language lacks ornate beauty,\nTheir melodies lack florid embellishment—\nThus they are called profound and obscure,\nDifficult to fathom in detail.\n\nTreasured by heaven,\nThey are secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Dark Capital,\nTransmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Statutes.\nIf a perfected person pledges gold and treasures with sincerity,\nFollowing the old protocols to swear oaths before the Ten Heavens,\nOnly then are they entrusted.\n\nMaster Shangyang said:\nThis scripture crowns all others,\nFor its beginning and end correspond,\nIts front and back follow in sequence.\nAs in the upper scroll,\nThe Heavenly Perfected One recorded the Jade Dawn,\nThe Dao Lord narrated the words of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy—\nThat ten thousand generations later,\nThose who recite this scripture\nAre as if personally witnessing the events of that time.\nThis is its wonder.\n\nThe present chapter and the *Jade Calendar* are the main scriptures.\nThe demon kings’ songs of the Three Realms,\nAppended after these two chapters,\nDo not belong to the main scriptures.\nYet because their texts test the practitioner’s merit extensively,\nThey are interwoven at the end of the *Primal Cavern*—\nThus called \"sounds interweaving with cavernous chapters.\"\nWhat follows are the Heavenly Perfected One’s further transmissions of the Dao Lord’s words.\n\nThese two chapters are the *Crimson Text of the Chaotic Cavern* and the *Jade Calendar of the Primal Cavern*.\nThe *Crimson Text of the Chaotic Cavern* clarifies the returning elixir of the primordial, original, and mysterious One;\nThe *Jade Calendar of the Primal Cavern* clarifies the wondrous Way of the posterior, effortless, and perfectly true.\nThese two chapters,\nUnique and unparalleled,\nAre the hidden sounds of all Celestial Thearchs—\nNothing but the interplay of yin and yang.\nThe most numinous demon kings\nFully rely on spiritual efficacy,\nTheir hidden sounds the mysterious pass of the One Aperture.\nThe words of the Great Brahma—\nLead, silver, cinnabar, mercury—\nIn scripture, they are the hidden secrets of the Celestial Thearchs and demon kings;\nIn the elixir, they are the Brahma-words of the Mysterious Female’s knife and measure,\nNot common speech of the world.\n\nFoolish people of the world open their mouths to discuss the Way,\nYet do not know what the Way is,\nNor what its substances are for—\nThis is called \"not common speech of the world.\"\nTheir language lacks ornate beauty—\nTrue words are not embellished;\nTheir melodies lack florid embellishment—\nFlourish is not substance.\nThus they are called profound and obscure.\nThough Yan and Min were wise, they could not guess;\nThough Huang and Lao had no teacher, they could not comprehend—\nTreasured by heaven.\nThe first scripture alone is secreted in the celestial palace,\nNot commonly used in the world.\nTransmitted once every forty thousand kalpas,\nIt is not to be given to just anyone.\nThe \"perfected person\" is one of utmost sageliness.\nPledging gold and treasures is exchanging wealth for the Dharma.\n\nGold and treasures are what the world values.\nFoolish people take gold and treasures as their lives;\nPetty men take fame and rank as their lives;\nRighteous scholars take reputation and integrity as their lives;\nPerfected persons take virtue and the Way as their lives.\nThus perfected persons refine the nine-return divine elixir of golden liquid,\nUsing gold and treasures as Dharma-wealth.\nWith Dharma but no wealth, matters seldom succeed;\nWith wealth but no Dharma, one is no different from a fool.\nWhen scriptures circulate,\nDharma and wealth are both employed.\nFollowing the protocols to swear oaths,\nOnly then may they be entrusted.\nTo act presumptuously and recklessly is difficult to complete.\nThis is the explanation of its use in the Way.\n\nAs for worldly matters,\nOne has never seen someone pledge gold and treasures as earnest money to request a scroll of scripture—\nEven in forty thousand kalpas, none would exist.\nWhy?\nHow would they know this scripture contains the Way of long life and enduring vision?\n\nIf one speaks of the application of the Dao, such cases may yet exist. Why? Those of superior roots and proper Dharma-vessels, by virtue of karmic affinities from past lives, have already gained some understanding within the alchemical scriptures. Though they may not yet fully grasp the profound essence, upon suddenly hearing the sublime truths of this sutra, they offer gold and treasures in unwavering faith.\n\nThe methods of nine-return and seven-reversion require the external medicine to merge with the internal medicine. Without gold and treasures as earnest, how could one obtain the wonders of this sutra? How could one subdue the tiger to descend the dragon? How could one draw the primordial qi from the midst of emptiness?\n\nIn this present age, when foolish and impure men hear of Dharma-wealth, they invariably burst into laughter, claiming that cultivators must be utterly destitute, stripped bare, and devoted solely to rigid sitting, drifting into hollow stillness. Such people toil in vain until old age, never understanding the use of gold and treasures to seek the wondrous sutra. This is the principle of employing both Dharma and wealth.\n\nThe Perfected of Mystery and Silence’s *Entering the Chamber Poem* says:\n*Entering the chamber, what makes it unique?*\n*Golden flowers bloom day after day.*\n*The numinous sprout rises from the earth,*\n*Fragrant medicine descends from the heavens.*\n\nIt also states:\n*To yearn for the treasure of heaven,*\n*One must first move worldly wealth.*\n*Within the jade caves of Penglai,*\n*The nine-returned cup is brewed.*\n\nThe Perfected Wang Ding says:\n*If mortals seek the affairs of heaven,*\n*They must first use the wealth of the world.*\nFor the treasure of heaven and the affairs of heaven are the subtle mechanisms of immortals’ practice—far removed from the deluded grasping of heterodox paths.\n\nWhen Faduo Migajia received the master’s teaching, he asked, “How should one repay?”\nThe master replied, “If you prepare five hundred *kārṣāpaṇa*, it will fully express your profound sincerity.”\nThereupon, Migajia searched the earth, and having gathered them, presented this verse:\n*Abundant wealth, many treasures,*\n*Spring’s attributes all fulfilled.*\n*Certain of bodhi,*\n*Ever abiding in the Dharma.*\n\nThis verse left by Faduo Migajia, the teacher of gods and men, serves as the eye and guide for later generations to realize the Dao and attain Buddhahood—unlike the practices of heretical demons. Carefully observing these words, one sees that this sutra must be entrusted only after pledging gold and treasures with sincerity, thereby attaining its wonders.\n\nThe ode says:\n*Unmoved by even a speck of wealth,*\n*How can gold and treasures ferry others?*\n*I, of Qingcheng, was personally entrusted,*\n*For the elixir of return, only the tiger and dragon suffice.*\n\n**End of the Middle Scroll of the *Commentary on the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings*, Upper Chapter**\n\n**The Lower Scroll of the *Explanatory Commentary on the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery***\n*Commentary by Chen Guanzhen of Shangyang*\n\nThe Dao says:\nThe revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends;\nThe sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane;\nEven the most sagely and divine persons also have their limits;\nAnd the ignorant and unlearned also suffer illness and harm.\n\nFor all such calamities, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times—whereupon virtue and power will descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens. The boundless text universally delivers the limitless.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth are spoken of in terms of the Dao, then the human body receives the central qi of heaven and earth. The head resembles heaven, the feet resemble earth—thus the human body is called a small heaven and earth. The transformations of heaven and earth give birth to humans and all beings; the transformations of the human body give birth to buddhas and immortals.\n\nThe *Lingbao Complete Methods* states: The Dao gives birth to the myriad things. Among them, heaven and earth are the greatest, and humans are the most numinous. If one seeks the Dao separately, humans are equal to heaven and earth. The heart corresponds to heaven, the kidneys to earth; the liver is yang, the lungs are yin. Rising and falling, gazing upward and downward, one may fathom their mechanism. Beginning and ending, measuring and calculating, one may grasp their principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: Heaven is noble, earth is lowly—thus Qian and Kun are established.\nThe *Laozi* says: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name, so I style it the Dao.\n\nMaster Zhang the Perfected says:\nWhen sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;\nWhere the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li merge.\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nThen gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.\n\nThus, the golden elixir uses heaven and earth as its crucible and vessel.\n\nIn worldly reckoning, the revolutions of heaven and earth are vast—ancients took the great unity as heaven. The scripture says: Within the realm are four great things: the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.\n\nThe *Huntian Theory* likens heaven to an egg, with earth like the yolk within. The great earth lies within the body of heaven. The north and south poles of heaven are like the pivot and axle of a wheel. Heaven rotates once in a day and night, circling the two poles without leaving its original place. The comparison of heaven to an egg refers to its imperfectly round shape—ancients knew the resemblance of its form and thus used it as an analogy. It merely illustrates that earth lies within heaven, and heaven envelops earth.\n\nMaster Yuanduzi says: Heaven is like a brocade ball, containing a half-sphere of water. Upon the water floats a board, which represents the great earth. The objects placed on the board represent the myriad kinds of humans. The ball constantly rotates, yet the objects on the board remain unaware. Heaven rotates day and night, while earth abides within it. Humans and beings upon the earth remain unmoving—this analogy of the floating board is most apt.\n\nThe *Huntian Theory*’s claim that earth lies within the body of heaven does not mean heaven’s body is visible. Rather, observing the rising and setting of the stars in the east and west, governed by the two poles with fixed degrees and no cessation, one infers the stars’ attachment and posits it as the body of heaven.\n\nThe *Gexiang* states: The body of heaven is round like a pellet, and the center of this round body is the target of the six directions. All around, above and below, it is square and equal—this is called the center of heaven. The center of heaven extends straight upward to the zenith. In ancient times, measuring shadows at Yangcheng yielded the shadow of the zenith’s exact center. Gazing upward at the North Pole, its emergence and submergence above and below the earth total thirty-six degrees—this is the center of heaven, not the center of earth. As for the earth’s axis, the center of the four directions should be sought at the farthest reaches of the four seas. The source of the Yellow River is Kunlun, the highest place on earth. The Western Barbarians call it Mount Memuli, from which waters flow in four directions. The mountain lies less than twenty thousand *li* from the Eastern Sea and over thirty thousand *li* from the Western Sea. Yangcheng is closer to the Eastern Sea but farther from Kunlun. Most of the world’s land lies to the west, yet Kunlun still stands in the eastern lands. One must know that the true center of the great earth lies west of Kunlun.\n\nThe *Huntian*’s comparison of heaven to an egg, with the yolk as earth, implies less heaven above earth and more below. The *Gexiang* claims the opposite—more heaven above earth and less below—which also has its logic.\n\nRegarding the height of heaven, the *Jade Book* says: Between heaven and earth, the distance above and below is eighty-four thousand *li*, and their qi and substance cannot interact. Heaven seeks Qian from Kun and returns to the center of earth, its yang bearing yin upward. Earth seeks Kun from Qian and returns to the center of heaven, its yin embracing yang downward. Rising and falling, they revolve within the Dao.\n\nThe *Sanwu Liji* states: When heaven and earth opened, the clear yang became heaven, and the turbid yin became earth. Pangu was born between them, divine in heaven and sagely on earth. Heaven is extremely high, earth extremely deep, and Pangu extremely tall. Later came the Three Sovereigns, whose numbers began with one, stood upon three, were completed by five, flourished in seven, and resided in nine—thus heaven is ninety thousand *li* from earth.\n\nBoth accounts agree: from earth to heaven is ninety thousand *li*, and from earth below to heaven is also ninety thousand *li*—thus the body of heaven is one hundred eighty thousand *li* in height. Anciently, three hundred sixty paces made one *li*. As in previous chapters’ notes on the generation of the various heavens, the hundreds of thousands of *li* mentioned are not literal. They signify that those of superior roots who cut off desire and joy become equal to sages and worthies, far removed from the people of the lower realms.\n\nSimilarly, the breadth of the earth: from the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea to the western shore of the Western Sea is over fifty thousand *li*. The width of the seas is another thirty thousand *li*, and beyond the seas, twenty thousand *li*—thus from the farthest east to the farthest west spans one hundred fifty thousand *li*. Compared to the height of one hundred eighty thousand *li*, the *Huntian*’s likening of its shape to an egg is apt.\n\nThe Dao of heaven rotates left, circling the three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees of the celestial sphere once each day and night, without end. During the Liu Song dynasty, Zu Chongzhi, skilled in observing the heavens, saw that the Pole Star remained nearly motionless, deviating by just over one degree. Thus, astronomers measuring the North Pole determined the length of degrees.\n\n**The Record of Guo Shoujing’s Conduct:**\n\nIn the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan era (1279), Guo Shoujing memorialized: During the Kaiyuan reign of the Tang, Yi Xing ordered Nan Gongshuo to conduct nationwide solar shadow measurements. Today, our empire surpasses the Tang in vastness. Without distant observations to verify solar and lunar eclipses, discrepancies arise in their magnitudes and timings, as well as in the varying lengths of day and night, and the differing altitudes of the sun, moon, and stars. Given the scarcity of observers, we may first erect gnomons north and south, aligning them over great distances. Thus, each celestial degree spans 1,390 *li*, while the moon’s path is narrower than the sun’s diameter—each lunar degree measures only 670 *li*. A full circuit of 365 degrees totals no more than 240,000 *li*, proving the moon is nearer to man, and heaven most distant. Only the sun traverses the middle Way, so all calendrical calculations take it as their standard.\n\nThe sun’s path defines the names of the twenty-eight lodges. During the reigns of Yao and Shun, the winter solstice sun lodged in *Xu*. How do we know? The *Canon of Yao* states: “The shortest day, the star *Mao* [Pleiades], marks mid-winter.” At winter solstice, the day is shortest; the sun sets at the end of *Shen*, and *Mao* appears in *You*. Initially, *Mao* stands due south at *Wu*, while the sun lies in *You*. *Xu* belongs to the celestial *Zi* (north). When the celestial *Zi* aligns with the earthly *You*, *Zi* overlays *You*, and *You* in turn overlays *Wu*. *Mao* belongs to the celestial *You*, yet at winter solstice, it appears in the earthly *Wu*. Thus, the winter solstice sun lodges in *Xu*, the summer solstice in *Xing*, the spring equinox in *Mao*, and the autumn equinox in *Fang*. Ancient astronomers determined the sun’s degrees solely by the midnight culmination of stars—hence the calendars devised by Rong Cheng and the stellar divinations of Che Qu.\n\nThe *Taichu* calendar of the Han placed the mid-winter sun in *Chou*, lodging in *Qianniu*. From Yao to the Han, the lodging shifted by one mansion. Yu Xi of the Jin estimated a shift of one degree every fifty years; He Chengtian, one degree per century; Liu Zhuo, one degree every seventy-five years; and Yi Xing of the Tang, one degree every eighty-three years. The *Dayan* calendar placed the sun at thirteen degrees in *Dou*. The Song adopted Liu Zhuo’s seventy-five-year standard. In the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era (1277), on the *dingchou* day of the winter solstice, the sun lodged at ten degrees in *Ji*. In the third year of the Zhiyuan era (1266), on the *dingchou* day, it lodged at eight degrees in *Ji*. Thus, in Yao’s time, the sun was in *Zi*; in the Han, in *Chou*; and between the Jin and Song, in *Yin*. From Yao to the present—3,700 years—the sun has shifted three mansions. Extrapolating, nine thousand years hence, the sun will lodge in *Wu*; eighteen thousand years hence, it will return to *Zi*. Before Yao’s time, the pattern must have been the same. Hence, Li Chunfeng, finding ancient calendars’ cycles and epochs inconsistent in their divisions, established a unified method. Yi Xing, noting four long and three short months in the lunar cycle, determined regional variations in eclipses. Xu Mao accounted for solar eclipses’ qi, refining the three temporal discrepancies. Yao Shunfu recognized the approximate nature of eclipse maxima, attributing the changing residual discrepancies to celestial images, and noted that precession was slower in high antiquity and faster in later ages. Observations from the Tang and Song to the present confirm his theory.\n\nAncients divided the 360-odd hours of a year into twelve qi and seventy-two hou, forming a month. Yet each month’s new moon spans only 356 hours and a fraction. A single qi exceeds fifteen days. Thus, long months are called “qi surplus,” short months “deficient,” and the new moon “void.” This refers not only to the waxing and waning of the sun and moon at conjunction and eclipse but also to the five planets’ cyclical fluctuations. The five planets, too, vary in speed relative to the sun: near the sun, they move swiftly; far, slowly. When slowest, they pause; after lingering, they retreat. Initially retreating slowly, they gradually accelerate, then slow again. When retreat halts, they pause, then resume direct motion at their swiftest, aligning with the sun’s path.\n\nJupiter moves fastest at one degree every four days; Mars, five degrees in seven days; Saturn, one degree in seven days. These three planets’ speeds are slower than the sun’s, so after conjunction, the sun leads them: Jupiter appears at dawn when thirteen degrees from the sun, Mars at nineteen degrees, and Saturn at eighteen and a half degrees. Generally, they pause once near and twice far, then retreat halfway through their celestial circuit. Jupiter first pauses at 109 degrees from the sun; first retreats at 131 degrees. Mars first pauses at 134 degrees; first retreats likewise. Saturn first pauses at 94 degrees; first retreats at 128 degrees. During their fastest retrograde motion, they oppose the sun. Retrogression ceases, they pause, then resume direct motion.\n\nVenus moves fastest at five degrees in four days; Mercury, two degrees in one day. Venus does not exceed forty degrees from the sun; Mercury, twenty-four degrees. Far from the sun, they move slowly; near, swiftly. Jupiter and Mars, being large, appear near the sun; Saturn, Venus, and Mercury, being small, appear farther. These are the five planets’ constant measures.\n\nEven the most sagely and divine may know adversity. Shun faced peril at the well and granary; King Wen was imprisoned at Youli; the Duke of Zhou resided in the east for two years; Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai; Laozi was challenged while transforming the Hu; the Tathāgata carved his flesh for bandits. Are not even the sagest and most divine subject to fortune’s vicissitudes? Likewise, lesser scholars may suffer affliction. Those who study the Dao yet fail to act are but shallow learners.\n\nWithout diligence, the Dao cannot be accomplished; if the Dao is not accomplished, afflictions and misfortunes will arrive. Whenever such calamities occur, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times—those of shared qi are of the same kind. Being of the same kind, they must unite in heart; only when their hearts are aligned can matters be resolved.\n\nThe worldly know how to read scriptures but not how to recite them in cycles. Reading scriptures seeks blessings; reciting them in cycles seeks the elixir. When the scriptures are fully recited, blessings arrive; when the elixir is achieved, virtue is profound. Thus it is said: \"Blessings and virtue descend at once.\" These scriptures speak of boundless words to universally deliver the limitless, yet their intent lies in the scriptures and centers on the elixir.\n\nThe primordial Brahma qi is the Way of the Returned Elixir. From the highest-rooted sagely scholars to the lowest and most foolish, if even petty men can believe, accept, and practice it, all may ascend to the sacred rank. Thus it is said: \"Universally deliver the limitless.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nForm has number and ends in exhaustion,\nUntil it reaches formlessness and the great void.\nIf one asks what formlessness resembles,\nThe whole body rests within a millet-like pearl.\n\nThe Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet fulfilled, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected beings should burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf to deliver the corpse according to the method. Then the hun-soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to the merit of their studies, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days, escaping the turning wheel of rebirth and attaining immortality.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This speaks of those of lesser attainment who hear the Dao late in life. Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet fulfilled, who fail to practice with courage and diligence, and whose years are already advanced with waning essence and qi—unaware that the thirtieth night of the twelfth month has arrived—have no recourse but to employ the methods of seizing a vessel or entering a womb. Seizing a vessel and entering a womb are two distinct matters. Though this method belongs to the side gates, those who attain it may still deliver their corpse, ensuring their true nature does not fall into the cycle of rebirth. Such as the Fifth Patriarch entering the womb of the Zhou family, or Song Jing entering the Golden Lord’s household. Thus it is said: \"To deliver the corpse according to the method.\" Yet this requires fellow students and perfected beings to protect and guide them, so the hun-soul may ascend directly to the Southern Palace. Like the Fourth Patriarch inscribing for the Fifth, or Lü Dongbin delivering Song Jing—these are fellow students and perfected beings.\n\n\"According to the merit of their studies\" means that among those who cultivate and study, merit varies in depth. Thus, according to the depth of their merit, the number of days until rebirth is calculated. Though they pass through the turning wheel, their true nature remains undestroyed. When the Great Elixir of Golden Liquor is achieved, they attain immortality.\n\n**Verse:**\nRebirth is calculated by days according to merit,\nWhen merit is complete at eight hundred, the golden countenance appears.\nIn the wondrous realm of the Great Luo,\nThose who believe in the Dao know form is but emptiness.\n\nThe Dao states: When the heavens and earth reach their destined end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the ruler of the state faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When masters and friends pass away, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. Above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the people. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is said: \"Boundless, universally delivering gods and humans.\"\n\nMaster Shangyang said: \"The heavens and earth reach their destined end.\" Interpreted through the Dao’s application, great cultivators compare the heavens and earth to the body. If the Returned Elixir is achieved but merit is not accumulated, one cannot ascend bodily in broad daylight. Thus, they may grow weary of the mundane world, choosing to feign illness and depart, shed their form and leave, or merely attain the method of corpse liberation—all are called \"reaching their destined end.\" If taken literally as the heavens and earth truly reaching their end, how many people would remain? Who would perform purification rites, burn incense, or recite scriptures?\n\n\"When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times\"—this refers to the dissipation of the body’s spirit and qi, causing the ears and eyes to grow dim. The sun, moon, and five planets correspond to the seven orifices of the body. The *Scripture of the Three Luminaries* states: \"If the ears listen recklessly, sounds and colors corrupt the person; if the eyes gaze upon evil, the true light dims; if the nose smells foulness, the Jade Perfection is not pure; if the mouth consumes杂味, the body suffers many illnesses. Thus, illness enters through the mouth, and fortune is lost through the senses. If you guard against these, your life will endure like heaven.\"\n\n\"When the four seasons lose their proper order\"—if the true qi deviates from principle, yin and yang fall out of harmony. Master Peng said: \"If the yang fire exceeds its measure, drought and flood disrupt the seasons, and midwinter turns to scorching heat. If the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other, and midsummer brings thick frost. When the Golden Palace fails to sprout cinnabar and mercury, the cauldron breeds insects and pests. In great cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon boil over; in minor cases, violent rain and whirlwinds arise, the Kan man and Li woman flee in chaos.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: What the Most High calls \"performing purification rites, burning incense, and reciting scriptures\" refers to refining qi with an empty mind, nurturing the spirit by following its nature, and cultivating the true. All the above are applications of the Dao. In worldly terms, when the heavens and earth reach their destined end, the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm undergo a great kalpa and are consumed by fire. The Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm undergo a great kalpa and are swept away by water. The Four Heavens of the Formless Realm undergo a great kalpa and are destroyed by wind. When these Three Realms are utterly destroyed, the Lord of Heaven selects one person from the Heaven of Seeded People to descend and repopulate the world—hence it is called the Heaven of Seeded People. From this perspective, the heavens and earth indeed have a time of destined end.\n\nWhen the stellar lodges fall into disarray and the sun and moon lose their proper times of dusk and dawn, the ancients, gazing up at the celestial patterns, observed that the rising and setting of the stars at dawn and dusk gradually diverged from their usual courses. They likened the celestial sphere to a round melon, which, having twelve segments, divides the circumference of the heavens—365¼ degrees—into twelve equal parts. Each segment thus spans thirty degrees, forty-three minutes, and seventy-five seconds. Every degree converges like spokes toward the north and south celestial poles, narrowing as it approaches the two ends, with the broadest span at the melon’s equatorial belt. This equatorial belt is called the Celestial Equator. Degrees along the Celestial Equator measure a full degree in width, but as one moves farther from the equator, the degrees grow progressively narrower, though they retain the name of a degree, they no longer span the full width of the equatorial belt. Each degree is reckoned by the distance stars of the twenty-eight lodges, forming what is called celestial longitude. Longitude divides east and west, while latitude divides north and south, both measured by their proximity to the two poles. The distance between the two poles is 182 degrees, 62 minutes, and 50 seconds. The Celestial Equator, running horizontally, lies equidistant from both poles at 91 degrees, 31 minutes, and 25 seconds. The zenith is called Songgao. The north celestial pole deviates 55 degrees and some minutes north of Songgao, while the south celestial pole, though hidden beneath the earth’s center, also deviates 55 degrees and some minutes to the south. The Celestial Equator tilts 36 degrees south of Songgao, with its sides aligning with the due east and west positions.\n\nThe sun, moon, and stellar lodges are not fixed to the heavens but instead traverse the void by virtue of the transformative qi of the great Dao, much as fish do not cling to the earth but swim through rivers by virtue of water. During the Northern Qi dynasty, Zhang Zixin observed the heavens for many years and discerned that the Five Planets exhibit cycles of advance and retreat. He thus adjusted the standard calculations to determine their daily positions. The Five Planets do not follow the Yellow Road nor the moon’s Nine Paths but instead move within and beyond the Yellow Road. Each of the Five Planets has its own course, and their speed varies with their distance from the sun, much as a traveler’s pace fluctuates with fatigue. They are also subject to additional variations, like the twists and turns of a road. The greatest deviation for Jupiter is over seven degrees; for Mars, over twenty-five degrees; for Saturn, over eight degrees; for Venus, over four degrees; and for Mercury, over six degrees. The paths of Luo, Ji, and the comet-like Bo do not vary in speed. Luo and Ji follow the moon, intersecting the Yellow Road to determine the beginnings and endings of lunar nodes. Between these intersections, Luo and Ji each move retrograde by one degree, forty-six minutes, and thirty seconds. The comet-like Bo follows the moon’s cycles of waxing and waning. The Purple Qi arises from the intercalary method: over twenty-eight years with ten intercalary months, the Purple Qi completes a circuit of the twelve celestial palaces. The Purple Qi is the Auspicious Star. Historical annotations describe it as resembling a half-moon, appearing only when a ruler possesses virtue and sagely wisdom.\n\nThe stationary segments of the stars complete one revolution around the earth each day, moving in tandem with the heavens by one degree. Those that move swiftly appear slow in comparison, while those that move slowly appear swift; those that retreat appear exceedingly swift. When their motion falls short of the heavens’ pace, the degrees they traverse mark the conjunction of the sun and moon at the same celestial longitude. A solar eclipse occurs at the new moon when the sun and moon share the same longitude but not the same latitude, resulting in conjunction without eclipse. If, however, the moon crosses the sun’s Yellow Road at the same longitude, and both share latitude, then conjunction brings an eclipse. Some claim that all ten luminaries can eclipse the sun, but this is incorrect. The sun itself is never consumed; it is merely obscured for a time by the moon’s dark body, leading the world to call it an eclipse, though the sun suffers no harm. The extent of the obscuration depends on the two points where the sun’s and moon’s paths intersect. If they meet precisely at an intersection, the moon’s body fully covers the sun’s, plunging the world into deep darkness—this is called a total eclipse. If they share longitude but are before or after the intersection, an eclipse is still visible, though the closer to the intersection, the greater the eclipse, and the farther, the lesser.\n\nThe sun and moon move at different speeds, sometimes converging, sometimes diverging; as they depart from the intersection, light is restored. A lunar eclipse occurs at the full moon when the sun and moon are in opposition, dividing the Yellow Road in half. The Yellow Road has two intersections; if the full moon does not occur at either, no eclipse takes place. If the full moon is near the intersections, the moon will eclipse. The extent of the eclipse is determined by its proximity to the intersection. At this time, the moon is in the sky while the sun is beneath the earth, and no other luminary can eclipse it. Yet why does the moon lose its light? Though the moon reflects the sun’s brilliance, when it lies within the bounds of the two intersections, directly opposite the sun in both longitude and latitude, the intensity of the sunlight overwhelms it, causing the moon to darken—an excess of yang leading to its own reversal. This is a lunar eclipse. According to the *Shoushi* calendar, if the full moon occurs within thirteen degrees of an intersection, an eclipse will not occur; beyond this limit, an eclipse takes place.\n\nThus, the ancients named the region opposite the sun’s illumination the \"dark void,\" as if it were the sun’s shadow, causing the moon to lose its light—though no such shadow exists. The term is a forced designation, hence called \"void,\" for it is not truly substantial. If the sun and moon conjoin at night or oppose each other during the day, eclipses may occur, but if they have already set beneath the earth, they remain unseen—this is what is meant by the sun and moon losing their proper times of dusk and dawn. In such cases, one should likewise perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe sun is yang, the moon is yin; yang governs virtue, yin governs punishment. Those who rule states and households fear, when the sun eclipses, that virtue has not been cultivated, and when the moon eclipses, that punishment has been misapplied.\n\nThus, when the sun eclipses, cultivate virtue; when the moon eclipses, rectify punishment—yet one should also perform purification rites, recite scriptures, and offer prayers to avert calamity. What is meant by \"averting\" is to observe celestial patterns, discern temporal anomalies, and take precautionary measures in advance. When the four seasons lose their proper measure and yin and yang fall out of harmony—\n\nInterpreting this through worldly principles: since antiquity, the solstices and equinoxes have marked the divisions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, with winter solstice as the head of the four seasons, for it is the Way of yang. Ancient calendars established the *yuan*, *ji*, *bu*, *zhang*, and precise calculations. The *zhang* governs the harmonization of years, months, days, and hours, each with its own function. The *hours* are the twelve earthly positions traversed by the sun; the *day* is one full cycle of the sun’s rising and setting; the *month* is the waxing and waning of the moon from beginning to end; the *year* is one cycle of cold and heat, flourishing and withering; the *zhang* is the conjunction of solstice and new moon in a single hour; the *bu* is their conjunction at the *zi* hour; the *ji* is their conjunction on a *jiazi* day at the *zi* hour; the *yuan* is their conjunction in a *jiazi* year, on a *jiazi* day, at the *jiazi* hour. One hundred *mang* make a *hao*, one hundred *hao* make a *miao*, one hundred *miao* make a *fen* (a *ke*). Twenty-five *ke* make three hours, twelve hours make a day, thirty days make a month, twelve months make a year, nineteen years make one *zhang*, four *zhang* make one *bu*, twenty *bu* make one *ji*, and three *ji* make one *yuan*—thus one *yuan* spans four thousand five hundred and sixty years. At the beginning of a *yuan*, the winter solstice sun resides in *zi*; when the *yuan* is complete, the winter solstice sun moves to *mao*; when two *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun returns to *wu*; when three *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun resides in *you*; and when four *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun returns to *zi*—thus four *yuan* comprise eighteen thousand two hundred and forty years. The sun’s return to its origin accumulates six thousand seven hundred and twenty intercalary months, for each *zhang* contains seven intercalary months.\n\nWhen the four seasons lose their proper measure and yin and yang fall out of harmony: in spring, the state is beset by fear and the people suffer epidemics; in summer, crops fail to ripen and women endure misfortune; in autumn, the people grow cruel and suffer from *è* (sneezing) and *tì* (hiccups); in winter, plagues abound and chronic illnesses arise—all these are the result of yin and yang falling out of harmony. One should likewise perform purification rites and recite scriptures to summon the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the ruler of a state faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, if the realm enjoys great peace, the state prospers and the people live in security—this is the blessing of one man, upon which the multitudes depend. But if the state is beset by turmoil and military campaigns arise in succession, ministers and subjects must devote their loyalty and efforts to repay their sovereign.\n\nTeachers and friends—one must never forget their kindness. The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. *Zhai* (purification) is the cleansing of the heart; *jie* (precepts) is the severance from worldly attachments. To have scriptures without precepts is like having fish without a fishing line.\n\nIn ancient times, Lord Lao transmitted the Five Precepts to Master Yin, and the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts to the Perfected One. The Celestial Master’s Seventy-Two Precepts, the Supreme Clarity’s Twenty-Four Precepts, the Ten Precepts for Cultivating the Real, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected, the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure, and the Orthodox One’s Five Precepts—though many are recorded in scriptures and repentance texts, all place the restraint of desire at their head. Thus Lord Lao said: \"If one can fully uphold the precepts within and harmonize one’s light without, one may approach the precipice of spiritual transcendence. Only when desire is utterly purified can success be achieved—then one’s blessings in life and death will be boundless.\"\n\nThe ode says:\nThe merit of delivering beings is vast, its fruits boundless,\nEach phrase distinct, fostering good affinity.\nFrom the kalpas of the Primordial Beginning, teachers and friends,\nNow gather in the Great Canopy Heaven.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the rulers of Heaven and Earth and the multitudes of people—on days of calamity, if one resolves to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their names, the myriad spirits will attend and protect them, and those of exceptional attainment will become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Sovereign. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people with flawless precision. Even the Demon Kings of Heaven will vouch for such a one, and those who attain the Dao will thoroughly comprehend the ultimate teachings.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Whoever possesses this scripture—*jing* (scripture) is the Dao. All those who embody the Dao align their virtue with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, and their essence with the workings of creation. Whether for state, household, others, or oneself, performing the meritorious deeds within this scripture will cause all the heavens to record their names, and the myriad spirits to attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment—those who have accumulated merit and diligence—will become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Sovereign. Such as the Celestial Master Zhengyang and the Perfected Lord Fuqiu, whose Dao was complete and virtue lofty, both became ministers of the Golden Gates.\n\nStudents of cultivation should act with courage upon encountering goodness, and correct their faults upon recognizing them. Correcting faults ensures the unseen protection of the divine, while accumulating goodness elevates one’s merit and virtue. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without omission. If one’s merit is great and virtue profound, even the Demon Kings of Heaven will vouch for them. Those who attain the Dao are those who have heard the Dao—they must thoroughly comprehend the scripture’s essence to achieve the ultimate teachings of immortality.\n\nThe ode says:\nWhoever possesses this scripture refines the elixir,\nUpon its completion, they ascend the mysterious threshold.\nThree thousand merits and deeds are but secondary,\nIn the Golden Gates’ halls, they bow before the Jade Countenance.\n\nAmong the Great Brahma Hidden Words of the Myriad Sounds in the Heavens, *The Scripture of the Heavenly Duke* states: In the Palace of the Great Canopy Heaven, there is *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter*, known as *Guangsheng Gaoying*. There are also the Dragon Script and Phoenix Seal, known as *Zhengwen Guanjue Yulan*. And there is *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter*, known as *Danlou Acang*. Though the scriptures speak of the many heavens, they are still bound by kalpas. Thus the Jade Clarity Dao Lord composed *The Three Chapters of the Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Writ*, inscribing them in coagulated clouds, each character a *zhang* in width and height, with eight-pointed rays, to stabilize the Thirty-Two Heavens. The three chapters mentioned above were all transmitted by the Dao Lord and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign.\n\nLater, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, admiring these recondite sounds, further expounded *The Numinous Writ of the Lower Chapter*, known as *Senjiao Chuyun*. Thus there came to be four chapters. Yet today, people speak only of the Middle Chapter and recite neither the Upper nor the Lower—could it be that the heavens guard their secrets jealously, so that the lower world seldom hears of them?\n\n*The Scripture of Inner Sound* states: The Primordial Celestial Honored One preached the Dao in the Red Clarity World at Cypress Mound, with the assembled Perfected in attendance. Clouds and mists surged thickly for three days and nights, and the dark *yin* did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs addressed the Celestial Honored One, saying: \"Never before have we witnessed the Celestial Honored One expound the teachings. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails—what is the reason?\" The Celestial Honored One replied: \"This is the auspicious response of the many heavens, a numinous manifestation of the natural Way. The jade characters blaze with radiance, obscuring the light of heaven.\" He commanded all present to close their eyes and listen reverently. In an instant, the celestial *qi* suddenly parted, and the gloom vanished. Suddenly, a numinous writ appeared in the void above, each character a *zhang* in width and height. The Celestial Honored One proclaimed to the assembly: \"This Numinous Writ of the Eight Convergences—its purport is profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail. I shall command the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to interpret its sounds, so as to instruct those among the many heavens who are destined to attain the Dao, achieve Perfection, and bear the name of immortals.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, obeying the luminous command of the Celestial Honored One, first unsealed *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter*. He beheld only *Guangsheng Gaoying*, its literary splendor dazzling, beyond all scrutiny. Next, he unsealed *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* and saw *Zhengwen Guanjue Yulan*, each character eight-pointed with trailing rays, their luminous essence overwhelming the eye. Then he unsealed *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter* and at last beheld *Danlou Acang*, each character a *zhang* in width, its golden light penetrating and radiant.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign sighed deeply with sorrow and dared not venture questions. After a long while, he said: \"*The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter* and *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* are secrets of the celestial palaces. The kalpas have not yet run their course, and the mysteries of the Great Dao ought not to be heard in the lower world. Yet in *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter*, I humbly perceive the great compassion of the Celestial Honored One. The Three and Five have met their destined time, and the True Dao should now be practiced. Thus he revealed the numinous sounds, imparting teachings to those who have not yet heard. Therefore, the Upper Chapter and the Dragon Script must not be lightly disclosed as profound secrets. Only the Middle Chapter, following the interpretations of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and with minor additions and omissions, allows those in later ages to glimpse the hidden mysteries of the scripture.\"\n\nOther versions place *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter* and *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* after the Lower Chapter—this is incorrect. Here it is corrected:\n\n*The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter of the Primordial Beginning* — composed by the Dao Lord.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East:\nVast and life-generating, their radiance soars high, awakening the primordial through emptiness. Responding to the Nine Perfected of Mystery, their transformative interplay begins the cosmic design. As numinous forces interweave and structures take form, they establish the ancestral model of the Mystic Capital. Embracing all transformations in their totality, their majestic power manifests spontaneously. Traversing peaks and shifting light, the Imperial Dao enfolds luminosity. The celestial jade gleams with authority, its qi crystallizing to nurture souls. Merging and unfolding, the circular essence conceals itself within the heavens. Awaiting the embrace of the colossal spirits, the grand net proclaims tranquility.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the South:\nFlourishing with blazing brilliance, they firmly unfold and clarify their lineage. The empty image of Mystery’s blossom, the Dragon-Yang dances across the vault. Subtle life arises in the dawn’s splendor, while the profound and vast congeal in stillness. The Three Nodes of the Primordial Pass, the Great Brahma soars through space. Hidden awakening brings abundant growth, as celestial kinship celebrates its manifestation. Divine portals entwine in networks, dispersing the essence of True Origin. In purity they grasp the obscure illumination, revolving and ascending in union. Guiding the soaring clouds in festive repose, the numinous response ascends to heaven.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the West:\nFirm and lustrous, subtly restrained, their yin stands solitary in solemnity. Piercing qi illumines purity, as the imperial cavern unfolds its subtlety. Encompassing transformation in hidden response, the Emperor’s Terrace clarifies the void. Extending peace to distant realms, they honor the flourishing Child’s Pool. Binding the whirlwind to nurture, their beauty remains undispersed. Yang connects to the Hundred and Six, as submerged radiance conceals its steps. In the vast and silent obscurity, the true peaks gather the numinous. Firm and majestic, they follow the Dao, proclaiming their mandate to the soaring forests.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\nThe Dragon’s Peace transforms in hidden change, Pure Yang conceals itself in mystery. The square root returns to qi, as images submit to the lofty round. Divine transformations bestow benevolent change, refining the numinous root. The Red Essence embodies the pure Dao, assuming the title of Majestic Honored One. Beneficent clouds accompany the eternal, amidst the Central Mound of kalpas. Towering jade fortresses, their odes resound in joyous flow. Receiving their positions in the Jade Chamber, the Great Statute penetrates the obscure. The Mystic Chapters gleam and scatter, as the net’s wheel completes its cycle.\n\nThe Dragon-Script and Phoenix-Seal Orthodox Text — Composed by the Dao Lord\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East:\nContemplation awakens in lush abundance, the Great Radiance of Purple Numinosity. Nine spirits ferry souls, opening the jade perfection of creation. Ah Yi shines resplendently, as flying heavens stream their sounds. The wheel of light becomes the Emperor’s constancy, as the capital’s numen attains fulfillment. The vast expanse of Great Possession, as auspicious clouds initiate the numinous. The Seven Luminaries illuminate demons, spreading tranquility in flourishing glory. At the summit of emptiness and non-being, heaven’s mandate extends boundlessly. The Four Exhalations round the images, washing and ascending in radiant essence.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the South:\nResplendent and blazing, penetrating Yang, floating light becomes jade’s brilliance. The Seven Numinous Ones chant their odes, as the kalpic origin establishes the Purple Hall. The net’s essence scatters light, illuminating the Jade Chamber. The Eight Sceneries gather their beasts, as the Shao Jade captures essence. The Nine Capitals soar in lush abundance, giving flight to the upper numina. The dense net purifies the realm, nurturing the empty wheel. Irrigating the Yellow Blossom, the vast movement revolves in mystic clarity. The divine palace unfolds in vastness, extending the cinnabar courtyard.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the West:\nThe Great Plan floats in light, as true stability transforms the origin. Graceful and subtle, the jade beam clarifies the mist. Towering and erect, they bind the valleys, as light nets the Seven Coils. The Three Treasuries flourish in elegance, streaming radiance through the Nine Mysteries. Serene and distant in emptiness, flying blossoms brush the canopy. Dawn overflows the green registers, as the Great Desert extends its course. The Aligned Mounds ascend ninefold, as six dragons dance upon the axle. Lush and misty, the floating net, as purple essence perfumes the abyss.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\nThe Primordial Expanse of Great Possession, as the Nine Mechanisms transform Qian. Covering forms with profound virtue, the Primordial River submerges its essence. Nurturing the flourishing Mingtu, as light and stars drift in subtle clouds. The Great Hidden One oversees all, as the flourishing music guards heaven. The Purple Void of the Mingtu Mound, as kalpic measures intersect in the forefront. Azure radiance chants the Brahma tones, drifting subtly through the origin. Six transformations revolve their measures, severing evil transgressions. Vast and tranquil in mystic desert, ten thousand crossings achieve immortality.\n\nThe above jade script, in Dragon-Script and Phoenix-Seal, comprises the hidden and taboo names of the inner heavens. Inscribed on jade tablets in golden script, they are secreted within the thirty-two palaces of heaven to guard the thirty-two heavens. Diligence in recitation and invocation ensures responsive resonance.\n\nThe Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter of the Primordial Beginning — Composed by the Dao Lord\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East:\nDanlou Acang, Wu Xiang Guanyin.\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Poutan.\nJiana Ayi, Huhe Liuyin.\nHuadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen.\nDaluo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun.\nFeisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen.\nWuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan.\nAtuo Longluo, Sixiang Xuyuan.\nDanlou Acang Wuhe Guanyin.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning wove these eight characters from Brahma qi into cloud-seals to guard the Heaven of August Antiquity. Within the Jade Capital stands the Danlou Tower, which upholds the Mystic Capital Palace, where the overseer of halls and towers is named Ana. The wandering terrace within heaven is called Cangwu, the realm of emptiness and non-being. *He* signifies the gate of sun and moon. *Guan* is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor. *Yin* denotes the sound of song. Thus, at each courtly assembly, Ana first ascends the tower, striking the great Dharma drum to gather the perfected of the heavens, paying homage to the Primordial Beginning in the realm of emptiness and non-being, opening the gate of sun and moon. The Primordial Beginning commands the Heavenly Emperor to observe and oversee the Register of Longevity, leading the host of perfected to ascend the Cang Terrace, chanting the sounds of the Cavern Chapters to initiate the deliverance of heavenly beings.\n\nThe Upper Yang Master states: The jade script of the Numinous Writ is another name for the Golden Elixir, hence it is called the Middle Chapter. Its explanatory phrases elucidate the wondrous workings of the Reverted Elixir, thus they are termed hidden language. At this stage, the practitioner must first possess the eye of wisdom, for there will surely be points of realization.\n\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Poutan—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Jade Perfection. The gate of this heaven is named Xuyan, and its capital overseer is titled Mingshou. The Four Perfected Ones are named Falan Poutan. Whenever a great kalpic transition occurs, the Primordial Beginning commands Xuyan to open the Jade Treasury, admitting the immortals and sages, while Mingshou guides the heavens to sustain Brahma qi. Thereupon, the Dharma Wheel draws the registers, embracing awakening to ferry souls; the Bodhi Wheel turns, as Poutan raises the banner. Naturally, the Nine Earths radiate light, and all practitioners receive deliverance.\n\nJiana Ayi, Huhe Liuyin—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Harmonious Youth. Jiana oversees the registers, the Perfected One Ayi of the Seven-Jewel Jade Grove. *Hu* is the inner name of the Flying Heavenly Divine King. *He* interprets as invoking the Primordial Beginning as Mahā.\n\n\"Flow\" signifies dissemination; \"chant\" signifies song. The Primordial Beginning exhales the qi of the primordial Brahma, filling the Seven-Jewel Grove of Ayi, naturally forming numinous sounds that flow and spread through the ten thousand heavens. Jiana raises the registers to determine life and death, while the Flying Heavenly Great Sage delivers the celestial beings.\n\nHuadu Quli, these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Harmonious Nurture. *Hua* refers to the Eastern Marchmount’s Azure Flower Capital, also named the Gate of the Great One’s Azure Flower. *Du* signifies the hymns of cavernous chapters. *Qu* is the name of a Jade Maiden. *Li* denotes auspicious clouds. *Pu* is the name of a tower. *Yu* is the imperial taboo name. *Zhen* means \"to arrive.\" The Primordial Beginning, dwelling in the Great One’s Azure Flower Capital, commands the immortals and sages to lead the Jade Maidens, ascending the Pu Tower to chant cavernous hymns as auspicious clouds gather on all sides and the Yu Emperor first arrives. The long night is enlightened, demons are summoned, and immortals are raised.\n\nDaluo, these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Literary Elevation. *Daluo* is the name of a palace courtyard. *Great Brahma* refers to the hymn of amnesty. *Scattered mist and auspicious clouds* signify the Brahma qi within the heavens. As the Primordial Beginning roams the courtyard of Daluo, opening the Great Brahma’s amnesty, pardoning sinful souls, and gathering the primordial qi, the Brahma qi returns to its origin, coalescing into propitious mist and auspicious clouds to return to the Golden Womb’s divine chamber.\n\nFeisa Yudu, these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Majestic Tranquility. *Fei* denotes the Flying Ones; *sa*, divine swiftness; *yu*, Jade Perfected; *du*, Fengdu. *Ming* signifies command; *mo*, demon kings; *shangmen*, the Golden Gate of the Supreme Emperor. The Primordial Beginning, with the Flying Heavenly Host of Sages, expounds the wondrous Dao from the Dragon Han to the Yan Kang eras, swiftly and divinely, completing the assembly in an instant. At this time, the Jade Perfected opens the long night’s repository, Fengdu delivers souls from the eight adversities, and the demon kings are commanded to escort and present themselves at the Supreme Emperor’s Golden Gate.\n\nWuxing Shangshou, these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Transcendent Balance. The Primordial Beginning, with the wondrous Dao of emptiness and non-being, circulates the Brahma qi, binding the eight poles, and above, envelops the heavens of Miro. At the head stands the palace of the Northern Emperor. When the great kalpic transition occurs and the destined cycle completes, the Supreme Emperor returns the flowing radiance of dawn, treading the dark void to disseminate transformation.\n\nAtuoluo Long, these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Veiled Brilliance. *A* is the name of a mountain in heaven; *tuo*, the name of a tower within the mountain; *long*, the name of the Empty Peak Mountain; *luo* signifies the light of sun and moon—thus the Heavenly Perfected call the sun Zhuoluo. *Four* refers to the four extremities; *xiang*, the chariot of symbols; *xu*, the taboo name of the Southern Flourishing Emperor; *yun*, the name of the solar child.\n\nThe A Mountain and Dragon Mountain, their forces interlinked, their qi conjoined with the Jade Purity, ascend in ninefold turns to connect with the Tower of Tuo, where the light of sun and moon shines universally upon the four extremities. The Perfected all ride the chariot of symbols to descend and ferry learners, guiding them to pay homage to the Southern Cinnabar Yu Emperor and seek the fire of true yang, refining and delivering their living bodies. The Yu Emperor then commands the solar child bearing the flower of ninefold yang golden essence to bathe and refine their forms, as explained above, transforming the mortal to attain sagehood.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable, moved by compassion for the benighted, bestows this numinous script of jade characters and hidden language, so that superior practitioners may follow the Way of the Numinous Script and attain sudden enlightenment; middling practitioners may hear the mystery of the jade characters and cultivate gradually; and lesser practitioners may recite the scripture of hidden language to seek blessings—this is called the wondrous subtlety of the Great Brahma’s Numinous Treasure.\n\n*Eulogy:*\nHow wondrous the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure Delivering Humanity*!\nCloud-seal celestial chapters are concealed in the Jade Purity.\nThe radiant capital of A spreads flowing Brahma qi,\nAnd the netherworld, upon hearing this, gains rebirth.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the South**\n**Nanyan Dongfu**, Jade Eyes shimmering.\nThe Brahma form descends into emptiness; the Nine Numinous advance.\nThe Terrace of Duo and Wei, the Green Gauze of the Great Thousand.\nVast and boundless, the Nine Uglies; the Shao chants wind along the margin.\nAbove the clouds, the Nine Capitals—flying life soars of itself.\nNayu’s lush fragrance, Mara’s Dharma Wheel.\nThe Mirrorless Pool of Hong; seizing posture, moving countenance.\nFragrance bright and expansive; the divine tassel self-contained.\n\n**Nanyan Dongfu, Jade Eyes shimmering**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Harmonious Yang. The Southern Cinnabar Heavenly Realm holds the Court of Flowing Fire, where flying portals blaze across the eight directions. At its center lies the Cavernous Yang Palace, where fiery qi flames upon the jade pupils, the rich essence of fire flourishing in great splendor. Light and brilliance intermingle to refine and deliver learners.\n\n**The Brahma form descends into emptiness; the Nine Numinous advance**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Reverent Florescence. From the Dragon Han kalpa to the Yan Kang kalpa, from eon to eon, the Primordial Beginning transforms and gives life to beings, all congealing the great Brahma qi to form their shapes. A single spirit manifests without undergoing gestation, born from emptiness. The Nine Numinous Perfected of the Jade Capital scatter golden flowers upon the Terrace of Advancement, whistling and chanting cavernous hymns to deliver heavenly beings.\n\n**The Terrace of Duo and Wei, the Green Gauze of the Great Thousand**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Ancestral Drift. *Duo* is the name of a mountain in heaven; *Wei* is the inner taboo name of the Dao Lord. *Pu* is the inner sound of the flying heavens; *Terrace* refers to the jade terrace on the southern slope of Duo Mountain. *Green Gauze* is the name of the Jade Consort of the Moon Palace. The Jade Concubine of Broad Cold is named Luo Ying; the solar child of the Sun Palace is named Zhuoluo; the numinous child of Fusang is named Yun. The *Great Thousand* refers to the Southern Jambu Continent as the Great Thousand World. A thousand worlds form a Small Thousand; a thousand Small Thousands form a Middle Thousand; a thousand Middle Thousands form a Great Thousand. Speaking thrice of thousands, it is called the Three Thousand. Duo Mountain is where all dragons submit; at its center lies the Yellow Chamber, the dwelling of the Wei Lord. From eon to eon, it neither perishes nor arises, and in due time, it leads the flying heavenly sages to ascend the Jade Terrace, sing cavernous hymns, and deliver heavenly beings. The Green Gauze Jade Consort illuminates the Great Thousand World; her form is like jade, beautiful yet not alluring. She rides the great Brahma qi, governing the calculations of the Great Yin to correspond with the celestial origin, without error. When the great kalpic transition occurs and sun and moon converge, the Jade Terrace conceals its light and silently shines, awaiting the reopening of the kalpic cycle. Those who restore the primordial transformation and refine their forms with golden liquid seek their starting point here.\n\n**Vast and boundless, the Nine Uglies; the Shao chants wind along the margin**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of August Reed Pipes. *Vast and boundless* describes the state of chaos. The *Nine Uglies* are mighty demonic beasts. *Shao* is the name of a demon king; *chants* refer to demonic songs. *Margin* is the inner taboo name of the Southern Dipper; *Zhan* is the hidden name of the Northern Dipper. Before heaven and earth divided, their state was vast and boundless; the nine demonic beasts of the Uglies were born equal to heaven, examining human good and evil. The demon king further sings songs to vex and test learners. If one dwells in the realm of desire yet remains steadfast in heart despite alluring beauty and seductive charm, transforming the realm of desire into the realm of the divine, turning desire into the pure mind of the Dao, then the Northern Dipper removes their name from the black register, and the Southern Dipper inscribes their name as an immortal, with the supervising office guiding them into this heaven. They seek the Golden Flower Mountain to obtain the Taiyi Unification Talisman and roam the various heavens in revelry.\n\n**Above the clouds, the Nine Capitals—flying life soars of itself**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Hallowed Radiance. *Above the clouds* is the taboo name of the Divine King; the *Nine Capitals* is the name of the Mystic Terrace. *Flying life* is the name of the Great God of Rebirth; *of itself* refers to entering the Forest of Soaring. The Flying Heavenly Divine King burns hundredfold harmonious incense above the clouds and scatters five-colored cloud flowers. The Jade Lad of the Great Perfected holds the Ten Absolute Banners, circling thrice daily. Each revolution of the banner gathers all the heavenly emperors beneath the Terrace of the Nine Capitals, who circumambulate the terrace thrice, chanting cavernous hymns to deliver learners. If one recognizes this song, the Great God of Rebirth opens the gate of deathlessness, flowing the qi of eternal life to refine their form and soul, and then recommends them to enter the Forest of Soaring and roam the Mystic Terrace. After twenty-four years, when their merit is complete, they may ascend to pay homage at the Mystic Capital.\n\n**Nayu’s lush fragrance, Mara’s Dharma Wheel**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Upright Tranquility. *Na* is the celestial attendant; *Yu* is the empty wheel of the heavenly gate. *Lush fragrance* is the immortal child of the Dipper; *Mara* is the demon king of heaven; *Dharma Wheel* is the Dharma Wheel of the heavenly palace. The attendant Na governs the qi of the four seasons, turning the empty wheel of the heavenly gate to regulate the divisions of heaven. When the great kalpic transition occurs, the Dharma Wheel turns ten times, and all spirits gather. The lushly fragrant one intones the rites, and with a single chant, all spirits bow in unison. The demon king sings the melody of the cavernous hymns to deliver learners.\n\n**The Mirrorless Pool of Hong; seizing posture, moving countenance**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Reverent Celebration, the abyss of the divine dragon. *Hong* is the name of the dragon abyss; *Chi* is the supervisor of the Dragon Abyss.\n\nThe Mirrorless is the name of a divine king; *Seizing Posture* is the name of the Heavenly Gate; *Moving Countenance* is the name of the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maiden. Nine dragons crouch in the abyss, and the Supervisor of the Dragon Abyss ever holds a golden flask, channeling the Yellow Flower Heavenly Primordial True Unity’s water from the Eastern Well to refine and temper the celestial beings. The Mirrorless opens the long-night repository to deliver their nine generations of ancestors, ascending beyond the Heavenly Gate. Thereafter, the Moving Countenance Jade Maiden guides the learners, refining them with the crimson numinous *qi* and bathing them in the fluid of Mysterious Harmony. Their bodies are transmuted, their forms infused. *Fragrant Radiance, Vast Brilliance*—these eight cloud-seals guard the Ultimate Jade Heaven. *Fragrant Radiance* is the name of the Mysterious Terrace Mountain; *Vast Brilliance* is the inner title of the divine lord. *Tassel* is the name of the Purple Tenuity numinous child; *Self-Palace* means ascending to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The divine lord Guo Yi was born together with the Primordial Beginning and is the ancestor of the mysterious *qi*. He ever chants the cavernous hymns upon the Fragrant Radiance Terrace, while the Tassel numinous child leads learners to ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace and pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. The greatly cultivated practitioner, having refined the self to purity, congeals the jade pupils into flowing fire-ointment, rides the green silk of the Great Brahma *qi*, and dwells within the realm of desire without the Nine Shameful Ones being able to examine his transgressions. Entering the Golden Flower, he immediately unites with the Grand Monad. The *Hong* Supervisor opens the refining ground; the Moving Countenance pours the fluid of Mysterious Harmony; the crimson numinous refines the substance; the Yellow Flower washes the form. Reborn and regenerated, guided by the Tassel, they ascend into the Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nThe ode says:\nHow wondrous the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity*!\nJade tablets and golden writ adorn the Highest Clarity.\nThe lushly fragrant one bows in reverence to intone the rites,\nWhile the divine lord Vast Brilliance safeguards the immortal name.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the West:**\n*Daoli Chanyou, Poni Joutong. Wansou Dise, Taimiao’s Hall. Liuluo Fanmeng, Jingwei Xiaoyu. Yimiao Wuji, Wanshou Shaodu. Alan Yuzhu, Huamo Yanyou. Jiukai Zibian, Anapin Shou. Wuliang Fugai, Fuluo Heshen.*\n\n*Daoli Chanyou* and *Poni Joutong*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Ascending Aperture. *Daoli* is the southern world; *Chan* is the name of the Li state; *You* is the name of the Lord of Good Birth. *Poni* is the name of the numinous child of the Cavernous Yang Palace; *Joutong* is the inner taboo of the demon king. In the *Daoli* world of the Li state’s Cavernous Yang Palace, the Primordial Beginning fired the true writ to illumine the myriad heavens, transforming this world into the Great Blessing Hall. All sinful souls are thereby enabled to ascend and enter. When learners attain the Dao, the Lord of Good Birth delivers their lives, Poni refines their souls, and the demon king Joutong reverently receives his charge, daring not obstruct the gate of life.\n\n*Wansou Dise* and *Taimiao’s Hall*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of August Precipice. *Wansou* is the inner title of the Heavenly Emperor; *Di* means to cleanse; *Se* refers to the realm of form. *Taimiao’s Hall* is the Great Blessing Hall within heaven, the secret repository of heaven wherein lies the great cavern’s natural writ. The Heavenly Emperor of August Precipice presides over the opening of the great desert’s scriptures, governing the heavenly *qi*. He often leads the various immortals to wander the realm of form. The various heavens enter and exit the Highest Clarity’s repository, cleansing impure *qi* and opening the path for learners. Those whose conduct is lofty may ride the cloud chariot to ascend and be born in Taimiao’s Hall.\n\n*Liuluo Fanmeng* and *Jingwei Xiaoyu*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Ultimate Wind. *Liu* is the taboo of the Heavenly King; *Luo* is the name of the Lunar Consort; *Fan* is the inner sound of the Flying Heavenly Perfected; *Meng* is the inner name of the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King. *Jinghuang* is the Highest Perfected of the Four Poles; *Weixiu* is the Perfected of the Radiant Empyrean; *Xiaoyu* is the palace of kalpic measure. This is the White Primordial Sovereign of the West, the Recondite Chamber Flowing Lord, who rectifies the *qi* of the Nine Empyreans. The Lunar Consort presides over the rites of feasting and wandering; the Flying Perfected opens the passes of the Nine Empyreans; the Meng Lord is the ancestor of the Brahma *qi*; the Jinghuang and Weixiu open and govern the Xiaoyu Palace. Only when learners comprehend this sound may they rein the cinnabar dragon’s bridle to ascend the terrace of the Nine August Ones.\n\n*Yimiao Wuji* and *Wanshou Shaodu*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Filial Purity. *Yimiao* is the taboo of the First Emperor; *Wuji* is the name of the heavenly courtyard. *Wanshou* is the inner sound of the Dao Lord; *Shaodu* is the name of the solar child. From the Dragon Han to the Vermilion Bright kalpa, the Heavenly Emperor of the First Beginning dwells in the courtyard of emptiness and silence, serving the Dao Lord to expound the profound and elucidate the wondrous Dharma to deliver humanity. The numinous child Shaodu flows with flying rosy clouds and irrigates with the essence of solar splendor.\n\n*Alan Yuzhu* and *Huamo Yanyou*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Floating Repose. *Alan* is the hidden taboo of the Heavenly Emperor; *Yumo* is the inner name of the demon king. *Zhu* is the realm of desire; *Hua* is the realm of form; *Mo* is the vast and distant; *Yan* is the courtyard of eastern ghosts; *You* is the chamber that restrains ghosts. The Yumo demon king appears and vanishes, sometimes dwelling in the realm of desire, sometimes in the realm of form, harassing and disturbing the heavenly beings, vast and distant and difficult to control. The Emperor Alan ascends the nine-tiered tower to chant the cavernous hymns and subdue them. Thereupon, the multitude of demons respond to the echo and bind themselves, while the host of ghosts prostrate their forms before You.\n\n*Jiukai Zibian* and *Anapin Shou*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Riverine Flow. Before heaven and earth were divided, the three *qi* were in chaos. When the nine openings first emerged, yin and yang, male and female naturally became distinct. The Emperor Aqiu ever ascends the Dragon Mountain’s Nine Mysteries capital to command the flying heavenly ones to roam the void, opening the path for those of good roots. Their souls are graded and ranked, entering the foremost rank of flying immortals.\n\n*Wuliang Fugai* and *Fuluo Heshen*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Joyous Music. *Wuliang* is the great sage of heaven; *Fu* is the name of the Lord of Regeneration; *Gai* is the name of this heavenly palace. *Fu* is the cry of the hidden souls; *Luo* is the Great Web; *He* means to join in celebration; *Shen* refers to the divine lord.\n\nThe Great Sage of *Wuliang* governs all flying heavens, who ascend and advance according to their graded ranks. The Lord of Regeneration resides in the *Gai* Palace, presiding over the registers of the Long Night, determining the roots of good and evil, and ferrying all hidden souls to the Great *Luo* Heaven to join the Divine Lord in celebration.\n\nThe eight characters *Yudan Changsang* and *Bokong Duxian* in cloud-seals guard the *Tan Shi* Heaven. *Yudan* is the Jade Capital; *Changsang* is the *Fusang* Forest of Ascending Trees; *Bo* is *Boling*; *Kong* is the Void; *Duxian* means to ferry humans to immortality. Within the Jade Capital stands the *Fusang* Forest of Ascending Trees, its canopy overspreading all heavens, its leaves inscribed with golden characters in purple script. Whenever the divine wind stirs the *fan hun* grasses, the forest sways with the music of a hundred pipes, just as when the Heavenly Worthy once expounded the *Dao* in *Boling*, and the trees spontaneously sang in the Void. A numinous rooster perches above, and when it crows, all roosters under heaven respond. Then, azure mists swirl upward, the sun ascends, and the flying *zhen* immortals, hearing the rooster’s first crow, mount the Jade Terrace. They gather the cloud-teeth of the five directions and inhale the light of the three dawns to ferry those who study immortality.\n\nThose of the highest root, single-minded in purity, though dwelling in the land of *Zhu Hua*, remain undisturbed by demonic chaos. They receive the *Shaodu*’s *guan zhen* elixir, attend the *Liuluo*’s feast, hear the *Sanglin*’s pipes, and bathe in the sun’s flowing radiance to refine the returning cinnabar.\n\n*Ode:*\nMarvelous is the *Lingbao Duren Jing*,\nIts eight corners casting rays to illumine the Great Clarity.\nThe Hall of the Subtle and Remote transcends the realm of form,\nBeneath the *Changsang* Forest, one imbibes the essence of flowers.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the North**\n*Juewu Ziyu* and *Jiu Ri Daoqian*—\n*Kunmu Dongfu* and *Xing She Shangxuan*—\n*Tuoluo Yumiao* and *Miaoqi Heyun*—\n*Feitian Dashou* governs the heavens above.\n*Satuo Jieliang*, *Longhan Yingxian*—\n*Biluo Fuli*, chanting in emptiness to preserve the precious.\nThe wicked and base, without rank, attain spontaneity in the wondrous Void.\nThe primordial *fàn* vast and boundless, in profound stillness, ferries humanity.\n\nThe eight characters *Juewu Ziyu* and *Jiu Ri Daoqian* in cloud-seals guard the *Xiaodu* Heaven. The flying heaven *Juewu* emerged from the primordial chaos of *Longhan Mingxing*, borne by the turning of the kalpa. At times, it accompanies the *Yu* Emperor in a phoenix chariot to roam the Nine Mysteries’ realm, revolving the nine mechanisms of destiny to align with the kalpa’s reckoning. When the great kalpa shifts, the Solar Flower Lad halts his radiance to transform and revolve the constant *qian* Dao of heaven, opening and guiding the harmonious *qi*.\n\nThe eight characters *Kunmu Dongfu* and *Xing She Shangxuan* in cloud-seals guard the *Yuandong* Heaven. *Kunmu* is the Great Yin’s Ninefold Numinous Immortal Mother; *Dongfu* is the name of the Eastern Sea’s water-governing deity; *Xing* is the earth’s mechanism; *She* means to summon; *Shang* is to report above; *Xuan* is the *Xuandu*.\n\nThe Ninefold Numinous Immortal Mother governs the Eastern Ultimate, the *Fuduo* Yang Valley’s abyss, holding dominion over the earth’s mechanism and revolving the primordial *qi*. When the Heavenly Pass and earth’s mechanism complete one revolution, the overflowing waters reach three thousand three hundred *du*; when this measure is exhausted, heaven and earth’s *qi* intermingle, the nine seas merge as one, and the waters inundate the heavens. The great deity *Dongfu* presides over the summit of Kunlun, filling the vast seas and traversing the source of the Eastern Well, ensuring the earth’s mechanism does not sink. When the kalpa shifts, the *Kun* Mother emerges from the Eastern Well, summoning the Bird Mother at the Dragon Gate to regulate the river’s source. Ascending before the Emperor, she reports the kalpa’s convergence, then bears the disciples in a phoenix chariot to ascend Kunlun and pay homage at *Xuandu*.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The *Miao Jing* is the foremost of the most wondrous scriptures. Among the eighteen thousand scrolls of the Daoist Canon, the wonder lies in the *Du Ren* scroll; within the *Du Ren Jing*, the wonder lies in the *Ling Shu* scroll. In the *Ling Shu*, these eight characters are revealed—how could the Primordial Beginning’s secret mysteries, so profoundly subtle, be so utterly exposed as to exhaust heaven’s mechanisms? The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, allows the world’s people to doubt or believe. Alas! The scripture is spoken for the perfected. Only the perfected can employ this scripture. Thus, the Elder of Qinghe praised it in verse:\n\n*Juewu* rides the turning to align with the *qian* origin,\nRevolving the nine revolutions to preserve heaven’s root.\nWhen the kalpa ends, the Bird Mother meets at the Dragon Gate,\nDisciples ride the phoenix to ascend Kunlun.\nThe Feathered Forest receives the talisman and bows to new grace,\nIn cloud robes ethereal, they pay homage at the Emperor’s hall.\nThe marvel of golden liquid and returning cinnabar—\nThe perfected behold this with discerning eyes.\n\n*Tuoluo Yumiao* and *Miaoqi Heyun*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Miaocheng* Heaven. *Tuo* is the name of a flying immortal; *luo* is the moon’s radiance; *yu* is the personal name of the *Miaocheng* Heaven’s lord; *miao* is the name of the Feathered Forest’s overseer. It is said that *Tuo* and *Yu* were both born on the Cloud Alas Ridge, embracing the moon’s light, and govern the Feathered Forest army. The Feathered Forest lies in the north, while the Cloud Alas Ridge is in the south. At times, the Emperor commands *Miao* to patrol the Three Realms, safeguarding and guiding those who study immortality to the Feathered Forest army to receive talismans and credentials. Their resplendent *fan qi* merges with the myriad heavens’ luminosity, weaving cloud-*qi* into robes and refining moonlight to fill their bellies.\n\nThe Great Ugly Flying Immortal and the *Zongjian Shangtian*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the Forbidden Upper Heaven. *Feitian* is the divine king; *Dashou* is the registrar of the ancestral ministry. *Zongjian* are the names of two deities under the Flying Immortal Divine King. *Shangtian* means ascending to heaven. The Flying Immortal Divine King oversees the kalpa’s revolutions in the Upper Heaven, managing the Three Realms’ ancestral ministry. At times, he commands the two *Zongjian* deities to record the Long Night’s repository, raising the dark souls to the heavenly realm to merge with the Dao and unite with the true.\n\n*Shatuo Jieliang* and *Longhan Yingshan*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Changrong* Heaven. This heaven contains the *Shalan* Palace. *Tuo* means hills; *jieliang* means measuring by the kalpa’s reckoning. *Longhan* is the name of the first kalpa; *ying* is the divine king’s personal name; *shan* is the Solar Lad’s name. The auspicious *Shalan* Palace rests upon the hills, a detached palace of the Jade Purity Purple Tenuity. Those newly received into the ranks of the delivered, whose merits remain incomplete, often number in the tens of thousands and dwell scattered within. All are people from the *Longhan* kalpa; as the kalpa’s revolutions shift, their merits are assessed to ascend to the upper palaces. If disciples comprehend this sound, *Ying* the Lord examines their conduct and merits to deliver them by rank, while the *Shan* Lad bathes them in solar essence to refine their forms.\n\n*Biluo Fuli* and *Kongge Baozhen*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Tengsheng* Heaven. *Biluo* is the celestial rosy clouds; *Fuli* is the Heavenly King’s personal name; *Kong* is the name of the celestial attendant; *ge* is the sound of the Great Cavern. When the Heavenly King steps in emptiness, the rosy clouds part, and he rides the flying cloud’s brush; with one cry from the celestial attendant, the divine wind fans forth, forming the Great Cavern’s song. They guide the immortals to ascend and pay homage at the Seven Treasures, preserving and cherishing the scriptures for those who study below.\n\n*Eyi Wupin* and *Dongmiao Zizhen*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Fandu* Heaven. *Eyi* is the Heavenly Emperor’s inner sound; *wu* is the Supreme Nonbeing Perfected. The Heavenly Emperor *Eyi*, since the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa, has cultivated the Dao, transcending the Three Realms to enter the Jade Void. At times, he commands the Supreme Nonbeing Perfected to widely open the Long Night’s repository, ranking and delivering sinful souls, enabling them to clearly understand their past lives, purify their evil roots, ascend to the wondrous transformation’s blessed hall, and naturally delight in the most true and wondrous Dao.\n\n*Yuanfan Huimo* and *Youji Duren*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Jiayi* Heaven. The Primordial Beginning’s great *fan qi* is vast and boundless, difficult to fathom—lofty and floating in emptiness, suspended yet not falling. Though secluded and unseen, it can transform; though still and unmoving, it responds and connects. Within it lies the true; within the true lies the essence. Its essence is most true, wondrous beyond naming. Inverting and overturning, reversing the Five Phases, it delivers countless beings to achieve the Way of returning cinnabar. Those of great cultivation, with steadfast true hearts, who faithfully receive and practice this, will attain the fusion of nature and life, the marvel of both form and spirit, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, accumulating deeds and merits to realize the rank of lofty immortals and supreme sages.\n\nA verse praises:\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dao to deliver heaven’s people,\nThe great *fan* and numinous scripture reveal the utmost true.\nHow fine is the wondrous efficacy of this true scripture—\nIn the Great Luo Heaven above, all find their abode.\n\nThe Dao speaks: These great *fan* hidden words within the heavens, the boundless sounds, were once written in characters a *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old transcribed their script to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and purify themselves to recite them will have the myriad heavens dispatch Flying Immortal Divine Kings to observe their bodies, record their diligent merits, and report to the heavens. The ten thousand spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at the gates, and the great demon kings will protect and recommend them as immortals. When their Dao is complete and they attain perfection, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the Heavenly Perfected’s natural sounds.\n\nThus, when one recites them, Flying Immortals descend to observe; the Supreme Emperor sings from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, all demonic beings bow their heads, and ghostly essences perish of themselves. The resonant jade-like tones reverberate, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, and the ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, summoning the assembly of immortals. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth is without demonic dust, dark wisdom shines with clarity, and the vastness of the mysterious profundity is boundless.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This concluding passage of the scripture was composed by the Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate. The ancient characters, each a *zhang* in length, were formed at the dawn of the Dragon Han era, when the Primordial Beginning wove them from the qi of the Brahma-sound. A *zhang* is the perfect measure of heaven and earth. The Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate recounted: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old transcribed these characters to establish the correct sounds. This sacred script is the root of the Great Dao and the master of returning cinnabar. Those who know its sounds—this hidden language—are not of middling or lesser capacity, for they cannot fathom its subtleties. Only those of supreme sagely roots, the seeds of immortals, upon receiving their master’s illumination, may grasp its sounds. At first hearing, they awaken to a hundred insights, their joy boundless, and without hesitation, they purify themselves inwardly and observe the precepts outwardly, faithfully receiving and practicing it. Thus, the Most High said: The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it. For those who practice the Dao, divine luminaries guard their gates, and demonic beings withdraw into hiding. When one recites this scripture in harmony, Flying Immortal Divine Kings descend to observe whether their body is truly pure, and record whether their merits and diligence are steadfast. If their body is indeed pure, desire cannot disturb them, and demons cannot test them. If their merits are truly vigorous and unwavering, their progress diligent and unceasing, then the myriad spirits will naturally pay homage, earth deities will attend at their gates, and demon kings will protect and recommend them. When their Dao is complete and their elixir perfected, their cultivation reaching the scripture’s essence, their merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, they will attain a body beyond the body, transcend the Three Realms, and ascend through the Golden Gate. These sounds respond to one’s practice: those who practice diligently attain the Dao and become immortals; those who recite diligently have their wishes fulfilled. Thus, they repel, exorcise, deliver, and accomplish all—nothing is beyond their power. Therefore, recitation summons the descent of Flying Immortals.\n\nObserve those who recite the scripture: they must purify their minds, abstain from desires, sweep the ground, change their garments, burn incense, sit upright, withdraw their gaze, and concentrate their spirit before recitation may begin. With sincere and focused intent, free from stray thoughts, they can summon the descent of Flying Immortals to observe and record their diligent merits. The Supreme Emperor sings from afar, moved by their devotion. Yet today, people hold prayer beads while their minds wander, their thoughts scattered, their mouths merely murmuring as if reciting the scripture—how can they expect the myriad spirits to pay homage or the Three Realms to attend in reverence? Instead, they invite calamity and retribution that cannot be evaded. These sounds are the essence of the world’s dharma.\n\nFrom \"protect and recommend as immortals\" to \"the earth is without demonic dust\" was previously expounded in detail by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Here, the Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate concludes the scripture, reiterating and proclaiming it to complete the merit of the *Lingbao* deliverance. When applied in Daoist practice, the descent of Flying Immortals signifies the spirit returning to the body; the Supreme Emperor’s distant song is the transformation of the embryo spirit. The carriage of the myriad spirits paying homage is the primordial qi returning to the origin; the Three Realms attending in reverence are the three origins guarded within. Demonic beings bow their heads, ghosts and demons submit and descend, ghostly essences perish of themselves, and corpse anomalies are eradicated. The resonant jade-like tones harmonize with the qi’s response. The ten directions grow solemn and clear, inner and outer purity prevail. Rivers and seas fall silent, nature is tranquil and emotions stilled. Mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the pulse ceases and qi settles. The ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, the yang spirit manifests. Immortals are summoned and assembled, the Dao is perfected and merits fulfilled. The heavens are free of defilement, vast and all-pervading. The earth is without demonic dust, radiant and serene. Dark wisdom shines with clarity—*minghui* (or *minghui*, the four characters signify the scripture’s concluding meaning)—illuminating the unseen, wisdom boundless. Grace extends to all, the vast emptiness resplendent. Ascending to the ethereal and distant heavens, free from all constraints; the vastness of the mysterious profundity’s wonders cannot be fully extolled.\n\nA hymn says:\n*A scroll of true scripture, five thousand characters,*\n*Layered and dense, all proclaimed in full.*\n*To know the wondrous Dao’s perfect merit,*\n*All habits forgotten, one attains the immortal’s rank.*\n\n**Latter Section of the Primordial Beginning’s Sacred Scripture**\n*Composed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign*\n\n**Eight Heavens of the East:**\nSenluchu stores clouds, nine souls refine essence.\nJimo gazes at jade, Fumei traces footprints.\nLuji raises the chamber, Bitizan revolves.\nChidian bears the burden, Qihuan presents offerings.\nZaozhang transforms jade, Lanban shatters green.\nKangbang grows wild, Jizhong’s purity ascends.\nYaozhan dries the abyss, silence without trace.\nSuyi leans on the void, Huangda reaches the primordial spirit.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the South:**\nYanduo’s spacious hall, Great Rosy Cloud’s jade corner.\nLixia offers ripples, Zhoujiong adds diagrams.\nPiyao’s paths are hazy, Gudan’s capital is vast.\nJiyun’s brilliance dazzles, Jingqi grasps the reed.\nZhangwei restrains ceremony, Yiguang’s jade gleams.\nBianlv benefits but, Youwei’s thunder completes.\nJuanhuang flows east, Chiyao gathers in clusters.\nYuxuan performs for the marquis, Boqi’s rules are supreme.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the West:**\nGaozheng turns left, Poni kills spirits.\nBeizhao’s borders equal, Jinan’s stars entwine.\nJingyi dims light, Hunyuan awakens to causes.\nDaoshou guards the distant, Mianzhen knows proclamation.\nTailing’s vastness fades, Binghe follows Lu.\nZhejing’s eternal splendor, Xucheng’s firm sands.\nLiduo banishes stocks, Huiyan’s spheres adorn.\nZhuoyun’s Azure Mansion, Yedu’s karma revealed.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the North:**\nWahai nurtures sweetness, Cuiyu’s nine gates.\nXiaogou’s ripples rise, Longfen’s divine pass.\nGoulun’s void swallows demons, Huoman prays for passage.\nXuanliao’s breath ceases, Wuzhi’s brilliance spreads.\nMangxiu’s auspicious evening, Futan’s timely furrows.\nTangchang spreads prosperity, Feiyong’s caution aids.\nChaokang’s sagely breadth, Mifa’s secrets abound.\nGuangdi governs life, Weizhao’s vast humanity.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign chants the Brahman-qi of the Vast and Distant Celestial Treasure, the Spontaneous Eightfold Harmonic Sound, governing the kalpas of the world, the earth’s ramparts, the floods and marshes, and the transformations of calamities and adversities. Those who recite and intone it dispel inauspicious omens, purify and refine the Dao-qi, and know no disturbance. The Earthly Offices present the scripture; the hundred spirits revere and obey. The Vermilion Gods transcribe the text; wearing or bearing it brings manifest verification. Applied to the utmost study, it is not proclaimed to the vulgar below.\n\n**Ode of the Supreme Pole Perfected**\nDivine spirits gleam in layered voids,\nBrahmanic nets gather in azure skies.\nThe Primordial Beginning’s nine dragons draw the chariot,\nThe Sovereign holds the reins of the blue carriage.\nLuminous radiance harmonizes with the myriad Perfected,\nPearl shadows unfold in the vast and desolate.\nRevealing the *Lingbao* scriptures,\nFortune and virtue thereby summoned.\nThe *Dongxuan* conceals lofty solemnity,\nJade tones ripple like cloud-borne zithers.\nBoundless, beyond thought’s reach,\nThe Dao-ocean surges with saving waves.\nDharma-meaning flows like a rivulet,\nNurturing and fostering fine sprouts.\nUsed to relieve the destitute and hungry,\nTeaching flourishes to guard the central court.\nThe August Thearch’s life spans myriad years,\nGreat Peace extinguishes blades of war.\nBowing my head, I gaze toward the Jade Palace,\nDivine blossoms scatter from golden brushes.\n\n**The Supreme Pole Perfected says:**\nThe Supreme Jade Palace Great Dao Lord abides above the Purple Mist, in the Heaven of Sevenfold Radiance, recording the mysterious script. Jade consorts bear the sutras; golden lads scatter incense. The Great Unity holds the towel; jade youths attend the banquet. Dragons chant, tigers roar; auspicious clouds veil the mists. The Ten Directions’ Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, Supreme Sages and Lofty Perfected, Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings, Great Demons of the Three Realms, and the Nine Heavens’ Elders—innumerable hosts—chant the Jade Sutra, take refuge in the Supreme *Lingbao* Wondrous Dharma, and ensure its flourishing circulation, enduring for kalpas uncounted.\n\n*Explication of the Primordial Beginning’s Peerless Upper Scripture on the Salvation of Humankind, Volume the Lower, concludes.*\n\nAfter reciting the sutra, intone the incantation:\n\"Supreme August Perfected,\nEnable my ascent to the numinous.\nPurify with fasts and refinement,\nRecite and intone the Golden Sutra.\nThe Seven Mysteries unfurl,\nAscend to the Great Void.\nProlong years and endure,\nInscribe my name in the celestial records.\"\n\nClose the eyes, swallow saliva thrice, knock the teeth thrice, then recite the furnace incantation:\n\"Your servant has finished reciting the sutra. The Three and Five Functionaries of my body, the Attendants of the Left and Right Offices, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Fragrance Officers of the Day—thirty-two each—return to their golden chambers and jade halls. Those on the left return to the left; those on the right return to the right. Let none err or stray. When summoned again, return as before, in accordance with ancient precedent.\"\n\nOnce more knock the teeth thrice and recite:\n\"Those who have come to hear and guard the sutra, dissolve the altar and disperse the assembly, each returning to their posts.\nThe divine winds grow still and silent,\nMountains and seas stand solemn and clear.\nA thousand evils hide in submission,\nA hundred spirits shield this form.\"\n\nBow in reverence, swallow saliva, knock the teeth, and close the sutra.\n\nMaster of Supreme Yang says: The Heavenly Worthy preached the sutra to deliver the deluded. Had mortals not been sunk in confusion, would the Heavenly Worthy have revealed it?\nWhen a person is born, they receive their father’s essence and mother’s blood to form their bodily shell. As they reach maturity, desires arise with them, and the essence they were endowed with flows into the rivers of love and seas of lust. Those who lose it early do not reach the lower span of life; those who lose it later do not reach the middle span; those who lose it late do not reach the upper span. If one wishes for bodily peace and enduring life, they must only cut off desire and treasure their essence.\n\nA person’s lifespan is governed by essence and qi—\nLike a lamp with its oil, like a fish with its water.\nWhen the oil is spent, the lamp goes out;\nWhen the water dries, the fish perishes.\nYet how is it that fools take suffering for joy,\nSeeing beauty and casting life aside?\nHow could they know that when essence is exhausted,\nLife too slips away?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, expounded this sutra to teach the refinement of the elixir, that people might learn to return their qi, restore their origin, treasure their bodies, and perpetuate their years. Yet those who encounter it fail to grasp it, while the wise pass it by. Why is this so?\n\nThe wise say: \"Life must end in death, and death is final—why believe in hell?\" This is what it means to pass it by. The foolish say: \"Do no good, commit no evil, eat when hungry, sleep when weary—this is heaven itself. What other Way is there?\" This is what it means to fail to grasp it.\n\nYet this sutra was transmitted by perfected beings, and the Dao expounded to superior practitioners. When superior practitioners and perfected beings recite the sutra, practice the Way, accumulate deeds, and amass merit—when their merit is lofty, their bodies ascend beyond the Great Luo Heaven; when their practice is complete, they serve as ministers in the Three Realms.\n\nA hymn says:\nThis sutra is hidden in the Great Luo Heaven,\nJade maidens hold flowers beside the Dharma feast.\nWhen the sutra is mastered, the elixir perfected, and practice fulfilled,\nPhoenixes soar and simurghs dance, chariots ride the clouds.",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation, the Wondrous Upper Scripture**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of Limitless Salvation, the Wondrous Upper Scripture*. Composed by the Yuan-dynasty Daoist Chen Zhixu (courtesy name Guanwu). Three fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Treasure Sutra of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings, the Wondrous Upper Scripture**\n\nThe Supreme One embraces the true *qi*, which is indeed the wondrous Dao and immortal lineage. The *Scripture of Salvation* of the Mysterious Treasure is called the supreme scripture of the *Dongxuan* tradition.\n\nIt engenders and nurtures Heaven and Earth, opens and closes *yin* and *yang*, enabling the transformations of creation to flow and the primordial workings to extend boundlessly. It illumines the sun and moon, revolves and steers the stars, universally propagates the divine spirits, and transforms and gives birth to the ten thousand kinds.\n\nIn the *Dao De Jing*, non-action (*wuwei*) is primary, while action (*youwei*) is secondary. Supreme *de* is non-action; lesser *de* is action. Supreme *ren* is non-action; supreme *yi* is action. This *Scripture of Salvation*, however, takes action as its beginning and non-action as its end.\n\nThe floating of the mysterious seat in emptiness is action; the dark wisdom of the pure cavern is non-action. The cessation of the jade armillary sphere’s turning is action; the solemn stillness of the ten directions and the silence of rivers and seas is non-action.\n\nThus, when the recitation of the scripture is completed ten times, withered bones become human, and meritorious deeds are reported above to the heavens—then the myriad spirits pay homage. The thirty-two heavens and their thirty-two emperors reveal the transformations of the ancestral kalpas and the hidden mysteries of the heavens. The hidden names of the heavens are concealed lest the heavenly beings leak and slight them. Leaking and slighting bring calamity upon the seven ancestors, while diligent practice leads to ascension as an immortal elder.\n\nFor ten thousand kalpas, it was not transmitted, treasured by the heavens above—why is it called the Mysterious Treasure? *Qi* is called *ling* (numinous); essence is called *bao* (treasure). Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—this is *ling*. Having no ancestor above, with the Dao alone as its body—this is *bao*. When *qi* unites and essence gathers, it is called the upper scripture. When spirit communes and the Dao merges, it is called the salvation of beings. Thus, the Mysterious Treasure is essence and *qi*. Essence and *qi* are mercury and lead. Mercury and lead are *yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* are *li* and *kan*.\n\nWithout attaining the Dao of action, how could *li* and *kan* be harmonized and congealed into the pearl the size of a millet grain? When a person is first born, they unite the non-being with being, stealthily seizing the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s entwined breath to clothe and endow their form. Nurtured for ten months, they shed the womb and sever the umbilical cord, nourished by day with milk and by night with essence—then their form is complete and their spirit flourishes, their spirit is whole and their essence refined, their essence full and the *qi* of perfect harmony abundant.\n\nThe ancient sages said: One whose *qi* is whole does not think of food; one whose spirit is whole does not think of sleep; one whose essence is whole does not think of desire. At this time, it is called pure *yang*. Pure *yang* is *qian*. The superior person, practicing the Dao of supreme *de* and non-action at this stage, cultivates inner refinement and outer merit—then demon kings revere their form, and they attain immortality.\n\nYet those of shallow learning, who do not delight in the immortal Dao, are few in preserving the true and many in confusion. They dwell in the realm of drunken living and dreamlike death, inflamed in the land of the sea of desire and the river of love—thus, the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth they originally received stealthily flees and lodges in *kun*. From this point onward, *kun* seizes *qian*’s one *yang* to become *kan*, while *qian*, broken by *kun* and lacking one *yang*, becomes *li*.\n\nExamine this: desire arises from love, love follows emotion, and emotion is disordered by circumstances. Moreover, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, anxiety, sighing, change, and fear alternate day and night before one, clashing and grinding with things. How could they know the saying that \"things come endlessly, but my heart has its limits\"?\n\nThus, the immortal Dao is difficult to secure, while the demonic path is easily perverted. When the fate of extinction arrives, the body passes through the Great Yin, its return delayed without end—how can one not feel sorrow and pity? The perfected immortals, having encountered a true teacher and suddenly awakened to the human Dao, know that the heart cannot rely on others. At the time when the *qi* is subtly depleted, they early practice the Dao of the Mysterious Treasure’s salvation of beings to restore it.\n\nWhat, then, is restoration? It is the Dao of action of lesser *de*, the Dao of acting through supreme *yi*, the Dao of the Primordial Beginning’s suspended pearl, the Dao of flowing *wu* to approach *ji*, the Dao of descending the dragon and subduing the tiger, the Dao of refining lead and drying mercury, the Dao of golden liquid returning to the true, where form and spirit are both wondrous.\n\nOnly when one comprehends this does one truly believe in the marvel of Earth Treasury’s revelation and the merit of gold and jade manifesting their forms. Preserving their original years, they all attain longevity, transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Great Void—all matters within their allotted share. How could this not be due to accumulating virtue and establishing merit?\n\nExamining this scripture in detail, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, at the beginning of the Dragon Han era when Heaven and Earth first divided and the jade script emerged, composed this scripture. At that time, he wrote it in purple ink upon the Azure Forest, each character a *zhang* in length, and bestowed it upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. The Jade Dawn bestowed it upon the Mysterious Unity Perfected, who bestowed it upon the Heavenly Perfected August One. The August One transcribed its text in fine script to establish the correct pronunciation and concealed it in secrecy.\n\nDuring the time of the Yellow Emperor, the August One met with the Three Immortals of Grand Clarity at Mount Emei. The Yellow Emperor bowed and inquired of the Dao, and the August One bestowed upon him the text of the Five Teeth and Three Ones, along with the upper fascicle of the *Scripture of Salvation*. The Yellow Emperor cultivated it and ascended as an immortal.\n\nLater, Emperor Ku received the *Root Chapters* and *Jade Calendar Chapters* at the Pastoral Virtue Terrace from the August One. During the *Yuanfeng* era of the Western Han, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed the upper fascicle and the two chapters upon Emperor Wu, completing the entire scripture. In the Eastern Han, the Supreme One descended to bestow upon Gan Ji the *Upper Scripture of the Numinous Writ*, along with the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred and fifty fascicles. During the reign of Emperor Huan, the Old Lord descended to Shu and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the *Scripture of Salvation*, the *Northern Dipper*, and over a thousand fascicles of scriptures and records.",

      "translated_text": "In the *Haotian* era, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One bestowed upon Ge Xuan, the Left Palace Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate at Mount Shangyu in Kuaiji, the *Scripture of Salvation*, expanding it with the *Middle Fascicle of the Numinous Writ*. The Perfected Zheng Siyuan transmitted the original text to Ge Hong, the Master Embracing Simplicity, further augmenting it with the *Upper and Lower Fascicles of the Numinous Writ* and the *Postface of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One*, thus forming the present complete edition. During the Jin dynasty, Wang Zuan encountered the Lord of the Dao, who bestowed upon him this scripture along with dozens of other scriptures. In the Northern Wei, Kou Qianzhi resided on Mount Song to cultivate the Dao, whereupon the Supreme One revealed this scripture to him, along with over sixty fascicles of additional scriptures.\n\nAs this scripture spread through the world, people knew to recite and pray for blessings, yet remained unaware of the Way of returning cinnabar and attaining longevity. From the *Imperial Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* onward, scholars such as Xue Youqi, Yan Dongqi, Cheng Xuanying, and Li Shaowei produced commentaries. In the early *Baoqing* era, Xiao Guanfu expounded the *Inner Meaning and Cinnabar Essentials of the Scripture of Salvation*. All these were those who delved deeply into its ultimate truths.\n\nBy virtue of karmic affinity with my Perfected Teacher, I received the secret of the *Golden Liquor Great Return Fire Talisman*. Wishing to make this Way known to all, I have annotated the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, and composed the *Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Subsequently, integrating the Dao’s application with worldly methods, I have divided and annotated this scripture, citing the insights of earlier sages to corroborate its teachings. May those who seek to avert misfortune learn to recite diligently and turn toward goodness; may those who transcend creation know to cultivate the Dao and ascend to Perfection.\n\nAlas! All people delight in life and detest death. Yet having detested death, they ought to seek the means to escape it. Instead, they bury themselves in the pursuit of fame, profit, and desires, heedless of remorse—thus hastening their demise. Having delighted in life, they ought to seek the Way of long life and enduring vision. Instead, they fail to seek a true teacher to reveal the principles of longevity and return, blindly wandering side paths and errant trails—thus shortening their lives.\n\nWhether in mountain forests or among the wise in cities, those who recite this scripture should seek within it the swift path to the golden elixir and eternal life. For the Supreme One, in employing the Way of the Numinous Treasure to deliver beings, desires precisely that people practice this Way. If one advances in cultivation and diligent practice, one shall ascend to the formless realms of the Upper Clarity and attain the pure conduct of the Brahma-realm.\n\nWritten on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *Bingzi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era by Chen Guanzhi, the Upper Yang Master of the Purple Empyrean Crimson Palace on the Northern Gold Conch Mountain.\n\n---\n\n**Annotations to the Supreme Pervasive Numinous Treasure Immeasurable Scripture of Salvation, Upper Fascicle of the Most Exalted Grade**\n*By Chen Guanzhi, the Upper Yang Master*\n\nThe Upper Yang Master says: *Supreme* (太) is that which the Dao alone makes greatest; *Exalted* (上) is that which heaven and earth alone revere. *Pervasive* (洞) is that which nothing fails to penetrate; *Mysterious* (玄) is that whose subtlety defies description. *Numinous* (灵) is that whose transformations are unfathomable, responding and communicating without obstruction. *Treasure* (宝) is that which is difficult to obtain, cherished by all. *Immeasurable* (无量) is that which cannot be conjectured; *Deliverance of Beings* (度人) is that which leads from the mundane to the sacred. *Upper Grade* (上品) is that which has no equal under heaven; *Wondrous* (妙) is that which nurtures the essence of all living things. *Scripture* (经) is that which serves as the raft across the river and the ladder to heaven.\n\nIn summary: the most revered and precious, the pervasively numinous and transformative, the true and primordial Way of the One that completes the elixir. The above is expounded for those of great root and superior capacity—this is the *application of the Dao*.\n\nNow, this scripture encompasses both the *application of the Dao* and *worldly methods*. The *application of the Dao* is that by which one cultivates and ascends as an immortal; *worldly methods* are those by which one recites diligently and seeks blessings. If interpreted through *worldly methods*, then *Supreme* (太上) is a title of towering reverence. *Pervasive Mystery* (洞玄) refers to the three grades of the Three Caverns—*Cavern of Perfection* (洞真), *Cavern of Mystery* (洞玄), and *Cavern of Spirit* (洞神)—signifying the Way of the Primordial Beginning that pervades the ultimate and the mysterious One. *Numinous Treasure* (灵宝) refers to the Lord of the Jade Dawn who, receiving the primordial qi of the Primordial Beginning, was transformed and born, bearing the exalted title of Numinous Treasure. *Immeasurable Deliverance of Beings* (无量度人) means that since the beginningless kalpas, the Primordial Beginning has generated the myriad heavens and brought forth the ten thousand existences, delivering countless beings beyond reckoning. *Upper Grade* (上品) signifies that among the thirty-six sections and eighteen thousand fascicles of the Daoist Canon, spanning four hundred thousand scrolls, this scripture stands foremost. *Wondrous* (妙) is that which cannot be named in words; *Scripture* (经) is the true path of the Dao. This is the interpretation through *worldly methods*.\n\nFor those of great cultivation, the *application of the Dao* and *worldly methods* proceed in tandem: the *application of the Dao* conceals *worldly methods*, while *worldly methods* fulfill the *application of the Dao*—this is the dual cultivation of *nature* and *destiny*. The world says that Buddhists cultivate *nature* while Daoists cultivate *destiny*; even the wise and sagacious cling to this view. Yet how could they know that this scripture fuses *nature* and *destiny*, uniting form and spirit in wondrous perfection? The Upper Yang Master has but revealed a celestial mechanism, exposing the essence and function of *nature* and *destiny* in this scripture.\n\n*Supreme* (太) is the essence of *nature* and the response of *destiny*—the very essence of the sovereign mandate of creation; its function is the power to generate the myriad heavens. *Pervasive* (洞) is that which the true nature shares in common. *Mysterious* (玄) is the hidden profundity of its workings. *Numinous* (灵) is the transformation of *nature*. *Treasure* (宝) is the product of *destiny*. *Immeasurable* (无量) is not something the ordinary can comprehend. *Deliverance of Beings* (度人) requires beings to deliver one another. *Upper Grade* (上品) means there is no second Way under heaven, and those of the same kind find it easy to apply effort. *Wondrous* (妙) is the first stirring of yang, when the ten thousand things burgeon with spring. *Scripture* (经) is that which possesses principles and provides the path of cultivation. Such forthright revelation—how could it not be direct?\n\nThe *Veritable Records of the Primordial Beginning* states: In the *Longhan* kalpa, the Lord Lao divided his body to teach and transform, manifesting the true writ in the Central Heaven Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, the Southern Culmen Vermilion Brightness Kingdom, the Eastern Culmen Floating Black Kingdom, the Western Culmen Western Na Kingdom, and the Northern Culmen Yudan Kingdom. Within these five kingdoms, all received the teachings of the Numinous Treasure. The Western King of the Hu inquired: \"What is the Dao?\" The Lord Lao replied: \"It is the Supreme Numinous Treasure, born before heaven and earth, vast enough to embrace all, subtle enough to contain all.\"",

      "translated_text": "The heavens attain it and become clear; the earth attains it and becomes tranquil; spirits attain it and become numinous; things attain it and come to life; humans attain it and take form. Should humans cultivate it, they may become immortals, ascending in flight to the Jade Capital—hence it is called the Supreme.\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind* from the *Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure* intones:\n*The Supreme abides primordially before the Great Ultimate,\nExisting ere father and mother gave birth.\nTo save humankind, the true scripture is required—\nIf you ask of the true scripture, *gui* is lead.*\n\nThe Dao declares: Long ago, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, within the azure void’s resounding hymns of the Great Floating Li Land, the *Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Upper Scripture on Salvation* was received. When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. Only then did he ascend the throne.\n\nCelestial perfected spirits, lofty sagely worthies, wondrously practiced perfected ones, and countless hosts arrived borne upon the void, soaring on cinnabar clouds, jade chariots, and feathered canopies casting shade, their flowing essence and luminous jade radiance in five vibrant hues billowing forth, illuminating the vast heavens for seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the myriad heavens—all celestial wheels—halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, the sky cleared of drifting veils, and the four qi shone in clarity. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees leveled as one, no longer high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue, as the assembled perfected ones attended the throne.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: In worldly terms, this recounts the origins of the scripture; viewed through the Dao’s application, it is entirely the wondrous discourse of the primordial Mysterious Unity’s great elixir.\n\n*Laozi* states: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth—it is named the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally wordless; words are but a means to reveal its function. Thus it is said: The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.\n\nIn worldly interpretation, the Dao Lord expounds the scripture’s meaning, simply calling it “the Dao declares.” In the Dao’s application, the Dao itself took form before the primordial darkness, becoming the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate, within the hidden and obscure, divided into yin and yang. Once yin and yang took shape, they became nature and life; at the moment of their effervescence, they are called spirit and qi. When the primordial chaos shattered, spirit and qi were named lead and mercury. Lead and mercury, passing through the gate of *wu* and *ji*, become the Mysterious Female. Thus the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth—this is called the Dao. To follow and employ the Dao is what is meant by “declares.” Hence the scripture’s opening directly states: *The Dao declares: Long ago, in the Azure Beginning Heaven.*\n\n“Long ago” refers to before the Great Ultimate; “Azure Beginning Heaven” is the origin of all things. “Azure void’s resounding hymns” marks the inception of creation; “Great Floating Li Land” is the source from which all things arise. Receiving the *Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Upper Scripture on Salvation* is to practice the great elixir of the Mysterious Unity—this is the Dao’s application.\n\nIn worldly terms: “Long ago” refers to the beginning, when the Azure Beginning Heaven—the first heaven of the eastern direction, above the Heaven of Seed-People—was filled with azure radiance, hence called the Azure Void Heaven. There, qi surged as divine winds, resonating like hymns in the empty vastness. Below lay the kingdom of Great Floating Li.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: The Great Floating Li Land reveals the inception of creation—things arise from earth and return to earth. The *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* says: Fire is born from wood, and calamity arises when it overcomes. Those who know this and refine it are called sages. Fire within wood, if unleashed without restraint, reduces all to ash and smoke, obliterating its original nature. Those who restrain it, though fire consumes wood to embers, may gather it into earth, preserving its original nature.\n\nThe Azure Beginning Heaven is the direction of wood; the azure void’s resounding hymns are the image of fire; the Great Floating Li Land is the root of earth. Earth is the foundation of the returned elixir. The returned elixir is the Dao of returning to the origin. The scripture says: Attain utmost emptiness, guard utter stillness—when the myriad things arise together, I observe their return. All things flourish and return to their root; returning to the root is called stillness, stillness is called the restoration of life—this is the principle of return.\n\nIn the *Book of Changes*, the hexagram *Return* says: In returning, one sees the heart of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth are the bodies of yin and yang; the “heart” reveals their function. Heaven moves, earth is still; yang moves, yin is still. When heaven’s movement reaches its extreme, yin is born; when earth’s stillness reaches its extreme, yang is born. Thus, when decay reaches the top, return begins below—through the waxing and waning of movement and stillness, their heart is revealed. Humans are the same.\n\nThe hexagram *Return* has one yang beneath five yin, its body *Zhen* below and *Kun* above. *Zhen* is wood, the Azure Beginning Heaven; wood generates fire, the azure void’s resounding hymns. Fire generates earth, thus *Kun* earth is the Great Floating Li Land. Earth is the root of creation, and from earth comes metal, called the “qi-void metal embryo”—truly the ancestral qi of the prior heavens.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning: *Yuan* means mysterious; *shi* means one. “Heaven” is the most exalted of the one qi, the supreme designation of the ten thousand existences. In the Dao’s application, it is the ancestral qi of the Dharma-body, also called the original face, the indestructible primordial spirit. Thus the *Elixir Scripture* says: The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning is none other than myself. When he expounded this scripture, in the Dao’s application, the scripture *is* true lead.\n\nLord Lao said to Master Wen Shi: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete. He also said: The One is lead, lead is the sovereign; the Two is mercury, mercury is the minister. If lead is not true, mercury cannot draw near. If lead is true, the household minister does not stray.\n\n“Circumambulating ten times to summon the ten directions”: In worldly terms, the Celestial Worthy expounds the scripture to summon the perfected and call forth the numinous. “Circumambulating” means universal proclamation; “ten times” means comprehensive summons. “Summoning” governs the practice across the ten directions.\n\n“Ascending the throne”: In the Dao’s application, this refers to the nine revolutions and ten months of elixir refinement. “Only then did he ascend the throne” signifies the golden elixir’s completion within the chamber.",

      "translated_text": "The great practitioner, upon entering the chamber to commence work, pursues the two qi along the Yellow Path, unites the three natures within the Primordial Palace, revolves through the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial passes, and gathers the three thousand six hundred upright qi—is this not the celestial perfected and supreme sages, their countless hosts converging upon the elixir crucible, their spokes assembling around the golden embryo? Is this not riding the void to arrive, uniting spirit with qi, refining with qi?\n\nIs this not soaring through vermilion clouds in the celestial vault, feathered canopies casting shade, golden radiance gleaming, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is this not the flowing essence and jade light, five hues billowing in profusion, illuminating the great void?\n\nIn worldly terms, the Celestial Worthy’s numinous efficacy in summoning response—how could it be limited to this? Seven days and seven nights: in the great transformations of heaven and earth, ten months are pure yin without yang. Only in the eleventh month, belonging to *zi*, though yang exists, it has not yet returned. After another seven days, yang first revives—this is the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The moon becomes full at the fifteenth day, and by the twenty-seventh night, the moon is black without yang. By the third day of the following month at the *shen* hour, the moon’s one yang revives at *geng*—this is the yin and yang of the sun and moon. All revive through seven.\n\nHeaven’s one generates water, earth’s six completes it—this is the seven of the Five Phases. In the Dao of the golden elixir, the number of convergence and gathering: one hour contains six seasonal nodes, each node governing five days. At the time of gathering the medicine, only one and a half nodes are used—seven days and seven nights. The *Book of Changes* states: “Hard and soft are the images of day and night.” The former worthies said: “Hard and soft are the going and coming of one qi.” A person’s exhalation and inhalation are the going and coming of one qi. One exhalation and one inhalation make one breath; within one breath, yin and yang are divided. Exhalation, bright, is yang; inhalation, dark, is yin. The seven orifices’ exhalation is the seven days; the seven orifices’ inhalation is the seven nights.\n\nWhen the Golden Mother’s merit is accomplished, the celestial mechanism does not move, spirit is suspended in fixed gaze, pulse ceases, heart stills—thus it is called seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the revolving jade pivot, all halt their wheels; breath does not enter or exit. The numinous phoenix is silent, qi does not ascend or descend—like mountains and seas concealing clouds. Delusive conditions are entirely purified, as if the heavens were without floating obscurities. The six roots are greatly stabilized, called the four qi’s clarity and purity. At this point in the Dao’s application, the wondrous fusion of nature and life is revealed.\n\nA kingdom’s land: in worldly terms, it is the Floating Black Soil; in the Dao’s application, it is the one body. A person takes the body as the kingdom, essence as the people, qi as the ruler, and spirit as the commander. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all within the body. When truly still and serene, it is as if all were leveled equally, without further high or low. Nature, like jade’s lustrous purity—how is it different from having color?\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: “Soil is nature and emotion. Nature, empty and transformative, generates spirit, stored within the chamber—this is *wu* soil. Qi, stirred and aroused, has emotion, gathered within the cauldron—this is *ji* soil.” After *wu* and *ji* have united, spirit is joyful and qi is still; nature returns to the darkness of emotion. Like the azure qi’s flawless hue, like jade’s purity without admixture—thus it is said that all soil becomes azure jade, without differing colors.\n\nWithin the heart and eyes, the true qi is inwardly observed; the three *hun* return to the body, the seven *po* return to the true. The heart-monarch is at peace, and the myriad spirits obey commands—thus it is said the host of perfected attend the seat. All this pertains to the Dao’s application of active effort.\n\nIf interpreted through worldly dharma, the Celestial Worthy’s awe-inspiring power transforms the celestial spirits, earthly deities, sun, moon, and stars, who respond according to conditions—such is the spectacle.\n\nThe ode says:\nIn the azure vault, the most wondrous sound sings through emptiness,\nThe great Floating Black Soil sought in *kun*.\nFlowing essence illumines brightly, the numinous wind is still,\nSerene and still, the subtle yang refines the five yin.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Worthy, upon the dark seat floating in space atop a five-colored lion, expounded the scripture once—all the celestial great sages simultaneously praised its excellence. At that time, all the deaf and ailing men and women of the kingdom had their ears opened and hearing restored. When the scripture was expounded a second time, the blind had their eyes brightened. A third time, the mute could speak. A fourth time, the lame and those with chronic ailments could all rise and walk. A fifth time, those with long-standing illnesses had their forms restored at once. A sixth time, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. A seventh time, the old reverted to youth, and the young became strong. An eighth time, women conceived, and birds and beasts carried young; whether born or unborn, all were brought to completion. A ninth time, the earth’s treasuries opened, and gold and jade were revealed. A tenth time, withered bones revived and all arose as complete persons.\n\nAt that time, all men and women of the kingdom, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and all attained longevity.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: In the Dao’s application, the Primordial Celestial Worthy is the primordial spirit. The Purple Clarity White Perfected said: “This spirit is not the spirit of thought and deliberation; it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.” The *Inner Meaning* states: “The dark seat is the spirit chamber; floating in space is the dharma-body. The five colors are the qi of wondrous transformation; the lion is the knowing heart.” When the primordial spirit is in the chamber, moving the heart to gather qi, the dharma-body is empty and still, the knowing heart is bright and wondrous. The spirit’s control of qi, the heart’s likeness to a charioteer—is this not the Celestial Worthy’s Dao-form? And is it not also one’s true nature? Thus, the dark seat floating in space is profound stillness and true serenity, yet also constant response and constant stillness.\n\nWhat is most difficult for a person to subdue is the heart and nature. The scripture says: “The spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, but desires pull it.” Spirit is the true nature; when the heart is still, the spirit is naturally clear. The work of entering the chamber is to subdue the heart like taming a fierce beast. The former worthies compared lead and mercury to dragon and tiger, speaking of how difficult they are to restrain. Pure Yang said: “The gentle lead crucible, its light penetrating the screen.”",

      "translated_text": "The workings of creation race onward, tiger and dragon in union—advancing the fire-work at the perilous point of Ox and Dipper. Moreover, the lion is king of the hundred beasts; to sit floating in space above it, even the slightest negligence brings extreme danger. The Perfected of Azure Prime from the Eastern Sea said: “One must first subdue it and then sit above it, emptying the heart and externalizing the form—only then can the Dao respond, and this becomes the foundation of transcendence.” After one recitation of the scripture, all the celestial worthies and great sages simultaneously proclaimed its excellence.\n\nThose who cultivate the Mysterious Unity, the Perfect Numinous Treasure, the Great Returning Elixir—all sages revere and protect them, all heavens honor them, demon kings escort them, and spirits look up to them. How much more, then, to be present at the scripture-seat—would this not be proclaimed excellent? In terms of the Dao’s function, reciting the scripture once brings all the spirits within the body to joyful ease. In a kingdom, men and women with deafness and ear ailments all regain their hearing; after a second recitation, the blind see clearly; after a third, the mute speak. Viewed through worldly methods, this may seem shallow, but understood through the Dao’s function, its principle is most precise.\n\nWhy is this so? Ordinary people cannot quietly listen to nurture qi, withdraw their vision to preserve spirit—thus their ears are confused by sounds, their eyes disturbed by colors, their mouths enslaved by flavors. Over time, without awakening, they inevitably become blind, deaf, mute, and dumb. As *Laozi* says: “The five tones deafen the ear, the five colors blind the eye.” The great cultivator listens to the soundless and grows ever more acute; gazes upon the formless and grows ever more clear; abstains from mixed flavors and grows ever more refined. How much more, then, in the moment of entering the chamber—how should one’s five senses fear or falter?\n\nMaster Wei the Perfected said: “The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—seal them tightly and do not let them open. The perfected one hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass within.” After a fourth recitation, the lame and those bound by chronic illness all rise and walk. Compared to worldly people who do not cultivate the Dao, they are like the lame who cannot walk. “Chronic illness” means entanglement—accumulated habits reaching their limit. Due to their profound ignorance, they are ensnared by worldly defilements, bound by ingrained habits. Now, to say they “rise and walk” means they rouse their resolve and cultivate the Dao.\n\nAfter a fifth recitation, long-standing chronic diseases all restore their form at once. There are those who believe in the Dao but whose hearts lack firmness. Those who do not believe in the Dao harbor hearts of disbelief as hard as metal or stone; no amount of persuasion can turn their hearts to trust the Dao. This is called long-standing chronic illness. Yet if they suddenly come to believe in the Dao and practice without doubt, this is called restoring their form at once. Some explain that Kan (Water) corresponds to the ear and restores hearing, while Li (Fire) corresponds to the eye and restores sight. Others say that Zhen (Thunder) startles and restores hearing, Li (Fire) attaches and restores sight—how is this not transcendence? The scripture’s circulation in the world truly preserves the Dao. Without the vessel and insight of one who truly treads the path, how can one speak of this?\n\nAfter a sixth recitation, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regrow. When blood flourishes, hair thrives; when essence abounds, teeth are firm. After a seventh recitation, the old regain their youth, the young grow strong. If the primordial Mysterious Unity’s qi is restored, the old revert to infancy and regain their vigor. If the Perfect qi is complete, the young all grow strong. As *Laozi* says: “Compared to a newborn babe, bones weak and sinews soft yet with a firm grip, unaware of the union of male and female yet the organ stirs”—is this not the meaning of the young growing strong?\n\nAfter an eighth recitation, women conceive, birds and beasts carry young—whether already born or not yet born, all attain birth and completion. After a ninth recitation of the scripture, the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form. After a tenth recitation, withered bones revive, all rise as complete humans. Here, the Dao’s function and worldly methods coexist. In worldly terms, one follows the scripture’s words without needless repetition. In the Dao’s function, for those cultivating the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, if they have not obtained the primordial qi, their entire body is yin. If the center of Li (Fire) is empty, is this not called a woman? As the Perfected of Purple Yang said: “The sun resides in the Li position, yet when inverted, it becomes the woman; Kan (Water) pairs with the toad palace, yet it is the man.” Having obtained the Golden Fluid’s woman-vessel, above and below one guards with the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, left and right with the White Tiger and Azure Dragon—is this not birds and beasts carrying young? “All attain birth and completion” means the golden vessel’s embryo is complete and qi is full.\n\n“Earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form” means both form and spirit are wondrous. “Withered bones revive, all rise as complete humans” means the perfected one appears, with a body outside the body, a thousand or a hundred million transformations. The *Inner Meaning* says: “Birds and beasts carrying young” refers to cinnabar containing mercury’s essence, resembling pregnancy. Mercury meets lead and congeals; qi meets form and blends. The already-congealed qi grows ever stronger; the arising qi blends and congeals again, not scattering with things but nurturing the sacred embryo—thus, whether already born or not yet born, all attain birth and completion.\n\nMoreover, the ninth recitation corresponds to earth producing metal, heaven completing it at nine. Returning to the west, the Dui (Lake) direction is metal, where Kun (Earth) and Dui unite to form metal in the soil. This is lead returning to the earthen crucible to become treasure. As the *Triple Concordance* says: “When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the Returning Elixir”—this is the qi returning to the origin. Heaven’s one generates water, first giving rise to the golden embryo from empty qi, though its metallic essence is not yet visible. Earth’s four produces metal, still a transformative mechanism; at this stage, it returns to the origin and restores its nature, residing in the central palace—this is the elixir’s body with its mysterious image. The central palace is earth; earth is the land, and the metal mother dwells within it—thus, “the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form.”\n\nMaster Celestial Han’s preface to the *Scripture of the Golden Fluid Divine Elixir* says: “The immortal’s path, the subtle words, the principle beyond principle, the great reality beyond all realities.”",

The scripture says: “The spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, but desires pull it.” Spirit is the true nature; when the heart is still, the spirit is naturally clear. The work of entering the chamber is to subdue the heart like taming a fierce beast. The former worthies compared lead and mercury to dragon and tiger, speaking of how difficult they are to restrain. Pure Yang said: “The gentle lead crucible, its light penetrating the screen.”",

      "translated_text": "This has already been recorded in the profound tradition, not to be conveyed by even the slightest measure.\n\nThe Most High likewise expounded this subtle and empty Dao. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts toward it. The land is the body; man and woman are yin and yang. \"Turning their hearts\" means resonance by kind—just as the primordial qi unites with the postnatal breath to form the elixir, and when merit is complete and qi is full, it is said that all receive protection and deliverance, attaining longevity.\n\nAs explained above, these all pertain to the functioning of the Dao. If viewed through worldly methods, the exposition has already been made clear in the verses:\n\n*The empty seat of mystery floats with the five-colored master,\nThe blind, deaf, mute, and lame all depart from their afflictions.\nWhen the earth’s treasury opens, gold and jade reveal their form,\nSoaring through the void, the banner of victory is seized.*\n\nThe Dao speaks: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture once, the boundless hosts of perfected great spirits from the Eastern Direction of the Infinite arrived floating through the void. When he expounded it a second time, those from the Southern Direction arrived; a third time, those from the Western Direction; a fourth time, those from the Northern Direction; a fifth time, those from the Northeast; a sixth time, those from the Southeast; a seventh time, those from the Southwest; an eighth time, those from the Northwest; a ninth time, those from the Upper Direction; a tenth time, those from the Lower Direction.\n\nWhen the ten recitations were complete, the boundless hosts of perfected great spirits from the ten directions arrived all at once. Every man and woman in the land turned their hearts in reverence, and those who came were like fine rain or dense mist—so vast was the multitude that they filled half the land, causing the earth to sink unevenly, beyond all restraint.\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the empty void five *zhang* above the earth. He led the perfected great spirits, the exalted sages, the high worthies, the subtle-practiced perfected ones, and the boundless hosts of the ten directions’ primordial and ultimate perfected great spirits—all entered into the pearl. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging motion as they entered through the pearl’s opening. Once inside, their whereabouts were unknown.\n\nThe people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer uneven. After the Primordial Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding the scripture within the pearl, the host of perfected ones oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The dharma rites were perfectly accomplished, and the various heavens returned to their places. In an instant, all was silent, without a trace of lingering sound.\n\nAt that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered, preserving their destined years without harm. The entire land turned in reverence, all cultivating good hearts—no killing, no harm, no envy, no jealousy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no resentment. Their words were free of embellishment, their mouths free of harsh speech. They were united in compassion, transforming even strangers into kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony.\n\nWhen the scripture first emerged to teach the land, those who had beforehand devoted sincere hearts, revered and upheld it with devotion, all attained deliverance across the ages.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This encompasses both the functioning of the Dao and worldly methods. In worldly terms, the Heavenly Worthy expounds the scripture, summoning the boundless hosts of perfected ones from the ten directions—the Eastern Direction’s Brahma-Monitor Xuyan Heaven and others in the Zhen Palace’s *mao* position, an innumerable host; the Southern Direction’s Yudan Wuliang Heaven and others in the Li Palace’s *wu* position; the Western Direction’s Linghua Fanfu Heaven and others in the Dui Palace’s *you* position; the Northern Direction’s Dongyuan Huayingsheng Heaven and others in the Kan Palace’s *zi* position; the Northeast’s Gaoxu Qingming Heaven and others in the Gen Palace’s *yin* direction; the Southeast’s Poluonimi Bujiaole Heaven and others in the Xun Palace’s *si* direction; the Southwest’s Jiran Doushu Heaven and others in the Kun Palace’s *shen* direction; the Northwest’s Shangshan Shanwu Lian Shoutian and others in the Qian Palace’s *hai* direction; the Upper Direction’s Nine Heavens, Upper Clarity, Jade Perfected Thirty-Six Heavens, and others; the Lower Direction’s Formless Realm, Form Realm, Desire Realm’s Thirty-Two Heavens, down to the boundless hosts of the Three Origins and Nine Earths—all assembled in the Primordial Azure Heaven’s Fuli Land to hear the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expound the scripture.\n\nThe number ten signifies the ultimate. In terms of the Dao’s functioning, ten is the number of heaven and earth’s generation: the two earths of *wu* and *ji* combine to form ten. Heaven and earth unite, and the myriad things interact; yin and yang unite, and the myriad things are born; lead and mercury unite, and the golden elixir is formed.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, one gathers the three thousand six hundred breaths of upright qi, reverses the seventy-two seasonal nodes, distinguishes the three hundred eighty-four lines, and assembles the five stars and twenty-eight constellations. One drums the twenty-four breaths of yang fire, moves the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, guards the three *hun* to protect the form, and returns the seven *po* to the body. The twelve thousand spirits within the body all heed the command—this is the boundless host from the ten directions arriving floating through the void, all at once.\n\nMen and women turning their hearts in reverence is the union of yin and yang qi. The fine rain and dense mist are the true qi’s steaming. As the *Cantong Qi* says: *\"When golden sand enters the five viscera, the mist scatters like wind and rain.\"* The earth sinking unevenly refers to the two earths of *wu* and *ji*—*wu* and *ji* are the gate of the Mysterious Female. When gathering the medicine, dragon and tiger contend, metal and wood are separated. If control is lost even once, the medicine will surely flee and be lost.",

      "translated_text": "For what is gained in me is lost in the other, and what is lost in me is gained in the other—hence the term \"uneven sinking.\" At this moment, only the most sagely and spirit-like adept, having refined the self to perfection, can prevent this loss of balance. The precious pearl, no larger than a grain of millet, admits the thronging host of perfected beings with vigor. Viewed through worldly eyes, how could this not be divine transformation? Yet from the perspective of the Dao’s workings, it is no larger than a millet grain.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, the size of a millet grain, within the empty mystery, five *zhang* above the earth—this clarifies the Dao’s workings. The pearl dwells in empty mystery, where spirit and Dao unite; five *zhang* above the earth, for \"earth\" here denotes soil, and soil refers to *wu* and *ji*. The golden elixir coalesces from *wu* and *ji*, and once the elixir is formed, it departs and distances itself. *Wu*-soil is already separated by the Western Heaven, while *ji*-soil remains five *zhang* away—this must be transmitted orally and cannot be disclosed openly. Looking back at what lies five *zhang* below, one sees only the Five Defiled Evil Realms.\n\nSome explain the pearl’s five-*zhang* distance as analogous to the heart’s five-*cun* separation from the spleen—this is utterly foolish and mistaken. Others take the pearl as essence and the five *zhang* as the number of the Five Phases; still others speak of the distance from the cinnabar field to the Mysterious Pass, unaware of the wondrous transformations of the primordial *qi* in forming the immortal embryo. The Primordial Beginning ascends and guides the host of perfected beings into the pearl. Once the primordial spirit is stabilized, the ten thousand spirits all return, merging with emptiness and uniting with the formless, ascending into the mysterious and entering the wondrous.\n\nThe Azure Perfected One said: \"The Dao’s subtlety and wonder originate in emptiness and nothingness. The body of celestial perfection, how could it admit obstruction?\" Yet it cannot escape simultaneous confusion and mixture, so the suspended pearl responds to changes, demonstrating that the formless returns to nothingness. \"Ascends\" means to rise and proceed; \"guides\" means to point out and transform through instruction. Celestial and human beings look up to those who have attained the true Dao, following them into the pearl’s mouth—yet if celestial beings bear burdens, they cannot accompany them. Once inside the pearl’s mouth, their whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAll this is the Primordial Beginning’s manifestation of the divine transformations of the golden elixir’s Dao: from nothingness into being, and from being back to nothingness; merging the hundred spirits into one heart, gathering the ten thousand existences into a single breath. Then the perceptions of celestial and human beings differ—how could they know the wondrous transformations within the pearl? When the sutra’s exposition is complete, the host of perfected beings oversees the transmission and bestows it upon me.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"The White Tiger’s first scripture is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold.\" He also said: \"Swallowing and devouring each other, yet growing closer—only then does one realize the truth of male and female conception.\" Does this not describe the sutra’s exposition as complete? And does it not mean it was bestowed upon me? At this moment, joy and celebration defy expression. Nature and emotion both attain perfect clarity, and today I rejoice in receiving the transmission.\n\nThe ritual matters are roughly understood, and the celestial beings return to their positions. \"Ritual matters\" refers to affairs of deliberate action. As the scripture says: \"The highest principle acts, yet does so with intention.\" The *Great Treasury of Prajñā* states: \"After the elixir is formed, abandon it and depart—then the celestial beings return to their positions, and the principle is evident.\"\n\nOnce the celestial beings have returned to their positions, Bodhidharma too enters the Shaolin Temple to sit in cold meditation. Such pointers having been given, how could all you aspiring immortals not rejoice in this swift attainment! In an instant, all is silent, without a trace of lingering sound. \"In an instant\" describes extreme swiftness. A single breath consists of five such instants. In the span of one instant, there is no time even to blink—this is worldly speech. But if you consider the Dao’s workings, do not pass lightly over the phrase \"in an instant.\" Each word must be pondered with full awareness.\n\nThe refinement of the golden fluid’s great elixir is the swiftest of affairs. Thus, the elixir scriptures speak of taking the month from the year, the day from the month, the hour from the day, the *hou* from the hour, and the *ke* from the *hou*—gathering the seventy-two *hou* into a single day, dividing each hour into six *hou*. In the moment of refining the elixir, not even two *hou* are needed; indeed, half an hour is not required before the returning elixir is obtained. Thus, Subhūti asked the World-Honored One: \"Is this matter swift?\" The World-Honored One replied: \"This matter is exceedingly swift.\" Yet the meaning of \"lingering sound\" must be examined in detail. This word \"silent\" offers boundless application.\n\nAt this time, celestial and human beings encounter the scriptural Dharma and universally attain deliverance—this should be interpreted through the Dao’s workings. \"Celestial and human beings\" must be distinguished, and \"scriptural Dharma\" also bears two meanings. Why? Because those with talent receive the village, those with the Dharma receive the Dharma, and those with the medicine receive the elixir. Those who hear the scriptures receive the Dharma—thus, scripture and Dharma are both clarified, and Dharma and talent are both engaged. Both are called \"two,\" referring to celestial and human beings, and to scripture and Dharma. Celestial and human beings embody the entirety of heaven and earth’s substance, while scripture and Dharma embody the entirety of the great elixir’s function. Each preserves its original years without harm or injury.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: \"Those who attain it know its spirit and cherish it, understand its *qi* and treasure it—only then is it called complete.\" Turning the earth in reverence and all practicing good hearts, refraining from killing and harming—this should be interpreted through worldly principles. There are no inherently unvirtuous people; all are obscured by material desires, their original nature obscured. Thus, evil grows daily while goodness diminishes. Now, having encountered the scriptural Dharma, all turn their light inward, return to the root, and revert to the origin, practicing the good heart of their original nature.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: \"Hearing its voice, one cannot bear to eat its flesh.\" Thoughts, perceptions, sights, and sounds all constitute killing; damaging or injuring anything is harm; destroying another’s good abilities is jealousy; resenting another’s wealth and honor is envy; failing to sever delusive thoughts is lust; taking what is not rightfully one’s is theft; insatiable covetousness is greed; seeing things and generating thoughts is desire; slandering those superior to oneself is hatred; doubting and suspecting the upright is obstruction; false and deceitful speech is florid embellishment; unregulated and unchecked words are evil speech.\n\nAmong the ten evil deeds, lust and desire are the foremost. Those who cultivate the Dao must first eliminate them. The Perfected One of Everlasting Spring, addressing the Emperor Taizu, placed desire as the first precept. The *Sacred Writ of the Great Mystery* ranks desire as the chief of the ten failures.",

      "translated_text": "The method of cultivation requires nothing more than truly and utterly severing desire—all else is but an easy matter. The world deems the severance of desire exceedingly difficult, yet this is the view of the foolish and deluded, who know not that the method is in fact quite simple; it is merely that people have not yet tested it. To test is to refine the self. For beginners, this trial begins in secluded places, walking alone and dwelling apart, while abstaining from wine. By day, one should constantly study the *Canon of the Elixir*; by night, maintain a mind of purity. With no external distractions to disturb the senses, internal delusive thoughts will naturally dissipate. Should demonic obstacles arise, one’s resolve must only grow firmer. Externally, avoid hunger and thirst; internally, nourish and replenish without cease. After half a year or a full year, when essence and qi are firmly consolidated within, desire will vanish of its own accord. If desire has not yet been eradicated, it is because essence remains incomplete—one must then further fortify it. As the *Canon of the Elixir* states: *\"One whose spirit is whole does not crave sleep; one whose qi is whole does not crave food; one whose essence is whole does not crave desire.\"* So it is indeed.\n\nOnce essence is whole and can be preserved and guarded for the long term, only then may one proceed to refine the returning elixir. Let people test this method, and they will witness its efficacy. Cultivating the self in seclusion is called \"lesser reclusion\"; once lesser reclusion is mastered, one may then achieve \"greater reclusion\" amidst the dust of the marketplace. If one severs external distractions yet fails to eliminate internal thoughts, reacting to every encounter, this is not true practice—it is mere empty talk of purity while the conduct remains impure, and such a one is but a seed of hell.\n\nThose who sever desire are secretly protected by the highest sages, revered in the unseen by gods and spirits, and the Dao of the elixir naturally comes to fruition. In ancient times, the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness and the Perfected Lord Mao examined the successes and failures of true immortals across the world. Among them, forty-seven had fallen, while only two had ascended. Their downfall was due to desire not yet being extinguished. If the sin of desire is eradicated, the ten evil deeds all cease. With universal compassion and love, self and others are embraced as one; even those of different bones become kin. By benefiting oneself, one benefits others; the nation is at peace, and the people prosper in joyful harmony. The \"nation\" is the body; the \"people\" are the essence and qi within it.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao transmitted to Gan Ji the *Essentials of Great Peace*, saying: *\"Heaven bestows spirit upon humanity, Earth bestows essence, and the Center bestows qi. If one treasures essence, severs desire, consolidates qi, and cherishes spirit, then internally, the body attains longevity; externally, the nation achieves great peace.\"* Moreover, what is within inevitably manifests without. By completing one’s nature, the body becomes pure; by completing one’s life, the elixir is perfected. Internally, nature and life are both cultivated; externally, virtuous deeds flourish, bringing blessings to the nation and peace to the people, resulting in joyful harmony.\n\nWhen the teachings first emerged, a nation that embraced the Dao, with sincere devotion, reverence, and respect, would see all its people delivered across the ages. The *Inner Meaning* states: *\"Humans are born endowed with the qi of the Dao—how could the heart be without it? It is only through attachment to illusions and delusion that one becomes benighted and confused. Upon encountering the scriptures and their teachings, this heart is illuminated anew.\"* It is like pointing to the cinnabar elixir—this is one’s original substance, not something that was absent before and now exists. Though obtained after hearing the Dao, it was in truth present before hearing it. Thus, it is said: *\"previously possessed with sincere devotion.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Azure Primordium said: *\"Revering and upholding this scripture is to seek deliverance. 'Reverence' means honoring this scripture as one would a father, mother, teacher, or elder—fearing and loving it, ever wary of negligence. 'Respect' means treasuring this scripture as one would gold, jewels, pearls, or jade—cherishing it without parting, ever fearful of losing it.\"* Having fully devoted the four hearts, all attain deliverance across the ages and achieve longevity.\n\nThe ode says:\n*A pearl like a millet grain hangs in empty space,\nThe highest sages and lofty worthies all appear before it.\nThough the pearl’s mouth may hold boundless multitudes,\nOnly then does one know the scripture’s wondrous mystery.*\n\nThe Dao states: *\"What the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds in the scriptures are the hidden, rhymed names of the Emperors of the various heavens, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits—these are not the common words of the world.\"* Only the perfected immortals who have attained the highest sageliness, who fathom the profound and investigate the subtle, can fully comprehend its verses. Reciting it ten times, the heavens echo in response, and the ten thousand emperors pay homage. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The sun and moon pause in their course; the celestial pivots cease to turn. All demons bind their forms; ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead are revived; white bones become living beings.\n\nFor those earnest in their studies, reciting it ten times summons the Five Emperors to stand guard, the Three Realms to bow in reverence. Demon spirits lose their sight; ghostly apparitions vanish. The dying are delivered; the perishing are restored to life. This is because, though the student’s impure qi has not yet dissipated and their body has not fully attained the true, their invocation can command the ten directions. Though their power does not yet govern the celestial administration, their virtue can subdue the earthly deities, bind demonic spirits, and even reverse death—though they cannot restore life. To recite these verses lightly brings misfortune upon oneself. To offer reverent devotion and honor brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through the generations, forging good karmic connections. Ten thousand calamities will not encroach; divine spirits will guard the gate.\n\nThis scripture is most exalted and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and stands as the root of the ten thousand Daoist paths. Vast and majestic is the Great Brahma—its virtue is beyond measure.\n\nMaster of Supreme Yang said: *\"What the Celestial Worthy expounds in the scriptures, when interpreted through worldly terms: the taboos of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors are the hidden, rhymed names of the Emperors of the various heavens. For example, the Demon King of the Azure Heavens, Bayuan Choubo, is one of the demon kings’ taboos. The Venerable Lord of No-Flourishing, Taokang, and Heyan are among the hundred spirits’ concealed names.\"*\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Azure Primordium said: *\"The *Numinous Treasure* is the ancestor of the Dao’s qi; the *Deliverance of Humanity* is the foremost of the ten thousand methods. The Primordial Beginning contained the wondrous Dao, and as the Dharma flowed forth, it scattered into written words, fashioned into rhythms and tones—unmatched by the inferior seven literary forms. Lesser and middling immortals cannot even glimpse its chapters and verses; only the highest perfected immortals, who have deeply penetrated the mysteries of the Dao, can fathom its profound subtleties. When the Dao is employed to translate this scripture, it is the returning elixir.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Laozi* states: *\"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* The hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Supreme Gods spoken of in the scriptures—Perfected Lord Taiyi’s *Song of Breaking Delusion* says: *\"If there is something that is indeed the Dao, it is Taiyi containing the true qi.\"* Is not Taiyi itself an inner name? The ancient sages said: *\"Within Heaven and Earth, amid the cosmos, there is one treasure, concealed within the mountain of form.\"* This is the hidden rhyme. Perfected Lord Zhengyang said: *\"The gate that gives me life is the door that takes my death.\"* This is the inner taboo of the demon kings. Perfected Lord Boyang said: *\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss.\"* The Buddha said: *\"Above the seat sits a true person without position.\"* These are the concealed names of the hundred spirits. All the above are profoundly mysterious; unless one is a perfected immortal who has personally cultivated, practiced, and attained the Dao, how could an ordinary person comprehend and fathom them? The meanings of the three words—*comprehend* (通), *fathom* (究), and *master* (悉)—how can they be glossed over or left unexplained?\n\n*Comprehend* means to grasp the scripture’s meaning; *fathom* means to delve into the elixir path; *master* means to perfect the firing times. These three matters share a single principle, yet within them lie countless evenings of subtle mysteries. For instance, the inner names of the medicine in the *Elixir Scripture*: solar essence and lunar marrow, metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, golden liquid and flowing pearl, divine water of the flower pool, intersecting pears and fiery jujubes, phoenix marrow and tortoise essence—all these are the inner names of the medicine.\n\nAgain, the hidden taboos of the cauldrons and vessels: the Heaven-Earth crucible, the Kan-Li frame, the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture, the Taiyi divine furnace, the divine chamber and yellow room, the primordial elixir crucible, the suspended embryo and inverted moon, the golden tripod and jade furnace—all these are the concealed names of the vessels.\n\nAgain, the hidden names of the yin-yang firing times: the Supreme Simplicity’s Zi and Gui, the return, arousal, difficulty, and obscurity, the mother concealed in the child’s womb, the knife-point matchmaker, the gathering of moments, the interplay of emotion and nature, host and guest, white and black, male and female, the new moon and full moon, the waxing and waning qi, inversion and floating, extraction and replenishment, bathing, refining, tempering, nurturing, weights and measures, hexagrams and talismans, shedding the embryo and changing the crucible—all these are the hidden names of the firing times.\n\nAgain, the hidden rhymes of the returning elixir: the dim and obscure, the primordial Supreme Ultimate, the third day forming Zhen, the moon appearing on Gengshen, finding companions in the southwest, the foremost treasure of the primary scripture, civil and martial, reverse and forward, closing the pass on the solstice, rending the vast chaos, cleaving open the primordial darkness, establishing the banks and shores, creating the crucible, entering the void from existence, flowing Wu to meet Ji, guarding against danger and averting peril, returning to life and reverting to the root, tortoise-breathing and heel-sound, a thousand myriad transformations—all these are the hidden rhymes of the returning elixir, none other than the wondrous subtleties of the primordial unity’s ancestral qi.\n\nThe scholar must seek a luminous teacher to comprehend the profound and fathom the subtle, attaining precise and deep understanding. Only then may one request the highest perfected immortals to fully grasp its chapters. To recite it ten times is to speak of the success of the returning elixir, a metaphor for the Dao’s loftiness and virtue’s abundance. If an ordinary person, failing to understand the scripture’s meaning, merely recites it ten times in vain hope of distant celestial chanting, the myriad emperors offering rites—as the scripture describes—this is surely impossible. If one cultivates the returning elixir to completion and the Dao is perfected, then its numinous responses shall far exceed such things.\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: *\"The myriad emperors offering rites\"* refers to what *Zhuangzi* called *\"tranquil and boundless, with all excellences following.\"* It is the virtue of Heaven and Earth, the Dao of the sage. *\"Rivers and seas\"* compare to the river of love and the sea of suffering. When the human heart is deluded by illusions, love arises from emotion, and suffering comes from perception. If one cultivates the golden elixir, aligning virtue with Heaven and Earth and the Dao with the perfected immortals, then the river of love shall still and the sea of suffering fall silent.\n\n*\"Mountains and peaks conceal clouds.\"* The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *\"The qi of the Five Peaks billows and swells.\"* This refers to the qi of the five viscera; the true person’s breath is deep, and when deep, the qi of the five viscera fills like mountains concealing clouds. *\"Sun and moon\"* are the two eyes; *\"radiance\"* is light—it is the spirit.",

      "translated_text": "The perfected person’s spirit does not stray outward; though the eyes see things, they remain still and unmoving—thus it is called *\"halting the radiance.\"* The *\"jade pivot\"* is the Northern Dipper. The human heart, when it mirrors the ultimate, revolves without shifting; though it observes and examines, it seems unmoving. The perfected person follows nature, responding to things while the heart remains profoundly tranquil—thus it is called *\"not moving.\"* When myriad demons swarm in confusion and ten thousand threads of delusion arise, if my heart follows nature, it responds as though nothing has occurred—thus it is called *\"binding the form.\"*\n\n*\"Ghostly essences\"* are the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses are not expelled, the Dao will surely be difficult to accomplish. One who embodies purity and simplicity will naturally sever the Three Corpses—thus it is said *\"extinguishing the luminous.\"* *\"Reversing the corpse to raise the dead\"* and *\"transforming white bones into a person\"*—those who have attained the elixir do not merely perfect themselves but should extend their merit to others, delivering the dead and saving the living. The *Scripture of Pure Clarity* states: *\"When my elixir is complete, transformation is at will. What remains lacking is only the celestial decree; thus I accumulate merit to await the true mandate.\"* When Master Wu of Wu suddenly revived the deceased at Qing, was this not *\"reversing the corpse to raise the dead\"*? Those who pursue the study must diligently advance without retreat.\n\nThe *\"Five Emperors\"* are the spirits of the five viscera: the liver’s *hun*, the lungs’ *po*, the heart’s *shen*, the kidneys’ *jing*, and the spleen’s *yi*. When a person is serene, the spirit is settled, the *hun* is clear, the *yi* is at peace, the *po* is calm, and *jing* is not lost. When a person is restless and competitive, the spirit is weary, the *hun* is turbid, the *yi* is disordered, the *po* is scattered, and *jing* dissipates and depletes. Though people desire peace and longevity, daily interactions weary the spirit, and when the Three Corpses and Nine Worms become pests within, the true qi of the cinnabar field is disturbed. Those who advance with dedication must eliminate the Corpses and Worms; when the spirits of the five viscera each fulfill their roles, it is called *\"attending in guard.\"*\n\nThe *\"Three Realms\"* are the Three Corpses—three regions of turbid, dark, and perverse qi within the human body, belonging to the three demonic realms. The Upper Corpse, Peng Ju, dwells in the head; the Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, resides in the intestines; the Lower Corpse, Peng Qiao, inhabits the feet. All human cravings, lusts, and myriad evils are instigated by these corpse-demons. On days such as Gengshen, they ascend to the celestial courts to report every human transgression, omitting nothing. They delight in hastening death. Ge Zhichuan said: *\"Can you sever the enmity of the Three Pengs?\"* An ancient immortal’s poem states: *\"Of all the boundless methods in the world, only the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\"* The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Since ancient times, the decrees of Geng and Jia have been clear: only by slaying the Three Corpses can the Dao be attained.\"* This is to dissolve evil and cultivate goodness, to transform the stubborn and follow virtue. Once subdued, they protect my practice—thus it is called *\"bowing in reverence.\"*\n\n*\"Demon essences lose their eyes, ghostly spirits extinguish their luminous.\"* Demon essences have but one eye and are formless; ghostly spirits possess luminous essence but lack substance. Why do ordinary people, drunk on life and dreaming in death, suffer harm from demons and ghosts yet mistake it for joy? It is because the Six Desires and Seven Emotions remain uneliminated. Those who cultivate greatly forget the Seven Emotions and purify the Six Roots; thus demon essences lose their blind eyes and transform into eyes of wisdom, while ghostly spirits extinguish their luminous essence and manifest divine powers. Those of superior capacity, steadfast in advancement, may even prolong life when on the verge of death—how much more so for the young and vigorous!\n\nThe Perfected One of Azure Origin said: *\"Myriad entanglements arising within are inner demons; calamities and hardships pressing from without are outer demons. Inner demons unsevered are called *essences*; the Seven Emotions and Six Desires are called *ghosts*. They disturb and invert, obstructing my virtue and power—these are what we call *demonic illusions.*\"* Those who pursue the study with unwavering hearts will not be hindered by these demonic illusions.\n\nBeginners may lack inner distractions, but when external circumstances suddenly arise, the heart becomes disordered—how then can they refine the elixir? Thus the scripture states: *\"You, as a student, have not yet dispelled your impure qi.\"* Those given to lust cannot purify themselves or recognize their own impurity. When they encounter practitioners, they should swiftly withdraw to avoid offending their true qi and inviting misfortune. Beginners whose desires remain uneliminated are also impure in body; their qi cannot penetrate the true Dao, nor can they summon and command the ten directions. Though they accumulate minor merits and inch-long deeds, they cannot yet govern the seven celestial bodies of the heavens. For those who refine the golden elixir, their conduct aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth and the luminosity of the sun and moon; the Celestial Stem points the way, and the Northern Dipper stands before them.\n\nIf the elixir is not yet complete, their power cannot govern the celestial bodies—this is called an *\"initial immortal.\"* If one has not yet cultivated but has accumulated profound virtue, this is called an *\"earth immortal,\"* whose power can only subdue earthly spirits. Those who *\"bind demonic spirits\"* do so because they do not comprehend the wondrous precelestial Dao. Instead, they rely on visualization, talismans, and rituals to command spirits and ghosts, often inhaling the qi of yin gates and ghostly realms—these are called *\"ghost immortals.\"* Through unceasing accumulation of practice, they may extend their lifespan—thus it is said they *\"merely avert death\"* but cannot *\"revive further.\"* Though their bodies endure long life, if they cease practice even for a day, calamity will swiftly strike.\n\nThose who know the Dao yet do not practice it, and recklessly discuss it with others, are said to *\"frivolously recite this chapter\"*—their bodies will suffer misfortune. The *Inner Meaning* states: *\"The essence of the golden elixir lies entirely in diligent harmonization. Diligence ensures clarity; perseverance ensures success. First, be diligent in gathering; next, be vigilant in maintaining fullness. Await the completion of the crucible and the readiness of the medicine, then proceed with the talisman, advance the fire, adjust the mercury and lead, aligning the hours and seasons without error. Thus the qi of yin and yang will be sufficient, the pearl of Kan and Li will be round, the spirit will transform into truth, and one will attain long life and enduring vision.\"*\n\nIf, however, one is hasty in emotion and lazy in heart, acting recklessly and carelessly, missing the proper times and failing to align with the seasons, then *\"midwinter brings scorching heat, midsummer brings bitter frost; the maiden flees, the red dragon escapes.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "rtue with Heaven and Earth and the Dao with the perfected immortals, then the river of love shall still and the sea of suffering fall silent.\n\n*\"Mountains and peaks conceal clouds.\"* The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *\"The qi of the Five Peaks billows and swells.\"* This refers to the qi of the five viscera; the true person’s breath is deep, and when deep, the qi of the five viscera fills like mountains concealing clouds. *\"Sun and moon\"* are the two eyes; *\"radiance\"* is light—it is the spirit.",

      "translated_text": "Once spirit and essence are lost, the golden elixir becomes unattainable; qi withers, the body weakens, and life perishes. Yet with reverent offerings and devout worship—honoring the perfected immortals and sacred masters day and night—coupled with steadfast cultivation and utmost sincerity, one’s dwelling flourishes outwardly while inwardly, body and mind attain tranquility. Every movement aligns with auspiciousness, and divine spirits guard the gate.\n\nMaster Gaoxiang Xian, pondering the truth day and night, unknowingly ascended in soul to the Jade Capital. The Celestial Emperor, moved by his devotion, commanded the Lady of Western Florescence, the Great Unity, to reveal the secret of the golden elixir. Its verses declare:\n\n*\"Qian and Kun are the gates of yin and yang.\nThe Way of Qian is male; the Way of Kun is female.\nYet mortals know not true yin and yang,\nVainly seeking dragon and tiger across heaven and earth.\"*\n\nFrom this, one sees that the gates and dwelling reside within the self. This scripture is most sacred and peerless, unmatched in the Jade Capital.\n\nThe *Seven Lots of the Scriptural Teachings* states: *\"The Three Caverns embody the wondrous essence of the One Vehicle and the profound words of the Three Luminaries. Mastery leads the highest sages to ascend; awakening allows the loftiest perfected to transcend. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals reveal the finest exegesis of the supreme principle; jade tablets and golden writs guide the essential arts of returning to the origin. Moreover, this scripture crowns the Three Caverns, hence it is called peerless in the Jade Capital. From ancient times to the present, no immortal or perfected sage has ever attained realization without relying on it. Of the myriad methods and thousand gates, none lie beyond its scope. Vast and boundless, it defies description in words or thought.\"*\n\nIts ode proclaims:\n*\"The inner name is hidden, ineffable;\nThe positionless true one is uniquely revered.\nOnly by realizing the inner name may one receive its use,\nThen know eternal abiding through kalpas unending.\"*\n\nThe Dao states: *\"Whoever recites this scripture ten times shall summon all heavens to arrive. Countless generations of ancestors—bound spirits and suffering souls—shall all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace. After nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn, becoming noble beings. Those who diligently study this scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, shall all attain immortality, soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital. Scholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall likewise be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years and attain long life, later achieving the Way of corpse liberation. Though their souls temporarily dissolve, they shall not pass through hell but swiftly regain form, roaming the vast heavens. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings; all celestial and human realms receive its blessings. Immeasurable fortune arises, and the cycle of birth and death is graced with its favor. Treasured by heaven, it is not transmitted to the lower world. Only the most devoted, offering gold and treasures, swearing oaths to heaven, may receive it. Those who lightly disclose or profane it shall bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to serve as ghost officials, attending the scripture under the Five Emperors, with twenty-four jade lads and maidens guarding the sacred text and protecting the recipient.\"*\n\nMaster Shangyangzi said: *\"Ten recitations complete the number, signifying the scripture’s merit is fulfilled and all heavens arrive.\"* The Perfected of Azure Origin stated: *\"Countless generations of ancestors—parents and forebears from time immemorial, bound spirits and suffering souls long confined in darkness—shall all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace.\"*\n\nIn the southern cinnabar heavens lies the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, within which is the Vermilion Mound Prefecture, containing the Flowing Fire Court—the realm where refinement, transformation, and deliverance of immortals occur. Those who attain transcendence pass through this palace, undergoing the great forging of the Three Fires to purge the five impurities of form. The radiance of the King’s Eyes refines their qi and substance; the Yellow Flower’s waters wash away the corpse’s form. Then, inwardly nurturing the numinous true, they follow their karmic transformation to be reborn anew.\n\nThe refinement and deliverance follow three grades: scholars of the highest learning achieve deliverance in three years; those of middling wisdom, in nine; and the least learned, in twenty-four. The \"nine years of refinement\" refers generally to the middle grade, a worldly interpretation. In the practice of the Dao, one must seek it within the self.\n\nThe \"ten recitations\" correspond to the principle of the ten months; \"all heavens arriving\" signifies the myriad spirits merging into primordial unity. \"Countless generations of ancestors\" are the transient unions of parents; \"bound spirits and suffering souls\" are the turbid qi arising after embodiment. All are delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace—refining and transforming the turbid qi of transient unions, transcending into the realm of purity and radiant light, reborn as noble beings. This means refining the turbid qi of transient unions into yang spirit, transforming it into true qi, unifying the myriad spirits into one spirit and the myriad qi into one qi, nurturing the sacred embryo.\n\nScholars who reach this stage have attained wholeness of spirit and sufficiency of qi, prolonging life and attaining longevity. Yet this is not yet what may be called immortality. Only those who diligently study the scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, may attain the rank of immortals. To truly speak of immortality, one must cultivate both inner work and outer conduct. Inner work is the Way of fire timing and embryo liberation, the path of spirit transformation. Outer conduct involves aiding others and benefiting beings, as seen in the examples of the Han Celestial Master discerning humans and ghosts, Master Ge delivering bound spirits, and Perfected Xu slaying dragons and demons.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"Though a scholar may uphold the Dao, without performing meritorious deeds, they cannot attain the Way. Only when the inner elixir is complete and outer conduct is cultivated shall merit be fulfilled and virtue perfected, allowing one to soar to the Golden Gates and roam the Jade Capital—this is no empty claim.\"*\n\nScholars of the highest learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall all be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. \"Scholars of the highest learning\" are those who hear the Dao and practice it diligently. As *Laozi* says: *\"The highest scholar, hearing the Dao, practices it diligently.\"* Diligence yields merit, leading to ascension to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years and attain long life, later achieving the Way of corpse liberation.\n\n\"Mortals\" refer to the common folk. Perfected Ziyang said: *\"The method of the great elixir is most simple and easy; even the foolish and ignorant may practice it and ascend to sagehood.\"* Corpse liberation takes four forms: the first is liberation by weapon, as when Ji Kang was executed in the marketplace or Huainan met his end in prison.",

      "translated_text": "The second is liberation by literary means, as when Ciqing transformed his essence into shoes or Changfang borrowed form from bamboo. The third is liberation by water or fire, as when Feng Yi drowned in the great river or Fengzi was burned in the great tree. The fourth is seated liberation: though appearing dead, the feet do not turn blue, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes do not dim, and the limbs remain pliable at another’s touch. This is called \"Refining the Form in the Great Yin,\" where the flesh remains uncorrupted for over a hundred years before reviving as a living person.\n\n*The True Sayings* states: \"Those who achieve corpse-liberation as immortals cannot ride the flowered canopy, mount the dragon, or ascend to the Great Ultimate; they merely avoid death.\" Thus, it is said that the hun-soul and spirit temporarily vanish, bypassing hell, and swiftly regain form to roam the great void. Some explain that in corpse-liberation, the bones become lustrous and light, the essence and blood remain unchanged, and if the corpse is cast into famous mountains or great rivers, after a hundred years it transforms into pearls and jade.\n\nThis scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings; all heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings. Interpreted through the Dao, this scripture is the supreme treasure, the Golden Elixir. Its subtlety is the White Tiger, the Two Sevens. As Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: \"The Two Sevens gather and assist.\" Through the subtle power of this scripture, when followed, it gives life to beings; when reversed, it forms the elixir. It broadly saves the sentient and universally delivers the boundless. All heavenly and mortal beings—great cultivators—are like the two weights of gold and cinnabar, or the dual substances of dragon and tiger in the golden elixir, none fail to receive its blessings. Heavenly and mortal beings employ both method and medicine, thus all receive its blessings. When the scripture’s merit is complete and the elixir’s path is perfected, how could one merely receive the grace of long life for oneself? Even ancestors widely receive the favor of transcendence.\n\nThis is treasured by Heaven and not transmitted to the lower world. This is explained through worldly methods. Master Qingyuan said: \"When the perfected ascend to present their reports, they must recite this chapter in song.\" Heaven truly treasures and does not transmit it to the lower world. Only because later sagely rulers earnestly requested it to guard against the calamities of Jia and Shen did the sages pass it down through generations, excluding the common folk. Only the most refined scholars, offering gold and treasures as tokens of sincerity, pledging their hearts and swearing oaths to the heavens, may receive its transmission. Why? Because what people cherish most are gold and treasures. Gold is a substance of firmness and hardness; the Most High established this to make people relinquish what they love, breaking their stingy hearts, and through this offering, turn their minds toward devotion, demonstrating sincerity as firm as metal and stone. If lightly leaked or recklessly transmitted, calamity will extend to nine generations.\n\nWhen serving this scripture, the Five Emperors, twenty-four Jade Boys, and twenty-four Jade Maidens attend—this is the Daoist interpretation. The scripture is the ancestral qi. The Five Emperors wondrously transform the qi of the Five Phases; the twenty-four maidens unite the inner and outer two luminaries, the true spirits and true qi, nourishing and protecting the elixir body, safeguarding those who receive the scripture to perfect the great elixir. Formerly, when Xu Jingsun refined the returning elixir, he moved the Emperor Above to dispatch five immortal boys wielding swords to descend to Jingsun, daily sparring with him, and later he achieved the Dao. Was this not to protect the body of one receiving the scripture?\n\nA verse says:\n*Heaven’s treasured scripture is not lightly passed,\nOnly those who receive it directly may ascend to Heaven.\nWhat value lies in offering gold as sincerity?\nThis scripture’s subtlety brings boundless fortune.*\n\nThe Dao states: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past lives’ souls and deliver them to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain immortality, with one’s name recorded in the heavens; the Yellow Register and White Slips erase death and inscribe life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture to secure the kingdom’s ruler, ministers, fathers and sons, stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve Heaven’s eternal existence, and ensure the lineage of rulers continues unbroken, ever reigning as sovereigns, pacifying their lands, with the people enjoying great peace.\n\nOn the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s life-destiny day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the hun-soul and spirit, eternally preserve the myriad qi, avoid suffering, radiate light from the body, receive the attendance of the Three Realms, the Five Emperors’ welcoming, the homage of myriad spirits, with one’s name inscribed in Heaven. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Upper Clarity.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: According to worldly methods, during the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture. The first month is the beginning of the year, the first of the four *meng* months, the month of the Heavenly Official’s Upper Prime grand celebration. Unwavering focus is called \"long,\" vigilant mindfulness is called \"fast\"—this is the long fast of the first month. Vocalizing aloud is called \"recitation,\" continuous chanting while walking or sitting is called \"chanting\"—this is reciting and chanting this scripture.\n\nMaster Qingyuan said: The first month is the beginning of the four starts, when Heaven and Earth communicate and all things renew. Riding the Heavenly Official’s examination standard, the long fast and scripture recitation deliver past lives’ souls, severing the suffering of earthly bonds and delivering them to the Southern Palace. In Daoist practice, this is the month of advancing the fire and gathering the medicine, all for the purpose of beginning inner cultivation.\n\n*The Inner Meaning* states: The first month belongs to *yin*. In elixir refinement and medicine gathering, *yin* and *shen* are the phases of rise and fall. *Yin* is the phase of yang’s arising; if one wishes to act at the *jia* hour, one must first guard at the *yin* hour, then apply at the *jia* hour. The long fast is purifying the mind; reciting the scripture is gathering qi. Purifying the mind and gathering qi is gathering the medicine. The souls of past lives are the accumulated yin qi within the body. Though yang qi arises from *zi*, one yang lies beneath five yins; by the *yin* hour, yin and yang are still intertwined, yin above and yang below, pent-up and not yet free—hence the term \"earthly bonds.\" By the *jia* hour, through the method’s steaming, yang qi vigorously rises and ascends into the *Li* Palace. Is this not severing earthly bonds and delivering to the Southern Palace? Thus, the scripture’s references to the Vermilion Palace, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, Vermilion Mound, or Southern Palace all denote the *Li* Palace.",
      "overlap_context": "ding to ascension to the Southern Palace. Mortals who recite it shall prolong their years and attain long life, later achieving the Way of corpse liberation.\n\n\"Mortals\" refer to the common folk. Perfected Ziyang said: *\"The method of the great elixir is most simple and easy; even the foolish and ignorant may practice it and ascend to sagehood.\"* Corpse liberation takes four forms: the first is liberation by weapon, as when Ji Kang was executed in the marketplace or Huainan met his end in prison.",

      "translated_text": "The *Li* Palace corresponds to the *Kan* position, hence Master Zhang’s saying: \"Take the solid center from the *Kan* position and refine the yin within the *Li* Palace’s belly.\" By observing the long fast in the seventh month and reciting this scripture, one attains immortality. The seventh month belongs to *shen*, a time when yang lies concealed. To practice at the *geng* hour, one first guards at the *shen* hour; by the *geng* hour, mercury is set in motion to merge with lead, forming the treasure within the crucible—this is also called \"gathering the medicine\" or \"casting the crucible.\" As yang qi grows daily stronger, yin qi wanes. Pure yin is a ghost; pure yang, an immortal. When yang qi is robust, one gradually attains immortality. With practice complete and qi full, the spirit transforms and the embryo is released—thus the true person emerges, hence \"attaining immortality in body.\" Those who achieve the Dao have their names stricken from the registers of death in Fengdu and inscribed in the ledgers of immortality, receiving charts and registers, thereby ascending. Thus it is said: \"The heavens record names on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death to grant life.\"\n\nIn the tenth month, observe the long fast and recite this scripture. The *Inner Meaning* states: \"When the medicine is fully gathered and the crucible is cast to perfection, enter the chamber in the tenth month to harmonize spirit and qi. Beginning fifteen days before the winter solstice, fast and store the spirit within the kidneys—this is called 'fortifying the numinous root.' Thus, the root and origin are established, and spirit and qi arise together. The body is like a nation: the spirit is its lord, qi its minister. When spirit is full and qi abundant, the hundred bones are all ordered. The elixir is completed, the form is shed, and one attains long life and enduring vision. Bone and flesh ascend together, form and spirit unite in subtlety—just as the scripture declares.\"\n\nOn the days of the eight nodes, recite this scripture to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces. The eight nodes correspond to the eight trigrams. Entering the chamber to circulate the talisman and advance the fire, take the *zi* hour of the winter solstice as the starting point, storing the spirit in the kidneys. As the yang fire moves, the spirit follows in its wake. The kidneys are the root; the spirit chamber, the girdle. From root to girdle, root and girdle move in concert, forming the embryo and ripening the fruit. One cycle encompasses three hours: from *zi* to *chou*, from *chou* to *yin*, metal and fire press forward, returning to the spirit chamber, and the golden elixir gradually coalesces. This corresponds to the winter solstice and the beginning of spring, nodes governed by the *Kan* and *Gen* trigrams. By the *mao* hour, one bathes; by the *chen* hour, the fire advances. By *si*, metal and fire press forward, returning to the sea of marrow. This corresponds to the spring equinox and the beginning of summer, nodes governed by the *Zhen* and *Xun* trigrams. When the yang fire reaches its peak, at the *wu* hour, the talisman is circulated. From *wei* to *shen*, metal and water propel the movement, entering the chamber via the magpie bridge at the double pass, enclosing and securing the mysterious pearl. This corresponds to the summer solstice and the beginning of autumn, nodes governed by the *Li* and *Kun* trigrams. By the *you* hour, one bathes; by *xu* and *hai*, the talisman is circulated, and true qi returns to its source, as one yang revives. This corresponds to the autumn equinox and the beginning of winter, nodes governed by the *Dui* and *Qian* trigrams. The cycle repeats endlessly, condensing a year’s work into a single day to correspond with the eight nodes. All applications of yang fire and yin talismans return to the central palace to nurture the sacred embryo. After ten months, when qi is full and the treasure crucible’s work is complete, the embryo is released and the spirit transforms—this is the True Person.\n\nThe eight trigrams are arrayed in a circle, solid without and hollow within, with the elixir body residing at the center. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The eight trigrams are arrayed, and their images lie within.\" This is why one becomes a True Person of the Nine Palaces. In worldly custom, the days of the eight nodes are when the Great Unity’s Controller of Destiny, along with various officials, records the merits, transgressions, blessings, and faults of mortals. Merits are rewarded; faults, punished. On these days, reciting the scripture allows one to seize the opportunity for commendation and become a True Person of the Nine Palaces.\n\nOn one’s life-destiny day, recite this scripture to purify the hun-spirits and rectify the myriad qi, ensuring their enduring presence. The human body possesses three hun-spirits: one resides in the celestial offices, belonging to one’s natal constellation; one dwells in the earthly prison; and one abides within the body. The seven po-spirits constantly inhabit the body. The seven po-spirits cause confusion and indulgence, while the three hun-spirits delight in goodness. On one’s life-destiny day, the hun-spirits descend into the body to join the corpse, circulating in unbroken union. Thus, the living person remains peaceful, and calamities and illnesses do not arise. On this day, by purifying the body, one unites hun and po. The hun belongs to yang; the po, to yin. When yin and yang harmonize, the Dao’s qi descends within, the root of life is fortified, and the body is at peace.\n\nIf one’s form is befuddled by wine and lust, the hun-spirit, upon appearing, retreats seven paces from the body and cannot unite. Polluted and defiled, the hun departs. The seven po-spirits, unable to unite with the hun, grow ever more dominant, stirring and indulging their desires. If one is befuddled thrice and the hun cannot unite with the po, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the seven po-spirits commune with yin ghosts, fostering only lewd thoughts. The seven po-spirits each have names: Corpse Dog, Crouching Corpse, Sparrow Yin, Swallowing Thief, Flying Poison, Removing Filth, and Fetid Lung. Corpse Dog governs greed; Crouching Corpse, gluttony; Sparrow Yin, lust; Swallowing Thief, theft; Flying Poison, delusion; Removing Filth, corruption of goodness; and Fetid Lung, all afflictions. Because they are unwholesome, their names are likewise vile. If one’s thoughts are impure, they are drawn into depravity—indulging in wine and lust, wandering in dreams among evils, engaging in filthy and defiled conduct, lost in confusion and excessive sleep, depleting essence and exhausting spirit, dissipating qi and multiplying illness, vexing and disturbing until death—while they, by contrast, find ease.\n\nWhen on one’s life-destiny day one diligently cultivates goodness, recites scriptures, and practices the Dao without weariness, advancing without retreat, so that one’s virtuous deeds reach heaven—then, as the scripture promises, when merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends in flight. In Master Xu’s *Method of the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Scripture for Delivering Humanity*, there are ten \"Do Nots Forget.\" The most essential is \"Do not forget firmness and purity.\" Firmness means having resolve and not indulging in lewdness; purity means maintaining precepts and not craving food and drink. Avoiding lewdness prevents harm to body and spirit; abstaining from gluttony prevents the taking of lives.",
      "overlap_context": "neath five yins; by the *yin* hour, yin and yang are still intertwined, yin above and yang below, pent-up and not yet free—hence the term \"earthly bonds.\" By the *jia* hour, through the method’s steaming, yang qi vigorously rises and ascends into the *Li* Palace. Is this not severing earthly bonds and delivering to the Southern Palace? Thus, the scripture’s references to the Vermilion Palace, the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, Vermilion Mound, or Southern Palace all denote the *Li* Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who indulge in wine and lust while reciting scriptures and discoursing on the Dao commit the gravest transgression. These are but worldly interpretations of the Dharma. Yet if one speaks of the application of the Dao, there lies a wondrous principle.\n\nThe day of one’s life-destiny is the day of gathering the medicine and entering the chamber; it is the day of returning to the origin and reverting to the root; it is the day of returning to the foundation and restoring life. Therefore, within a year, there is only this one day; within this day, only one hour; within this hour, merely two *ke*. This is the method of gathering the clan. One condenses the seventy-two seasonal nodes into a single day, clusters the thirty-six thousand breaths of primordial qi into one hour—each hour encompassing six nodes, yet only two are used for reciting scriptures and refining the elixir. Thus, within that hour, four nodes remain, reserved for other wondrous applications, transmitted only in secret teachings. Such is the day of one’s life-destiny.\n\nMaster Peng said: At first, there is no form or substance, as in the primordial chaos of *hongmeng*. Once the fire is kindled and the talismans are activated, the first year of cultivation begins to flourish—this is the day of one’s life-destiny, the inception of receiving qi. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"At the capping and marriage, qi intertwines; in the first year, the sprout flourishes.\" The *Inner Meaning* says: \"When the fire’s timing is complete, the way of shedding the mortal coil and transforming the spirit is achieved.\" The sacred embryo resides within the sea of marrow, with a cycle of sixty days; the life-destiny completes one revolution to match the number of the celestial cycle. Suddenly, like the crack of thunder, the Gate of Heaven splits open, the sacred embryo emerges, the mortal husk is shed, and one becomes an immortal—attaining eternal life. The Demon Kings bear witness, the hosts of heaven welcome, merit is fulfilled, virtue is exalted, and ascension awaits.\n\nLi Changling said: \"Merit is the practice of daily conduct; virtue is the renewal of each day.\" If one is as earnest as a farmer awaiting the harvest, as diligent as a merchant amassing wealth—accumulating virtue today, piling merit tomorrow—then the three hundred virtues of an Earth Immortal may be completed in a single year, and the one thousand three hundred virtues of a Heavenly Immortal in four years. Yet though many begin the practice, most falter midway, for their resolve is not steadfast.\n\nThe Purple Void Primordial Sovereign said: Master Fu, from youth, loved the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao for seven years, where he suddenly encountered the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, who bestowed upon him a wooden drill and bade him bore through a millstone. The master warned: \"When the stone is pierced, I shall deliver you.\" The stone was over five feet thick, yet Fu drilled without cease. After forty-seven years, the stone was suddenly pierced through, and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One indeed came to deliver him. Such was the utmost firmness of his resolve—how much more so for those who recite scriptures and practice the Dao with diligence!\n\nA hymn says:\n*For three months, maintain the fast and chant this scripture,*\n*The host of heaven’s sages shall inscribe your name.*\n*Though men know the day of life-destiny for chanting scriptures,*\n*In daily practice, they act in folly.*\n\nThe Dao teaches: On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, observe abstinence, enter the chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times in the heart. Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, inwardly and outwardly shrouded in mist. Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber; a radiant halo appears above the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all must be vividly perceived.\n\nThe secret incantation says:\n*Tanluo Yuluo, Fuwu Sutuo.*\n*Great Thoroughfare, Supreme Ultimate,*\n*Yin Heart—no wine, no lust,*\n*Change garments, burn incense,*\n*Recite scriptures, practice goodness,*\n*Sit without sleep, Yang envelops Harmony.*\n*Exiting existence, entering non-existence,*\n*Entering life, exiting death.*\n*Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom,*\n*Transformations arise naturally.*\n*Primordial Hunqi, Mystery within Mystery.*\n*Above, it reaches the End; below, it penetrates the Great Abyss.*\n*Recite once, and chronic illness heals itself.*\n*Refine the hun-soul, bathe the po-soul,*\n*True Yang is preserved whole.*\n*Observe abstinence, perform rites, recite—*\n*Ten thousand repetitions, and one ascends as an immortal.*\n*This supreme secret incantation grants an enduring mandate.*\n*Recite the heart incantation again:*\n*Tanluo reveals the light.*\n*Jade Clarity, Supreme Pole,*\n*Brahma qi suffuses and steams.*\n*Dispense the numinous, spread the qi,*\n*Bestow and infuse the body.*\n*Form and spirit both wondrous,*\n*Merge with the Dao and become true.*\n*This servant attains the Dao,*\n*Seven ancestors ascend as immortals.*\n*Like golden statutes, they descend,*\n*Commanding the ten thousand spirits.*\n*Hasten! As the Law of the Primordial Mystery and the Mystic Capital decrees.*\n\nThe Most High Primordial Supreme Lord of the Dao summons from this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officers—thirty-two each. They are to relay the words spoken today: a day of auspicious celebration, a hall of purity and fasting, the cultivation of this supreme scripture, the deliverance of boundless beings, the turning of the scriptures to receive rebirth. May the prayers ascend directly to the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens before the august throne.\n\nAfterward, draw qi thirty-two times and recite the scriptures facing east.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This scripture truly reveals the essence of cultivation and demonstrates the truth of the ancestral qi. Thus, it speaks of \"the day of practicing the Dao\" rather than \"the day of reciting scriptures,\" for one must know: the scripture is the elixir, the elixir is the Dao, and the Dao is the scripture. Without the Dao, the scripture does not emerge; without the scripture, the elixir does not emerge; without the elixir, the Dao is not accomplished. This is an immutable principle, with no alternative path. Here, the application of the Dao and the worldly Dharma are expounded together.\n\nThere are two kinds of practicing the Dao: internal and external. First, the external practice: bathing, observing abstinence, solemnly arranging the altar, burning incense, reciting scriptures, pacing the void, and offering morning and evening praises—this is the external practice of the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Primordial Sovereign of the Eastern Sea said: Using five-fragrance water and reciting incantations to wash the body is the great external bathing in Brahma qi, which circulates through the ten directions. Internally, it harmonizes the five qi and unites the hundred spirits—this is internal bathing.\n\nAbstinence does not merely mean refraining from meat and impurity; one must first sever lustful desires. Only then can the heart be aligned to avert misfortune, and the nature be restrained to dispel calamity.",

      "translated_text": "Entering the chamber means entering stillness, free from worldly dust, with body and mind wholly concentrated—thus may one commune with the divine spirits. The east is the direction of long life, where one summons the qi of generation; the method of knocking the teeth: the left is the Heavenly Bell, the right the Heavenly Chime, to summon the immortals. The center is the Heavenly Drum, used to offer morning praises to the Most High. Heart-bowing means the body remains unmoving while the mind is wholly intent on reverence. Closing the eyes means withdrawing vision to gaze inward, so that qi settles into profound stillness.\n\nAzure is the qi of the Mysterious One, yellow the qi of the Primordial One, white the qi of the Original One. The significance of these three colors is drawn from the Three Pure Ones. Sitting in meditation upon them, the divine numina will naturally appear. Inner visions and outer realms merge in misty oneness.\n\nNext, visualize the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver and residing on the left; the White Tiger emerging from the lungs and residing on the right; the Vermilion Bird emerging from the heart and residing in front; the Dark Warrior emerging from the kidneys and residing behind. Visualize six lions and six cranes emerging from the six bowels, dividing left and right.\n\nThe left eye transforms into the solar orb, radiating nine layers of purple-red light; the right eye transforms into the lunar orb, radiating seven layers of yellow-white light. These orbs stand three feet from the body, their brilliance resplendent, shining into the nose, passing through the back of the brain, entering the Golden Flower Palace, and coalescing into a wheel of light as large as a chariot wheel. The three colors—azure, yellow, and white—intermingle within it, forming the Nine-Colored Round Image. With this radiance, illuminate the ten directions, then recite the preceding esoteric incantation. \"Esoteric\" means not vocalizing aloud. After the incantation, perform the closing announcement as before.\n\nOnce the closing announcement is complete, face east and sit upright. Visualize the four spirit-beasts and other gods emerging from within the body, arrayed before you to listen to the Dharma and hear the scriptures. Then recite aloud with resonant clarity, without straying thoughts, idle conversation, or interrupting the scriptural recitation. As if before a sovereign or father, allow no trace of negligence—strive to achieve thorough resonance with Heaven. This is the external practice of the Dao, the natural course of worldly methods.\n\nIf one practices the internal Dao, however, it becomes the application of the Dao. The matter is entirely distinct—why? When ordinary people read scriptures, they merely read through them without realizing that the scripture itself is a great practice, teaching one to follow the Dao within it. Thus, it is called the day of practicing the Dao, not the day of reading scriptures. In refining the internal elixir, there is the work of entering the chamber and applying effort, hence it is called entering the chamber facing east, not ascending the altar. Ascending the hall refers to the teachings of refining the returning elixir.\n\nNow, the scripture is reverence. The Heavenly Worthy expounds the scriptures to enable the foolish to know where to return. Reverence inclines the heart toward goodness, prevents wrongdoing, and through storing spirit and nurturing qi, one may avoid disaster. If one recites without bathing, observing abstinence, or changing garments before entering the chamber, one will instead invite misfortune and condemnation. Yet if a superior person or perfected being practices the Dao within the scripture, it is called the day of practicing the Dao. The scripture is the Dao, and the Dao is the elixir—only in refining the elixir does the matter of entering the chamber arise, hence it is called entering the chamber facing east.\n\nIn refining the returning elixir, one must first refine the self and stabilize the mind, hence the term \"bathing.\" A person of the Dao first severs desires, hence the term \"abstinence.\" The foolish, unaware of this, merely recite loudly without understanding. What is practicing the Dao? It is refining the returning elixir. What is the returning elixir? It must be taught by a master. Thus, the Perfected One of Pure Yang said: \"Without a master’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know.\" Laozi said: \"I am not a sage; I obtained this through learning.\" Therefore, to learn the elixir, one must first seek a master and not recklessly speculate.\n\nHaving received the master’s transmission, one must first refine the self. What is refining the self? It is eliminating desires and nurturing essence and qi. Thus, Pure Yang said: \"First refine the self and await the time.\" Having refined the self, one must find a fellow practitioner to serve as external protection. Liu Haichan said: \"This matter is no ordinary matter; seeking a person, one has not yet found the right person.\" Chen Ninwan said: \"Without like-minded companions to guide one, when awakened, one may fear the fire-timing in the crucible is amiss.\"\n\nHaving found a companion, first seek the furnace and cauldron. The *Awakening to Reality* states: \"First take Qian and Kun as the furnace and vessel; next, gather the Crow and Hare as the medicine to refine.\" Having obtained the furnace and cauldron, then select the day. What is selecting the day? The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"When lead encounters the birth of Gui, one must swiftly gather it.\" He also said: \"When the sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite.\" This is the meaning.\n\nHaving obtained the day, one must also obtain the hour. Then proceed with the hexagram qi. Thus, the *Awakening to Reality* says: \"Take the solid center of the Kan position and transform the yin within the Li palace.\" Therefore, knocking the teeth thirty-two times and bowing thirty-two times corresponds to the sixty-four hexagrams. Closing the eyes in still contemplation—Master Boyang said: \"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be closed and not allowed to leak.\" The Perfected One dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass within.\n\nSitting amidst the azure, yellow, and white clouds of qi—my master Yuanduzi said: \"The primordial qi of the prior Heaven comes from the realm of emptiness and non-being. Azure qi is mercury, white qi is lead, and yellow qi is earth. Before mercury and lead unite, they rely on earth to combine them.\" The *Preface by Purple Yang* states: \"Pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the palace of non-being, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images. When the dragon intones and the tiger roars, husband and wife follow in succession, then one knows the inner and outer merge in misty oneness, the four beasts arrayed, the sun and moon shining brightly, illuminating the chamber within. A wheel of light appears above the nape—so vividly clear.\"\n\nThe esoteric incantation refers to the great sound that is soundless. This is called practicing the Dao, this is called reciting scriptures, this is called the inner and outer two visions. Once the elixir is refined, then perform the closing announcement, and the hun and po within the body will all transform into spirits.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe work of entering the chamber severs deluded emotions,\nReciting scriptures and practicing the Dao—begin cultivation early.\nIt is said that the Jade Maiden first makes the announcement,\nThen one ascends through the thirty-two heavens in sequence.",
      "overlap_context": " Sovereign of the Eastern Sea said: Using five-fragrance water and reciting incantations to wash the body is the great external bathing in Brahma qi, which circulates through the ten directions. Internally, it harmonizes the five qi and unites the hundred spirits—this is internal bathing.\n\nAbstinence does not merely mean refraining from meat and impurity; one must first sever lustful desires. Only then can the heart be aligned to avert misfortune, and the nature be restrained to dispel calamity.",

      "translated_text": "The *Supreme Esoteric Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, First Scroll* concludes.\n\n*The Supreme Esoteric Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery, Middle Scroll*\nCommentary by Chen Guanwu of Shangyang\n\nShangyangzi states: \"Scripture\" is the Dao, and it is reverence. The Dao is to be honored in practice, and reverence is to be upheld without lapse. The world knows what to revere: the Three Treasures. These Three Treasures are indeed the essence of the wondrous Dao. Explained through the Dao’s function, they are called the Three Treasures within the body; explained through worldly dharma, they are called the Three Treasures within the teachings. Regarding the Three Treasures within the body, there are two matters. Regarding the Three Treasures within the teachings, there are two interpretations.\n\nHere, the Three Treasures within the teachings are the Dao, the scriptures, and the master. There are two interpretations: the present canon and the ancient canon. The Dao is the primordial qi of the Mysterious Unity of Primordial Beginning, which gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings—this is the Treasure of the Dao. The scriptures are the teachings expounded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord from the Dao of the Mysterious Unity of Primordial Beginning, serving as the ladder and raft for all ages—this is the Treasure of the Scriptures. The master is Lord Lao, who descended to bestow the scriptures and registers upon Heavenly Master Zhang, transmitting the teachings through the world—this is the Treasure of the Master. The origin and transmission of the teachings truly follow the Heavenly Master, yet there are also two interpretations. Thus, the Three Treasures of the earlier canon are called the present canon, while those of the later canon are called the ancient canon, and their designations differ.\n\nThis is the worldly method of transforming customs. If speaking of the Dao’s function, then it is the Three Treasures within the body, which also comprise two matters. The essence of the Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Unity and utmost perfection is called the Heavenly Treasure, also known as the Treasure of the Dao. The precelestial qi of the Golden Liquor of Supreme Clarity is called the Numinous Treasure, also known as the Treasure of the Scriptures. The spirit of the Primal Chaos and the Ultimateless is called the Spirit Treasure, also known as the Dharma Treasure. Without these Three Treasures within the body, one cannot return the elixir, cannot become a buddha, cannot attain immortality. The *Great Golden Book of the Three Treasures* states that the Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Spirit Treasure all transform through qi—these are also the Three Treasures within the body.\n\nIf discussing the Dao of the golden liquor and returning the elixir, then the Three Treasures within the body have two further interpretations: spirit, qi, and essence are the inner Three Treasures, while the ears, eyes, and mouth are the outer Three Treasures. If one honors the outer Three Treasures and does not act recklessly, then the inner Three Treasures will coalesce to form the returned elixir and nurture the fetal immortal. Thus, the true writs and precious talismans, the dragon scripts and phoenix seals, the jade tablets and golden books, the profound classics of the Three Caverns, and the thirty-six sections of eighteen thousand chapters all emerge from the Three Treasures—these are called scriptures. Therefore, scripture is the elixir, the primordial qi of the precelestial.\n\nThis *Scripture of Limitless Salvation* was expounded by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord from the Dao of Primordial Beginning and transmitted to the Perfected of Mysterious Unity. The Perfected of Mysterious Unity transmitted it to the Heavenly Perfected August Person, who, following the Dao Lord’s transmission, inscribed it into scripture. Thus, each chapter begins with the words of the Dao, except for this chapter and the two chapters of the *Jade Calendar*, where the August Person directly inscribed the Dao of Primordial Beginning. Yet all derive from the Dao Lord’s transmission. Today, some mistakenly regard chapters with the words of the Dao as prefaces and those without as the scripture itself. To recite only the two chapters while omitting the preceding scripture is even more erroneous.\n\nThe title *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity* was bestowed by the August Person. This title, *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, was bestowed by the Dao Lord. Though the origins and transmissions of the scriptures differ, all scriptures emerge from the Dao Lord, and thus the Dao Lord is the Treasure of the Scriptures. The scriptures embody the Dao in practice, and the Dao functions through the scriptures. If discussing the golden liquor and returning the elixir, then the scriptures precede the elixir in practice, and the elixir follows the scriptures in function. Borrowing the scriptures to represent the elixir, it is called the *Precelestial Supreme Numinous Treasure Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir*. Borrowing the Dao to expound the scriptures, it is called the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe spirit, qi, and essence of Primordial Beginning’s precelestial,\nIts wondrous workings boundless, most numinous.\nTo save others and oneself, one must be saved by others—\nThe supreme elixir’s method is the wondrous scripture.\n\nThe primordial Cavernous Mystery, the original chapter of the Numinous Treasure,\nThe supreme wondrous beginning, ten cycles of salvation,\nA hundred demons concealed in rhyme, naturally converging and parting,\nThe crimson writ of the Chaotic Abyss—\nThe Ultimateless, the Supreme Perfected, the Primordial Beginning’s kalpas,\nGiving birth to all heavens, illuminating the Three Luminaries,\nThis is the root of heaven.\nAbove, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\nThe five writs unfold and expand, universally planting numinous spirits.\nWithout writ, there is no radiance; without writ, there is no illumination;\nWithout writ, there is no establishment; without writ, there is no completion;\nWithout writ, there is no salvation; without writ, there is no birth—\nThis is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven,\nThe Jade Capital of Yu Luo, the Supreme Capital of the Jade Mountain.\nUtmost above the utmost, the Great Canopy of Jade Clarity.\nVast kalpas stretch into the distance, as if absent, as if present.\nThe Three Flowers part, the wondrous court of Great Existence.\nGolden towers and jade chambers, the pure expanse of the forest of principles.\nThe great circulation of Brahmā qi revolves through the ten directions.\nWithin it are the spirits who save humanity, the deathless gods,\nWithin it is the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,\nWithin it is the Great God Sima who saves the world,\nWithin it is the Venerable Han Jun who cherishes life,\nWithin it are the exalted gods of the Southern Supreme who govern destiny, record deeds, extend life, increase years, and save from calamity—\nThey turn back bones and revive the dead, boundlessly saving humanity.\n\nToday, the collation is recorded.

yin and yang share the same wonder yet are pure.\nSun and moon contain wonder and shine; the five phases unite in wonder and are refined.\nThe myriad things are all wondrous and true.\n*The Inner Meaning* says: The wondrous chief of the highest grade is the golden liquid returning elixir, the crown of the supreme wondrous Dao.\n“Delivering people ten times” is the work of ten months, delivering the world to become immortals.\n“The hundred demons conceal their rhymes” is another name for the elixir.\n“Separation and union occur naturally” compares the interval between metal and wood, which can again merge; water and fire, which oppose each other, can again achieve harmony—naturally completing creation.\nThe *Crimson Text of Primal Chaos* is the original source of the myriad things, the true nature of all beings.\nThe ancestor of the one qi, the ancestor revered by the myriad spirits.\n*The Scripture of Western Ascent* says: The empty and non-being generates the natural; the natural completes the great Dao.\nAs for the Dao, it is formless and without substance, the one qi of prior heaven that transforms and generates the myriad things, the foundation of heaven and earth’s creation.\nThose who refine the golden elixir embody the workings of creation through emptiness and naturalness.\nThe true one qi of prior heaven is called “empty qi.”\nThe golden womb, born of the golden mother, serves as the foundation of the elixir.\nThis qi, before father and mother united, shared the same body with chaos, hence called “primal chaos.”\nAfter father and mother joined in essence, this qi responded and attached itself, called “yang essence.”\nIt is likened to silver ore, named “original spirit,” stored in the Palace of Earth, thus called “nature,” the original face.\nBefore birth it is called “yin metal”; after birth it is called “yang lead,” the mother of the five metals.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: Directly pointing to the spirit-root of heaven and earth, taking it as the ancestor of medicine; clearly showing the holy mother of yin and yang, using it as the foundation of the elixir.\nBefore heaven and earth’s chaos, this qi congealed into jade characters, hence called “crimson text.”\nIt is the supreme, unsurpassable, most true and wondrous Dao, thus called the “true of the non-being and non-non-being.”\nIn the primordial kalpa of the Primordial Beginning, the primordial qi of the various heavens was generated.\nThe beginning qi of the ancestral kalpa initially divided into three qi, generating the Three Heavens: the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Heaven of Yu Remainder, and the Heaven of Great Crimson.\nThe qi of the Three Heavens further divided into nine qi, generating the Nine Heavens: the Heaven of Beginning Azure, the Heaven of Azure Prime, the Heaven of Beginning Cinnabar, the Heaven of Great Cinnabar, the Heaven of Beginning Simplicity, the Heaven of Great Simplicity, the Heaven of Beginning Mystery, the Heaven of Great Mystery, and the Heaven of Azure Tenuity.\nThe Brahmā qi of the Nine Heavens further divided to generate the Nine Firmaments and Nine Heavens: the Heaven of Great Firmament Radiant Flowing Light and Pure Scenery, the Heaven of Azure Firmament Primordial True Treasure Radiance, the Heaven of Azure Firmament General Life Opening Spirit and Transmitting Dao, the Heaven of Crimson Firmament Great Peace Response and Transformation Dao Lord, the Heaven of Cinnabar Firmament Central Culmen Supreme Wondrous Empty Transformation, the Heaven of Jade Firmament Luminous Prime Majestic Virtue Shining Crystal, the Heaven of Jade Firmament Flying Azure Prime Pass Transmitting Salvation, the Heaven of Purple Firmament Conjoined Scenery Double Gates Transformation Body, and the Heaven of Divine Firmament Jade Purity Wondrous Scenery Great Existence.\nThe Brahmā qi of the Nine Firmaments further divided to generate the Nine Heavens below, namely the Nine Heavens of Spirit Generation:\n1. The Heaven of Southern Fragrance Immeasurable Abundance;\n2. The Heaven of Northwest Meditation Goodness Immeasurable Longevity;\n3. The Heaven of Eastern Brahmā Surveillance Prolonged Extension;\n4. The Heaven of Southwest Serene Constellation Tuṣita;\n5. The Heaven of Southeast Pāramitā Secret Joyous Non-Pride;\n6. The Heaven of Northern Cavernous Prime Transformation Response Sound;\n7.

The Heaven of Central Non-Thought Non-Knot Non-Attachment.\nBelow these, the Thirty-Six Heavens of Great Existence, Jade Purity, and Supreme Purity were generated, and below them the Four Heavens of Seed People.\nOne million three hundred fifty-eight thousand li below the Heavens of Seed People lie the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm.",

      "translated_text": "Beneath the Formless Realm, at a distance of three hundred sixty thousand *li*, lie the Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm. Within the Form Realm are six Heavens of Light Dust, six Heavens of Fine Dust, and six Heavens of Coarse Dust.\n\nBelow the Form Realm, at a distance of three hundred thousand *li*, lie the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm. Beneath the Desire Realm, five hundred twenty billion ten-thousand *li* distant, five hundred million heavens are transformed and generated, along with the Eight Round Worlds.\n\nAbove the Four Heavens of Seed People, the sun, moon, and stars are arrayed, governing and sustaining the myriad things—hence called the Three Luminaries of Illumination.\n\nHuman birth follows a similar pattern. Father’s essence and mother’s blood gather within the mother’s womb. Before essence and blood congeal, they resemble a pearl or dewdrop; after congealing, the fivefold form takes shape: the head and the four limbs. In males, the left kidney forms first, followed by the right Gate of Life. In females, the reverse occurs. The root of inherent nature continues the lineage between the two kidneys, and the wondrously transforming *qi* naturally arises. Next, the divine waters of the two pupils form above, followed by the generation of the five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, hundred vessels, sinews, bones, teeth, and hair. When *qi* is sufficient and the form is complete as metal, the fetus emerges from the womb.\n\nThus, Lord Lao said: \"Heaven and Earth unite their essence; yin and yang spread and transform. In the first month, it is the embryo—essence and blood congeal. In the second month, it is the fetus—form begins to take shape. In the third month, the yang spirit becomes the Three Hun, moving to give life. In the fourth month, the yin numen becomes the Seven Po, still to stabilize the form. In the fifth month, the Five Agents divide into the five viscera to settle the spirit. In the sixth month, the Six Pitches determine the six bowels to nourish the numen. In the seventh month, the Seven Essences open the seven orifices to convey radiance. In the eighth month, the Eightfold Splendor of the spirit is complete, descending with true numen. In the ninth month, palaces and chambers are arrayed to secure essence. In the tenth month, *qi* is sufficient, and the myriad images are complete.\"\n\nThus, when spirit spreads and *qi* fills the thirty-six thousand joints, the root-source and original beginning simultaneously generate the spirit. This is the transformation and generation of the myriad heavens, the Three Luminaries of Illumination—this is the Heavenly Root.\n\nThe *Fundamental Scripture* states: \"Only when the Dao attains three is it complete; thus, three unite to form virtue. If the Dao does not reach three, nothing can be accomplished.\" Internally, this refers to lead, mercury, and cinnabar. Directly pointing to the matter, it is our true nature, the wondrous transformations of daily use, and the union of yin and yang *qi* to form three. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is the body.\n\nThe *Scripture of Lord Lao’s Transformation of the Barbarians* states: \"The Dao is the primordial *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. Heaven and Earth follow it to generate the myriad things, which rely upon it for form—all are the wondrous transformations of the ancestral *qi*. In the Dao, this is called the Golden Elixir; thus, it is said, 'Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is the body.'\"\n\nThe Five Scripts open and expand, universally planting the divine numen. In the Elixir, the One *Qi* returns and transforms to generate the Five Agents; when the Five Agents are complete, the Golden Embryo forms. In the scriptures, the Jade Characters emerge and coalesce into the Red Script; when the Five Scripts are complete, they plant the divine numen.\n\nThe Five Agents are lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth. Heaven One generates water, and within Kan (☵) lies lead. Earth Two generates fire, and within Li (☲) cinnabar is produced. Heaven Three generates wood, and within Zhen (☳) the dragon governs mercury. Earth Four generates metal, and within Dui (☱) the tiger embodies silver. Heaven Five generates earth, and within the Central Palace the Elixir coalesces.\n\nThe Dao is not illuminated without these; the scriptures are not clarified without these; the body is not established without these; the Elixir is not completed without these; *qi* is not transcended without these; the medicine is not generated without these—this is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven. The Great Brahmā is the primordial *qi* congealed, with the Five Agents fully prepared. The Heaven within Heaven means there is a body within the body.\n\nYu Luo Xiao Terrace is the region of the brain. Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is the Muddy Pellet. The Utmost Supreme is the Great Canopy of Jade Purity and Supreme Mystery above the Muddy Pellet. Within the Supreme Mystery lies a secret mechanism called the High Ascent of Sun and Moon—the essential method for spirit transformation and shedding the embryo.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Ascending the sun and moon, I attain the Dao above, and behold the Jade Purity of Emptiness and Nothingness, the Ancient One.\" Vast and immeasurable, most high and most revered, it is as if absent, as if present. Thus, Master Zhang said: \"Gazing upon it, one cannot see its form; yet when calling it, it responds with the Three Flowers.\"\n\nLi (☲) corresponds to the crown of the head, belonging to the south. The south is originally the number three; the crown is the Flower Canopy, also called the Round Canopy. The south belongs to Li, and Li is the position of *wu* (午). The Three Flowers are Golden Flower, Jade Flower, and Ninefold Flower. When the Inner Elixir has coalesced, the crown bears the Three Flowers.\n\nThe Great Wondrous Court is the Upper Cinnabar Field—the cavity where the hundred passages converge. The Golden Gate and Jade Chamber: the Sun Palace is the Golden Gate, the left eye; the Moon Palace is the Jade Chamber, the right eye. The Forest of Stars refers to the constellations. It speaks of the sun, moon, and stars arrayed, and the nine orifices of the body becoming clear and luminous.\n\nThe Great Flowing Brahmā *Qi* is the wondrous primordial *qi*. \"Circulating through the ten directions\" describes the wondrous *qi* nourishing and protecting the Golden Embryo’s divine chamber, warming and nurturing the Great Elixir. The above are brief annotations of Daoist practice. There are yet more wondrous subtleties, which must be transmitted heart-to-heart.\n\nOnce the inner landscape is revealed, the outer landscape must also be understood. Now, I further explain in terms of worldly methods, so that the wise and foolish alike may each possess eyes and vision.\n\nThe Red Script of Primal Chaos emerges from the *qi* of primordial chaos congealing into the Red Script. Once the script emerges, the wondrous scriptures circulate. When the wondrous scriptures circulate, the ancestral *qi* resides within the human body, dispersing into the categories of things—this is called the Supreme Truth of No-Nothingness.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning transformed and generated the myriad heavens through the great kalpas. The Primordial Beginning, as the ancestor of the Dao, governs the great kalpas and, with the ancestral *qi*, transforms and generates the myriad heavens. The ancestral *qi* divides into the Three *Qi*, which belong to the Three Pure Realms of the Great Canopy. Thus, it is called the Three Luminaries of Illumination.\n\nKnow that this *qi* remains unharmed even through great kalpas—hence, it is called the Heavenly Root. This *qi* is the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate, which generates Heaven and Earth, the Five Agents, and the myriad beings. Thus, it is said, \"Above, there is no further ancestor.\" The Dao within the human body is like the *qi* within Heaven and Earth; thus, it is said, \"Only the Dao is the body.\"",

      "translated_text": "When the Crimson Zhangli stands, the Five Patterns unfold and expand; when the scriptural Dharma is practiced, spiritual beings are universally planted. Without scriptural texts, there can be no illumination, no establishment, no self-deliverance. This scripture, self-generated, is the Great Brahma, the sound of the highest rank, the Heaven within Heaven—it is the sacred realm of the Three Pure Ones within the Great Canopy. \"Great\" means it covers the myriad heavens; \"Canopy\" means it encompasses the Three Realms. Within it lies the Jade Capital Mountain, eighty thousand *li* in circumference, standing opposite Kunlun below. The mountain bears the Terrace of Lush Radiance, upon which rests a Seven-Treasures City. Above, beyond all bounds, stands the Jade Pure Palace, and further, the Three-Flowered Palace of Detached Convenience, the Great Wondrous Court—all places where the Heavenly Worthies repose and rest. Golden towers and jade chambers, jasper pools and emerald waters, arrayed in solemn order, all depend on the revolving circulation of Brahma-*qi* to endure and persist eternally. Within this realm dwell the spirits who deliver people from death—these are the emanations of the Primordial Beginning. The Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Great Emperor of Vermilion Numinosity, governs the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure and oversees the affairs of fire refinement. The Lord of World-Deliverance presides over the transformations of the Nine Hundred and Six Yang calamities. The Lord Sima oversees the eradication of evil and the repelling of trials.

      "translated_text": "Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void,\nTheir radiant light turned back, they oversee the perfected and deliver the living.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi says: The Flying Heavenly Great Saints of the Ten Directions are all emanations of the Primordial Dao’s qi. Their taboo names are:\nEast: Zong\nSouth: Fei\nWest: Yun\nNorth: Wujing\nNortheast: Fan\nSoutheast: Nayu\nSouthwest: Duxian\nNorthwest: Jueqi\nAbove: Ying\nBelow: Luo\n\nThey are also called the Ten Directions’ Great Saints of Longevity, or the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering. By the mandate of the Primordial Beginning, they govern the weighing of merits and virtues across the Ten Directions and Three Realms, opening deliverance to the boundless, encompassing life and death, and refining the adepts.\n\nThe *Hidden Canon* records that in the heavens of the Eight Directions, there exist Boundless Great Thousandfold Worlds:\nThe Boundless Heavens of the East hold the Great Thousandfold World of Nadatangxiang, the Realm of Gathering Goodness;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the South hold the Great Thousandfold World of Wanlichengjing, the Realm of Forsaking the Worthy;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the West hold the Great Thousandfold World of Futangzhou, the Realm of Universal Conduct;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the North hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yudanye, the Realm of Purity;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Northeast hold the Great Thousandfold World of Fujidu, the Realm of Eternal Peace;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Southeast hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yuanfutian, the Realm of Employing the Worthy;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Southwest hold the Great Thousandfold World of Yanfuxiang, the Realm of Benevolent Stillness;\nThe Boundless Heavens of the Northwest hold the Great Thousandfold World of Fudeye, the Realm of Extending Worthiness;\nThe Upper Heavens of Supreme Purity’s Jade Perfection hold the Thirty-Six Heavens of Xuandu, the Boundless World;\nThe Lower Heavens of Huangzeng hold the Thirty-Two Heavens of Bayuan, the Boundless World.\n\nThe boundless great spirits oversee the affairs of attaining the Dao, longevity, and world-deliverance.\n\nThe Perfected of Azure Origin says: Chariots, wheels, and canopies are formed from the qi of yang essence; phoenixes, cranes, dragons, and simurghs are transformations of the qi of yin essence. The perfected saints, possessing the constant Dao, harmonize their breath—gathering and dispersing at will, manifesting as they please. The harmony of yin and yang qi resembles song and melody, all wrought by qi, not external things. When a person’s returning elixir is complete, the yin demons are also transformed into yang spirits. With a single breath of primordial qi, the myriad spirits all heed; the spirits of the five viscera each appear in their directional colors. The chariots, carriages, and retinue come to welcome, the hundred bones’ host of spirits lead the way, and the following ascent to the Primordial is no different.\n\nThe Five Elders who clear the path are:\nThe Azure Spirit Elder of the East, surnamed Guan, taboo name Kai, style Lingweiyang;\nThe Cinnabar Spirit Perfected Elder of the South, surnamed Dongfu, taboo name Jiyan, style Chibiaonu;\nThe Primordial Spirit Primordial Elder of the Center, surnamed Tongban, taboo name Yuanshi, style Hanzhuniu;\nThe Radiant Spirit August Elder of the West, surnamed Shangjin, taboo name Changkai, style Yaopobao;\nThe Dark Spirit Mysterious Elder of the North, surnamed Heijie, taboo name Linghui, style Yinhouju.\n\nThe Great Saints of the Ten Directions, exalted in their Dao rank, thus evoke the Five Elders to clear the path while the host of immortals flanks the procession. Myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive floating through the void—yet all are the divine bodies of the Dharma.\n\nThe *Elixir Canon* states: The spirit rides the qi, and the qi abides in form. Their radiant light turned back, jade light and flying clouds swirl around the Dharma-throne of the Heavenly Worthies, leading and overseeing the assembly of perfected, assessing and delivering the ranks of lords. In alchemical terms, “turning back the radiant light” signifies the completion of the Kan-Li union, the intercourse of yin and yang, the transformation and birth of the true spirit, and the nurturing of the embryo chamber—hence, “overseeing the perfected and delivering the living.”\n\nA hymn says:\nThe Heavenly Perfected of the Boundless gather in the Palace of Medicines,\nCinnabar and simurgh carriages ride the floating void.\nTurning back the radiant light, the host of immortals rejoices—\nYang grows, yin wanes: the wondrous work of transformation.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Heavens, the Supreme Palace of Nanchang, the Recorder Han, the Great Spirit Who Oversees Life—holding registers and grasping ledgers, they all arrive before the Emperor. According to whom deliverance is due, they strictly assess the heavens. Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Boundless Spirit Regions, the Yellow Springs’ courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources: the ancestors and forebears of a thousand kalpas, the kin of countless eons—swiftly erase their ledgers of sins, sever their roots of evil, and forbid their detention or coercion into ghostly throngs. By the talismanic mandate of the Primordial Beginning, they ascend in due time. From the Cold Pool of the Northern Capital, their forms and souls are escorted, demons restrained, and merits protected—delivered to the Southern Palace for ranking. The souls of the dead undergo refinement and transform into immortals; the living who receive deliverance endure through kalpas, everlasting. Through kalpas they revolve, their years equaling Heaven’s. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Supreme Purity.\n\nThe Heaven of Supreme Purity is the Realm of the Heavenly Emperor’s Jade Perfection, the Formless Realm of Brahma-conduct.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi says: This Dao employs both the methods of the Dao and the principles of the world—both must be understood.\n\nIn worldly terms:\nThe Chancellors of the Heavens—each heaven has its chancellor, also called the Great Luo Divine Duke. Nanchang is the world of the Cinnabar Heaven; the Supreme Palace is the Scarlet Numinous Fire Mansion. The Venerable One of the Han Bureau is the Controller of Destiny. He oversees the affairs of refining and delivering the records. The Recorder is the celestial minister who assists the Heavenly Emperor in recording. The Office of Registers oversees the forging of souls. When the Most High expounds the scriptures, each holds their ledgers and arrives before the Emperor to assess those due for deliverance. Some are destined by their names in the Mysterious Register or their bone configurations for immortality; others accumulate merits through cultivation, observance of precepts, or reverence for the Three Treasures, their good deeds piercing Heaven; still others make offerings to the masters and treasures, praised by the Three Offices. Those whose names are in the heavens undergo strict examination and assessment, their merits measured and ranks determined—according to their excellence, they receive ascent and deliverance.\n\nIn Daoist terms:\nHolding registers and grasping ledgers, the qi of the Primordial Beginning divides, and yin and yang separate; the Three Powers are established, and the records arise. The *Inner Meaning* states: Manifesting in benevolence, they become ledgers; concealed in function, they become yin and yang. Without ledgers in the hidden and manifest, how could merits and sins be recorded? Without yin and yang in Heaven and Earth, how could creation be accomplished? Thus, the Emperor’s presence is the divine chamber of the Central Palace, where the Emperor resides—all seas converge like spokes to a hub, where spirits abide—all qi coalesces in harmony.",

The Heavenly Worthy’s scriptural teachings are no empty words—they urge people to practice the Way.\n\nThose who cultivate and study must first correct their faults and turn toward goodness, uphold precepts and guard against lust, abandon deceit and still their scheming, purify the heart and reduce desires. Alas! Worldly people chase the trivial and forget the fundamental, devalue life and treat the body lightly. The heroic and bold are enslaved by fame and merit; the wise and exceptional are shackled by ambition; the well-clothed and well-fed are trapped by their schemes; the poor and destitute are burdened by their bodily needs. Even those who leave the dusty world, delighting in ease and comfort, mistakenly believe that emptiness and non-action alone constitute cultivation—how could they ever attain the convergence of yin and yang within the divine chamber?\n\nAs for those who are to be delivered, the Way of the Golden Elixir demands true effort, and rewards follow according to merit. With ten parts effort comes ten parts reward; even a single lapse yields a corresponding deficiency.

The human body is endowed with the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning at birth, yet in the prime of life, one stumbles into the realm of intoxication and dreams, and this qi flees and is lost. For the cultivator, one must first refine the yin within yang to retain true mercury, then refine the yang within yin to seek true lead. In a single moment of concentration, the Elixir coalesces, and one may hope for ascension and promotion. The Northern Capital is the root of nature, where true mercury flourishes. The Cold Pool is the Gate of Life, where true lead flourishes. When lead and mercury unite, nature and life merge, and one must seize the moment with a single thought to guard the body and the hun-soul. If the form is whole and the hun-soul restored, the pulse halts and qi ceases, the Reverted Elixir begins to form—thus one can subdue demons, ensure promotion, and pass through the Southern Palace for ranking. The so-called withered corpse and dying hun-soul, refined by this lead-fire, attain the wondrous transformation of divine immortality and become perfected beings.\n\nTo deliver the living body—this single phrase revealed by the Heavenly Worthy clarifies the essence of the Reverted Elixir. For this scripture speaks not only for the dead, but for the living practitioner who receives this true qi for deliverance. Moreover, in the living body, yin and yang may be made whole, and the workings of creation grasped. If the practitioner, within this mortal frame, can invert the Five Phases and cultivate this Great Elixir to become a lofty immortal, then one may endure for kalpas unending, revolving through the ages, sharing the lifespan of Heaven, forever escaping the Eight Difficulties, transcending the Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm, rising above the Four Kinds of Heavenly Beings, and roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.\n\nXue Youqi said: The Upper Clarity has thirty-six heavens, whose heavenly emperors are equal in Dao to the Primordial Beginning, their ranks arrayed in the Jade Clarity. Thus it is said that the Jade Perfected reside beyond the Formless Realm, outside the bounds of creation, moving by the qi of Brahmanic contemplation, passing in and out without obstruction. They are not like the thirty-two heavens confined within the Three Realms. Hence it is called the Brahmanic practice. The ode states:\n\nThe Heavenly Emperors and Jade Perfected of the six-six heavens,\nWhen the Elixir is complete and the Dao perfected, share Heaven’s years.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, their merit fulfilled,\nFor kalpas unending they endure as Upper Immortals.\n\nSome versions mistakenly attribute the name of this Heavenly Emperor to the *Primordial Numinous Writ, Upper Chapter*. Yet they fail to recognize that the *Heavenly Duke’s Scripture* states: The Great Brahma Heaven has its own *Numinous Writ, Upper Chapter*, along with the *Observing Awareness* and the *Coiled Dragon Seal Script*, contained within the *Numinous Writ, Middle Chapter*. The Former Shu edition sometimes places it in the Lower Chapter—this too is incorrect. The Azure Perfected said: One should follow the *Heavenly Duke’s Scripture*. This is correct.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East are formed from the Primordial Beginning’s accumulation of ninefold yang Brahmanic qi. Six heavens belong to the Desire Realm, and two to the Form Realm. The Heavenly Emperors’ regalia are all azure.\n\nThe Supreme August Yellow-Pervaded Heaven, also called the Pure Heaven or the Witnessing History. Its color is yellow, next to Kui and Bi. Those who cultivate the ten virtues and purify a single sense faculty are reborn here. The Buddhists call this the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings. The Emperor’s name is Yu Jian Yu Ming.

The Emperor’s name is Yuan Yu Qi Jing. The correct pronunciation is Ming Sheng Jiu Zhen. The Heavenly King’s hidden name is Yuan Yu; the perfected one’s inner text is Qi Jing. These four characters are secret to the Nine Dawns Palace of Heaven, which governs the promulgation of governance and teachings.\n\nThe Mysterious Womb Nurturing Heaven, also called the Brahmanic Heaven or the Trāyastriṃśa. Its color is red, next to Wei. Those who cultivate sixty virtues and purify four sense faculties are reborn here. The Buddhists call this the Tuṣita Heaven. The Emperor’s name is Liu Du Nei Xian. The correct pronunciation is Piao Han Mo Ran. The Heavenly Emperor’s hidden name is Liu Du Nei Xian. These four characters are secret to the Primordial Scenery Palace of Heaven, which governs the summoning of demons and promotion of immortals.\n\nThe Primordial Brightness Literary Flourishing Heaven, also called the Transformative Joy. Its color is blue-green, next to Xu. Those who cultivate eighty virtues and purify five sense faculties are reborn here. The Buddhists call this the Nirmāṇarati Heaven. The Emperor’s name is Chou Fa Lun.",

      "translated_text": "The divine perfected scatter and spread, universally delivering heavenly beings and humans.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The Heavenly Emperor’s inner scriptures, hidden names, colored robes, and root-dust—all these the Heavenly Honored One, in compassion for the benighted, commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to annotate, descending to teach those who have not yet heard. See the *Cavernous Spirit Sutra*, *Inner Sound Sutra*, *Dragon’s Soaring Sutra*, *Root-Boundary Sutra*, *Heavenly Duke Sutra*, and others. Huang and Zeng reached the Seven Luminaries and Six Heavens of the Desire Realm—this is the lower realm. At first emerging, with worldly desires not yet extinguished, the people of these heavens touch things and become stained. In the first two heavens, bodily union is desire. In the next two, hand-clasping is desire. In the following five, speech is desire. In the next six, eye-gazing is desire. Because of desire for form, yin and yang intermingle, hence it is called the Desire Realm. Due to their indulgence in desire, signs of decay become apparent, lifespans end, and they sink back into the various destinies. If one gradually cultivates and abandons desire, ascending into the Form Realm, this is the Small Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns, fire arises from the root of Kunlun, burning the world. Flames surge to the Harmony-Sun Heaven, primordial qi disperses, and the heavens collapse. Passing through to the Vow-Swearing Heaven marks the Form Realm—this is the middle realm. The people of these heavens possess six colors and eighteen dusts. When one dust is purified, one ascends to a heaven; when all eighteen dusts are purified, one ascends to the Formless Realm. If one clings even slightly, one falls back into the Desire Realm—this is the Middle Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns with water, it arises from the Eastern Well, vast springs churning waves that flood to the Ultimate Wind Heaven. Primordial qi disperses, and the heavens collapse. From the Radiant Court to the Four Heavens of Elegant Joy is the Formless Realm—this is the upper realm. Only when all dust-stains are purified does one ascend to these heavens. The *Great Perfected Regulations* states: In the Formless Realm, the utmost perfected are without emotion, do not intermingle yin and yang, and if humans are transformed and born there, they only consume true qi, no longer possessing physical form. When one cultivates to a heaven, only the mind-consciousness remains; if the mind-consciousness is extinguished, one ascends step by step. When qi is observed and the Dao is accomplished, one penetrates into spontaneity, ascending to the Seed-People Heaven. The Buddhists call this the Bodhisattva-Striving Heaven—the Great Vehicle Dao.\n\nWhen the great kalpa turns, neither water nor fire reaches it, only wind vast and surging. From Filial Might to the Six Heavens of Cloud-Soaring, the wind destroys them; from Primordial Cavern to Elegant Joy, primordial qi scatters and then recombines, with no further kalpas. From Constant Fusion to the Four Seed-People Heavens of Level Nurturance, penetrating into the true Dao, one ascends to these heavens—this is the Most Supreme Vehicle. When the great kalpa turns and the Three Realms are utterly destroyed, these heavens give birth again to sages as the seed of the people, hence they are called the Seed-People.\n\nThe secrets of the Heavenly Emperor, demons, spirits, and numinous chapters are all formed from the qi of emptiness and cavernousness. All spirits rely on them for transformation, just as the returning elixir depends on the primordial ancestral qi, the work of nine harmonizing with ten, to form the golden embryo. The embryo transforms, and the body enters the Upper Clarity. Of boundless mysteries, this elixir is the most wondrous and transformative, deeply hidden and beyond full explication.\n\n\"Scattering and spreading\" refers to the divine perfected dispersing the true scriptures, arranging them throughout the heavens, commanding them to be upheld, universally delivering heavenly beings and humans, all attaining the wondrous Dao. This is the comprehensive explanation of the Dao’s application and worldly dharma.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe thirty-two heavens in total are dust,\nWhen form and mind are both quiescent, the whole body appears.\nNine harmonizes with ten, the scriptural work complete,\nIn the Golden Watchtower Palace, one attends the Jade Emperor.\n\nToday, joyously celebrating this deliverance, passing through the barriers of all heavens, we request the eradication of the Three Evils, severing the root of earth, flying through the Five Passes, with one’s name recorded in the Great Mystery. The Demon Kings vouch for you, unbound by the Heavenly Gates. The Eastern Dipper governs lifespan, the Western Dipper records names. The Northern Dipper casts down death, the Southern Dipper bestows life, the Central Dipper’s Great Chief oversees all spirits. The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood. The Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transgress him.\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King is Ba Yuan Chou Bo.\nThe Vermilion Heaven Demon King bears the heavens and carries stones.\nThe White Heaven Demon King reverses mountains with six eyes.\nThe Black Heaven Demon King oversees the ugly and fragrant.\nThe Yellow Heaven Demon King bears the heavens with horizontal strength.\n\nThe Five Great Demon Emperors are the lords of all spirits, flying and drumming in procession, commanding ghostly soldiers. Waving banners and beating drums, they roam and observe the great void. Proclaiming themselves resplendent, all heavens share in the merit. Ascending to heaven to deliver people, they strictly govern the Northern Feng. The Divine Duke receives the mandate, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness. The Eight Mighties spew poison, fierce horses spread in four directions. Heavenly Soldiers lead the way, great marshals wield banners. Casting fire for ten thousand miles, flowing bells in eight directions. Should any dare to test or obstruct the perfected, the golden axes strike first, the giant天后 metes out punishment. Slaughtering and severing ghostly brilliance, wind and fire never cease. Thousands upon thousands of heads are cut off, ten thousand upon ten thousand forms are sheared. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not be monstrous. The Three Officials of the Northern Feng inspect the ghostly camps—none may conceal themselves, the golden horse’s courier route. Universally proclaiming without end, all spirits heed.\n\nThe Five Emperors of the Three Realms report to the Upper Clarity.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: The earlier mention of \"today’s recording\" refers to the practitioner refining the self to accumulate merit. This mention of \"today’s joyous deliverance\" refers to refining qi to return the elixir. For the great cultivator, the rarest attainment is today; when lead meets the arising of gui, today; where the yellow sprout arises, today. Having attained today is having attained the proper time. Moreover, possessing both the talent and the person—this is the joyous deliverance.",

      "translated_text": "Passing through the barriers of all heavens, should one desire communion between heaven and humanity, one must first establish sincere communication, beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, sever false karmic ties, cut off the root of earthly existence, and fortify the true nature with steadfast resolve. Gathering and refining the primordial Brahman qi of the Origin, one soars through the Five Gates to return to the origin, thereby inscribing one’s name in the Great Mystery.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate is the Gate of Destiny. When entering the chamber, the Demon Kings oversee the true undertaking, ensuring the Gate of Destiny remains unobstructed. As the Green Yang first returns, the Dipper of the East governs reckoning. When the Golden Flower blooms, the Dipper of the West records names. Drawing the yang from Kan, the Northern Dipper marks death. Mending the deficiency in Li, the Southern Dipper bestows life. When qi returns to the Yellow Court, the Central Dipper oversees all spirits.\n\nThe Green Emperor, surnamed Chang, styled Jingming, guards the hun-soul and governs the liver. The White Emperor, surnamed Hun, styled Rushou, attends the po-soul and governs the lungs. The Red Emperor, surnamed Yan, styled Dongdan, nurtures qi and governs the heart. The Black Emperor, surnamed Xuan, styled Mingmeng, circulates blood and governs the kidneys. The Yellow Emperor, surnamed Ma, styled Zhongshen, presides over the Yellow Hall at the center, commanding all spirits.\n\nThe *Register of the Jade Emperor of the Great Cavern* states: The Five Emperors exist coeval with heaven and earth; when yin and yang first divided, they transformed and gave rise to the Five Phases. For the great cultivator, the Five Emperors descend their spirits to refine the golden liquid, infusing qi to congeal the fetal embryo.\n\nThe Demon King of the Green Heaven, surnamed Bin, styled Chicheng. The Demon King of the Red Heaven, surnamed Fo, named Yousu. The Demon King of the White Heaven, surnamed Chi, named Zhangshi. The Demon King of the Black Heaven, surnamed Xu, named Zhishi. The Demon King of the Yellow Heaven, surnamed Tianmen, named Bokuang. All preside over greed and desire, depleting and agitating the spirit-qi, hence they are called Demon Kings.\n\nThe Five Emperors and Great Demons are the Heavenly Kings, corresponding to the five organs of the human body. They bestow the power of generation and nurturing, presiding over the wondrous Dao of the golden elixir, carrying out the edicts of the Heavenly Worthy to subdue and command. Each manifests in imperial form, thus they are called the Five Emperors. Dwelling in the Desire Realm, they test practitioners with the demons of form, sound, scent, taste, and touch, hence they are called Great Demons, the ancestors of all spirits and the sovereigns of the body.\n\nLong ago, the Heavenly Worthy descended these five demons, and in the *Comprehensive Divine Writ for Subduing Demons*, commanded the talisman-officers of the Five Emperors to guard the five directions. The talisman-officer of the Green Emperor is named Qihua; of the Red Emperor, Mingzhen; of the White Emperor, Maocheng; of the Black Emperor, Shouyuan; of the Yellow Emperor, Shengming. Each secures their direction, safeguarding the divine writ to repel demonic trials.\n\nWhen the Dao is in practice, the Four Emperors and Great Demons submit to it, containing the primordial Brahman qi. They are also called the Myriad Heavens, the Golden Duke, the Grand Unity, or the White Tiger. Only the Great Demon of the Green Emperor of the East belongs here, wielding the handle of life and death. He is also called the Original Spirit of Destiny, the Positionless True Person, or the Vajra Divine King.\n\nSoaring in flight, drumming in procession, the Four Emperors and Great Demons traverse the Three Realms, rallying their retinues to assemble the ghostly troops of the Desire Realm, demonstrating the path of lustful folly. When demons test the practitioner, they brandish banners and beat drums. This Great Demon of the Green Emperor, waving his pennants and striking his standards, though dwelling in the Form Realm, is not swayed by desire. Endowed with the true mandate of primordial Brahman qi, he inspects evil and exhorts goodness, thus he is said to roam and observe the great void. He styles himself the sole sovereign of awe-inspiring majesty, sharing in the generative power of the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens.\n\nWhen the heavens deliver humanity, among the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens, the most virtuous is said to be the one who, in delivering humanity, ensures that wondrous transformation begins with strict conduct. He summons the Northern Capital of Fengdu, inspects and severs the root of attachment, to refine and return the elixir. Thus, the Divine Duke receives his mandate.\n\nThe Divine Duke is our original spirit, styled Malongshi, named Kuoyi. Endowed with the true mandate of primordial Brahman qi, he sweeps away all inauspicious ghosts of greed and lust. The Eight Mighties spew forth poison—the Eight Mighties being the six senses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, combined with the storehouse and transmission consciousnesses to form the eight consciousnesses, called the Eight Mighties. They expel the poisonous harm of form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas, preventing disturbance and disorder.\n\nThen the Vajra Divine King mounts a fierce steed with four steeds abreast, dispatching Heavenly Ding as vanguard, advancing with valor and discipline. The great marshal wields his banner, marching with steadfast resolve. Casting fire for ten thousand leagues, its light blazes brilliantly; the flowing bells of the Eight Directions resound with perfect roundness. Should the Four Emperors and the Myriad Heavens dare to interfere, obstructing the heavens’ deliverance of humanity and hindering the true qi of the primordial Origin from returning to the origin, the Vajra Divine King advances with his golden axe, while the mighty Heavenly Warriors wield their massive halberds in punishment. They slaughter the lustful demons of the Five Turbidities with the swiftness of wind and fire, without pause for even half an hour, emphasizing urgency and speed.\n\nA thousand thousand heads are severed, a thousand demons retreat in disarray; ten thousand ten thousand forms are cut down, ten thousand specters flee in terror. Those who do not interfere or transgress remain unharmed.",

The primordial Origin’s Brahman qi is the Golden Horse and the Yellow Path. The post route is swift transmission. This qi races along the Yellow Path to return to the divine chamber, universally proclaiming without end. Wherever this qi arrives, the myriad spirits heed its command. The Three Realms are the Three Fields and the Five Emperors, which are the Five Officials, all arrayed in speech to report their merits to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nBy worldly standards, as the scripture states, it is clear even without explanation.\n\nThe ode says:\nResplendent and majestic, the true command prevails,\nDemons dare not transgress, ghosts lose their might.\nOnce the ancestral qi returns and the elixir is complete,\nThe Three Realms report in ranks to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Primal Cavern Jade Chronicle* spans the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras.

Crimson writings on jade, the eight mighty dragon scripts, preserved and regulated the kalpic cycles, ensuring the heavens endured forever. The Brahman qi suffused the cosmos, myriad patterns unfolded, the primordial net flowed and evolved, forming the thirty-two heavens. Revolving without form, they circled the ten directions. The Dipper rotated past the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants. Thirty-five divisions gathered the qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Sceneries merged in darkness, qi entered the profound mystery.\n\nMaster Shangyangzi said: This second chapter is the pulse of the scripture, the marrow of the elixir. Why? This chapter concerns the refinement of the golden liquid and the return of the elixir, thus revealing the crimson script as the tool for gathering the medicine. From the ten directions, they float through the void to arrive together before the Emperor, where they gather essence and unite spirit. Only today, rejoicing in deliverance, do they finally compose the elixir. Once the primordial qi returns to the origin, the Five Dipper Emperors within the body perform their duties, driving away evil and expelling the yin demons and ghostly qi, thus demonstrating the merit of \"ten thousand ten thousand forms cut down.\"\n\n*Laozi* says: \"Inferior virtue acts with deliberate purpose.\" This describes the present chapter. This chapter concerns the refinement of the jade liquid great elixir, thus revealing the *Jade Chronicle* as the beginning of the kalpic record. The absence of darkness and obscurity, form and shadow, arises because the qi, having just returned, has not yet settled. Once the Primordial Origin’s Brahman qi stabilizes, myriad patterns unfold, leading to the ascension of the myriad qi as immortals.\n\nThe *Nine Grades Scripture* says: In ancient times, during the primordial chaos before the division of the heavens, the Primordial Origin first took shape. In the fifth kalpa, the initial transformation began, and the Brahman Origin Ancestral Dawn Dao Lord was commanded to record the celestial origin, governing the five kalpas. Thus, the *Primal Cavern* signifies the completion of the ancestral qi, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origin.\n\nFrom the division of the primordial qi, the three causes formed the nine. Like dragons or stalks, they coiled through the nine paths, boundless and infinite, encompassing the origin of the nine yang ancestral qi. The Most High then harmonized the Brahman qi, initiating the ancestral qi of the Azure Heaven. Thus, the East received nine qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Dragon Han. The South received three qi to divide its realm, the kalpa named Crimson Clarity. The Center received twelve qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Supreme August. The West received seven qi to divide its realm, the kalpa named Yan Kang. The North received five qi to divide its celestial realm, the kalpa named Kai Huang. Once the five kalpas had run their course, the vast heavens took form. The primordial qi merged with the Dao, the Eight Sceneries radiated light. The Eight Emperors manifested, the Nine Empyreans differentiated, coalescing the five yang qi of the Primal Cavern into the *Jade Chronicle*. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign was then commanded to record the initial kalpic cycles of the Primal Cavern, the origin of the revolving kalpas, and the merits of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People in cultivating immortality, along with the path of ascent and retreat.\n\nThe Azure Origin Perfected said: The formation of heaven and earth began in the Dragon Han and ended in the Yan Kang. How many times have they nearly formed, nearly collapsed? Beyond reckoning. Hence, it is called \"countless.\" With each kalpic destruction, heaven and earth dissolve, mountains and seas melt away, all phenomena vanish, leaving no trace of form or substance. Only the qi of the Primal Cavern remains undivided, indistinctly beginning its construction—this is called the primordial chaos. At this time, the true unity of water was enveloped in darkness, the five phases yet unformed. Above, there was no color; below, no abyss. Above, wind; below, marsh. The void was pervaded by emptiness, the Vajra qi bearing the root of heaven. \"Obscurity\" refers to what is hidden and manifest; \"form and shadow\" refer to phenomena. \"Limit\" refers to boundaries. \"Vast expanse\" describes boundless space.\n\nWithin the primordial chaos, between heaven above and heaven below, hidden and manifest, boundless and vast, phenomena were indistinguishable. Boundaries were undefined, only the vast Brahman qi stretched endlessly, without light or shadow. Later, when the golden wind qi rubbed to generate fire, the four images combined to produce earth, which bore heaven and earth and nurtured the myriad beings. This is called the Three Realms’ lofty perfected ones transcending calamitous kalpas. Compared to sentient beings, mired in birth and death, endlessly revolving, the return of the golden elixir to the origin is like enduring the trials of kalpic cycles. Now, fortunately, the Brahman qi has returned to the origin, yet remains without form or image.\n\nWhen the Crimson Clarity unfolded the chart, in the first year of Crimson Clarity, the *Jade Chronicle* established the record. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, phenomena and forms divided and grew—just as the elixir finds its place. The four seasons progressed, each in its proper order, thus it is called \"the kalpas turn naturally,\" akin to the primordial work of the elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Origin settled and stabilized, unfolding the Five Scriptures. The Primordial Origin observed the Brahman qi coalescing into form, carving jade into cloud-seal celestial scripts, bearing the five wondrous elements of the primordial spirit and true Dao. Thus, it is called the Five Scriptures. Those who awaken to its wonders enter its wonders; those who awaken to its origin enter its origin; those who awaken to its spirit enter its spirit; those who awaken to its truth enter its truth; those who awaken to its Dao enter its Dao.",

Established before heaven and earth, it is the root of the Great Dao. The Primordial Origin relies upon it to govern the cosmos; heaven and earth depend on it for generation and completion. It blankets the Three Realms and envelops the myriad heavens. Once the Two Modes unfolded, all phenomena and forms spread forth—thus it is said, \"the ten thousand patterns open and expand.\" The Brahman qi is the guiding principle of primordial transformation, flowing through the Thirty-Two Heavens like a turning wheel. From the Formless Realm, it circulates through the ten directions, from the Dipper to the Winnowing Basket, revolving through the Five Constants. With the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations, it forms the Thirty-Five Divisions.

flies and ascends to the Great Void.\n\nThis is called the completion of the Way.\nWithout cultivating the Way,\nMerely reciting it ten thousand times in hope of ascension\nWould be difficult

slighting\"?\nTo act carelessly and recklessly,\nHearing but not practicing,\nOr practicing without secrecy—\nAll incur the calamity of leaking and slighting,\nFearing a fall into hell.\nAs for bringing calamity upon ancestors,\nThis is to exhaust one’s primordial qi,\nThen blame the alchemical scriptures as false,\nOr call the Most High’s words empty—\nWould they not reflect upon their own fault in leaking and slighting?\n\nA hymn says:\nWhy do hymns interweave with cavernous chapters?\nOnly because of hell and heaven.\nKnowing that hell is created by the mind alone,\nOne should strive

the world.\nTheir language lacks ornate beauty,\nTheir melodies lack florid embellishment—\nThus they are called profound and obscure,\nDifficult to fathom in detail.\n\nTreasured by heaven,\nThey are secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Dark Capital,\nTransmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Statutes.\nIf a perfected person pledges gold and treasures with sincerity,\nFollowing the old protocols to swear oaths before the Ten Heavens,\nOnly then are they entrusted.\n\nMaster Shangyang said:\nThis scripture crowns all others,\nFor its beginning and

Calendar* are the main scriptures.\nThe demon kings’ songs of the Three Realms,\nAppended after these two chapters,\nDo not belong to the main scriptures.\nYet because their texts test the practitioner’s merit extensively,\nThey are interwoven at the end of the *Primal Cavern*—\nThus called \"sounds interweaving with cavernous chapters.\"\nWhat follows are the Heavenly Perfected One’s further transmissions of the Dao Lord’s words.\n\nThese two chapters are the *Crimson Text of the Chaotic Cavern* and the *Jade Calendar of the Primal Cavern*.\nThe *Crimson Text of the Chaotic Cavern* clarifies the returning elixir of the primordial, original, and mysterious One;\nThe *Jade Calendar of the Primal Cavern* clarifies the wondrous Way of the posterior, effortless, and perfectly true.\nThese two chapters,\nUnique and unparalleled,\nAre the hidden sounds of all Celestial Thearchs—\nNothing but the interplay of yin and yang.\nThe most numinous demon kings\nFully rely on spiritual efficacy,\nTheir hidden sounds the mysterious pass of the One Aperture.\nThe words of the Great Brahma—\nLead, silver, cinnabar, mercury—\nIn scripture, they are the hidden secrets of the Celestial Thearchs and demon kings;\nIn the elixir, they are the Brahma-words of the Mysterious Female’s knife and measure,\nNot common speech of the world.\n\nFoolish people of the world open their mouths to discuss the Way,\nYet do not know what the Way is,\nNor what its substances are for—\nThis is called \"not common speech of the world.\"\nTheir language lacks ornate beauty—\nTrue words are not embellished;\nTheir melodies lack florid embellishment—\nFlourish is not substance.\nThus they are called profound and obscure.\nThough Yan and Min were wise, they could not guess;\nThough Huang

thousand kalpas,\nIt is not to be given to just anyone.\nThe \"perfected person\" is one of utmost sageliness.\nPledging gold and treasures is exchanging wealth for the Dharma.\n\nGold and treasures are what the world values.\nFoolish people take gold and treasures as their lives;\nPetty men take fame and rank as their lives;\nRighteous scholars take reputation and integrity as their lives;\nPerfected persons take virtue and the Way as their lives.\nThus perfected persons refine the nine-return divine elixir of golden liquid,\nUsing gold and treasures as Dharma-wealth.\nWith Dharma but no wealth, matters seldom succeed;\nWith wealth but no Dharma, one is no different from a fool.\nWhen scriptures circulate,\nDharma and wealth are both employed.\nFollowing the protocols to swear oaths,\nOnly then may they be entrusted.\nTo act presumptuously and recklessly is difficult to complete.\nThis is the explanation of its use in the Way.\n\nAs for worldly matters,\nOne has never seen someone pledge gold and treasures as earnest money to request a scroll of scripture—\nEven in forty thousand kalpas, none would exist.\nWhy?\nHow would they know this scripture contains the Way of long life and enduring vision?",

      "translated_text": "If one speaks of the application of the Dao, such cases may yet exist. Why? Those of superior roots and proper Dharma-vessels, by virtue of karmic affinities from past lives, have already gained some understanding within the alchemical scriptures. Though they may not yet fully grasp the profound essence, upon suddenly hearing the sublime truths of this sutra, they offer gold and treasures in unwavering faith.\n\nThe methods of nine-return and seven-reversion require the external medicine to merge with the internal medicine. Without gold and treasures as earnest, how could one obtain the wonders of this sutra? How could one subdue the tiger to descend the dragon? How could one draw the primordial qi from the midst of emptiness?\n\nIn this present age, when foolish and impure men hear of Dharma-wealth, they invariably burst into laughter, claiming that cultivators must be utterly destitute, stripped bare, and devoted solely to rigid sitting, drifting into hollow stillness. Such people toil in vain until old age, never understanding the use of gold and treasures to seek the wondrous sutra. This is the principle of employing both Dharma and wealth.\n\nThe Perfected of Mystery and Silence’s *Entering the Chamber Poem* says:\n*Entering the chamber, what makes it unique?*\n*Golden flowers bloom day after day.*\n*The numinous sprout rises from the earth,*\n*Fragrant medicine descends from the heavens.*\n\nIt also states:\n*To yearn for the treasure of heaven,*\n*One must first move worldly wealth.*\n*Within the jade caves of Penglai,*\n*The nine-returned cup is brewed.*\n\nThe Perfected Wang Ding says:\n*If mortals seek the affairs of heaven,*\n*They must first use the wealth of the world.*\nFor the treasure of heaven and the affairs of heaven are the subtle mechanisms of immortals’ practice—far removed from the deluded grasping of heterodox paths.\n\nWhen Faduo Migajia received the master’s teaching, he asked, “How should one repay?”\nThe master replied, “If you prepare five hundred *kārṣāpaṇa*, it will fully express your profound sincerity.”\nThereupon, Migajia searched the earth, and having gathered them, presented this verse:\n*Abundant wealth, many treasures,*\n*Spring’s attributes all fulfilled.*\n*Certain of bodhi,*\n*Ever abiding in the Dharma.*\n\nThis verse left by Faduo Migajia, the teacher of gods and men, serves as the eye and guide for later generations to realize the Dao and attain Buddhahood—unlike the practices of heretical demons. Carefully observing these words, one sees that this sutra must be entrusted only after pledging gold and treasures with sincerity, thereby attaining its wonders.\n\nThe ode says:\n*Unmoved by even a speck of wealth,*\n*How can gold and treasures ferry others?*\n*I, of Qingcheng, was personally entrusted,*\n*For the elixir of return, only the tiger and dragon suffice.*\n\n**End of the Middle Scroll of the *Commentary on the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings*, Upper Chapter**\n\n**The Lower Scroll of the *Explanatory Commentary on the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Beings from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery***\n*Commentary by Chen Guanzhen of Shangyang*\n\nThe Dao says:\nThe revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends;\nThe sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane;\nEven the most sagely and divine persons also have their limits;\nAnd the ignorant and unlearned also suffer illness and harm.",

      "translated_text": "For all such calamities, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times—whereupon virtue and power will descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens. The boundless text universally delivers the limitless.\n\nMaster Shangyang says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth are spoken of in terms of the Dao, then the human body receives the central qi of heaven and earth. The head resembles heaven, the feet resemble earth—thus the human body is called a small heaven and earth. The transformations of heaven and earth give birth to humans and all beings; the transformations of the human body give birth to buddhas and immortals.\n\nThe *Lingbao Complete Methods* states: The Dao gives birth to the myriad things. Among them, heaven and earth are the greatest, and humans are the most numinous. If one seeks the Dao separately, humans are equal to heaven and earth. The heart corresponds to heaven, the kidneys to earth; the liver is yang, the lungs are yin. Rising and falling, gazing upward and downward, one may fathom their mechanism. Beginning and ending, measuring and calculating, one may grasp their principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: Heaven is noble, earth is lowly—thus Qian and Kun are established.\nThe *Laozi* says: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name, so I style it the Dao.\n\nMaster Zhang the Perfected says:\nWhen sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite;\nWhere the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li merge.\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nThen gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.\n\nThus, the golden elixir uses heaven and earth as its crucible and vessel.\n\nIn worldly reckoning, the revolutions of heaven and earth are vast—ancients took the great unity as heaven. The scripture says: Within the realm are four great things: the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.\n\nThe *Huntian Theory* likens heaven to an egg, with earth like the yolk within. The great earth lies within the body of heaven. The north and south poles of heaven are like the pivot and axle of a wheel. Heaven rotates once in a day and night, circling the two poles without leaving its original place. The comparison of heaven to an egg refers to its imperfectly round shape—ancients knew the resemblance of its form and thus used it as an analogy. It merely illustrates that earth lies within heaven, and heaven envelops earth.\n\nMaster Yuanduzi says: Heaven is like a brocade ball, containing a half-sphere of water. Upon the water floats a board, which represents the great earth. The objects placed on the board represent the myriad kinds of humans. The ball constantly rotates, yet the objects on the board remain unaware. Heaven rotates day and night, while earth abides within it. Humans and beings upon the earth remain unmoving—this analogy of the floating board is most apt.\n\nThe *Huntian Theory*’s claim that earth lies within the body of heaven does not mean heaven’s body is visible. Rather, observing the rising and setting of the stars in the east and west, governed by the two poles with fixed degrees and no cessation, one infers the stars’ attachment and posits it as the body of heaven.\n\nThe *Gexiang* states: The body of heaven is round like a pellet, and the center of this round body is the target of the six directions. All around, above and below, it is square and equal—this is called the center of heaven. The center of heaven extends straight upward to the zenith. In ancient times, measuring shadows at Yangcheng yielded the shadow of the zenith’s exact center. Gazing upward at the North Pole, its emergence and submergence above and below the earth total thirty-six degrees—this is the center of heaven, not the center of earth. As for the earth’s axis, the center of the four directions should be sought at the farthest reaches of the four seas. The source of the Yellow River is Kunlun, the highest place on earth. The Western Barbarians call it Mount Memuli, from which waters flow in four directions. The mountain lies less than twenty thousand *li* from the Eastern Sea and over thirty thousand *li* from the Western Sea. Yangcheng is closer to the Eastern Sea but farther from Kunlun. Most of the world’s land lies to the west, yet Kunlun still stands in the eastern lands. One must know that the true center of the great earth lies west of Kunlun.\n\nThe *Huntian*’s comparison of heaven to an egg, with the yolk as earth, implies less heaven above earth and more below. The *Gexiang* claims the opposite—more heaven above earth and less below—which also has its logic.\n\nRegarding the height of heaven, the *Jade Book* says: Between heaven and earth, the distance above and below is eighty-four thousand *li*, and their qi and substance cannot interact. Heaven seeks Qian from Kun and returns to the center of earth, its yang bearing yin upward. Earth seeks Kun from Qian and returns to the center of heaven, its yin embracing yang downward. Rising and falling, they revolve within the Dao.\n\nThe *Sanwu Liji* states: When heaven and earth opened, the clear yang became heaven, and the turbid yin became earth. Pangu was born between them, divine in heaven and sagely on earth. Heaven is extremely high, earth extremely deep, and Pangu extremely tall. Later came the Three Sovereigns, whose numbers began with one, stood upon three, were completed by five, flourished in seven, and resided in nine—thus heaven is ninety thousand *li* from earth.\n\nBoth accounts agree: from earth to heaven is ninety thousand *li*, and from earth below to heaven is also ninety thousand *li*—thus the body of heaven is one hundred eighty thousand *li* in height. Anciently, three hundred sixty paces made one *li*. As in previous chapters’ notes on the generation of the various heavens, the hundreds of thousands of *li* mentioned are not literal. They signify that those of superior roots who cut off desire and joy become equal to sages and worthies, far removed from the people of the lower realms.\n\nSimilarly, the breadth of the earth: from the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea to the western shore of the Western Sea is over fifty thousand *li*. The width of the seas is another thirty thousand *li*, and beyond the seas, twenty thousand *li*—thus from the farthest east to the farthest west spans one hundred fifty thousand *li*. Compared to the height of one hundred eighty thousand *li*, the *Huntian*’s likening of its shape to an egg is apt.\n\nThe Dao of heaven rotates left, circling the three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees of the celestial sphere once each day and night, without end. During the Liu Song dynasty, Zu Chongzhi, skilled in observing the heavens, saw that the Pole Star remained nearly motionless, deviating by just over one degree. Thus, astronomers measuring the North Pole determined the length of degrees.",

      "translated_text": "**The Record of Guo Shoujing’s Conduct:**\n\nIn the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan era (1279), Guo Shoujing memorialized: During the Kaiyuan reign of the Tang, Yi Xing ordered Nan Gongshuo to conduct nationwide solar shadow measurements. Today, our empire surpasses the Tang in vastness. Without distant observations to verify solar and lunar eclipses, discrepancies arise in their magnitudes and timings, as well as in the varying lengths of day and night, and the differing altitudes of the sun, moon, and stars. Given the scarcity of observers, we may first erect gnomons north and south, aligning them over great distances. Thus, each celestial degree spans 1,390 *li*, while the moon’s path is narrower than the sun’s diameter—each lunar degree measures only 670 *li*. A full circuit of 365 degrees totals no more than 240,000 *li*, proving the moon is nearer to man, and heaven most distant. Only the sun traverses the middle Way, so all calendrical calculations take it as their standard.\n\nThe sun’s path defines the names of the twenty-eight lodges. During the reigns of Yao and Shun, the winter solstice sun lodged in *Xu*. How do we know? The *Canon of Yao* states: “The shortest day, the star *Mao* [Pleiades], marks mid-winter.” At winter solstice, the day is shortest; the sun sets at the end of *Shen*, and *Mao* appears in *You*. Initially, *Mao* stands due south at *Wu*, while the sun lies in *You*. *Xu* belongs to the celestial *Zi* (north). When the celestial *Zi* aligns with the earthly *You*, *Zi* overlays *You*, and *You* in turn overlays *Wu*. *Mao* belongs to the celestial *You*, yet at winter solstice, it appears in the earthly *Wu*. Thus, the winter solstice sun lodges in *Xu*, the summer solstice in *Xing*, the spring equinox in *Mao*, and the autumn equinox in *Fang*. Ancient astronomers determined the sun’s degrees solely by the midnight culmination of stars—hence the calendars devised by Rong Cheng and the stellar divinations of Che Qu.\n\nThe *Taichu* calendar of the Han placed the mid-winter sun in *Chou*, lodging in *Qianniu*. From Yao to the Han, the lodging shifted by one mansion. Yu Xi of the Jin estimated a shift of one degree every fifty years; He Chengtian, one degree per century; Liu Zhuo, one degree every seventy-five years; and Yi Xing of the Tang, one degree every eighty-three years. The *Dayan* calendar placed the sun at thirteen degrees in *Dou*. The Song adopted Liu Zhuo’s seventy-five-year standard. In the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era (1277), on the *dingchou* day of the winter solstice, the sun lodged at ten degrees in *Ji*. In the third year of the Zhiyuan era (1266), on the *dingchou* day, it lodged at eight degrees in *Ji*. Thus, in Yao’s time, the sun was in *Zi*; in the Han, in *Chou*; and between the Jin and Song, in *Yin*. From Yao to the present—3,700 years—the sun has shifted three mansions. Extrapolating, nine thousand years hence, the sun will lodge in *Wu*; eighteen thousand years hence, it will return to *Zi*. Before Yao’s time, the pattern must have been the same. Hence, Li Chunfeng, finding ancient calendars’ cycles and epochs inconsistent in their divisions, established a unified method. Yi Xing, noting four long and three short months in the lunar cycle, determined regional variations in eclipses. Xu Mao accounted for solar eclipses’ qi, refining the three temporal discrepancies. Yao Shunfu recognized the approximate nature of eclipse maxima, attributing the changing residual discrepancies to celestial images, and noted that precession was slower in high antiquity and faster in later ages. Observations from the Tang and Song to the present confirm his theory.\n\nAncients divided the 360-odd hours of a year into twelve qi and seventy-two hou, forming a month. Yet each month’s new moon spans only 356 hours and a fraction. A single qi exceeds fifteen days. Thus, long months are called “qi surplus,” short months “deficient,” and the new moon “void.” This refers not only to the waxing and waning of the sun and moon at conjunction and eclipse but also to the five planets’ cyclical fluctuations. The five planets, too, vary in speed relative to the sun: near the sun, they move swiftly; far, slowly. When slowest, they pause; after lingering, they retreat. Initially retreating slowly, they gradually accelerate, then slow again. When retreat halts, they pause, then resume direct motion at their swiftest, aligning with the sun’s path.\n\nJupiter moves fastest at one degree every four days; Mars, five degrees in seven days; Saturn, one degree in seven days. These three planets’ speeds are slower than the sun’s, so after conjunction, the sun leads them: Jupiter appears at dawn when thirteen degrees from the sun, Mars at nineteen degrees, and Saturn at eighteen and a half degrees. Generally, they pause once near and twice far, then retreat halfway through their celestial circuit. Jupiter first pauses at 109 degrees from the sun; first retreats at 131 degrees. Mars first pauses at 134 degrees; first retreats likewise. Saturn first pauses at 94 degrees; first retreats at 128 degrees. During their fastest retrograde motion, they oppose the sun. Retrogression ceases, they pause, then resume direct motion.\n\nVenus moves fastest at five degrees in four days; Mercury, two degrees in one day. Venus does not exceed forty degrees from the sun; Mercury, twenty-four degrees. Far from the sun, they move slowly; near, swiftly. Jupiter and Mars, being large, appear near the sun; Saturn, Venus, and Mercury, being small, appear farther. These are the five planets’ constant measures.\n\nEven the most sagely and divine may know adversity. Shun faced peril at the well and granary; King Wen was imprisoned at Youli; the Duke of Zhou resided in the east for two years; Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai; Laozi was challenged while transforming the Hu; the Tathāgata carved his flesh for bandits. Are not even the sagest and most divine subject to fortune’s vicissitudes? Likewise, lesser scholars may suffer affliction. Those who study the Dao yet fail to act are but shallow learners.",

      "translated_text": "Without diligence, the Dao cannot be accomplished; if the Dao is not accomplished, afflictions and misfortunes will arrive. Whenever such calamities occur, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scriptures ten times—those of shared qi are of the same kind. Being of the same kind, they must unite in heart; only when their hearts are aligned can matters be resolved.\n\nThe worldly know how to read scriptures but not how to recite them in cycles. Reading scriptures seeks blessings; reciting them in cycles seeks the elixir. When the scriptures are fully recited, blessings arrive; when the elixir is achieved, virtue is profound. Thus it is said: \"Blessings and virtue descend at once.\" These scriptures speak of boundless words to universally deliver the limitless, yet their intent lies in the scriptures and centers on the elixir.\n\nThe primordial Brahma qi is the Way of the Returned Elixir. From the highest-rooted sagely scholars to the lowest and most foolish, if even petty men can believe, accept, and practice it, all may ascend to the sacred rank. Thus it is said: \"Universally deliver the limitless.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nForm has number and ends in exhaustion,\nUntil it reaches formlessness and the great void.\nIf one asks what formlessness resembles,\nThe whole body rests within a millet-like pearl.\n\nThe Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet fulfilled, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected beings should burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf to deliver the corpse according to the method. Then the hun-soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to the merit of their studies, they will be reborn after a calculated number of days, escaping the turning wheel of rebirth and attaining immortality.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This speaks of those of lesser attainment who hear the Dao late in life. Those of shallow learning in the Dao, whose immortal rank is not yet fulfilled, who fail to practice with courage and diligence, and whose years are already advanced with waning essence and qi—unaware that the thirtieth night of the twelfth month has arrived—have no recourse but to employ the methods of seizing a vessel or entering a womb. Seizing a vessel and entering a womb are two distinct matters. Though this method belongs to the side gates, those who attain it may still deliver their corpse, ensuring their true nature does not fall into the cycle of rebirth. Such as the Fifth Patriarch entering the womb of the Zhou family, or Song Jing entering the Golden Lord’s household. Thus it is said: \"To deliver the corpse according to the method.\" Yet this requires fellow students and perfected beings to protect and guide them, so the hun-soul may ascend directly to the Southern Palace. Like the Fourth Patriarch inscribing for the Fifth, or Lü Dongbin delivering Song Jing—these are fellow students and perfected beings.\n\n\"According to the merit of their studies\" means that among those who cultivate and study, merit varies in depth. Thus, according to the depth of their merit, the number of days until rebirth is calculated. Though they pass through the turning wheel, their true nature remains undestroyed. When the Great Elixir of Golden Liquor is achieved, they attain immortality.\n\n**Verse:**\nRebirth is calculated by days according to merit,\nWhen merit is complete at eight hundred, the golden countenance appears.\nIn the wondrous realm of the Great Luo,\nThose who believe in the Dao know form is but emptiness.\n\nThe Dao states: When the heavens and earth reach their destined end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the ruler of the state faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When masters and friends pass away, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. Above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the people. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus it is said: \"Boundless, universally delivering gods and humans.\"\n\nMaster Shangyang said: \"The heavens and earth reach their destined end.\" Interpreted through the Dao’s application, great cultivators compare the heavens and earth to the body. If the Returned Elixir is achieved but merit is not accumulated, one cannot ascend bodily in broad daylight. Thus, they may grow weary of the mundane world, choosing to feign illness and depart, shed their form and leave, or merely attain the method of corpse liberation—all are called \"reaching their destined end.\" If taken literally as the heavens and earth truly reaching their end, how many people would remain? Who would perform purification rites, burn incense, or recite scriptures?\n\n\"When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times\"—this refers to the dissipation of the body’s spirit and qi, causing the ears and eyes to grow dim. The sun, moon, and five planets correspond to the seven orifices of the body. The *Scripture of the Three Luminaries* states: \"If the ears listen recklessly, sounds and colors corrupt the person; if the eyes gaze upon evil, the true light dims; if the nose smells foulness, the Jade Perfection is not pure; if the mouth consumes杂味, the body suffers many illnesses. Thus, illness enters through the mouth, and fortune is lost through the senses. If you guard against these, your life will endure like heaven.\"\n\n\"When the four seasons lose their proper order\"—if the true qi deviates from principle, yin and yang fall out of harmony. Master Peng said: \"If the yang fire exceeds its measure, drought and flood disrupt the seasons, and midwinter turns to scorching heat. If the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other, and midsummer brings thick frost. When the Golden Palace fails to sprout cinnabar and mercury, the cauldron breeds insects and pests. In great cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon boil over; in minor cases, violent rain and whirlwinds arise, the Kan man and Li woman flee in chaos.\"\n\nThe *Inner Meaning* states: What the Most High calls \"performing purification rites, burning incense, and reciting scriptures\" refers to refining qi with an empty mind, nurturing the spirit by following its nature, and cultivating the true. All the above are applications of the Dao. In worldly terms, when the heavens and earth reach their destined end, the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm undergo a great kalpa and are consumed by fire. The Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm undergo a great kalpa and are swept away by water. The Four Heavens of the Formless Realm undergo a great kalpa and are destroyed by wind. When these Three Realms are utterly destroyed, the Lord of Heaven selects one person from the Heaven of Seeded People to descend and repopulate the world—hence it is called the Heaven of Seeded People. From this perspective, the heavens and earth indeed have a time of destined end.",

Are not even the sagest and most divine subject to fortune’s vicissitudes? Likewise, lesser scholars may suffer affliction. Those who study the Dao yet fail to act are but shallow learners.",

      "translated_text": "When the stellar lodges fall into disarray and the sun and moon lose their proper times of dusk and dawn, the ancients, gazing up at the celestial patterns, observed that the rising and setting of the stars at dawn and dusk gradually diverged from their usual courses. They likened the celestial sphere to a round melon, which, having twelve segments, divides the circumference of the heavens—365¼ degrees—into twelve equal parts. Each segment thus spans thirty degrees, forty-three minutes, and seventy-five seconds. Every degree converges like spokes toward the north and south celestial poles, narrowing as it approaches the two ends, with the broadest span at the melon’s equatorial belt. This equatorial belt is called the Celestial Equator. Degrees along the Celestial Equator measure a full degree in width, but as one moves farther from the equator, the degrees grow progressively narrower, though they retain the name of a degree, they no longer span the full width of the equatorial belt. Each degree is reckoned by the distance stars of the twenty-eight lodges, forming what is called celestial longitude. Longitude divides east and west, while latitude divides north and south, both measured by their proximity to the two poles. The distance between the two poles is 182 degrees, 62 minutes, and 50 seconds. The Celestial Equator, running horizontally, lies equidistant from both poles at 91 degrees, 31 minutes, and 25 seconds. The zenith is called Songgao. The north celestial pole deviates 55 degrees and some minutes north of Songgao, while the south celestial pole, though hidden beneath the earth’s center, also deviates 55 degrees and some minutes to the south. The Celestial Equator tilts 36 degrees south of Songgao, with its sides aligning with the due east and west positions.\n\nThe sun, moon, and stellar lodges are not fixed to the heavens but instead traverse the void by virtue of the transformative qi of the great Dao, much as fish do not cling to the earth but swim through rivers by virtue of water. During the Northern Qi dynasty, Zhang Zixin observed the heavens for many years and discerned that the Five Planets exhibit cycles of advance and retreat. He thus adjusted the standard calculations to determine their daily positions. The Five Planets do not follow the Yellow Road nor the moon’s Nine Paths but instead move within and beyond the Yellow Road. Each of the Five Planets has its own course, and their speed varies with their distance from the sun, much as a traveler’s pace fluctuates with fatigue. They are also subject to additional variations, like the twists and turns of a road. The greatest deviation for Jupiter is over seven degrees; for Mars, over twenty-five degrees; for Saturn, over eight degrees; for Venus, over four degrees; and for Mercury, over six degrees. The paths of Luo, Ji, and the comet-like Bo do not vary in speed. Luo and Ji follow the moon, intersecting the Yellow Road to determine the beginnings and endings of lunar nodes. Between these intersections, Luo and Ji each move retrograde by one degree, forty-six minutes, and thirty seconds. The comet-like Bo follows the moon’s cycles of waxing and waning. The Purple Qi arises from the intercalary method: over twenty-eight years with ten intercalary months, the Purple Qi completes a circuit of the twelve celestial palaces. The Purple Qi is the Auspicious Star. Historical annotations describe it as resembling a half-moon, appearing only when a ruler possesses virtue and sagely wisdom.\n\nThe stationary segments of the stars complete one revolution around the earth each day, moving in tandem with the heavens by one degree. Those that move swiftly appear slow in comparison, while those that move slowly appear swift; those that retreat appear exceedingly swift. When their motion falls short of the heavens’ pace, the degrees they traverse mark the conjunction of the sun and moon at the same celestial longitude. A solar eclipse occurs at the new moon when the sun and moon share the same longitude but not the same latitude, resulting in conjunction without eclipse. If, however, the moon crosses the sun’s Yellow Road at the same longitude, and both share latitude, then conjunction brings an eclipse. Some claim that all ten luminaries can eclipse the sun, but this is incorrect. The sun itself is never consumed; it is merely obscured for a time by the moon’s dark body, leading the world to call it an eclipse, though the sun suffers no harm. The extent of the obscuration depends on the two points where the sun’s and moon’s paths intersect. If they meet precisely at an intersection, the moon’s body fully covers the sun’s, plunging the world into deep darkness—this is called a total eclipse. If they share longitude but are before or after the intersection, an eclipse is still visible, though the closer to the intersection, the greater the eclipse, and the farther, the lesser.\n\nThe sun and moon move at different speeds, sometimes converging, sometimes diverging; as they depart from the intersection, light is restored. A lunar eclipse occurs at the full moon when the sun and moon are in opposition, dividing the Yellow Road in half. The Yellow Road has two intersections; if the full moon does not occur at either, no eclipse takes place. If the full moon is near the intersections, the moon will eclipse. The extent of the eclipse is determined by its proximity to the intersection. At this time, the moon is in the sky while the sun is beneath the earth, and no other luminary can eclipse it. Yet why does the moon lose its light? Though the moon reflects the sun’s brilliance, when it lies within the bounds of the two intersections, directly opposite the sun in both longitude and latitude, the intensity of the sunlight overwhelms it, causing the moon to darken—an excess of yang leading to its own reversal. This is a lunar eclipse. According to the *Shoushi* calendar, if the full moon occurs within thirteen degrees of an intersection, an eclipse will not occur; beyond this limit, an eclipse takes place.\n\nThus, the ancients named the region opposite the sun’s illumination the \"dark void,\" as if it were the sun’s shadow, causing the moon to lose its light—though no such shadow exists. The term is a forced designation, hence called \"void,\" for it is not truly substantial. If the sun and moon conjoin at night or oppose each other during the day, eclipses may occur, but if they have already set beneath the earth, they remain unseen—this is what is meant by the sun and moon losing their proper times of dusk and dawn. In such cases, one should likewise perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe sun is yang, the moon is yin; yang governs virtue, yin governs punishment. Those who rule states and households fear, when the sun eclipses, that virtue has not been cultivated, and when the moon eclipses, that punishment has been misapplied.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the sun eclipses, cultivate virtue; when the moon eclipses, rectify punishment—yet one should also perform purification rites, recite scriptures, and offer prayers to avert calamity. What is meant by \"averting\" is to observe celestial patterns, discern temporal anomalies, and take precautionary measures in advance. When the four seasons lose their proper measure and yin and yang fall out of harmony—\n\nInterpreting this through worldly principles: since antiquity, the solstices and equinoxes have marked the divisions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, with winter solstice as the head of the four seasons, for it is the Way of yang. Ancient calendars established the *yuan*, *ji*, *bu*, *zhang*, and precise calculations. The *zhang* governs the harmonization of years, months, days, and hours, each with its own function. The *hours* are the twelve earthly positions traversed by the sun; the *day* is one full cycle of the sun’s rising and setting; the *month* is the waxing and waning of the moon from beginning to end; the *year* is one cycle of cold and heat, flourishing and withering; the *zhang* is the conjunction of solstice and new moon in a single hour; the *bu* is their conjunction at the *zi* hour; the *ji* is their conjunction on a *jiazi* day at the *zi* hour; the *yuan* is their conjunction in a *jiazi* year, on a *jiazi* day, at the *jiazi* hour. One hundred *mang* make a *hao*, one hundred *hao* make a *miao*, one hundred *miao* make a *fen* (a *ke*). Twenty-five *ke* make three hours, twelve hours make a day, thirty days make a month, twelve months make a year, nineteen years make one *zhang*, four *zhang* make one *bu*, twenty *bu* make one *ji*, and three *ji* make one *yuan*—thus one *yuan* spans four thousand five hundred and sixty years. At the beginning of a *yuan*, the winter solstice sun resides in *zi*; when the *yuan* is complete, the winter solstice sun moves to *mao*; when two *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun returns to *wu*; when three *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun resides in *you*; and when four *yuan* are complete, the winter solstice sun returns to *zi*—thus four *yuan* comprise eighteen thousand two hundred and forty years. The sun’s return to its origin accumulates six thousand seven hundred and twenty intercalary months, for each *zhang* contains seven intercalary months.\n\nWhen the four seasons lose their proper measure and yin and yang fall out of harmony: in spring, the state is beset by fear and the people suffer epidemics; in summer, crops fail to ripen and women endure misfortune; in autumn, the people grow cruel and suffer from *è* (sneezing) and *tì* (hiccups); in winter, plagues abound and chronic illnesses arise—all these are the result of yin and yang falling out of harmony. One should likewise perform purification rites and recite scriptures to summon the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the ruler of a state faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, if the realm enjoys great peace, the state prospers and the people live in security—this is the blessing of one man, upon which the multitudes depend. But if the state is beset by turmoil and military campaigns arise in succession, ministers and subjects must devote their loyalty and efforts to repay their sovereign.\n\nTeachers and friends—one must never forget their kindness. The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is profound. *Zhai* (purification) is the cleansing of the heart; *jie* (precepts) is the severance from worldly attachments. To have scriptures without precepts is like having fish without a fishing line.\n\nIn ancient times, Lord Lao transmitted the Five Precepts to Master Yin, and the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts to the Perfected One. The Celestial Master’s Seventy-Two Precepts, the Supreme Clarity’s Twenty-Four Precepts, the Ten Precepts for Cultivating the Real, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Nine Perfected, the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure, and the Orthodox One’s Five Precepts—though many are recorded in scriptures and repentance texts, all place the restraint of desire at their head. Thus Lord Lao said: \"If one can fully uphold the precepts within and harmonize one’s light without, one may approach the precipice of spiritual transcendence. Only when desire is utterly purified can success be achieved—then one’s blessings in life and death will be boundless.\"\n\nThe ode says:\nThe merit of delivering beings is vast, its fruits boundless,\nEach phrase distinct, fostering good affinity.\nFrom the kalpas of the Primordial Beginning, teachers and friends,\nNow gather in the Great Canopy Heaven.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for the rulers of Heaven and Earth and the multitudes of people—on days of calamity, if one resolves to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their names, the myriad spirits will attend and protect them, and those of exceptional attainment will become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Sovereign. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people with flawless precision. Even the Demon Kings of Heaven will vouch for such a one, and those who attain the Dao will thoroughly comprehend the ultimate teachings.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: Whoever possesses this scripture—*jing* (scripture) is the Dao. All those who embody the Dao align their virtue with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, and their essence with the workings of creation. Whether for state, household, others, or oneself, performing the meritorious deeds within this scripture will cause all the heavens to record their names, and the myriad spirits to attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment—those who have accumulated merit and diligence—will become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sage Sovereign. Such as the Celestial Master Zhengyang and the Perfected Lord Fuqiu, whose Dao was complete and virtue lofty, both became ministers of the Golden Gates.\n\nStudents of cultivation should act with courage upon encountering goodness, and correct their faults upon recognizing them. Correcting faults ensures the unseen protection of the divine, while accumulating goodness elevates one’s merit and virtue. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without omission. If one’s merit is great and virtue profound, even the Demon Kings of Heaven will vouch for them. Those who attain the Dao are those who have heard the Dao—they must thoroughly comprehend the scripture’s essence to achieve the ultimate teachings of immortality.\n\nThe ode says:\nWhoever possesses this scripture refines the elixir,\nUpon its completion, they ascend the mysterious threshold.\nThree thousand merits and deeds are but secondary,\nIn the Golden Gates’ halls, they bow before the Jade Countenance.\n\nAmong the Great Brahma Hidden Words of the Myriad Sounds in the Heavens, *The Scripture of the Heavenly Duke* states: In the Palace of the Great Canopy Heaven, there is *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter*, known as *Guangsheng Gaoying*. There are also the Dragon Script and Phoenix Seal, known as *Zhengwen Guanjue Yulan*. And there is *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter*, known as *Danlou Acang*. Though the scriptures speak of the many heavens, they are still bound by kalpas. Thus the Jade Clarity Dao Lord composed *The Three Chapters of the Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Writ*, inscribing them in coagulated clouds, each character a *zhang* in width and height, with eight-pointed rays, to stabilize the Thirty-Two Heavens. The three chapters mentioned above were all transmitted by the Dao Lord and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign.",
      "overlap_context": "but if they have already set beneath the earth, they remain unseen—this is what is meant by the sun and moon losing their proper times of dusk and dawn. In such cases, one should likewise perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.\n\nThe sun is yang, the moon is yin; yang governs virtue, yin governs punishment. Those who rule states and households fear, when the sun eclipses, that virtue has not been cultivated, and when the moon eclipses, that punishment has been misapplied.",

      "translated_text": "Later, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, admiring these recondite sounds, further expounded *The Numinous Writ of the Lower Chapter*, known as *Senjiao Chuyun*. Thus there came to be four chapters. Yet today, people speak only of the Middle Chapter and recite neither the Upper nor the Lower—could it be that the heavens guard their secrets jealously, so that the lower world seldom hears of them?\n\n*The Scripture of Inner Sound* states: The Primordial Celestial Honored One preached the Dao in the Red Clarity World at Cypress Mound, with the assembled Perfected in attendance. Clouds and mists surged thickly for three days and nights, and the dark *yin* did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs addressed the Celestial Honored One, saying: \"Never before have we witnessed the Celestial Honored One expound the teachings. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails—what is the reason?\" The Celestial Honored One replied: \"This is the auspicious response of the many heavens, a numinous manifestation of the natural Way. The jade characters blaze with radiance, obscuring the light of heaven.\" He commanded all present to close their eyes and listen reverently. In an instant, the celestial *qi* suddenly parted, and the gloom vanished. Suddenly, a numinous writ appeared in the void above, each character a *zhang* in width and height. The Celestial Honored One proclaimed to the assembly: \"This Numinous Writ of the Eight Convergences—its purport is profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail. I shall command the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to interpret its sounds, so as to instruct those among the many heavens who are destined to attain the Dao, achieve Perfection, and bear the name of immortals.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, obeying the luminous command of the Celestial Honored One, first unsealed *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter*. He beheld only *Guangsheng Gaoying*, its literary splendor dazzling, beyond all scrutiny. Next, he unsealed *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* and saw *Zhengwen Guanjue Yulan*, each character eight-pointed with trailing rays, their luminous essence overwhelming the eye. Then he unsealed *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter* and at last beheld *Danlou Acang*, each character a *zhang* in width, its golden light penetrating and radiant.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign sighed deeply with sorrow and dared not venture questions. After a long while, he said: \"*The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter* and *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* are secrets of the celestial palaces. The kalpas have not yet run their course, and the mysteries of the Great Dao ought not to be heard in the lower world. Yet in *The Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter*, I humbly perceive the great compassion of the Celestial Honored One. The Three and Five have met their destined time, and the True Dao should now be practiced. Thus he revealed the numinous sounds, imparting teachings to those who have not yet heard. Therefore, the Upper Chapter and the Dragon Script must not be lightly disclosed as profound secrets. Only the Middle Chapter, following the interpretations of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and with minor additions and omissions, allows those in later ages to glimpse the hidden mysteries of the scripture.\"\n\nOther versions place *The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter* and *The Dragon Script of the Orthodox Text* after the Lower Chapter—this is incorrect. Here it is corrected:\n\n*The Numinous Writ of the Upper Chapter of the Primordial Beginning* — composed by the Dao Lord.",

      "translated_text": "The Eight Heavens of the East:\nVast and life-generating, their radiance soars high, awakening the primordial through emptiness. Responding to the Nine Perfected of Mystery, their transformative interplay begins the cosmic design. As numinous forces interweave and structures take form, they establish the ancestral model of the Mystic Capital. Embracing all transformations in their totality, their majestic power manifests spontaneously. Traversing peaks and shifting light, the Imperial Dao enfolds luminosity. The celestial jade gleams with authority, its qi crystallizing to nurture souls. Merging and unfolding, the circular essence conceals itself within the heavens. Awaiting the embrace of the colossal spirits, the grand net proclaims tranquility.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the South:\nFlourishing with blazing brilliance, they firmly unfold and clarify their lineage. The empty image of Mystery’s blossom, the Dragon-Yang dances across the vault. Subtle life arises in the dawn’s splendor, while the profound and vast congeal in stillness. The Three Nodes of the Primordial Pass, the Great Brahma soars through space. Hidden awakening brings abundant growth, as celestial kinship celebrates its manifestation. Divine portals entwine in networks, dispersing the essence of True Origin. In purity they grasp the obscure illumination, revolving and ascending in union. Guiding the soaring clouds in festive repose, the numinous response ascends to heaven.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the West:\nFirm and lustrous, subtly restrained, their yin stands solitary in solemnity. Piercing qi illumines purity, as the imperial cavern unfolds its subtlety. Encompassing transformation in hidden response, the Emperor’s Terrace clarifies the void. Extending peace to distant realms, they honor the flourishing Child’s Pool. Binding the whirlwind to nurture, their beauty remains undispersed. Yang connects to the Hundred and Six, as submerged radiance conceals its steps. In the vast and silent obscurity, the true peaks gather the numinous. Firm and majestic, they follow the Dao, proclaiming their mandate to the soaring forests.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\nThe Dragon’s Peace transforms in hidden change, Pure Yang conceals itself in mystery. The square root returns to qi, as images submit to the lofty round. Divine transformations bestow benevolent change, refining the numinous root. The Red Essence embodies the pure Dao, assuming the title of Majestic Honored One. Beneficent clouds accompany the eternal, amidst the Central Mound of kalpas. Towering jade fortresses, their odes resound in joyous flow. Receiving their positions in the Jade Chamber, the Great Statute penetrates the obscure. The Mystic Chapters gleam and scatter, as the net’s wheel completes its cycle.\n\nThe Dragon-Script and Phoenix-Seal Orthodox Text — Composed by the Dao Lord\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East:\nContemplation awakens in lush abundance, the Great Radiance of Purple Numinosity. Nine spirits ferry souls, opening the jade perfection of creation. Ah Yi shines resplendently, as flying heavens stream their sounds. The wheel of light becomes the Emperor’s constancy, as the capital’s numen attains fulfillment. The vast expanse of Great Possession, as auspicious clouds initiate the numinous. The Seven Luminaries illuminate demons, spreading tranquility in flourishing glory. At the summit of emptiness and non-being, heaven’s mandate extends boundlessly. The Four Exhalations round the images, washing and ascending in radiant essence.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the South:\nResplendent and blazing, penetrating Yang, floating light becomes jade’s brilliance. The Seven Numinous Ones chant their odes, as the kalpic origin establishes the Purple Hall. The net’s essence scatters light, illuminating the Jade Chamber. The Eight Sceneries gather their beasts, as the Shao Jade captures essence. The Nine Capitals soar in lush abundance, giving flight to the upper numina. The dense net purifies the realm, nurturing the empty wheel. Irrigating the Yellow Blossom, the vast movement revolves in mystic clarity. The divine palace unfolds in vastness, extending the cinnabar courtyard.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the West:\nThe Great Plan floats in light, as true stability transforms the origin. Graceful and subtle, the jade beam clarifies the mist. Towering and erect, they bind the valleys, as light nets the Seven Coils. The Three Treasuries flourish in elegance, streaming radiance through the Nine Mysteries. Serene and distant in emptiness, flying blossoms brush the canopy. Dawn overflows the green registers, as the Great Desert extends its course. The Aligned Mounds ascend ninefold, as six dragons dance upon the axle. Lush and misty, the floating net, as purple essence perfumes the abyss.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\nThe Primordial Expanse of Great Possession, as the Nine Mechanisms transform Qian. Covering forms with profound virtue, the Primordial River submerges its essence. Nurturing the flourishing Mingtu, as light and stars drift in subtle clouds. The Great Hidden One oversees all, as the flourishing music guards heaven. The Purple Void of the Mingtu Mound, as kalpic measures intersect in the forefront. Azure radiance chants the Brahma tones, drifting subtly through the origin. Six transformations revolve their measures, severing evil transgressions. Vast and tranquil in mystic desert, ten thousand crossings achieve immortality.\n\nThe above jade script, in Dragon-Script and Phoenix-Seal, comprises the hidden and taboo names of the inner heavens. Inscribed on jade tablets in golden script, they are secreted within the thirty-two palaces of heaven to guard the thirty-two heavens. Diligence in recitation and invocation ensures responsive resonance.\n\nThe Numinous Writ of the Middle Chapter of the Primordial Beginning — Composed by the Dao Lord\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the East:\nDanlou Acang, Wu Xiang Guanyin.\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Poutan.\nJiana Ayi, Huhe Liuyin.\nHuadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen.\nDaluo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun.\nFeisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen.\nWuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan.\nAtuo Longluo, Sixiang Xuyuan.\nDanlou Acang Wuhe Guanyin.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning wove these eight characters from Brahma qi into cloud-seals to guard the Heaven of August Antiquity. Within the Jade Capital stands the Danlou Tower, which upholds the Mystic Capital Palace, where the overseer of halls and towers is named Ana. The wandering terrace within heaven is called Cangwu, the realm of emptiness and non-being. *He* signifies the gate of sun and moon. *Guan* is the taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor. *Yin* denotes the sound of song. Thus, at each courtly assembly, Ana first ascends the tower, striking the great Dharma drum to gather the perfected of the heavens, paying homage to the Primordial Beginning in the realm of emptiness and non-being, opening the gate of sun and moon. The Primordial Beginning commands the Heavenly Emperor to observe and oversee the Register of Longevity, leading the host of perfected to ascend the Cang Terrace, chanting the sounds of the Cavern Chapters to initiate the deliverance of heavenly beings.\n\nThe Upper Yang Master states: The jade script of the Numinous Writ is another name for the Golden Elixir, hence it is called the Middle Chapter. Its explanatory phrases elucidate the wondrous workings of the Reverted Elixir, thus they are termed hidden language. At this stage, the practitioner must first possess the eye of wisdom, for there will surely be points of realization.\n\nXuyan Mingshou, Falan Poutan—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Jade Perfection. The gate of this heaven is named Xuyan, and its capital overseer is titled Mingshou. The Four Perfected Ones are named Falan Poutan. Whenever a great kalpic transition occurs, the Primordial Beginning commands Xuyan to open the Jade Treasury, admitting the immortals and sages, while Mingshou guides the heavens to sustain Brahma qi. Thereupon, the Dharma Wheel draws the registers, embracing awakening to ferry souls; the Bodhi Wheel turns, as Poutan raises the banner. Naturally, the Nine Earths radiate light, and all practitioners receive deliverance.\n\nJiana Ayi, Huhe Liuyin—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Harmonious Youth. Jiana oversees the registers, the Perfected One Ayi of the Seven-Jewel Jade Grove. *Hu* is the inner name of the Flying Heavenly Divine King. *He* interprets as invoking the Primordial Beginning as Mahā.",

      "translated_text": "The A Mountain and Dragon Mountain, their forces interlinked, their qi conjoined with the Jade Purity, ascend in ninefold turns to connect with the Tower of Tuo, where the light of sun and moon shines universally upon the four extremities. The Perfected all ride the chariot of symbols to descend and ferry learners, guiding them to pay homage to the Southern Cinnabar Yu Emperor and seek the fire of true yang, refining and delivering their living bodies. The Yu Emperor then commands the solar child bearing the flower of ninefold yang golden essence to bathe and refine their forms, as explained above, transforming the mortal to attain sagehood.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable, moved by compassion for the benighted, bestows this numinous script of jade characters and hidden language, so that superior practitioners may follow the Way of the Numinous Script and attain sudden enlightenment; middling practitioners may hear the mystery of the jade characters and cultivate gradually; and lesser practitioners may recite the scripture of hidden language to seek blessings—this is called the wondrous subtlety of the Great Brahma’s Numinous Treasure.\n\n*Eulogy:*\nHow wondrous the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure Delivering Humanity*!\nCloud-seal celestial chapters are concealed in the Jade Purity.\nThe radiant capital of A spreads flowing Brahma qi,\nAnd the netherworld, upon hearing this, gains rebirth.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the South**\n**Nanyan Dongfu**, Jade Eyes shimmering.\nThe Brahma form descends into emptiness; the Nine Numinous advance.\nThe Terrace of Duo and Wei, the Green Gauze of the Great Thousand.\nVast and boundless, the Nine Uglies; the Shao chants wind along the margin.\nAbove the clouds, the Nine Capitals—flying life soars of itself.\nNayu’s lush fragrance, Mara’s Dharma Wheel.\nThe Mirrorless Pool of Hong; seizing posture, moving countenance.\nFragrance bright and expansive; the divine tassel self-contained.\n\n**Nanyan Dongfu, Jade Eyes shimmering**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Harmonious Yang. The Southern Cinnabar Heavenly Realm holds the Court of Flowing Fire, where flying portals blaze across the eight directions. At its center lies the Cavernous Yang Palace, where fiery qi flames upon the jade pupils, the rich essence of fire flourishing in great splendor. Light and brilliance intermingle to refine and deliver learners.\n\n**The Brahma form descends into emptiness; the Nine Numinous advance**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Reverent Florescence. From the Dragon Han kalpa to the Yan Kang kalpa, from eon to eon, the Primordial Beginning transforms and gives life to beings, all congealing the great Brahma qi to form their shapes. A single spirit manifests without undergoing gestation, born from emptiness. The Nine Numinous Perfected of the Jade Capital scatter golden flowers upon the Terrace of Advancement, whistling and chanting cavernous hymns to deliver heavenly beings.\n\n**The Terrace of Duo and Wei, the Green Gauze of the Great Thousand**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Ancestral Drift. *Duo* is the name of a mountain in heaven; *Wei* is the inner taboo name of the Dao Lord. *Pu* is the inner sound of the flying heavens; *Terrace* refers to the jade terrace on the southern slope of Duo Mountain. *Green Gauze* is the name of the Jade Consort of the Moon Palace. The Jade Concubine of Broad Cold is named Luo Ying; the solar child of the Sun Palace is named Zhuoluo; the numinous child of Fusang is named Yun. The *Great Thousand* refers to the Southern Jambu Continent as the Great Thousand World. A thousand worlds form a Small Thousand; a thousand Small Thousands form a Middle Thousand; a thousand Middle Thousands form a Great Thousand. Speaking thrice of thousands, it is called the Three Thousand. Duo Mountain is where all dragons submit; at its center lies the Yellow Chamber, the dwelling of the Wei Lord. From eon to eon, it neither perishes nor arises, and in due time, it leads the flying heavenly sages to ascend the Jade Terrace, sing cavernous hymns, and deliver heavenly beings. The Green Gauze Jade Consort illuminates the Great Thousand World; her form is like jade, beautiful yet not alluring. She rides the great Brahma qi, governing the calculations of the Great Yin to correspond with the celestial origin, without error. When the great kalpic transition occurs and sun and moon converge, the Jade Terrace conceals its light and silently shines, awaiting the reopening of the kalpic cycle. Those who restore the primordial transformation and refine their forms with golden liquid seek their starting point here.\n\n**Vast and boundless, the Nine Uglies; the Shao chants wind along the margin**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of August Reed Pipes. *Vast and boundless* describes the state of chaos. The *Nine Uglies* are mighty demonic beasts. *Shao* is the name of a demon king; *chants* refer to demonic songs. *Margin* is the inner taboo name of the Southern Dipper; *Zhan* is the hidden name of the Northern Dipper. Before heaven and earth divided, their state was vast and boundless; the nine demonic beasts of the Uglies were born equal to heaven, examining human good and evil. The demon king further sings songs to vex and test learners. If one dwells in the realm of desire yet remains steadfast in heart despite alluring beauty and seductive charm, transforming the realm of desire into the realm of the divine, turning desire into the pure mind of the Dao, then the Northern Dipper removes their name from the black register, and the Southern Dipper inscribes their name as an immortal, with the supervising office guiding them into this heaven. They seek the Golden Flower Mountain to obtain the Taiyi Unification Talisman and roam the various heavens in revelry.\n\n**Above the clouds, the Nine Capitals—flying life soars of itself**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Hallowed Radiance. *Above the clouds* is the taboo name of the Divine King; the *Nine Capitals* is the name of the Mystic Terrace. *Flying life* is the name of the Great God of Rebirth; *of itself* refers to entering the Forest of Soaring. The Flying Heavenly Divine King burns hundredfold harmonious incense above the clouds and scatters five-colored cloud flowers. The Jade Lad of the Great Perfected holds the Ten Absolute Banners, circling thrice daily. Each revolution of the banner gathers all the heavenly emperors beneath the Terrace of the Nine Capitals, who circumambulate the terrace thrice, chanting cavernous hymns to deliver learners. If one recognizes this song, the Great God of Rebirth opens the gate of deathlessness, flowing the qi of eternal life to refine their form and soul, and then recommends them to enter the Forest of Soaring and roam the Mystic Terrace. After twenty-four years, when their merit is complete, they may ascend to pay homage at the Mystic Capital.\n\n**Nayu’s lush fragrance, Mara’s Dharma Wheel**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Upright Tranquility. *Na* is the celestial attendant; *Yu* is the empty wheel of the heavenly gate. *Lush fragrance* is the immortal child of the Dipper; *Mara* is the demon king of heaven; *Dharma Wheel* is the Dharma Wheel of the heavenly palace. The attendant Na governs the qi of the four seasons, turning the empty wheel of the heavenly gate to regulate the divisions of heaven. When the great kalpic transition occurs, the Dharma Wheel turns ten times, and all spirits gather. The lushly fragrant one intones the rites, and with a single chant, all spirits bow in unison. The demon king sings the melody of the cavernous hymns to deliver learners.\n\n**The Mirrorless Pool of Hong; seizing posture, moving countenance**—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Reverent Celebration, the abyss of the divine dragon. *Hong* is the name of the dragon abyss; *Chi* is the supervisor of the Dragon Abyss.",

Nine dragons crouch in the abyss, and the Supervisor of the Dragon Abyss ever holds a golden flask, channeling the Yellow Flower Heavenly Primordial True Unity’s water from the Eastern Well to refine and temper the celestial beings. The Mirrorless opens the long-night repository to deliver their nine generations of ancestors, ascending beyond the Heavenly Gate. Thereafter, the Moving Countenance Jade Maiden guides the learners, refining them with the crimson numinous *qi* and bathing them in the fluid of Mysterious Harmony. Their bodies are transmuted, their forms infused. *Fragrant Radiance, Vast Brilliance*—these eight cloud-seals guard the Ultimate Jade Heaven. *Fragrant Radiance* is the name of the Mysterious Terrace Mountain; *Vast Brilliance* is the inner title of the divine lord. *Tassel* is the name of the Purple Tenuity numinous child; *Self-Palace* means ascending to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The divine lord Guo Yi was born together with the Primordial Beginning and is the ancestor of the mysterious *qi*. He ever chants the cavernous hymns upon the Fragrant Radiance Terrace, while the Tassel numinous child leads learners to ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace and pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. The greatly cultivated practitioner, having refined the self to purity, congeals the jade pupils into flowing fire-ointment, rides the green silk of the Great Brahma *qi*, and dwells within the realm of desire without the Nine Shameful Ones being able to examine his transgressions. Entering the Golden Flower, he immediately unites with the Grand Monad.

In the *Daoli* world of the Li state’s Cavernous Yang Palace, the Primordial Beginning fired the true writ to illumine the myriad heavens, transforming this world into the Great Blessing Hall. All sinful souls are thereby enabled to ascend and enter. When learners attain the Dao, the Lord of Good Birth delivers their lives, Poni refines their souls, and the demon king Joutong reverently receives his charge, daring not obstruct the gate of life.\n\n*Wansou Dise* and *Taimiao’s Hall*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of August Precipice. *Wansou* is the inner title of the Heavenly Emperor; *Di* means to cleanse; *Se* refers to the realm of form. *Taimiao’s Hall* is the Great Blessing Hall within heaven, the secret repository of heaven wherein lies the great cavern’s natural writ. The Heavenly Emperor of August Precipice presides over the opening of the great desert’s scriptures, governing the heavenly *qi*. He often leads the various immortals to wander the realm of form. The various heavens enter and exit the Highest Clarity’s repository, cleansing impure *qi* and opening the path for learners. Those whose conduct is lofty may ride the cloud chariot to ascend and be born in Taimiao’s Hall.\n\n*Liuluo Fanmeng* and *Jingwei Xiaoyu*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Ultimate Wind. *Liu* is the taboo of the Heavenly King; *Luo* is the name of the Lunar Consort; *Fan* is the inner sound of the Flying Heavenly Perfected; *Meng* is the inner name of the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King. *Jinghuang* is the Highest Perfected of the Four Poles; *Weixiu* is the Perfected of the Radiant Empyrean; *Xiaoyu* is the palace of kalpic measure. This is the White Primordial Sovereign of the West, the Recondite Chamber Flowing Lord, who rectifies the *qi* of the Nine Empyreans. The Lunar Consort presides over the rites of feasting and wandering; the Flying Perfected opens the passes of the Nine Empyreans; the Meng Lord is the ancestor of the Brahma *qi*; the Jinghuang and Weixiu open and govern the Xiaoyu Palace. Only when learners comprehend this sound may they rein the cinnabar dragon’s bridle to ascend the terrace of the Nine August Ones.\n\n*Yimiao Wuji* and *Wanshou Shaodu*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Filial Purity. *Yimiao* is the taboo of the First Emperor; *Wuji* is the name of the heavenly courtyard. *Wanshou* is the inner sound of the Dao Lord; *Shaodu* is the name of the solar child. From the Dragon Han to the Vermilion Bright kalpa, the Heavenly Emperor of the First Beginning dwells in the courtyard of emptiness and silence, serving the Dao Lord to expound the profound and elucidate the wondrous Dharma to deliver humanity. The numinous child Shaodu flows with flying rosy clouds and irrigates with the essence of solar splendor.\n\n*Alan Yuzhu* and *Huamo Yanyou*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Floating Repose. *Alan* is the hidden taboo of the Heavenly Emperor; *Yumo* is the inner name of the demon king. *Zhu* is the realm of desire; *Hua* is the realm of form; *Mo* is the vast and distant; *Yan* is the courtyard of eastern ghosts; *You* is the chamber that restrains ghosts. The Yumo demon king appears and vanishes, sometimes dwelling in the realm of desire, sometimes in the realm of form, harassing and disturbing the heavenly beings, vast and distant and difficult to control. The Emperor Alan ascends the nine-tiered tower to chant the cavernous hymns and subdue them. Thereupon, the multitude of demons respond to the echo and bind themselves, while the host of ghosts prostrate their forms before You.\n\n*Jiukai Zibian* and *Anapin Shou*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Riverine Flow.

The Emperor Aqiu ever ascends the Dragon Mountain’s Nine Mysteries capital to command the flying heavenly ones to roam the void, opening the path for those of good roots. Their souls are graded and ranked, entering the foremost rank of flying immortals.\n\n*Wuliang Fugai* and *Fuluo Heshen*—these eight characters in cloud-seals guard the Heaven of Joyous Music. *Wuliang* is the great sage of heaven; *Fu* is the name of the Lord of Regeneration; *Gai* is the name of this heavenly palace. *Fu* is the cry of the hidden souls; *Luo* is the Great Web; *He* means to join in celebration; *Shen* refers to the divine lord.",

      "translated_text": "The Ninefold Numinous Immortal Mother governs the Eastern Ultimate, the *Fuduo* Yang Valley’s abyss, holding dominion over the earth’s mechanism and revolving the primordial *qi*. When the Heavenly Pass and earth’s mechanism complete one revolution, the overflowing waters reach three thousand three hundred *du*; when this measure is exhausted, heaven and earth’s *qi* intermingle, the nine seas merge as one, and the waters inundate the heavens. The great deity *Dongfu* presides over the summit of Kunlun, filling the vast seas and traversing the source of the Eastern Well, ensuring the earth’s mechanism does not sink. When the kalpa shifts, the *Kun* Mother emerges from the Eastern Well, summoning the Bird Mother at the Dragon Gate to regulate the river’s source. Ascending before the Emperor, she reports the kalpa’s convergence, then bears the disciples in a phoenix chariot to ascend Kunlun and pay homage at *Xuandu*.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: The *Miao Jing* is the foremost of the most wondrous scriptures. Among the eighteen thousand scrolls of the Daoist Canon, the wonder lies in the *Du Ren* scroll; within the *Du Ren Jing*, the wonder lies in the *Ling Shu* scroll. In the *Ling Shu*, these eight characters are revealed—how could the Primordial Beginning’s secret mysteries, so profoundly subtle, be so utterly exposed as to exhaust heaven’s mechanisms? The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, allows the world’s people to doubt or believe. Alas! The scripture is spoken for the perfected. Only the perfected can employ this scripture. Thus, the Elder of Qinghe praised it in verse:\n\n*Juewu* rides the turning to align with the *qian* origin,\nRevolving the nine revolutions to preserve heaven’s root.\nWhen the kalpa ends, the Bird Mother meets at the Dragon Gate,\nDisciples ride the phoenix to ascend Kunlun.\nThe Feathered Forest receives the talisman and bows to new grace,\nIn cloud robes ethereal, they pay homage at the Emperor’s hall.\nThe marvel of golden liquid and returning cinnabar—\nThe perfected behold this with discerning eyes.\n\n*Tuoluo Yumiao* and *Miaoqi Heyun*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Miaocheng* Heaven. *Tuo* is the name of a flying immortal; *luo* is the moon’s radiance; *yu* is the personal name of the *Miaocheng* Heaven’s lord; *miao* is the name of the Feathered Forest’s overseer. It is said that *Tuo* and *Yu* were both born on the Cloud Alas Ridge, embracing the moon’s light, and govern the Feathered Forest army. The Feathered Forest lies in the north, while the Cloud Alas Ridge is in the south. At times, the Emperor commands *Miao* to patrol the Three Realms, safeguarding and guiding those who study immortality to the Feathered Forest army to receive talismans and credentials. Their resplendent *fan qi* merges with the myriad heavens’ luminosity, weaving cloud-*qi* into robes and refining moonlight to fill their bellies.\n\nThe Great Ugly Flying Immortal and the *Zongjian Shangtian*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the Forbidden Upper Heaven. *Feitian* is the divine king; *Dashou* is the registrar of the ancestral ministry. *Zongjian* are the names of two deities under the Flying Immortal Divine King. *Shangtian* means ascending to heaven. The Flying Immortal Divine King oversees the kalpa’s revolutions in the Upper Heaven, managing the Three Realms’ ancestral ministry. At times, he commands the two *Zongjian* deities to record the Long Night’s repository, raising the dark souls to the heavenly realm to merge with the Dao and unite with the true.\n\n*Shatuo Jieliang* and *Longhan Yingshan*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Changrong* Heaven. This heaven contains the *Shalan* Palace. *Tuo* means hills; *jieliang* means measuring by the kalpa’s reckoning. *Longhan* is the name of the first kalpa; *ying* is the divine king’s personal name; *shan* is the Solar Lad’s name. The auspicious *Shalan* Palace rests upon the hills, a detached palace of the Jade Purity Purple Tenuity. Those newly received into the ranks of the delivered, whose merits remain incomplete, often number in the tens of thousands and dwell scattered within. All are people from the *Longhan* kalpa; as the kalpa’s revolutions shift, their merits are assessed to ascend to the upper palaces. If disciples comprehend this sound, *Ying* the Lord examines their conduct and merits to deliver them by rank, while the *Shan* Lad bathes them in solar essence to refine their forms.\n\n*Biluo Fuli* and *Kongge Baozhen*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Tengsheng* Heaven. *Biluo* is the celestial rosy clouds; *Fuli* is the Heavenly King’s personal name; *Kong* is the name of the celestial attendant; *ge* is the sound of the Great Cavern. When the Heavenly King steps in emptiness, the rosy clouds part, and he rides the flying cloud’s brush; with one cry from the celestial attendant, the divine wind fans forth, forming the Great Cavern’s song. They guide the immortals to ascend and pay homage at the Seven Treasures, preserving and cherishing the scriptures for those who study below.\n\n*Eyi Wupin* and *Dongmiao Zizhen*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Fandu* Heaven. *Eyi* is the Heavenly Emperor’s inner sound; *wu* is the Supreme Nonbeing Perfected. The Heavenly Emperor *Eyi*, since the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa, has cultivated the Dao, transcending the Three Realms to enter the Jade Void. At times, he commands the Supreme Nonbeing Perfected to widely open the Long Night’s repository, ranking and delivering sinful souls, enabling them to clearly understand their past lives, purify their evil roots, ascend to the wondrous transformation’s blessed hall, and naturally delight in the most true and wondrous Dao.\n\n*Yuanfan Huimo* and *Youji Duren*, eight characters in cloud-seals, guard the *Jiayi* Heaven. The Primordial Beginning’s great *fan qi* is vast and boundless, difficult to fathom—lofty and floating in emptiness, suspended yet not falling. Though secluded and unseen, it can transform; though still and unmoving, it responds and connects. Within it lies the true; within the true lies the essence. Its essence is most true, wondrous beyond naming. Inverting and overturning, reversing the Five Phases, it delivers countless beings to achieve the Way of returning cinnabar. Those of great cultivation, with steadfast true hearts, who faithfully receive and practice this, will attain the fusion of nature and life, the marvel of both form and spirit, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, accumulating deeds and merits to realize the rank of lofty immortals and supreme sages.\n\nA verse praises:\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dao to deliver heaven’s people,\nThe great *fan* and numinous scripture reveal the utmost true.\nHow fine is the wondrous efficacy of this true scripture—\nIn the Great Luo Heaven above, all find their abode.\n\nThe Dao speaks: These great *fan* hidden words within the heavens, the boundless sounds, were once written in characters a *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old transcribed their script to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and purify themselves to recite them will have the myriad heavens dispatch Flying Immortal Divine Kings to observe their bodies, record their diligent merits, and report to the heavens. The ten thousand spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at the gates, and the great demon kings will protect and recommend them as immortals. When their Dao is complete and they attain perfection, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate. These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—such are the Heavenly Perfected’s natural sounds.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when one recites them, Flying Immortals descend to observe; the Supreme Emperor sings from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in reverence, all demonic beings bow their heads, and ghostly essences perish of themselves. The resonant jade-like tones reverberate, the ten directions grow solemn and clear, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, and the ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, summoning the assembly of immortals. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth is without demonic dust, dark wisdom shines with clarity, and the vastness of the mysterious profundity is boundless.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: This concluding passage of the scripture was composed by the Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate. The ancient characters, each a *zhang* in length, were formed at the dawn of the Dragon Han era, when the Primordial Beginning wove them from the qi of the Brahma-sound. A *zhang* is the perfect measure of heaven and earth. The Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate recounted: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old transcribed these characters to establish the correct sounds. This sacred script is the root of the Great Dao and the master of returning cinnabar. Those who know its sounds—this hidden language—are not of middling or lesser capacity, for they cannot fathom its subtleties. Only those of supreme sagely roots, the seeds of immortals, upon receiving their master’s illumination, may grasp its sounds. At first hearing, they awaken to a hundred insights, their joy boundless, and without hesitation, they purify themselves inwardly and observe the precepts outwardly, faithfully receiving and practicing it. Thus, the Most High said: The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it. For those who practice the Dao, divine luminaries guard their gates, and demonic beings withdraw into hiding. When one recites this scripture in harmony, Flying Immortal Divine Kings descend to observe whether their body is truly pure, and record whether their merits and diligence are steadfast. If their body is indeed pure, desire cannot disturb them, and demons cannot test them. If their merits are truly vigorous and unwavering, their progress diligent and unceasing, then the myriad spirits will naturally pay homage, earth deities will attend at their gates, and demon kings will protect and recommend them. When their Dao is complete and their elixir perfected, their cultivation reaching the scripture’s essence, their merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, they will attain a body beyond the body, transcend the Three Realms, and ascend through the Golden Gate. These sounds respond to one’s practice: those who practice diligently attain the Dao and become immortals; those who recite diligently have their wishes fulfilled. Thus, they repel, exorcise, deliver, and accomplish all—nothing is beyond their power. Therefore, recitation summons the descent of Flying Immortals.\n\nObserve those who recite the scripture: they must purify their minds, abstain from desires, sweep the ground, change their garments, burn incense, sit upright, withdraw their gaze, and concentrate their spirit before recitation may begin. With sincere and focused intent, free from stray thoughts, they can summon the descent of Flying Immortals to observe and record their diligent merits. The Supreme Emperor sings from afar, moved by their devotion. Yet today, people hold prayer beads while their minds wander, their thoughts scattered, their mouths merely murmuring as if reciting the scripture—how can they expect the myriad spirits to pay homage or the Three Realms to attend in reverence? Instead, they invite calamity and retribution that cannot be evaded. These sounds are the essence of the world’s dharma.\n\nFrom \"protect and recommend as immortals\" to \"the earth is without demonic dust\" was previously expounded in detail by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Here, the Perfected Sovereign of the Great Ultimate concludes the scripture, reiterating and proclaiming it to complete the merit of the *Lingbao* deliverance. When applied in Daoist practice, the descent of Flying Immortals signifies the spirit returning to the body; the Supreme Emperor’s distant song is the transformation of the embryo spirit. The carriage of the myriad spirits paying homage is the primordial qi returning to the origin; the Three Realms attending in reverence are the three origins guarded within. Demonic beings bow their heads, ghosts and demons submit and descend, ghostly essences perish of themselves, and corpse anomalies are eradicated. The resonant jade-like tones harmonize with the qi’s response. The ten directions grow solemn and clear, inner and outer purity prevail. Rivers and seas fall silent, nature is tranquil and emotions stilled. Mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the pulse ceases and qi settles. The ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, the yang spirit manifests. Immortals are summoned and assembled, the Dao is perfected and merits fulfilled. The heavens are free of defilement, vast and all-pervading. The earth is without demonic dust, radiant and serene. Dark wisdom shines with clarity—*minghui* (or *minghui*, the four characters signify the scripture’s concluding meaning)—illuminating the unseen, wisdom boundless. Grace extends to all, the vast emptiness resplendent. Ascending to the ethereal and distant heavens, free from all constraints; the vastness of the mysterious profundity’s wonders cannot be fully extolled.\n\nA hymn says:\n*A scroll of true scripture, five thousand characters,*\n*Layered and dense, all proclaimed in full.*\n*To know the wondrous Dao’s perfect merit,*\n*All habits forgotten, one attains the immortal’s rank.*\n\n**Latter Section of the Primordial Beginning’s Sacred Scripture**\n*Composed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign*\n\n**Eight Heavens of the East:**\nSenluchu stores clouds, nine souls refine essence.\nJimo gazes at jade, Fumei traces footprints.\nLuji raises the chamber, Bitizan revolves.\nChidian bears the burden, Qihuan presents offerings.\nZaozhang transforms jade, Lanban shatters green.\nKangbang grows wild, Jizhong’s purity ascends.\nYaozhan dries the abyss, silence without trace.\nSuyi leans on the void, Huangda reaches the primordial spirit.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the South:**\nYanduo’s spacious hall, Great Rosy Cloud’s jade corner.\nLixia offers ripples, Zhoujiong adds diagrams.\nPiyao’s paths are hazy, Gudan’s capital is vast.\nJiyun’s brilliance dazzles, Jingqi grasps the reed.\nZhangwei restrains ceremony, Yiguang’s jade gleams.\nBianlv benefits but, Youwei’s thunder completes.\nJuanhuang flows east, Chiyao gathers in clusters.\nYuxuan performs for the marquis, Boqi’s rules are supreme.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the West:**\nGaozheng turns left, Poni kills spirits.\nBeizhao’s borders equal, Jinan’s stars entwine.\nJingyi dims light, Hunyuan awakens to causes.\nDaoshou guards the distant, Mianzhen knows proclamation.\nTailing’s vastness fades, Binghe follows Lu.\nZhejing’s eternal splendor, Xucheng’s firm sands.\nLiduo banishes stocks, Huiyan’s spheres adorn.\nZhuoyun’s Azure Mansion, Yedu’s karma revealed.\n\n**Eight Heavens of the North:**\nWahai nurtures sweetness, Cuiyu’s nine gates.\nXiaogou’s ripples rise, Longfen’s divine pass.\nGoulun’s void swallows demons, Huoman prays for passage.\nXuanliao’s breath ceases, Wuzhi’s brilliance spreads.\nMangxiu’s auspicious evening, Futan’s timely furrows.\nTangchang spreads prosperity, Feiyong’s caution aids.\nChaokang’s sagely breadth, Mifa’s secrets abound.\nGuangdi governs life, Weizhao’s vast humanity.",

The Ten Directions’ Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, Supreme Sages and Lofty Perfected, Wondrously Practiced Realized Ones, Boundless Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings, Great Demons of the Three Realms, and the Nine Heavens’ Elders—innumerable hosts—chant the Jade Sutra, take refuge in the Supreme *Lingbao* Wondrous Dharma, and ensure its flourishing circulation, enduring for kalpas uncounted.\n\n*Explication of the Primordial Beginning’s Peerless Upper Scripture on the Salvation of Humankind, Volume the Lower, concludes.*\n\nAfter reciting the sutra, intone the incantation:\n\"Supreme August Perfected,\nEnable my ascent to the numinous.\nPurify with fasts and refinement,\nRecite and intone the Golden Sutra.\nThe Seven Mysteries unfurl,\nAscend to the Great Void.\nProlong years and endure,\nInscribe my name in the celestial records.\"\n\nClose the eyes, swallow saliva thrice, knock the teeth thrice, then recite the furnace incantation:\n\"Your servant has finished reciting the sutra.
