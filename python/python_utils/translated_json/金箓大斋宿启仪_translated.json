false winds of body, mind, and speech,\nThe ocean of calmness disturbed by sudden waves.\n\nOur accumulated deeds are sins without end,\nBoundless and infinite in number.\n\nWe humbly pray for mercy from above,\nAnd beg for pardon from below,\nThat we may answer without hindrance from *mo* (demons),\nAnd dwell in thought harmonized with the Dao.\n\nTo gather the myriad truths at the Imperial Seat,\nAnd extend ten thousand ages in the Celestial Plan.\n\nMay the teachings flourish and the Dao’s winds prevail far and near;\nMay the hidden be revealed and the fortunate rejoice,\nFollowing the
