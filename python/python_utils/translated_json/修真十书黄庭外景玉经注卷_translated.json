  "full_translation": "**The Fifty-Eighth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Annotated *Huangting Waijing Yujing* (Outer Radiance Scripture of the Yellow Court)**\n*Annotations by Liang Qiuzi*\n\nWhen Laozi dwelt in leisure, he composed verses of seven characters.\nLaozi, born before heaven and earth, enduring beyond them, possessed thirty-six titles and seventy-two names. Emerging from the womb of Mother Li after eighty-two years, he thus composed the *Huangting* to bequeath to later generations.\nThe Dao cycles endlessly, completing itself by nature.\nWhen one worthy is found, kneel and transmit it.\nIf none are worthy, remain silent for ten thousand generations.\n\n**Explication of the Body’s Form and Its Myriad Spirits**\nLaozi, serene and natural, roamed the eight directions, elusive and unfathomable, his transformations boundless. Of his own accord, he grasped talismans and recorded them, overseeing all spirits.\nThe Dao admits no duality—its perfection is thus. The Dao has no second parent—it ever abides with the virtuous.\n\n**Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Gate of Origin.**\nThe Yellow Court resides within the head: the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field—these three are the Upper Elixir Field.\nFirst, between the brows, one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light; two *cun* is the Grotto Chamber; three *cun* is the Cinnabar Field—these three form the Upper Origin.\nThe Yellow Court, born of the two halves within the Grotto Chamber, gives rise to the Crimson Child, who becomes the True Person. Constantly contemplate this; guard against loss. The Crimson Child transforms into the True Person in the Hall of Light, named Zidan. Thus, the One dwells in the Hall of Light.\nCirculate qi through guiding and pulling, close the eyes to gaze inward, calm the mind and settle the will. In the boundless chaos, refine the essence to ascend to the Muddy Pellet, moving the True Person Zidan.\n\nWithin the Hall of Light are ruler and ministers; in the Grotto Chamber, father and mother; in the Cinnabar Field, husband and wife.\n\n**Another Explication:**\nThe Yellow Court is the spleen, over a *chi* in length, situated above the Great Granary, three *cun* above the navel. The spleen, as the Yellow Elder Lord, is the central spirit, governing within it.\nThe Gate of Origin lies three *cun* below the navel, the portal of primordial yang before it. Suspended essence shines like a mirror, illuminating the entire body—unceasing, this is the Dao.\nBehind it lies the Dark Gateway, before it the Gate of Life.\nThe Dark Gateway is the two kidneys, like overturned cups, adhering to the spine, three *cun* from the navel, smaller above and larger below. The Gate of Life of sun and moon is also below the navel.\n\n**Inhalation and exhalation enter the Cinnabar Field between the hut of the nose.**\nBreathing: exhalation is the emission of qi, inhalation its intake. The hut is the nose, the essential path of expelling the old and drawing in the new. Three *cun* inward from between the brows is the palace of the Cinnabar Field—drawing qi from the nose to enter the Cinnabar Field.\n\n**The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.**\nThe Jade Pool is the pure water, the saliva in the mouth. The numinous root is the tongue. One should constantly tap the teeth, rinse with fluid, and irrigate the root of the tongue.\nThose who diligently cultivate this may endure forever.\nIf one practices day and night without ceasing, one may attain longevity.\n\nWithin the Yellow Court, a person dons crimson robes—\nVisualize the spleen as mother and child, entering from the stomach’s tube into the spleen, clad in red.\nThe Gate’s bolts and locks secure its double doors.\nThe gate of the lower Cinnabar Field must never be carelessly opened.\n\nThe Dark Watchtower stands towering and majestic—\nThe two kidneys reside at the gate of the Watchtower, the tower of the earthly palace, the mansion of generative qi.\nAbove, they connect to the ears; the ears flank the head, hence their lofty height.\n\nWithin the Cinnabar Field, the essence-qi is subtle—\nThree *cun* below the navel, its form spans three *cun* in breadth and depth.\nIts qi is wondrously delicate: preserved, it remains; forgotten, it vanishes—easily lost, hence called subtle.\n\nThe Jade Pool’s pure water engenders richness above—\nThe Jade Pool is the mouth; the pure water, the saliva within.\nWhen saliva gathers upon the tongue, it is called richness.\n\nThe numinous root stands firm, never aging nor withering—\nThe numinous root is the tongue’s root; constantly curling the tongue and tapping the teeth,\npractice this without allowing the tongue’s root to wither.\nEver abide in its spirit, and longevity will never fade.\n\nWithin the Central Pool, a knight wears crimson robes—\nConstantly visualize the crimson-clad infant within the heart, dwelling in the Cinnabar Field,\nclad in red silk. In times of fortune or crisis, it may be summoned.\n\nThree *cun* below the field, the spirit resides—\nThis refers to the spleen, situated below the upper burner of the stomach, above the navel,\nwhere the numinous root’s spirit abides.\n\nInner and outer must be sealed with double closure—\nOne must guard one’s essence and preserve it, never recklessly expending it,\nas if sealing it with a golden lock and jade bolt.\n\nWithin the Spirit Hut, cultivation must be tended—\nThe Spirit Hut is the nose; the hairs within must be regularly trimmed and removed,\nso that when qi flows through the nose, evil is dispelled.\n\nThe Suspended Breast’s qi-tube receives the essence-tally—\nBeneath the tongue lies the essence-tally; the throat is the qi-tube.\nEssence and qi descend from above.\n\nThe Upper Prime unites in wondrous subtlety—\nThe Perfected One ascends and descends the spirit’s path.\nSwiftly secure your essence to sustain yourself—\nOne must restrain qi, return essence, and preserve it, never recklessly dispersing it.\nReturning essence to replenish the brain is the Dao of immortality.\n\nWithin the dwelling, a knight ever wears crimson—\nConstantly visualize the heart’s spirit clad in crimson cinnabar robes,\nmoving in and out, warding off all misfortune and repelling every evil.\n\nShould you perceive it, you may remain free from illness—\nFocus your mind’s essence, meditate without cease,\nand if you inwardly behold the crimson infant, the body shall know no sickness.\n\nIt lies horizontally, a *chi* in length, binding its summit—\nThe spleen stretches over a *chi* in length, covering the Granary’s upper reaches.\n\nShould you guard it, you may remain free from harm—\nConstantly nurture the spleen’s spirit, meditate without cease,\nand you shall know no calamity or illness.\n\nInhaling and exhaling through the hut’s gate to repay oneself—\nDraw qi through the nose, swallow it through the mouth,\nand the primordial qi will moisten and nourish, thus repaying Heaven’s bounty.\n\nPreserve and guard it with perfect firmness, and the body shall receive blessings—\nSafeguard essence and nurture qi, and the body’s spirit shall gleam with radiance, hence called receiving blessings.\n\nWithin the square inch, meticulously store and conceal—\nThe square inch of the Cinnabar Field: concentrate on preserving essence and qi,\ntending it with care and purity, as if sealing a treasure.\n\nSpirit and essence return, and old age reverts to youth—\nReturn essence to refine the form, replenishing the brain’s qi,\nteeth grow firm, hair darkens, and the body does not age.\n\nGuide the Dark Watchtower’s flow to its completion—\nDraw the crimson infant from the Hall of Light downward to gaze upon the Crimson Palace,\naligning with the navel’s center. Transform the hexagrams so that essence flows into the Cinnabar Field, nourishing the form.\nAlso visualize the qi between the two kidneys ascending and descending,\ndrawing breath from above to the Yellow Court.\n(One day, the space between the brows shall serve as the Dark Watchtower.)\n\nNurture the Jade Tree’s child to strengthen it—\nConstantly guard the lower prime’s essence and qi, sealing it as firmly as jade.\nPreserve essence and spirit, and it shall flourish like a sturdy branch.\n\nThe supreme Dao is unhurried, without haste—\nFree from confusion or disorder, calm the mind and settle the intent,\ndirecting one’s course toward the noon hour.\nWith the back facing noon and the waist aligned with mao and you,\nthe Spirit Terrace connects heaven and overlooks the central wilds—\nThe heart is the Spirit Terrace, above connecting qi to the brain’s gate,\nbelow linking qi to the spleen’s center.\nIts qi circulates throughout the entire body.\n\nWithin the square inch, down to the Pass’s base—\nThe throat spans a *cun* in width; within the Hall of Light,\nthe Perfected One descends to harmonize with the Cinnabar Field,\nthen ascends again to the Hall of Light.\n\nWithin the Jade Chamber, the spirit’s gate and door—\nYin and yang are the spirit’s gate and door, governing essence’s restraint.\nIn men, it is called essence; in women, restraint.\nMen store essence; women regulate the monthly flow—hence called gate and door.\n\nAll these were taught to me by the Duke’s son—\nThe heart is the Grand Duke; the left kidney, the Minister of Education;\nthe right kidney, the Minister of Works.\nAll receive essence and qi, never to be leaked.\nAbiding in the One, one may perceive them.\n\nThe Hall of Light’s four directions reach the ocean’s source—\nAn inch above the brows lies the Hall of Light, where qi flows in all directions,\nlike the ocean’s boundless origin.\n\nThe Perfected One, Child Cinnabar, stands before me—\nThe crimson infant is the Perfected One, named Child Cinnabar,\ndwelling within the Hall of Light. Constantly meditate upon it, and longevity may be extended.\n\nWithin the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—\nThe Passes comprise three parts: the Heavenly Pass, the mouth;\nthe Earthly Pass, the lower body; the Human Pass, the two hands.\nGrasp and seal the Three Passes firmly, and no evil qi shall arise.\n\nShould you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun—\nKunlun is the head. Nurture the brain’s mud-pill,\nand you shall not die but attain longevity.\n\nThe Crimson Palace’s tower rises twelve stories—\nThe throat’s twelve rings lie above the heart, forming the Crimson Palace.\n\nWithin the palace’s chambers, the five qi gather—\nThe qi of the five viscera: the heart, as sovereign, resides at the center,\nwhile all spirits assemble beside the crimson infant.\n\nThe Crimson City’s child stands within the Central Pool—\nThe Crimson City is the heart; the tongue is called its child; the mouth, the Central Pool.\n\nBelow lies the Long Wall of the Dark Valley’s town—\nThe small intestine is the Long Wall, guiding qi into the bladder.\n\nLongevity’s essential subtlety lies in the bedchamber’s urgency—\nThe essence of nurturing life lies in sealing the essence-gate.\nAbandon lust and desire, focusing solely on preserving essence.\n\nThe *cun*-field and *chi*-dwelling may govern life—\n\nThe eyes are the *cun*-field, the face the *chi*-dwelling—\nTo govern life, gaze upward to the upper realm, where the One Spirit abides.\nBind the child to long remain, the heart at peace.\nEver contemplate the form of the crimson child,\nso that the hun and po remain constant, the myriad spirits unshaken.\nSerene and desireless, the heart knows no fear—\nthus it finds its own tranquility.\n\nObserve the will roam with the spirit through the Three Wondrous Luminaries—\nGuard the upper realm’s numinous root: the tongue;\nguard the middle realm’s numinous root: the navel;\nguard the lower realm’s numinous root: the essence-chamber.\nAt leisure, without cares, the heart is at great peace.\nSerene and still, embracing emptiness and passionlessness,\nthe body finds tranquility, the heart great peace.\n\nEver preserve the Jade Chamber, and the spirit’s clarity will flourish—\nThe Jade Chamber is the spirit’s gate and portal;\never preserve the qi’s coming and going,\nand the spirit’s clarity will naturally unfold.\nOften contemplate the Great Granary, and hunger and thirst will cease—\nThe Great Granary is the stomach, the kitchen of the five grains;\ncontemplate it often, and hunger and thirst will no longer arise.\nSummon the Six Ding spirit-maidens to attend—\nWhen the sovereign contemplates the Perfected within the Yellow Court,\nthe Six Ding Jade Maidens will come of their own accord to guard and serve.\nSeal the essence-path, and long life may be attained—\nSever ties with the profane, forsake the vulgar,\nand close the essence-path to achieve longevity.\n\nWithin the central chamber, the spirit dwells—\nThe central chamber is the Hall of Light and the Grotto Chamber.\nEver contemplate the crimson child born within it,\nand you become a Perfected One.\nHold this thought, and it remains;\nneglect it, and it is forgotten.\nWash the body and tend to it, allowing no defilement—\nIn purity and solitude, burn incense and contemplate the Perfected.\nThe Perfected of the Crimson Palace and the many Jade Maidens\nwill manifest their forms and speak with mortals.\n\nSurvey the five viscera, observing their rhythms—\nEver contemplate the spirits of the five viscera,\nnever straying from the body.\nThe six bowels, cultivated and tended, remain pure as silk—\nThe six bowels are: the gallbladder as the first,\nthe stomach as the second, the bladder as the third,\nthe large intestine as the fourth, the small intestine as the fifth,\nand the navel as the sixth, the great repository.\nThese six bowels must ever be kept pure and clean.\n\nEmptiness and spontaneity are the Dao’s principle—\nThe twelve qi arise from emptiness, with spontaneity as their origin.\nHumans drift far from the Dao, knowing not its truth.\nYet all things possess their spontaneity, and affairs need not be burdensome—\nOne who knows spontaneity becomes a Perfected One,\nsitting in stillness or standing in oblivion,\nabiding through ten thousand ages—what burden is there?\nHands folded, non-action—body at peace.\nSerene and inactive, dwelling alone in stillness,\nthe heart settled, the will steadfast,\nthe upright qi naturally abides—thus the body finds peace.\n\nThe dwelling of emptiness lies within the curtained chamber—\nThe curtained chamber is the secluded grotto chamber;\nthose who cultivate the Dao ever reside in this realm,\nnot contending with others—hence it is called the dwelling of the curtained chamber.\nSilent and vast, the mouth speaks not—\nDwelling in solitude, contemplating the Dao and pondering the Perfected,\nwhen they appear, do not be startled—close the mouth and speak not.\nSerene and desireless, wander the garden of virtue—\nCold brings no need for clothing, heat no sweat;\nserene and desireless, dwelling alone in stillness,\nemerging or withdrawing to the mountains, scorning worldly glory.\n\nIn purity and fragrance, the Jade Maidens abide—\nIn purity and solitude, with focused mind and self-restraint,\nincense burning, the altar cleansed,\nthe Jade Maidens stand as guardians.\nCultivate virtue, and the Dao’s gate becomes clear—\nLet one guard the Gate of Life, sit upright in right mindfulness,\nwithout wayward gaze.\nCultivate the Dao with clarity, observing the exterior to know the interior,\nand the spirit will open the Dao’s gate for you.\n\n*The Ten Books on Cultivating the Perfected: Annotated \"Outer Radiance of the Yellow Court\" Jade Scripture, Scroll

Yellow Court\" Jade Scripture*\n*By Liangqiūzǐ*\n\nTo practice the Dao is to roam in profound solitude,\nto enter the pure chamber,\nrefine the embryo and temper the form,\nreturning to the spirit’s essence.\nNurture life and guard emptiness—\nEmptiness is nature itself.\nGuard the Dao to cultivate the body,\nalign with nature’s harmony,\nnever departing from one’s own being.\n\nSerene and free from striving, why ponder?\nIn tranquility and purity,\nnurture the spirit and cherish the body,\nkeeping harm a thousand miles away,\nthoughts stilled forever.\nOnce wings are fully grown, they spread wide—\nWith the Dao’s learning complete,\nthe body becomes light,\nflickering and indistinct,\nas if feathered—\nwhen the time comes, one ascends.\nLong life and enduring vision then take flight—\nAttaining the Dao, one does not die,\ntranscending the world to abide forever,\nascending in broad daylight as the soul flies into the Great Clarity.\n\nThe Five Phases interweave, sharing the same root—\nThe five viscera follow the Five Phases,\nrising and falling,\nyet all diverge from a single throat.\nThe Three and Five unite in qi, their origin one—\nAbove and below, Three and Five merge in one chamber;\nwhen Three and Five wane, they return to unity.\nWho then contends with the sun and moon?\nThe left eye is the sun, the father, governing within.\nThe right eye is the moon, the mother, governing within.\nThe Dipper is the Seven Stars, the celestial markers,\nalso known as the Seven Governors.\n\nEmbrace jade, cradle pearls, harmonizing the Chamber of the Child—\nLuminous as jade, unyielding as stone,\ncirculate qi while holding them,\nmindful as if rolling pearls.\nIf you master this, all affairs are complete—\nCultivate the Dao, guard the One,\ningest qi to prolong life,\nreturn to the destiny of spirit immortality—\nall affairs are fulfilled.\nHold fast to what you possess, never losing it—\nSeal the essence, guard it as your own,\nand you shall not die, entering the Golden Chamber.\nRefining the Dao, one enters the nine chambers,\nreturns to the embryo, tempers the form,\norders the mysterious and the bright—\ntrue qi settles serenely,\nthe Three Passes sealed,\nno perverse qi arises.\n\nThe sun emerges, the moon enters—this is my Dao—\nSun and moon are the two eyes,\nflanking left and right,\ntheir governance within the Purple Chamber,\ntheir emergence the Dao’s truth.\nHeaven’s Seven and Earth’s Three revolve in mutual guardianship—\nHeaven has seven stars, Earth three essences;\nprimordial qi circulates endlessly.\nRising and falling, advancing and retreating—only in harmony is there enduring presence—\nPrimordial qi ascends and descends,\nabove and below merging in chaos,\nwithout fixed form—\nheaven and earth, attaining this, achieve long life.\n\nJade and stone gleam—these are my treasures—\nWhite as jade, like stone,\nthey reside in the lower region.\nWhy not guard what you already possess?\nSeal the essence, guard it as your own,\nreceive qi to nourish the spirit.\n\nThe heart understands the root and nurtures radiant splendor—\nThe root is knowing how to guard the One.\nRadiant splendor is the face and eyes aglow,\nthe body suffused with luminous brilliance.\nIngest heaven’s descent, follow earth’s ascent, harmonizing to store essence—\nHeaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi rises,\ntheir union completes virtue,\ntransformations arise in mutual generation—\nseal qi, guard essence,\nnourish the spirit, refine the substance.\n\nHow towering stands the Ninefold Mound—\nWithin the Muddy Pellet, the sovereign qi shines bright,\nthe Perfected One and Great Unity dwell within.\nTowering—this is the heart.\nThe Perfected One within may be commanded—\nThe Perfected Child may be sent forth.\nWithout stepping outside, one knows all under heaven;\nwithout peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.\nThe Three Yang Spirits within may grant long life—\nYang is primordial yang, white,\never-changing in an instant.\nThe key to long life is guarding the Three Black Spirits.\n\nFive and Seven revolve in mutual union—\nThe seven orifices and five viscera\nharmonize as one in a single chamber.\nThe Kunlun Mountain is never mistaken—\nKunlun is the head,\nwhere the Perfected One plays within.\nSun and moon revolve, cold and heat alternate,\nyet never err.\n\nShielded by the

Infant is born,\none spirit, the hun-po, enters the form.\nInternally, nurturing the Three Yin grants long life—\nDrawing yang qi through the nose,\ntaking it in to nourish within.\nThe Red Child, the Perfected One, the Infant—\nthese are the Three Yin,\nalso known as spirit-eaters.\n\nThe hun longs for heaven, the po descends to the springs—\nHun is yang, po is yin.\nFor those in the world without virtue,\nhun and po depart the body,\nreturning to their origins, scattered.\nReturning the hun, restoring the po—this is the Dao’s nature—\nRestrain the hun, govern the po,\nkeeping them from

Jade Scripture**\n*By Liang Qiuzi*\n\nThe jade pivot hangs like a pearl in endless revolution—\nThe jade pivot turns, qi flows in ceaseless circulation, never resting.\n\nClose the mouth to nurture spirit, rinse and refine the sweet spring as flowing pearls.\nThe Mysterious Gate’s golden key remains whole and firm.\nYin is the gate, yang the key—when neither harms the other, the qi of harmony is attained,\nreturning essence to refine the form, thus achieving wholeness and strength.\n\nBearing earth, suspended in heaven, it pervades Qian and Kun.\nEarth bears man, man is suspended in heaven—\nthe Dao is neither above nor below,\nits subtlety resides in the center of Qian and Kun, thus circulating throughout the world.\n\nIts image aligns with the four seasons, red as cinnabar.\nThe Hall of Light opens in four directions, corresponding to the four seasons—\nthe dwelling of the Perfected One, the Cinnabar Child.\nIf you can ponder this, chewing and savoring its qi,\nthen longevity will be boundless.\n\nFront lofty, rear humble—each enters through a different gate.\nHead and feet, kidneys and heart—\nthe heart is red, the kidneys black,\nrooted in the same source yet water and fire contend, thus differing and uniting.\nSend it back with the Returned Cinnabar and the Mysterious Spring.\nCinnabar is blood, transformed and entering the lower source,\nbecoming white essence.\nAt this moment, draw in the nose and return it,\nascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending to the mouth,\ntransforming into jade spring.\n\nLike the tortoise, draw qi to the numinous root—\nWith the nose, draw qi to the root of the tongue,\nswallow and send it to the abdomen, where thunder rumbles in response,\nfor the true qi causes this.\nWithin resides the Perfected One, clad in a golden kerchief.\nThe Red Child wears crimson robes, crowned with a golden kerchief.\nBearing armor and holding talismans, he opens the seven gates—\nDonning the talisman of the Six Jia, warding off evil and misfortune,\ndistributing qi to the seven orifices, ears and eyes become keen.\nSome say: back to the north, facing south, girdled with east and west.\nThe talisman is qi.\nThis is no branch or leaf—it is the true root.\nThe essential Dao, no empty script—\nPonder it day and night to endure forever.\nDay and night contemplate the Dao, never slackening.\nOpen the eyes to behold the true, close them to meditate on spirit—\nthus may one attain long life.\n\nImmortal and Daoist are not endowed with divinity—\nThe Dao is not twofold; fulfillment brings it forth.\nSharing a single root, no other spirits exist—\nharmonize the heart, settle the will,\nand the Dao will daily grow.\nAccumulated essence leads to concentrated years.\nWithout reckless expenditure of yin and yang,\nwithout leakage of essence and spirit,\naccumulating essence to receive qi,\none may live ten thousand years.\n\nAll men eat grains and the five flavors—\nThe common folk consume the essence of the earth,\nrepaying it with their death.\nThe sage eats the primordial harmonious qi,\nrepaying heaven with ascension.\nOnly the adept consumes the great harmony of yin and yang qi—\nThe student of immortality eats yang qi at dawn,\nyin qi at dusk,\nand the primordial qi together.\nThus they do not die, for heaven’s phase is complete.\nThe accomplished do not die—\ntheir years and fate are boundless, merging with heaven.\n*Ji* means to unite.\n\nLet us speak of the five viscera, each with its direction—\nThe five viscera correspond to the five phases,\nthe four limbs to the four seasons,\nwith earth as their ruler, residing in the center.\nThe heart is the sovereign, king of the five viscera.\nThe heart is like an egg, precarious and hard to stabilize.\nWhen the kingdom has worthy ministers, great peace is achieved.\nWhen the heart abides in clarity, the body is at peace.\n\nWithin the mind, movement and stillness allow qi to flow—\nBy preserving and guarding the inner spirits,\nbody and heart remain tranquil, never recklessly disturbed,\nthus qi flows with ease.\nThe Dao naturally sustains my spirit’s radiance.\nHolding to the One, the Dao guards my essence—\nthe radiance of spirit and clarity.\nBy day, luminous and bright; by night, self-guarding—\nContemplate the red qi within the heart, illuminating the myriad spirits.\nGuard the light of sun and moon, meditate on the roots of the two kidneys—\nby day, guard the light; by night, guard the spirit.\nThirst is quenched by nectar, hunger sated by fullness.\nHunger is fed with the qi of nature,\nthirst slaked with the nectar of the Flowery Pond—\nfree from hunger and thirst, one may attain long life.\n\nPassing through the six palaces, storing at mao and you—\nThe ears are the roots of the six palaces,\nstorage emerges at mao and you—\nthe subtlety is profound, unattainable.\nTurning yang into yin, storing it in the nine—\nYang reverts to yin, the body transforms and contends,\nreturning to be stored in the nine.\nNine is the head, thus the scripture says:\n\"Left two, right seven, storing nine, residing in one.\"\nPractice this constantly, and you will not age.\nAt cock’s crow, face outward with unbound hair,\nclick the teeth thirty-six times,\nswallow saliva and qi—\nthis is the way to distance death.\n\nThe qi of the liver is cultivated and long—\nCultivate qi to ascend, reaching the crown to nourish the Mud Pill.\nArraying the five viscera gives birth to the Three Lights.\nThe five officials and six palaces each govern their domains,\nthe kidneys above and below each possess sun, moon, and the Three Lights.\nThe Three Lights refer to the sun, moon, and stars.\nUniting with the Three Burners, the Dao drinks nectar—\nThe Three Burners are the three passes of the origin.\nHunger is fed with the qi of nature,\nthirst slaked with the nectar of the Flowery Pond—\nno more hunger or thirst.\nEssence awaits heaven and earth, the way of long life.\nEssence is my spirit, qi is my Dao—\nwearing essence, contemplating qi above and below,\nthis is the proper way of nourishment.\n\nMy spirit, hun, and po reside in the center—\nThe center’s hun and po are the two kidneys.\nLeft is hun, right is po—\nby day, the hun guards the po; by night, the po guards the hun.\nRestrain the hun, govern the po,\npreventing them from action.\nJade spring flows, the nose is fragrant—\nWhen yin and yang unite, essence leaks and is lost,\nflavors fade, the nose loses its fragrance.\n\nStand at the suspended pharynx, containing the Hall of Light—\nThe tongue’s base is the suspended pharynx, the lungs the Hall of Light.\nHold the qi and swallow it, irrigating the Hall of Light,\nflowing through the body.\nConnect my flowery essence to harmonize yin and yang—\nThis means to cultivate essence and nurture spirit.\nEmbrace yin, hold yang,\nharmonizing essence and spirit.\nCrouch at the Mysterious Gate, awaiting the heavenly Dao—\nThe gate is the nose, awaiting the upper region’s spirit.\nNear to me, yet I guard myself—\nCommand the spirit and essence to guard the self.\nPure and still, without action, the spirit lingers—\nWithin, cultivate the Dao through non-action;\nwithout, cultivate the Dao through desirelessness—\nthe heart untroubled, spirit and essence remain.\nEssence and qi ascend and descend, the passes are ordered and governed.\n\nLet qi ascend and descend through focused intent—\nguard the singular spirit.\nWhen the seven apertures are unobstructed, age remains unknown;\nthe seven orifices of the head and face, gates of spirit,\nflow freely with bodily awareness, defying old age.\n\nReturn to sit at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting yin and yang—\nmorning draws in yang qi, evening takes in yin qi,\nboth converging within the mouth.\nDescend through the throat to commune with spirit-light,\nwhere twelve sentinels of the hours stand guard,\neach wielding jade halberds to protect the passage.\nThe Perfected dwells within, governing the flow of qi above and below.\n\nPass beneath the Flowery Canopy, cool and clear—\nthe brows form the canopy, where spirit resides.\nEnter the realm of pure emptiness to behold my form,\nentering the Brain’s Chamber to meet the Mud-Pill Sovereign.\nWith time, the Returned Elixir may grant eternal life—\nreversing the years, the body never decays.\n\nReturn through the Flowery Pool to stir kidney essence,\ntraversing from the Brain’s Chamber down the spine to the kidneys.\nGaze upon the Hall of Light, nearing the Cinnabar Field—\none inch behind the space between the brows lies the Hall of Light,\nthree inches further, the Cinnabar Field.\nSummon all spirits to open the Gate of Life,\nas the nose draws true qi, ceaseless day and night.\nThe nose is Heaven’s Root.\n\nUnobstructed, the heavenly Dao conceals the numinous root—\nthe head, round as heaven.\nThe numinous root is the tongue.\nYin and yang array like shooting stars—\nthe seven orifices of the face mirror the seven stars.\nAt utmost yin, yang returns; gazing at the sun, one sees the starry host.\nEssence spreads, qi disperses, entering the Mysterious Court.\n\nThe qi of the liver flows like a ring without end,\ncircling ceaselessly through the body.\nThe qi of the lungs arises from the Triple Burner—\nthe Celestial Pass is the mouth,\nthe Human Pass, the hands,\nthe Earthly Pass, the lower region.\n\nCrouch at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting the ancient Dao—\nHeaven’s Gate is the mouth.\nAwaiting the ancient Dao means connecting to the Brain’s Chamber.\nPure fluid, sweet springs flow through the six palaces—\nrinsing the Flowery Pool, irrigating the tongue’s root,\nstreaming through the large intestine, small intestine, gallbladder, stomach,\nbladder, and Gate of Life—these are the six palaces.\n\nFollowing the nose’s ascent and descent, the two ears open—\nprimordial qi enters and exits the nose, rising and falling,\ncommuning

Emerging from the womb of Mother Li after eighty-two years, he thus composed the *Huangting* to bequeath to later generations.\nThe Dao cycles endlessly, completing itself by nature.\nWhen one worthy is found, kneel and transmit it.\nIf none are worthy, remain silent for ten thousand generations.\n\n**Explication of the Body’s Form and Its Myriad Spirits**\nLaozi, serene and natural, roamed the eight directions, elusive and unfathomable, his transformations boundless. Of his own accord, he grasped talismans and recorded them, overseeing all spirits.\nThe Dao admits no duality—its perfection is thus. The Dao has no second parent—it ever abides with the virtuous.\n\n**Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Gate of Origin.**\nThe Yellow Court resides within the head: the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Cinnabar Field—these three are the Upper Elixir Field.\nFirst, between the brows, one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light; two *cun* is the Grotto Chamber; three *cun* is the Cinnabar Field—these three form the Upper Origin.\nThe Yellow Court, born of the two halves within the Grotto Chamber, gives rise to the Crimson Child, who becomes the True Person. Constantly contemplate this; guard against loss. The Crimson Child transforms into the True Person in the Hall of Light, named Zidan. Thus, the One dwells in the Hall of Light.\nCirculate qi through guiding and pulling, close the eyes to gaze inward, calm the mind and settle the will. In the boundless chaos, refine the essence to ascend to the Muddy Pellet, moving the True Person Zidan.\n\nWithin the Hall of Light are ruler and ministers; in the Grotto Chamber, father and mother; in the Cinnabar Field, husband and wife.\n\n**Another Explication:**\nThe Yellow Court is the spleen, over a *chi* in length, situated above the Great Granary, three *cun* above the navel. The spleen, as the Yellow Elder Lord, is the central spirit, governing within it.\nThe Gate of Origin lies three *cun* below the navel, the portal of primordial yang before it. Suspended essence shines like a mirror, illuminating the entire body—unceasing, this is the Dao.\nBehind it lies the Dark Gateway, before it the Gate of Life.\nThe Dark Gateway is the two kidneys, like overturned cups, adhering to the spine, three *cun* from the navel, smaller above and larger below. The Gate of Life of sun and moon is also below the navel.\n\n**Inhalation and exhalation enter the Cinnabar Field between the hut of the nose.**\nBreathing: exhalation is the emission of qi, inhalation its intake. The hut is the nose, the essential path of expelling the old and drawing in the new. Three *cun* inward from between the brows is the palace of the Cinnabar Field—drawing qi from the nose to enter the Cinnabar Field.\n\n**The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.**\nThe Jade Pool is the pure water, the saliva in the mouth. The numinous root is the tongue. One should constantly tap the teeth, rinse with fluid, and irrigate the root of the tongue.\nThose who diligently cultivate this may endure forever.\nIf one practices day and night without ceasing, one may attain longevity.",
