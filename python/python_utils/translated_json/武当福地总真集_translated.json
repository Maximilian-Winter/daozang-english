  "full_translation": "**The Wudang Blessed Land Compendium of Perfected Ones**\n\n**Title:** *Wudang Fudi Zongzhen Ji* (*Compendium of the Wudang Blessed Land of Perfected Ones*). Compiled by Liu Daoming of the Yuan dynasty. Three juan. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Jizhuan* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the *Compendium of the Wudang Perfected Ones***\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the Two Modes began their separation. Water and fire transformed within a single stroke; wind and thunder danced between the two inquiries. The great mass took form, coalescing into seas and mountains. Qi flowed between peaks and marshes, and the ten thousand things took shape. People dwelled in the wilds and caves, their nature simple and unadorned. They pointed to things and images to name them, marking clouds and crows to designate officials. Thus arose the appellations of *Youxiong* and *Youchao*. The sacred traces of the Dark Emperor (Xuandi) on Wudang have endured since antiquity.\n\nThe Dark Emperor’s holy footsteps are fully recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. This mountain was originally called *Taihe* (Great Harmony). In middle antiquity, when heaven and earth settled into their positions, it corresponded to the celestial fields of *Yi*, *Han*, *Jiao*, and *Kang*. After the Dark Emperor ascended to perfected reality, it was said: \"None but *Xuanwu* (Dark Warrior) is worthy of this place,\" and so it was named accordingly.\n\nAccording to the *Illustrated Classic*, this was the land where Mi Jiu lun cut the earth in high antiquity. The people were rustic and simple, serene and fond of goodness—though likened to deer, they dwelled in peace. The Yellow Emperor was born in the land of *Youxiong*, ranking among the Three Sovereigns, yet later contended with the flooding of Feng waters. Yu pacified the waters and earth, enfeoffed the mountains, and inaugurated the provinces. By the late Spring and Autumn period, it was divided between the domains of *Yu* and *Yong*. During the Qin-Han transition, it belonged to Nanyang Commandery, later renamed Hanzhong Commandery. Under the Wei, it fell under Nanxiang Commandery; under the Jin, Shunyang Commandery. Emperor Huaidi of the Jin established Shiping Commandery during the Yongjia era. The Qi dynasty retained it, later establishing Qixing Commandery. The Liang made it Nan Shiping Commandery. The Later Wei renamed it Wudang Commandery. The Liang established Xingzhou, which the Western Wei made Fengzhou, and the Sui renamed Junzhou. It was also called Xiyang Commandery and Wudang Commandery. The Tang and Song restored Junzhou.\n\nIts springs are sweet, its soil fertile, its scenery beautiful and elegant. The land is numinous, its people outstanding—divine immortals make their home here. Collections on Wudang surely existed in ancient times. Though the mountain inspires reverence, its numinous traces have faded. Though the Daoist lineage is exalted, its records have undergone many changes. It is said that between the Jin and Song dynasties, within a hundred years, it suffered three calamities of fire. The woodblocks were destroyed in earlier days, and matters gradually faded in later times.\n\nFortunately, the Dao of Heaven favors return; the realm was unified under a single script and chariot. Erroneous words were swept away, and the true Dao flourished. Former standards were revived, and no text was left unestablished. I, a humble descendant of Jingmen, a rustic from the outskirts, have knocked at the gates of the Dharma lineage and once lodged in the halls of the worthy. Delighted to encounter an age of good governance, yet unable to aid the enlightened era, I retired to the mountains and forests to cultivate the true and nurture my nature.\n\nYet scholars and gentlemen who climbed its heights were many. Often, they sought traces and probed mysteries, asking me to point out its peaks and ridges. Having dwelled long in the groves, my spirit turned inward, preserving my mind and gathering my qi, weary of social obligations. With reverence, I gathered and excerpted from many books, inquired of elders, and supplemented this with what I had seen and heard. Investigating its definitive discourses and precise words, I penned the *Compendium of the Wudang Perfected Ones*. It gathers the essence of ages past, distills the wind and moon of a single mountain. Opening its pages, all is clear—what need is there for my humble words?\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the Zhongyuan day of the Xinmao year of the Zhiyuan era by Liu Daoming, the Hermit of Dongyang Cave in the Groves.\n\n---\n\n### **Compendium of the Wudang Blessed Land of Perfected Ones, Volume One**\nCompiled by Liu Daoming, the Hermit of Dongyang Cave\n\n### **Facts of Wudang**\n\nThe *Traditions and Records* state: Wudang Mountain, also called *Taihe*, *Great Peak*, and *Immortal Chamber*, is the mountain that assists the Central Peak in its mandate. It corresponds to the celestial fields of *Yi*, *Han*, *Jiao*, and *Kang*, located south of Junzhou. It spans six hundred *li* in circumference, encircling seventy-two peaks, thirty-six cliffs, and twenty-four ravines. It is the reserve of Songgao, a peer among the Five Peaks. It was the site of the *chai* and *wang* sacrifices in the Tang and Yu eras, and one of the seventy-two blessed lands.\n\nIts *qi* originates from *Qian* and *Dui*, coiling for ten thousand *li*, revolving like the image of the earth’s axis and the celestial gate. Its terrain is majestic—none but *Xuanwu* (Dark Warrior) is worthy of it, and so it was named Wudang. After the Perfected Lord of Blessing and Sagacity ascended, its temples and monasteries stood towering, immortals appeared and vanished, and its honors from successive dynasties are too numerous to recount.\n\nIn the twenty-third year of the Zhiyuan era, the Dharma Master Ye Xizhen, Liu Daoming, and Hua Dongzhen were summoned before the throne and appointed *Dudu Dian* (Chief Supervisor) of Wudang Mountain. They memorialized and received imperial decrees for protection, along with repeated offerings of imperial incense for prayers and blessings. Black tigers patrolled the corridors, crows heralded the dawn—truly a realm beyond the dust.\n\nThe peaks and crags, streams and ravines—seventy-two in all—culminate in the Great Summit, the Celestial Pillar, whose fame rivals that of Mount Feng and Mount Can. Towering ten thousand *zhang*, it stands supreme among the seventy-two peaks. Above, it aligns with the Three Heavens, positioned at the juncture of the *Yi* and *Han* constellations. Below, it overlooks the prefectures of Dengzhou, Zhou, Xiangyang, and Fangzhou, a thousand *li* of land where the rising and setting of the sun and moon are plainly visible. Radiant clouds often shroud its ridges.\n\nThe summit spans seven *zhang* from east to west and nine *chi* from north to south, its four edges formed of stone ridges gleaming like gold and silver. The ground is carpeted with creeping vines and evergreen foliage that never withers, their fragrance sharp as herbs. At its center stands a stone hall enshrining the sacred countenance of the Dark Emperor. Streams cascade and swirl like dragons and serpents, their depths unfathomable. For it borders the heavens, buffeted by the fierce winds and vast *qi* of the void, even crows and auspicious birds dare not alight, circling instead at its flanks. Gazing down, the surrounding peaks appear no more than mounds. Those who ascend to the summit feel their bones chill and hairs stand on end. At the slightest gesture or murmur, fierce winds and thunderous rains descend.\n\nTo the south, at the base of a sheer cliff, lies a well-like pool called the Heavenly Pond, dwelling of dragons and spirits. In former times, prayers offered here were answered without fail, and the dragon king was enfeoffed as the Great Summit’s Benevolent Dragon King—a title still inscribed in stone. Below grow pines, cypresses, and fragrant trees of various kinds.\n\nTo the north stand three stone gates, known as the Three Celestial Gates. Each soars into the void for ten thousand *ren*, where even gibbons and cranes cannot ascend. Legend holds that the Dark Emperor ascended to the celestial court from here, borne aloft in his chariot. Those who seek audience must first burn incense and offer prayers at the Purple Cloud Palace before ascending the Great Summit, lest they meet with misfortune.\n\nUpon the mountain, one encounters two passes: the first is the Manifest Determination Pass, the second the Imperial Cliff Pass. Here, one must silently recite the immortal scriptures, invoke the patriarchs, and praise their merits—such devotion yields great merit. With a heart pure and reverent, the four *qi* grow bright and clear, the eight directions become transparent, and rare birds and wondrous omens manifest before one’s eyes.\n\nAt the summit stands a bronze pavilion, within which rests an incense burner and a statue of the Dark Emperor. Pilgrims burn incense, inscribe their names, and recite sutras. They must not linger long but descend swiftly, for the winds and rains will cleanse the impurities of the world. Should the will of the sage be unyielding and one insist on ascending, mists will shroud the peaks, obscuring high from low, while giant serpents and fierce beasts crouch beside the path. Truly, this is the realm of the Jade Void, the colorless boundary of reality.\n\nIt is said: *\"Not for a moment does the Great Summit depart, nor for an instant is the Southern Cliff absent.\"* Only after three lifetimes as a human may one ascend this mountain; only after seven may one dwell upon its earth. And again: *\"Only in the clearest and brightest of months may its truth be seen.\"* How true this is!\n\n**Manifest Determination Peak**\nNorth of the Great Summit, also called the Secondary Summit, it aligns above with the Heaven of Manifest Determination and Supreme Wind. Verdant cliffs pierce the sky, untouched by human footsteps, while propitious clouds and auspicious *qi* suffuse the air. Elders of old transmit that this is where the Celestial Perfected records the deeds of immortals—though its appearances shift and vanish.\n\n**Ten-Thousand-*Zhang* Peak**\nNortheast of the Great Summit, its ten-thousand-*ren* heights vanish into the clouds, where the cries of cranes and gibbons echo. None can reach its summit.\n\n**Lion Peak**\n\n**Lion Peak**\nNorth of the Great Summit, above the First Heavenly Gate. Verdant ridges thrust forth, perched as if enthroned amid the clouds—does it not resemble the form of a lion? Below lies the very ground where Yin Xi once dwelled. Without one who rides the light and cleaves the void, how could any abide here?\n\n**August Cliff Peak**\nNorth of the Great Summit, it aligns above with the Heaven of Supreme Peace and August Cliffs. Golden walls bar the sky, auspicious radiance intertwining; the setting sun’s returning glow illumines the nine heavens. When rain clears, flying rainbows weave their hues—admirable from afar, yet unattainable. Below stands a crag named **Empress Rock**. Sheer cliffs soar into the void; unless one has attained the truth of the cavern-heaven, how could one rest here? Of old, the Holy Mother, the Victorious and Virtuous Empress, sought the Dao and reposed in this place—hence its name.\n\n**Small Brush Peak**\nEast of the Great Summit, a solitary pinnacle stands erect like the tip of a brush. Was this the craft of Heaven and Earth, or what cunning artistry?\n\n**Purple Empyrean Peak**\nNortheast of the Great Summit. Its stones gleam with the hues of golden and silver stars; bamboo and trees intermingle in verdant splendor. Giant turtles and strange serpents coil within its caverns. Untrodden by human feet, numinous creatures thus make their abode here.\n\n**Thunderstone Peak**\nNorthwest of the Great Summit. The southern mountain path ascends here, where a stone earth deity sits astride a tiger. The land abounds with mountain leeches, vexing travelers. Layered stones bridge the void, presenting marvels and wonders; some crouch, some stand erect, like tigers, like spirits. Mingled with mist, clouds, and forests, they inspire both reverence and delight.\n\n**Greedy Wolf Peak, Great Gate Peak, Prosperity Peak, Literary Star Peak, Incorruptible Peak, Martial Star Peak, Broken Army Peak**\nThese seven peaks lie north of the Great Summit, arrayed like the Northern Dipper encircling the pole. They soar into the empyrean, standing to the left and right; when clouds part and mists disperse, they appear as if pivoting about the celestial axis. Tradition holds this to be where the Celestial Perfected reviews good deeds. Among them, to the south lies **Ever-Spring Crag**, said to face the light in lofty openness, ever like the springtime sun. To the west stands **Cinnabar Rock**, its stones scorched by the sun’s radiance, taking on its hue. To the north rises **Northern Dipper Rock**, reaching the utmost void. None of these are places for middling or lesser adepts to cultivate the Dao. In summer and autumn, thunder and lightning rage with might; yet in the stillness of night, only the cries of crows and gibbons howling at the moon are heard.\n\n**Central Essence Peak**\nNorth of the Great Summit.\n\nThe rocks stand like ritual jades, bowing in reverence toward the summit, as if in the posture of advancing homage.\n\n**Thousand-Zhang Peak**\nWest of the Great Summit.\nIt rises alone, towering above the surrounding mountains. To its right lies the former dwelling of the immortal Fangling Zhu Zhong. Zhong possessed a rare variety of plum, so prized that the place was named **Immortal Plum Garden**. It no longer exists.\n\n**Great Lotus Peak** and **Lesser Lotus Peak**\nTwo peaks west of the Great Summit.\nThey stand facing each other in elegant splendor, their layered ridges soaring like lotuses rising from clear waters. In spring and summer, their beauty is unmatched.\n\n**Great Brush Peak** and **Middle Brush Peak**\nTwo peaks standing opposite each other between the Lotus Peaks.\nTheir sheer cliffs, a thousand *ren* in height, lean against withered pines like brush tips poised for calligraphy—no brush could compare.\n\n**Falling Hat Peak**\nNorth of Middle Brush Peak.\nA colossal spirit guards its summit, so perilous that none dare climb. Here, the immortal Dai Meng ascended to heaven, leaving his hat behind. Below lies a stone bridge, once inscribed with ancient records, now lost.\n\n**White Cloud Peak**\nWest of the Great Summit.\n**Purple Canopy** and **August Cliff** stand in mutual embrace to the east and west. Below lies a cavern named **White Cloud**, vast and serene. Beside it, a stone aperture like a star is called **Starry Window**. Gazing down into **Ten-Thousand Tigers Gorge**, the roar of pines and the howl of winds mingle with swirling clouds—only those who merge with the Dao may dwell here. Chen Tuan, seeking seclusion, moved thrice before settling here; later, the Five Dragons relocated him to Mount Hua.\n\n**Purple Canopy Peak**\nWest of the Great Summit, twenty *li* south of the Five Dragons Palace.\nIt stands horizontally across the sky, its jagged peaks arrayed like fangs. At dawn, purple *qi* billows over it; at night, immortal lanterns are often seen traversing its heights. Tradition holds that a divine elixir rests here, sought by many but never found. Long ago, the hermit Liu the Daoist built his hut below. After some time, one evening, a youth arrived bearing a summons for him.\n\nAfter some time, the procession arrived in full. His disciple, Master Wang, addressed his teacher, saying: \"The celestial music descends at dawn, when the yang light first appears. Now, in the dark of night, the music arrives—could this be a demonic trial?\" Secretly returning to his quarters, Fa Jing inscribed a thunder talisman and burned it. A single thunderclap resounded, and all vanished without a trace. At daybreak, only bloodstains remained, leading step by step for two or three *li* to a stone cavern where a great beast lay, struck by lightning. Had the thunder rite not discerned right from wrong, lives might have been lost.\n\n**Pine-Lichen Peak**\nWest of **Purple Canopy Peak**. Below lies a mountain ridge, also bearing this name. When the Dark Emperor cultivated the Dao, he often wore pine lichen as clothing, and this peak bore it most abundantly. To the north stands a crag called **Outer Dragon Rock**.\n\n**Peach Blossom Spring Peak**\nNorth of **Purple Canopy Peak**. The terrain here is vast and distant. To its west lies **Peach Blossom Spring Grotto**, the ancestral burial site where Daoists shed their forms and concealed their swords. In ancient times, a Daoist sanctuary stood here, where the people gathered to offer annual sacrifices. To the east is **Scripture-Recitation Terrace**, where Chen Tuan, seeking seclusion, moved a second time and recited the *Yijing*. The terrace’s foundation remains intact.\n\n**Stacked-Character Peak**\nSouth of **Five Dragons Summit**. Three mountains stack like characters, their heights gazing into the hollow sky. Stone steps wind upward, pines and bamboo flourishing in profusion. On its western precipice lies a stone cavern called **Thunder Crag**, some two *zhang* deep. One descends by rope from above, where the rocks take the form of flames, and the imprint of a seated figure remains. A divine wind howls fiercely, chilling the heart and trembling the gall. Tradition holds this as the place where Thunder Marshal Deng, Master of Fire and Law, refined his truth. Many winds and thunders arise from here.\n\n**Golden Cauldron Peak**\n\n**Golden Cauldron Peak**\nWest of **Stacked-Character Peak**. The mountain resembles a cauldron, often exhaling clouds and mist. Below lies a crag called **Cloud-Concealing Rock**. Neither is an ordinary place of seclusion—approaching **Dragon Summit**, the yin qi presses upon one.\n\n**Crouching Dragon Peak**\nWest of **Dragon Summit Peak**. The mountain’s form crouches low; gazing in all directions, the dragon’s lair lies near, and few human traces reach here.\n\n**Five Dragons Peak**\nAlso called **Five Dragons Summit**, corresponding above to the **Dragon Transformation Brahmā Heaven**. Five peaks stand in array, with a sacred pool at their center that never fails even in great drought. A stone temple, called **Hall of the True Source**, serves as the divine abode of the Five Black Dragon Lords. To the east is a crag where the Five Black Dragon Lords are venerated; through the ages, prayers here have met with instant response. Though halls were built, they were shifted by wind and thunder. Stone paths wind upward, overgrown with vines, where white serpents and strange centipedes dwell among the grasses and trees. To the east lie **Spirit Response Peak** and **Five Dragons Palace**.\n\n**Spirit Response Peak**\nBehind **Five Dragons Palace**. Pines and cedars interlock in verdant ranks, soaring to the stars. Long ago, the immortal **Fang Changxu** planted these trees and personally encountered the **Dark Emperor**. The account appears in his hagiography. To the west stands the palace gate, with vegetable gardens, mugwort pools, and lotus ponds arranged above and below.\n\n**Hidden Immortal Peak**\nNorth of **Dragon Summit**. Below it lies **Hidden Immortal Crag**; the **Bamboo Pass** ahead is the second gate of the palace precincts. The **Mountain Spirit Hall** stands to the left of the path.\n\n**Yang Crane Peak**\nNorthwest of **Dragon Summit**. Linked peaks rise in layered ridges, with tall bamboo and lush forests. Several ancient cedars stand here, where auspicious cranes once nested—hence the name of the hermitage. Within are medicinal gardens and lotus ponds, where recluses dwell. Along the ridge lies the main ascent to the mountain. The **Shrine of Marshal Yao**, the **Mighty and Ardent King**, stands here.\n\n**Vigorous Man Peak**\nNortheast of the **Great Summit**, to the right of **Three Lords Mountain**. It commands the clouds and skies, thrusting toward the **Ox** and **Dipper** constellations, majestic as if the **Celestial Guards** stood in attendance. Below is a crag called **Daoist’s Rock**.\n\n**Grand Preceptor Peak, Grand Tutor Peak, Grand Guardian Peak**\nThree peaks east of the **Great Summit**, also called **Three Lords Mountain**. Before **Purple Empyrean Palace**, they stand like jade chimes in ordered ranks. Yellow cranes and gibbons leap and clamber, making approach impossible. Even the **Witch Gorge** and **Flowery Summit** seem unworthy to stand beside them. In all the world, no peaks surpass these in sheer grandeur. Below is a crag called **Three Lords Rock**. The mountains are lofty, the clouds deep; sunlight scarcely lingers here. Only those who have transcended grain may dwell in such a place.\n\n**First Elder Peak, True Elder Peak, August Elder Peak, Dark Elder Peak, Primordial Elder Peak**\nFive peaks southeast of the **Great Summit**, also called **Five Elders Peak**. The five peaks stand in formation, resembling an inkstone rest. When the **Dark Emperor** ascended, the Five Elders received the decree to prepare the way and halted their chariot here, where the earth spirits leapt forth in manifestation. Below lie **Ascending Truth Crag** and **White Cloud Gorge**. Its waters encircle the cliffs in cascading torrents, flowing out through **Nine Crossings Gorge**.\n\n**Immortal Peak, Recluse Peak**\nTwo peaks south of the **Great Summit**. The great ridge and towering mountains allow only distant admiration. Below lies **Recluse Crag**. Divine immortals often appear here—some seen with disheveled robes and unbound hair, others in strange and wondrous forms, their hands and feet bearing claws five to seven inches long. Some sit upon boulders, others bathe along the stream’s edge; their true qi presses upon one, making approach impossible. In a moment of inattention, they vanish without a trace.\n\n**Great Brightness Peak**\nWest of the **Great Summit**. Several peaks rise in solemn array, bathed in full yang brightness. Bamboo, trees, springs, and stones flourish in dense shade, where the mountains run deep and the paths are secluded, the land fertile and rich. Those who study the Dao often choose to dwell here. Within stands a hermitage called **Queen Mother’s Palace**. Several great pines stand in ranks around it. Elders of old say that the **Holy Mother, the Victorious and Good Empress**, once sought the **Dark Emperor** here, and the place was later named in her honor.\n\n**Central Nose Peak, Cloud-Gathering Peak, Hand-Clutching Peak, Bamboo Grove Peak, Tooth-Gnashing Peak**\nFive peaks southeast of the **Great Summit**. A ridge flies southward, the five peaks spreading out across towering ridges and deep ravines for several miles. A mountain path called **Magistrate’s Mute** lies here, the route between **Jun** and **Fang**; leeches infest the way, making it impossible to set foot. Below **Cloud-Gathering Peak** is a crag called **Cloud-Assembling**. Serpents and tigers dwell here—no place for cultivation.\n\n**Turtle Gate Peak**\nSoutheast of the **Great Summit**. Cloud-wreathed ridges stretch in layers, strange rocks standing firm. Mist and miasma rise like morning steam. Unless one is a woodsman or firewood gatherer, what business has one here?\n\n**Nine Ministers Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. The peaks are graceful and verdant, their forms rare and wondrous. Pines, bamboo, flowers, and herbs are arranged within and without. Tradition holds this as the place where the **Celestial Perfected** assess blessings. Below is a crag of the same name. Long ago, a Daoist wanderer lodged by the crag and heard the sounds of golden bells and jade chimes in the night. Below lies a deep pool, unreachable by any.\n\n**Subduing Demons Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. It receives the vein of the **Arriving Dragon**, its form mighty and imposing, its forests tall and proud. Below lie the **Great** and **Lesser Ghost Valleys**, where roaring torrents spray like snow, splitting the rocks to let the waters flow. Sacred turtles and giant serpents are often seen moving up and down. Tradition holds this as the place where the **Dark Emperor** subdued demons and awaited the imperial command in the **Hall of Obstructing Evil**.\n\n**Jade Laughing Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. Locals call it **Stone Man Mountain**, for its peaks resemble human forms. To the north is **Parrot-Crest Ridge**. The peaks split the earth as they rise, like fresh bamboo yet to be trimmed. Beyond the southern gorge lies the border of **Fang Prefecture**, with a mountain path leading through. Below is **Azure Peak Crag**, where the land is secluded and the soil fertile—also a place fit for self-cultivation.\n\n**Pillar of Integrity Peak, Great Leveler Peak**\nTwo peaks southwest of the **Great Summit**. They rival the **Celestial Pillar** and **Song Peak** in grandeur, their ridges and hills level as a sash. One peak arches back like a **pillar of jade**, the other lies flat as a palm holding up the sky—both domains where fierce beasts dwell.\n\n**Needle-Holding Peak**\nWest of the **Great Summit**. Though small in girth, it rises steeply, its sharp summit commanding reverence. Legend holds that after the **Dark Emperor** attained sudden enlightenment, the **Primordial Lady** hurled an iron pestle here.\n\n**Cinnabar Turtle Peak**\nWest of the **Great Summit**. The mountain resembles a crescent moon in form. At dawn and dusk, wisps of azure mist and violet haze gather—locals call this the **\"Cinnabar Turtle’s Frozen Breath.\"** Its heights remain beyond reach.\n\n**Celestial Steed Peak**\nOne hundred *li* west of the **Great Summit**, also called **Neighing Horse Mountain** or **Westward Gaze Peak**, it marks the true vein of the **Wudang**’s incoming range. According to the *Illustrated Records*: The mountain originates in the *Qian-Dui* direction, traversing the lands of **Guan, Long, Jin, and Fang**, winding ten thousand *li* to arrive here. Situated along the **Jun-Fang** official road, it bears a **Dragon Well** of unfathomable depth, its waters clear and sweet. Merchants and travelers invariably draw from it for cooking. The **Western Gorge** rises from a cliff below, known as **Celestial Steed Crag**. Many wayfarers lodge within—commonly called the **\"Cliff Dwelling.\"**\n\n**Parrot-Cry Peak, Parrot-Cage Peak**\nTwo peaks west of the **Great Summit**, north of **Celestial Steed Peak**, along the **Jun-Fang** official road. Locals call the mountains **Great Parrot-Cry** and **Lesser Parrot-Cry**. In ancient times, the **Golden Parrot Gorge** met the waters of the **Western Gorge** here, its paths twisting like a sheep’s intestines. When summer and autumn floods surge, the torrents rage with fury. \"Drowning hills and swelling mounds,\" travelers may wait a month without crossing. The saying goes: *\"Once atop Neighing Horse Mountain, forty-nine fords stay ever wet.\"* This refers to these waters. Tradition claims that long ago, a **cinnabar phoenix** alighted on the summit, its cries echoing above and below. Unrecognized by the people, they called it the **\"Celestial Parrot.\"** When it later perched on the neighboring peak, the name **\"Cage\"** was given—how vulgar!\n\n**Brow-Ridge Peak**\nWest of **Five Dragons Summit**. The path from **Fangling** ascends here, rising and falling in undulating turns, winding and coiling for over thirty *li* before reaching **Five Dragons Palace**. Twin gorges flank its sides, while ranks of mountains rise in jagged array. Black tigers howl in the wind. Those of stubborn and fierce disposition, though they may attempt the climb, are invariably driven away.\n\n**Returning Court Peak**\nAlso called **Outer Court Mountain**. Along the **Jun-Fang** official road, seventy peaks all pay homage to the **Celestial Pillar**, yet this lone mountain drifts apart, as if dwelling beyond. It is said that departure holds the principle of return—hence its name. To the north, the land levels into open fields, mulberry and hemp blanketing the countryside, where the cries of parrots and the barking of dogs mingle. From the mountain’s southern slope, the terrain grows rugged for a hundred *li*, stretching all the way to **Fang Prefecture**.\n\nTo the east lies **Dragon’s Gargle**, where the people often make offerings in prayer.\n\n**Incense Burner Peak** stands northeast of the **Great Summit** and south of **Immortal’s Pass**. Its jagged crags tumble in profusion, while drifting mists gather and disperse, assuming a thousand forms in ten thousand postures. Below flows the **Purple Cloud Gorge**, and following its course leads to the mountain path.\n\n**Nine Bends Peak**, also called **Immortal’s Pass**, rises east of the **Great Summit**. It marks the main route to **Purple Cloud Palace**, its sheer cliffs towering into the azure, the stone path winding and twisting as white clouds come and go. Travelers who reach this point find all cares dissolved in an instant.\n\n**Unfurled Banner Peak** stands east of the **Great Summit**, behind **Purple Cloud Palace**. A single pillar props up the heavens, its thousand-*ren* face sheared smooth, its eastern flank draped in emerald curtains like a banner unfurled in the sky, perfectly evoking the form of a black standard. Mists and mountain vapors drift across it, as if this were the gateway to the **Purple Court of the Immortals**. Within lie the **Jade Clarity**, **Great Clarity**, and **Crown Prince** grottoes—all places where the **Mysterious Emperor** once rested. The rocks here gleam with the hues of gold and silver.\n\n**Golden Lock Peak** rises north of **Unfurled Banner Peak**. Its terrain resembles a pavilion, its summit leaning against the vault of heaven, its base overlooking a green ravine. The stones stand like blades and swords, the vines stretch like nets, exuding an aura so forbidding one dare not approach. **Ox-Dragging Pass** lies to its west. Legend holds that the **Mysterious Emperor** subdued and captured demons here, executing their ringleaders. Strange shapes—some like bears, some like monkeys—were all bound beneath the peak. He swore an oath: *\"Only when the waters of this mountain’s ravine run dry shall you be set free.\"*\n\nThe stone cliff here marks its gate.\n\n**Green Ram Peak** lies north of **Golden Lock Peak**. Towering and precipitous, its forests flourish in luxuriant growth. Legend holds that the **Most High** often roamed here in a chariot drawn by a green ram. Below flows a clear spring, named **Green Ram Ravine**.\n\n**Seven Li Peak** stands north of **Hidden Immortal Crag**, beneath **Bamboo Pass**. A single path stretches seven *li*, winding ninety turns in a hundred paces, crossing ridges and scaling heights—this is the **Five Li of Heaven-Piercing Ascent**. Below lies **Five Dragons Reception Hermitage**, where moss carpets the steps, mountain osmanthus scatters its fragrance, cranes alight to welcome guests, and tea is brewed with millet, all in the manner of immortals’ tales.\n\n**Striking Horse Peak** rises northwest of the hermitage, directly along the main ascent. A solitary peak juts upward—this is **Heavenly Steed Terrace**. Tradition says that the **Mysterious Emperor** once revealed his true form, mounted upon a white celestial horse, standing there. Below stands a hall, the shrine of **Black Tiger Great Spirit**.\n\n**Gathering Immortals Peak** lies along the mountain’s main path. Immortal trees pave the ground, and oak trees canopy the sky. In the *Duanping* era of the Song, the mountain’s overseer, Cao Guanmiao, welcomed the **Three Mao Perfected Lords** here, yet failed to recognize them—this story is recorded in their hagiography. Today, a shrine stands here, called the **Earth Altar of Gathering Immortals**.\n\n**Mao’s Mound Peak** is one of the mountain’s ridges, the first gate of this blessed land. Above stands a shrine to the **Divine Officer Guardian of the Earth**, whose numinous manifestations surpass all others. Those who consume meat or behave irreverently while ascending the mountain face swift retribution: at best, serpents and tigers drive them away; at worst, they are seized beneath the trees, bound as if in fetters. Judging from this, the divine beings guard the mountain thus—how much greater, then, must be the numinous responses for those who dwell here or make the ascent.\n\n*Compendium of the Blessed Land of Wudang, Upper Scroll—Concluded*\n*Compendium of the Blessed Land of Wudang, Middle Scroll*\n\n**The Thirty-Six Crags**\n\n**Purple Cloud Crag**, also called **Southern Crag** or **Solitary Yang Crag**, lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Robing Terrace, west of the Reverent Fire Crag, and south of the Immortal Song Crag. Facing the sun’s void and stillness, it leans against the cloudy heavens above and overlooks Tiger Gorge below. Lofty, bright, and expansive, its stones gleam like jade, naturally forming shapes of simurghs and phoenixes. Amid the pines’ wind through ten thousand ravines and the vast qi of a thousand cliffs, this is where the **Dark Emperor** refined his truth—where immortals wander and rest. Temples stand in ranks, housing the bronze statue of the **Blessed Sage**. In the *yichou* year of the Yuan Zhen era, the fangshi **Wang Daoyi** and **Mi Daoxing** rallied the faithful to cast it in Luling. The former **Academician of the Grand College**, Master **Liu Chenweng of Xuxi**, bowed and inscribed:\n\n*\"Before Heaven and Earth—lead in water.*\n*Smelted firm, the numinous wind and mist.*\n*Born the blue lotus;*\n*Sword coiled, altar wreathed.*\n*Survey the great kalpa—tortoise and serpent entwined.*\n*As kalpas turn, the heavens soar.*\n*Mysterious, mysterious, boundless—*\n*Ten thousand, ten thousand years.\"*\n\nThe true countenance was painted and sculpted. In the *jiashen* year of the Zhiyuan era, **Zhang Shouqing**, the crag’s resident, undertook great renovations. Stone paths were laid, pools filled with water, and the site named **Great Harmony Purple Cloud**. Temples arrayed across the crag, where morning bells and evening lamps resound, shaking the mountains and valleys—truly a realm beyond the mundane. At its heart lies a spring called **Sweet Dew**, its water glistening like pearls, sweet and crystalline. Recluses and enlightened scholars often dwell here—this is the first of the thirty-six crags.\n\nA hundred paces west along the ridge, a stone juts from a sheer cliff ten thousand *ren* high, called **Trial Heart Stone**. None reach it without trembling. Ten paces further stands the **Dark Emperor’s Robing Terrace**, where he exchanged his pine-and-moss robes for the bestowed crown and mantle. Below the terrace, a suspended stone chamber marks the **Crag of Gratitude to Heaven**, where he cultivated and refined. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan era, **Lu Dayou**, the **Cave Cloud Daoist**, renowned for his Way, revived the incense and offerings, receiving alms and veneration equal to the **Five Dragons** and **Purple Cloud** palaces.\n\n**Hidden Immortal Crag**, also called **Yin Immortal Crag** or **Northern Crag**, rises above Bamboo Pass. Towering into the clouds and mist, it overlooks the Han River, its stones like jade walls, revealing rare and wondrous forms. The ancient immortals **Yin Xi** and **Yin Gui** dwelled here, and many immortals of later ages refined the Great Elixir in this place. The alchemical chamber and furnace remain. In recent times, **Tian Suoyi** attained the Dao here in reclusion. Beneath a great tree to the crag’s right, a stone Go board lies flat, with stone seats arrayed on either side. Tradition holds this was where **Yin Gui** played Go. In the stillness of night, one often hears the ethereal chants and jade chimes of immortals, and glimpses their comings and goings, guarded by bears and tigers. *Recorded in the* **Gazetteer of Lands and Immortals**.\n\n**Immortal Song Crag** lies north of the Great Summit, facing the Gate of Heaven. The mountain’s meeting ground is level, and a spring flows from the crag with the sound of clashing gold and rinsing jade. Many immortals dwell here. Travelers who reach this place find not a trace of worldly dust. The spring is called **Hundred Flowers**; in ancient times, **Tao You’an** attained the Dao here.\n\n**Outer Dragon Crag** stands on **Pine-Moss Peak**, facing northeast. Open and lofty, it is unmatched in purity. On frosty moonlit nights, the cries of cranes and gibbons are exquisitely serene. Clouds and mist evoke the aura of Nanyang. **Yin Xi Crag**, also called **Immortal Crag**, has **Exhibition Banner Peak** to its north. Verdant peaks rise like brushes, and jade streams play like zithers. Here, **Master Wen Shi** once secluded himself. Below lies a gorge called **Ox Ford**. The **Most High** once transformed and visited **Xi**, and his blue ox remained outside—hence the name.\n\n**Heavenly Void Crag**, also called **Master Yu’s Crag**, lies east of **Immortal Pass** and above **Nine Waves Gorge**. A stone wall hangs midair, the crag soaring a hundred *ren* high. The gorge’s roar shakes like thunder, and wind and mist fill ten thousand ravines. Long ago, the recluse **Yu Huizhe** recited scriptures here, and an old man often came to listen. One day, the old man said: *\"I am a son of the Eastern Darkness, exiled here. My term is fulfilled, and I may return. I wish to offer my dwelling to you, noble one.\"* One night, thunder and rain reshaped the stone. In recent times, people fleeing war sought refuge here, but fire scorched the stone, and it became uninhabitable.\n\nThe affairs of **Five Dragons Crag** are recorded under **Five Dragons Peak**, **Jade Purity Crag**, and **Supreme Purity Crag**—originally called **Cultivation of the Dao Crag**. Long ago, **Huang Taiqing** attained the Dao here, and thus it was named. The affairs of **Crown Prince Crag** are recorded under **Unfurled Banner Peak**.\n\nThe affairs of **Empress Crag** are recorded under **Empress Peak**, **White Cloud Crag** under **White Cloud Peak**, **Daoist Crag** under **Robust Man Peak**, **Three Dukes Crag** under **Three Dukes Mountain**, **Cinnabar Crag** under **Seven Stars Peak**, **Heavenly Steed Crag** under **Heavenly Steed Peak**, **Hidden Cloud Crag** under **Golden Tripod Peak**, and **Recluse Crag** under **Recluse Peak**.\n\n**Mica Crag** and **Yang the Immortal’s Crag** lie two hundred paces east of **Five Dragons Temple**. The two crags stand facing each other, peach blossoms lining the path between, clouds for a canopy and the moon for a mat. They overlook clustered peaks, pines and bamboo intermingling in verdant hues, their beauty unchanging through the four seasons. Long ago, the recluse **Master Hua Yang** consumed pine needles here and lived over a hundred years. When visitors came to call, he would flee in haste. Once, when asked why he shunned company so, he replied: *\"The foul vapors of the mortal world offend my spirit—I cannot bear to sit.\"* Thereafter, none knew his whereabouts.\n\n**Shen the Immortal’s Crag** stands west of **Ascension Terrace**, facing **Peach Blossom Spring Grotto**. Its stone chambers lie in repose, while springs trickle in secluded clarity. Long ago, **Immortal Shen** attained the Dao here, and thus the crag was named after him.\n\n**Dripping Water Crag** lies south of **Immortal’s Song Crag**. The rock resembles a grand hall, its fissures releasing springs—hence its name.\n\n**Ever-Spring Crag** (see **Seven Stars Peak**). **Gathering Clouds Crag** (see **Cloud-Gathering Peak**). **Xie the Heaven-Earth Crag** (see **Purple Cloud Crag**). **Northern Dipper Crag** (see **Seven Stars Peak**).\n\n**Fire-Inspired Crag**, also called **Thunder Grotto**, lies north of **Purple Cloud Crag**. Its stones blaze like flames, its trees twist like dragon claws. Within lies a sacred pool whose waters heal illness; those who pray and drink find their prayers answered without fail. Yet those who steal its waters in secret suffer divine fire scorching their bodies, thunder and wind raging in fury. Within the grotto, the true form of **Fire-Inspired Spirit** appears—those who behold it tremble in awe. The true **Thunder Grotto**, where **Heavenly Lord Deng** cultivated the Dao, lies on **Stacked Characters Peak**, inaccessible to human tread.\n\n**Black Dragon Crag** stands south of **Nine-Turn Peak** above **Dragon Pool**. **White Dragon Crag** lies below **Ascension Terrace**, south of **Dragon Pool**. Both crags adjoin the **Dragon Chambers** and are unfit for habitation.\n\n**Black Tiger Crag** rises above **Black Tiger Gully**, amid vast forests and towering boulders—the lair of the black tiger.\n\n**Ascending Perfection Crag** (see **Five Elders Peak**). **Jade Peak Crag** (see **Laughing Jade Peak**).\n\n**Immortal Tortoise Crag** rests beneath **Golden Lock Peak**. The stone resembles a divine tortoise, exhaling mist and spouting clouds, its dwelling nestled within.\n\n**Thunder Crag**—where **Heavenly Lord Deng** practiced austerities (see **Stacked Characters Peak**).\n\n**Wind Crag** lies below the **Great Summit**, beside **Ten Thousand Tigers Gully**. Its stone caverns exhale gusts that shake the forests and valleys—none dare approach.\n\n---\n\n### **The Twenty-Four Gullies**\n\n**Great Green Sheep Gully**, also called **Green Sheep River**, flows north from the **Great Summit**, gathering all gullies before merging into the **Cao River**. **Dragon Chambers** and **Dragon Palaces** line its upper and lower reaches; in spring and summer, its waters surge, spraying snow and thundering like roaring dragons. At dusk, rainbows shimmer; at dawn, mists rise. Stone fish and golden carp dart through its depths, while divine beasts and hidden birds dwell here—this is the realm of immortals and celestial grottoes.\n\n**Ten Thousand Tigers Gully** lies north of the **Great Summit**. Wind and thunder rage like ten thousand roaring tigers before converging with **Green Sheep Gully**.\n\n**Ox-Cao Gully** rushes west from **Yin Xi Crag** into **Green Sheep Gully**.\n\n**Peach Blossom Spring Gully** rises from **Purple Canopy Peak**, flowing east from **Dragon Pool** into **Green Sheep Gully**.\n\n**Black Tiger Gully** and **Grindstone Gully** both originate from **Dragon Summit**, meeting at **White Dragon Pool**.\n\n**Lesser Green Sheep Gully** and **Yang Crane Gully** wind through forests from **Yang Crane Peak**, flowing east into **Green Sheep Gully**.\n\n**Golden Lock Gully**, **Flying Cloud Gully**, and **Waterfall Gully**—collectively called the **Three Gullies of the Water Curtain**—rise from the flanks of **Golden Lock** and **Green Sheep Peaks**, all flowing west into **Green Sheep Gully**.\n\n**Gathering Immortals Gully** lies north of **Five Dragons Summit**. The waters of all peaks converge here before flowing north to **Songkou**, merging with **Song Valley Gully**.\n\n**Song Valley Gully** begins east of **Plum Brook**. The waters of all mountains flow west into **Green Sheep Gully**, joining the **Zi River**.\n\n**Wudang Gully** lies east of the **Great Summit**. The waters of **Imperial Cliff** and its surrounding peaks flow north into **Purple Cloud Gully**.\n\n**Purple Cloud Gully** carries the waters of **Three Lords Mountain**, winding from the south of **Purple Cloud Palace** before turning north to merge with all gullies and enter **Nine-Turn Gully**.\n\n**Black Dragon Gully** gathers the waters of **Incense Burner Peak** and the two preceding gullies, cascading from **Dragon Pool** east into **Nine-Turn Gully**.\n\n**White Cloud Gully** flows from **Five Elders Peak**, joining **Nine-Turn Gully**.\n\n**Nine-Turn Gully** collects all gullies before spilling into **Plum Brook Gully**.\n\n**Plum Brook Gully** emerges from **Plum Brook Village**, becoming the **Miao River**.\n\n**West Gully** rises from **Horse-Neighing Mountain’s Dragon Well**, channeling all western mountain waters northward.\n\n**Golden Parrot Gully** gathers the waters of **Great and Lesser Parrot Peaks**, merging with **West Gully**.\n\n**Thunder Gully** carries the waters of **Thunder Grotto** on **Stacked Characters Peak**, flowing south into **Five Dragons Gully**.\n\n**Five Dragons Gully** collects the waters of **Crouching Dragon Peak** and its neighbors, exiting via **Thunder Gully** into **West Gully**, then joining **Green Sheep Gully** and **Plum Brook Gully** at **Songkou** to form the **Zi River**, which flows northeast into the **Han River**.\n\n**Ghost Valley Gully** rises south of the **Great Summit**, gathering the waters of all southern peaks before flowing east into **Twin Streams Gully**.\n\n**Twin Streams Gully** collects the waters of the **Great Summit’s** southeastern peaks, merging with **Ghost Valley Gully** before entering the **Lang River** northwest of the **Han River**.\n\n---\n\n### **Terraces, Pools, Pools, and Grottoes**\n\n**Ascension Terrace** stands a hundred paces southeast of **Five Dragons Palace**, facing the **Attire-Changing Terrace**. Pines and cypresses intertwine, mist and rosy clouds intertwine, and an ancient hall stands firm. From here, ten thousand ravines and a thousand cliffs lie in view. Those who ascend feel all worldly cares dissolve.\n\nAccording to the inscriptions on the *Illustrated Classic* stele, the **Dark Emperor** received the **Heavenly Mandate** here, and the **Five Dragons** bore him aloft to ascend. The earth transformed into gold and jade, and today the entire mountain glitters with **gold-star stones** and **silver-star stones**, though none compare to this site.\n\n**Attire-Changing Terrace**—where the **Dark Emperor** changed from pine-needle robes into celestial garments (see **Purple Cloud Crag**).\n\n**Scripture-Reciting Terrace**—where **Chen Tuan** recited the *Book of Changes* (see **Peach Blossom Peak**).\n\n**Immortal-Viewing Terrace** stands a hundred paces northeast of **Five Dragons Palace**, east of **Blessed Land Gate**. A solitary terrace rises, surrounded by towering pines, with a pavilion offering a lofty view of layered peaks. In the first year of the **Yuanyou** era, the monk **Liu** recorded its wonders.\n\n**Heavenly Steed Terrace**—where the **Dark Emperor** manifested his true form, standing astride a white celestial steed (see **Tethered Horse Peak**).\n\n**Heavenly Pool** lies atop the **Great Summit**. It is dedicated to the **Broad-Blessing Dragon King** (see **Heavenly Pillar Peak**).\n\n**Dragon Pool**—abode of the **Five Black Dragon Lords** (see **Five Dragons Peak**).\n\n**Sun-Moon Pools** lie south of the **Celestial Treasure Altar** behind **Five Dragons Palace**. The two pools adjoin each other; the **Moon Pool** is overgrown with creeping vines, while the **Sun Pool** spans over twenty *zhang* in circumference. It never dries in drought nor overflows in flood.\n\nThe waters shimmer in five hues, ever shifting in their colors. To the southwest, all is joined with the mountain’s stone; whenever frost descends in the crisp dawn, there sometimes rise white and black mists like clouds, lingering for a time before dispersing—those who witness this feel their hair stand on end and their bones grow cold.\n\nBefore the **Duanping** era, when the mountain gate flourished in full splendor, **Cao Shide**, the monastic overseer, began constructing a treasure repository south of the pool. As work commenced, he dreamed of immortals who spoke to him: *\"This place corresponds above to the Three Heavens and below to the Grotto Realms; here dwell the host of immortals, gods, and dragons. If you persist in moving earth and shifting timber, the divine spirits will find no peace—what then will you do?\"* Awakening, he recounted the dream to his fellow monks, and all found their visions in accord. Thus, the repository hall was built but left unused, and a placard was posted by the pool’s edge, inscribed: *\"The Grotto Heaven lies near—passersby, lower your voices.\"*\n\nIn the **Gengshen** year of the **Zhongtong** era, when **Sun Siju**, the Pacification Commissioner, led his followers to submit to the court, it was the seventh month. Soldiers came to the pool to wash their swords, and the dragon gods emerged, their scales and manes rising along their spines. The heavens darkened, and thunderous storms shook the earth.\n\nIn recent years, pilgrims journeying to the mountain have brought dogs and horses that drank from the pool by mistake—all perished at once. Such is the immediacy of its numinous response.\n\nThe Alchemy Pool and the Hermitage of Spontaneity lie paired fifty paces west of the Five Dragons Palace, ascending past the Well and Grip-the-Stars stars, nestled between two mountains. Pines and cedars twist and coil like dragons in disarray, yet though the three summer months swelter, no heat lingers here. Beneath the eastern eaves lies the Alchemy Pool, where a great stone in the water conceals a cavern—home to a dragon, often seen by visitors. Tigers, leopards, birds, and beasts frequent this place to drink.\n\nAccording to the prefectural map, this was the former site of Ma Mingsheng, later occupied by Chen Tuan. Here, Chen encountered the Five Black Dragon Lords, who bestowed upon him the art of sleep, granting him the marvel of foresight. The remnants of Mingsheng’s furnace, where he refined the Solar Spirit Elixir, remain—neither iron nor stone. Though Chen Tuan’s fame spread far, weary of constant visitors, he sought refuge at the Scripture-Recitation Terrace.\n\nThe Salt Pool marks where the Dark Emperor subdued demons, as recorded in the *Temple of the Protector Sage*. The Black Dragon Pool lies above the Immortal Pass, amid the waters of the Purple Cloud Gorge. Two towering stones stand within, their gap a mere thread above, widening below into a cavernous depth. The pool is unfathomable, and prayers for rain in times of drought are answered at once. A temple stands above it.\n\nThere are two White Dragon Pools: one below the Needle-Grinding Gorge, where a thousand-foot waterfall crashes down, and a temple nestles within the cliffs—prayers here are repeatedly answered; the other lies beneath the Ascension Terrace, its waters black and deep, clouds rising from its surface, instantly summoning rain. Few venture here.\n\nThe Thunder Grotto is where Deng Tianjun of the Fire Department cultivated the Dao, as noted at the Folding-Character Peak. The Peach-Blossom Grotto, within the Five Dragons, was where immortals tempered their swords, as recorded at Peach Source Peak. The Sweet Dew Spring lies at Purple Cloud Crag, as detailed in its own records.\n\nThe Dipper Spring sits beneath the Great Summit, south of the Stone Needle Peak. A spring emerges beneath a stone cliff, flanked by two stone wells. The *Illustrated Classic* states: though a thousand draw from it, it never runs dry; left undrawn, it never overflows—its waters correspond to the Dipper Star.\n\nThe Hundred-Flower Spring lies at Immortal Chant Crag, where the immortal Tao You’an attained the Dao, as recorded in its own records. The Dragon Well is at Heavenly Horse Peak, as noted beneath the peak. The Five Dragons Wells lie at the four corners of the Five Dragons Palace, with one well inside the Worship Hall—the traditional site for casting petitions. Today, it is sealed with stone. Its waters are sweet and pure, clear and bright; those who drink it claim it cures illness. Officials and Daoist abodes across the mountain, plagued by pestilence, find their afflictions vanish upon taking office here. Daoist companions draw its water to mix with medicine, healing all manner of ailments—such is the numinous power of the Dragon Well.\n\nThe Star Window is at White Cloud Peak, as recorded in the peak’s own records and the *Gazetteer of Lands*. Tiger Brook, also called the Ten-Thousand Tigers Gorge, is detailed in its own records. The Wind Cavern lies within the Ten-Thousand Tigers Gorge, as noted at Wind Crag. The origins and history of the temples and abbeys follow.\n\n**Records of the Five Dragons Numinous Response Abbey**\n\nWhen the Dark Emperor ascended to true reality, the Five Dragons bore his chariot aloft, and their former hermitage became a shrine for venerating the perfected. The *Survey of Scenic Lands* states: \"The Five Dragons Abbey is their place of seclusion.\"\n\nIn the ninth year of the Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song, Prefect Wang Dexian of Junzhou submitted a memorial and was granted an imperial plaque, bestowing the name \"Numinous Response Abbey.\" A stele remains to this day. In the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan reign of the Yuan, Zhang the Perfected, Grand Master of the Dark Teachings and Commander of Jiang-Huai, elevated its official rank.\n\nThe abbey lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Five Dragons Peak, south of the Hidden Immortal Crag, and west of the Green Ram Gorge. Tigers and dragons crouch in coiled majesty, while forests and ridges encircle it in homage. Five wells are arrayed in proper order, with two pools at their center. Its halls rise in towering splendor, and its ritual images stand in solemn ranks. The mountain thrusts forth like the pivot of the earth.\n\nThe central hall, resplendent with gold and azure, is dedicated to the sacred countenance of the Dark Heavenly Emperor. The Emperor is depicted embracing the Five Dragons, his brows like dragons, his eyes like phoenixes, his radiance like the sun and moon. His hair flows unbound, his feet are bare, and all is sculpted from rare incense and pure lacquer. Jade maidens and golden lads strike swords and bear seals, while two ministers in court robes stand in attendance. Below the courtyard, four great heavenly warriors wield halberds and banners, forming a protective escort. The four walls depict scenes of his birth and attainment of the Dao, while behind them rise the forms of a black tortoise and a giant serpent, their water and fire ascending and descending.\n\nAscending the steps, three halls stand in ordered ranks: the central one is the Hall of Illuminating Perfection, dedicated to the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother, the Primordial Lady; to the south is the Hall of the Cassia Register, enshrining the Primordial Emperor; to the north is the Penglai Hall, housing the Ten Perfected Masters. Above them stands the Numinous Response Ascending Clouds Tower. The remaining halls and courtyards are too numerous to record here.\n\nEach year on the third day of the third month and the ninth day of the ninth month, rites are conducted and offerings received. Pilgrims gather like spokes around a hub, their presence as pure and refreshing as this place is unmatched.\n\nIn the early Song, Chen Tuan resided here. After the southward crossing of the Shaoxing reign, Sun Yuanzheng, a Daoist from the Qingzhen Abbey on Mount Mao, established its foundations. When the Jin fell, Tang Shoucheng, the Gourd-and-Straw-Hat Master, restored its former glory. At the end of the Song, Wang Yining of the Chaoran Abbey in Jiangling oversaw it. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan reign, Wang Sizhen of the Quanzhen School revived its ancestral teachings. In the *bingxu* year, Ye Xizhen of Jianning assumed the post of Chief Supervisor. All these were pioneers who cleared the wilderness and laid its foundations, and thus they are recorded here.\n\n---\n\n**Purple Cloud Palace**\n\n\"Purple Cloud\" is another name for the Dark Heaven. The palace lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Unfurled Banner Peak, west of the Temple of Awesome Might, and south of the Crown Prince Crag. Before it stand the Three Lords—peaks like ten-thousand-*ren* jade bamboo leaning against the sky. Behind it rests the distant screen of the Seven Ridges, their dark folds resembling a coiled starry serpent. Pines and cedars stand tall, flowers and trees exude fragrance, halls rise in lofty grandeur, and corridors connect in orderly succession. The imperial visage is revered and solemn, the divine presence awe-inspiring, all modeled after the system of the Five Dragons Abbey. Yet the terrain here is open and expansive, not easily matched.\n\nThis is a place for immortals to refine their nature and cultivate their minds, a court for the state to pray for blessings. It was first built during the Xuanhe reign of the Song. The plaque with its imperial inscription was lost in the *jiawu* conflagration, carried away by its custodian on a journey south. Before the *gengshen* year, the prefectural seat was relocated here, and the people all settled in its vicinity. Later, when Pacification Commissioner Sun Siju led the masses to submit, for fifteen or sixteen years, no officials remained. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan reign, the mountain gates were reopened, and only the main hall remained, still worthy of veneration.\n\nIn the *dingchou* year, the Daoist Li Shouchong cleared the brambles at its front. In the *wuyin* year, the Khitan female official Xiao Shoutong built a hall at its rear. Rites and offerings are conducted here as at the Five Dragons Abbey.\n\n---\n\n**Temple of the Protective Sage**\n\nLocated fifty *li* southeast of the Great Summit, beside the Double Streams Gorge and north of the Salt Pond. To its left rises the Cinnabar Turtle Peak, layered in emerald; to its right crouches the Demon-Quelling Flying Void formation. Salt flowers gleam like snow, green bamboo sways in the wind, level fields spread like acres of golden clouds, and the numinous pond displays the auspicious hues of ten thousand years.\n\nFrom ancient times, it has been said that the Dark Emperor subdued and imprisoned a demonic essence beneath a stone here. A salty spring flows into the pond, commonly called the Ablution Pool. Though officials have forbidden its use, the spring’s source has gradually dried up, and thus a temple was built to suppress it.\n\nThe mountain’s form is steep and striking, narrow yet grand. Since suffering the calamities of war, only its old foundations remain. In the *wuyin* year of the Zhiyuan reign, the Daoist Zhao Shoujie, known as Azure Cloud, renowned for his mastery of the Dao, methods, and divination, led his disciples here. Within a few years, halls and ritual images were all restored. The surrounding mountains stand in ranks, a single plain stretches before it, and the provisions for the Daoist community—rare delicacies and fine foods—require no laborious transport. Rites and offerings are conducted anew, reviving its former glory.\n\n---\n\n**Palace of the Queen Mother**\n\nSituated among the southern peaks of the Great Summit. Clouds and mist intertwine in the heights and depths, forests and foothills rise and fall on either side. Far removed from the clamor of the world, its true traces are manifest. Here, the Sage Mother, the Victorious Empress Dowager, once sought the perfected, and thus it was named. Only those who have severed worldly attachments can dwell here.\n\n---\n\n**Cloud Mist Abbey**\n\nLocated to the right of the Fire-Suppressing Crag and south of the Unfurled Banner Peak. Dark ridges encircle it, clouds and mist unfurl and gather. In the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan reign, Perfected Master Zhang bestowed an abbey plaque and established its foundations.\n\n---\n\n**Divine Immortal Traces**\n\nThe **Grindstone Rock**\n\nRoughly one *li* north of the Five Dragons Abbey lies a ravine called the Grindstone Ravine. Its source descends from the Five Dragons Summit, where cascading springs and strange rocks meet towering trees and fragrant grasses. Along the ravine’s edge lies a spirit stone, its surface bearing the marks of grinding. From ancient times to the present, it has been said: When the Dark Emperor was refining his true nature, he grew weary after long effort, his progress seeming elusive. Wandering to the ravine below, he saw a divine woman grinding an iron pestle—this was the miraculous transformation of the Purple Primordial Sovereign. He asked, *“What are you grinding?”* She replied, *“I live in these mountains, and my mother-in-law lost her needle. I grind to replace it.”* He said, *“Turning an iron pestle into a needle is no easy task.”* She answered, *“It is only a matter of time and effort.”* The Dark Emperor was deeply enlightened. Thereafter, he redoubled his diligence in cultivation and ultimately attained the perfection of the celestial truth.\n\n**Sword-Testing Stone**\nWithin the Second Heavenly Gate of the Great Summit stands a stone split cleanly down the middle, the mark of a sword still vividly visible. Tradition holds this to be where the Dark Emperor tested his blade.\n\n**Immortal’s Chessboard Stone**\nThe place where the immortal Yin Gui played *weiqi*. Located at the Hidden Immortal Crag. (See account under that crag.)\n\n**Heart-Testing Stone**\nWest of the Purple Empyrean Crag. (See account under that crag.)\n\n**Three Heavenly Gates**\nAt the foot of the Great Summit, where Yin Xi once dwelled in truth. (See account under Heavenly Pillar Peak.)\n\n**Shrine of the Mulberry-Plum Immortal Elder**\nNorth of the Five Dragons Abbey and a hundred paces above the Grindstone Stone stand one or two withered trees, beside which rises a towering specimen called the Mulberry-Plum. The fruit of this tree resembles a plum in shape but bears the pit of a peach. Elders of old have passed down that when one of these trees withers, never exceeding the height of a man, another soon flourishes in its place—truly the fruit of immortals. Below stands a shrine dedicated to the Mulberry-Plum Immortal Elder. In the fourth and fifth months, when the fruit ripens, the tree’s height obscures its form. Those who pray to the Immortal Elder find the fruit falls of its own accord after a time. Eaten, its taste is tart yet sweet. Yet it is rarely obtained, serving as an omen of abundance or scarcity: in years of plenty, the fruit is plentiful; in lean years, it vanishes. Tradition holds that when the Dark Emperor gained enlightenment at the Grindstone, he plucked a plum blossom and thrust it into the wood, vowing, *“If I attain the Dao, you shall bear fruit.”* Thus, this numinous root and immortal trace remain unchanged through ten thousand ages.\n\n**Elixir-Calcining Furnace**\nThe place where the perfected ones refined the elixir. (See account under Hidden Immortal Crag.)\n\n**Natural Hermitage**\nWhere the immortal Ma Mingsheng refined the elixir. (See account under Elixir-Calcining Pool.)\n\n**Divine Birds and Sacred Beasts**\n\n**Black Tiger**\nA manifestation of the Northern Celestial One, the mountain’s guardian spirit. Its transformations are myriad: at times it assumes human form, clad in golden armor and a morning robe, bearing the aspect of a general; at others, it reveals its true shape—black-maned and dark-furred, resembling a lion. It may appear as large as a *li* or as small as a leopard. To encounter it is inauspicious, yet to dream of it brings fortune. Patrolling the corridors and halls by night, its divine traces endure; those of ill intent are instantly repelled. The *Elixir Canon* states: *\"The tiger is born toward the water.\"*\n\n**White Serpent**\nA remnant breath of winged transcendents, the numinous spirit of blessed lands. Four-nosed and eight-fanged, its manifestations defy prediction. It coils upon boulders or by the banks of outer streams—now as vast as a ridgepole, now as slender as a finger’s tendon. Suddenly it appears in illusions upon stools, tables, or bedding, or pursues the wicked along roads. In dreams, its marvels are boundless, beyond brush or tongue to recount.\n\n**Spirit Crow**\nEndowed with the hue of the north, it serves as the numen of Wudang. Forewarning fortune or misfortune, its omens—whether gentle or stern—never fail to manifest. Several often roost upon the eaves of halls, and at dusk or dawn, they clamor and flutter within. Tradition holds this is the bird that heralds the dawn. Yet, indifferent to the distinction between self and other, they show no fear. At morning and evening offerings, they soar and wait for food; among them, one with a red beak brings good fortune to those who see it.\n\n**White Pheasant**\nResembling a pheasant but with a tail four or five *chi* long, its crest is vermilion and its spurs iron-black, its plumage dark below and pale above. It calls to its kin among the verdant pines and emerald bamboos—truly a transcendent fowl. Yet it refuses captivity, choosing death over confinement.\n\n**Brocarded Pheasant**\nIts colors span all five hues, its feathers attuned to the four seasons. When it preens its wings and combs its plumes, circling cliffs or resting by bamboo, it commands reverence and affection. Often it wanders near courtyards, drinking and pecking at will.\n\n**Flying Squirrel**\nResembling a squirrel but elongated, with a blue tail and short neck, it leaps through trees with the agility of a gibbon’s swing. The people call it the \"immortal mouse.\"\n\n**My Master Bird**\nClad in brown plumage with a golden beak, its head is green and its feet crimson. On clear autumn nights, from the heights of lofty peaks and the depths of forests, it cries: *\"My master!\"*—throughout the night without cease. Tradition says that when the Dark Emperor ascended, the fragrant chambers stood empty, and the mountain birds mourned without end.\n\n**Half-Music**\nShaped like a yellow bunting, they gather in flocks of dozens. Their songs align with the *gong* and *shang* tones, evoking the rhythm of zither music and chanting. Tradition holds that when the Dark Emperor dwelled in truth, the earth spirits presented this auspicious sign, which is still seen from time to time.\n\n**Marvelous Herbs and Sacred Trees**\n\n**Ten-Thousand-Year Pine**\nAn auspicious herb of blessed lands, no taller than five *cun*, its color a deep green, its roots and leaves perfectly proportioned. It grows in the crevices of sheer cliffs and precipices, and is gathered by scaling the rock face. Those who obtain it may plant it in moist soil, and it will revive at once. Pressed and stored in bamboo tubes, it revives as before. If touched by oily hands, it withers and yellows by day’s end, as though afflicted by malevolent spirits. Planted before the divine altar, it drives away evil influences. Though found in famous mountains of the Jiangnan region, none are as numinous as those of this mountain.\n\n**Thousand-Year Mugwort**\nThe Dark Emperor preserved this to succor the people of the four directions. Its leaves resemble chrysanthemum, its roots those of the thoroughwort, and its stems those of the woody aster. In autumn’s clarity, its leaves bear green pearls like cinnabar. Gathered at the height of summer, it cures depletion in men and blood-qi ailments in women.\n\n**Canopy Plum**\n(See account under *Canopy Plum Branch.*)\n\n**Hui Orchid**\nBorn among cliffside rocks, its subtle fragrance drifts on gentle spring winds, a pure and secluded scent.\n\n**Kudzu Essence**\nAn auspicious omen of the earth, the essence of kudzu. When autumn dew hovers in the air, it rises like lingzhi from the ground—crimson and crisp, its flavor bittersweet. It cures ailments caused by alcohol excess.\n\n**Pine Lichen**\nThe immortal robe of the Dark Emperor, sacred descendant of the Blessed Court. It grows upon ancient trees of lofty peaks, some over a *zhang* in length. It heals stubborn sores from snakebites, tiger wounds, scalds, and burns. Chew the lichen, swallow its juice, and apply the dregs to the wound—recovery is immediate. Though found on other mountains, none are known to cure illness.\n\n**Heavenly Flower**\nCrimson and elegant, each bloom bears threads over a *chi* long. In late autumn, they bloom in profusion, secluded and lovely. When the Dark Emperor ascended to immortality, he scattered them across the cliffs and valleys, and to this day, his immortal descendants propagate them endlessly.\n\n**Cloud Bamboo**\nA numinous marvel of the earth, congealed within bamboo. Its purple sheen and dark veins astonish all who see it. Amid dense forests, one or two may be glimpsed.\n\n**Shaluo Tree**\nIts leaves never wither, its trunk towering and lofty. Its fruit resembles large chestnuts, growing in the shaded depths of great ravines and mountains, evoking the vast canopy of the Moon Palace.\n\n**Fangqian Tree**\nIts leaves are verdant and graceful, its trunk massive and tall. Its roots and branches naturally intertwine with vines in a manner unmatched by even the finest paintings. Two grow on Wudang: one on the Great Summit, the other by the stream near the Five Dragons Reception Hermitage.\n\n**Stone Lampwick**\nBorn in the earth of Wudang Mountain, gray and straight, resembling weathered stone. Soaked in oil, it burns with radiant clarity.\n\n**Gold-Star Stone and Silver-Star Stone**\nWhere the Dark Emperor ascended, the earth transformed into these. They cover the mountains, curing childhood convulsions and lameness. Though used everywhere, their nature is cold.\n\nMountain delicacies and wild greens—pine mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, orange broth, wood-infused decoctions, honeyed peony tea, chestnut rice, acorn cakes—each has its own source. As for paper cloaks and felt blankets, they suffice to ward off the cold; pine-oil lamps and birch torches, to extend the day.\n\nA poem says:\n*Mountain-field millet rice,*\n*Wild greens, pale and tender.*\n*Such flavors are apart—*\n*Only the self may know.*\n\nSuch is the sustenance the Dark Emperor provides his followers. Unless one sees through worldly vanity, how can one laugh freely beyond its bounds? These words are respectfully recorded for those of like mind.\n\n*Wudang Blessed Realm: Compendium of Perfected Truth, Middle Scroll—Concluded*\n*Wudang Blessed Realm: Compendium of Perfected Truth, Final Scroll*\n\nThe Divine Titles of the Heaven-Sealed Dark Emperor, as Recorded in the *Biographies of Immortals*\n\n**Divine Titles:**\nMarshal and Heaven-Pacifying Great General of the Dark Warrior, Chief Administrator of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Wandering Patrol, Grand Commander of the Left Celestial North Pole and Right Enclosure of the Three Realms, Judge of Divine, Immortal, Ghost, and Spirit Affairs in the Right Victory Prefecture of the Dark Capital, Director of the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and Relocation, Purple Sovereign of the Heaven of the One Celestial Day, Preceptor of the Jade Void, and Dark Heaven Thearch.\n\n**Song-Dynasty Bestowed Titles:**\nTrue Warrior of the North Pole, Heaven-Pacifying, Protective, Holy, Assisting, Compliant, Numinous, Responsive, Blessed, Virtuous, Benevolent, Salvific, Upright, Ardent, Harmonious, and Transformative Lord—originally named the Dark Warrior, but during the Song Dynasty, the name was altered to \"True Warrior\" to avoid taboo.\n\n**The Kingdom of Serene Joy, as Recorded in the Biographies:**\nIt lies beneath the Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent.\n\nThe *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure* states: The Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent is the northern heaven, one of the Four Peoples’ Heavens, situated above the Formless Realm. Its color is red, its aspect that of the Great Void, its palace the Numinous Treasure. Below, it corresponds to the constellation Lou in the western quadrant.\n\nThe *Illustrated Records of Wudang* further notes: The Five Dragon Peaks—one summit aligns with the Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent, where the Five Black Dragon Lords of the North reside.\n\nThirty *li* south of present-day Junzhou, there is a village called Le Du. Tradition holds that this is the ancient and eternal Land of Joy. At the foot of the eastern mountains of the village lie several ancient tombs. Elders pass down that these are the burial mounds of the kings of Serene Joy.\n\nThe *Records of Local Customs* states: In ancient times, Junzhou was known as the Land of Elaphures, where the people were simple and rustic, serene, joyful, and virtuous. Though likened to deer, they dwelt in peace.\n\nThe *Biographies of Immortals* recount: The Yellow Thearch was born in the Land of Youxiong, the Red Thearch in the Land of the Li Mountain Clan, and the Dark Thearch in the present Land of Joy. Given the Dark Thearch’s divine merit and sagely virtue, by which all things are nourished, moistened, and brought to life, it was deemed unfitting to retain the name \"Land of Elaphures.\" Instead, for its people’s serenity, joy, and goodness, it was renamed Serene Joy—thus is the matter made clear.\n\nObserving the customs of Junzhou, the waters of Taihe Bay wind in a hundred bends, forming a grotto-heaven of immortals. Cross-referencing ancient histories and immortal biographies, there is no doubt that the Kingdom of Serene Joy is none other than Junzhou.\n\n**The Divine Lineage:**\nThe *Canon of the Great Mystery* states: Heaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire. The Dark Emperor governs the spirit of Heaven One, hence the saying: \"Essence of the Water Position.\" His palace is called the Palace of Heaven One.\n\nThe *Biographies of Immortals* state: The essence of Heaven One is the Dark Emperor; the *qi* of Heaven One is the Water Star; the spirit of Heaven One is the Five Numinous Elder Lords; the manifestation of Heaven One corresponds to the constellations Xu and Wei, which is the Dark Warrior. Though his name is one, his forms are two—appearing as a dark tortoise and a crimson serpent. His essence and *qi* transform into rain and dew, rivers and lakes, seas and oceans. All things that fly or emit sound are transformations of Heaven One.\n\nWater and fire ascend and descend; tortoise and serpent unite in form. Thus are the myriad beings born, and the Dark Emperor is their sovereign—the Thearch of Heaven One.\n\n**Records of the Dark Emperor:**\nAccording to the *Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Abyss*: Before form and desire arose, the primordial state was indistinct, the Great Dao profound and obscure. One *qi* congealed the Three Treasures in the era before color and desire. The Five Kalpas intermingled in the flux of near and far. From this arose the Supreme, and from it, pattern emerged. Heavy and turbid sank; light and pure rose. Heaven and Earth took their places, each governing its domain.\n\nHeaven One generated water in the Kan Palace; spirit and transformation took form in the Kun Mound. Fire, wood, metal, and earth settled in their directions; red, blue, white, and yellow each assumed their celestial offices. Stars, constellations, sun, and moon unfolded the subtle principles of the cosmos, giving rise to forms. The exalted and profound deities embodied the love of life, adapting their teachings to the times. Vast and boundless, resplendent and luminous—so wondrous as to defy description, so profound as to elude comprehension.\n\nThe North Pole Protective and Holy Dark Warrior, Heaven of the One Celestial Day, Dark Heaven Thearch—Thearch of Heaven One, essence of the Water Position.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Great Ultimate* states: The essence of Heaven One is the Dark Emperor, who presides over the Kan direction, governing the myriad existences. The *qi* of Heaven One is the Water Star, assisting the Great Dao in its revolutions and transformations. The spirit of Heaven One is the Five Numinous Elder Lords, aiding the heavens in their pivot. The manifestation of Heaven One corresponds to the constellations Xu and Wei. Governing the north’s warp and weft, it is the Dark Warrior. Though his name is one, his forms are two—the dark tortoise and the crimson serpent. His essence and *qi* transform into rain and dew, rivers and lakes, seas and oceans. All things that fly or emit sound are transformations of Heaven One. When tortoise and serpent unite in form, Heaven and Earth take their places. Only the Dark Emperor, Thearch of Heaven One, can command and regulate them.\n\nEarth Two generates fire, presiding over the Li direction—this is the Red Thearch, whose image corresponds to the Vermilion Bird. Heaven Three generates wood, presiding over the east—this is the Blue Thearch, whose image corresponds to the Azure Dragon. Earth Four generates metal, presiding over the west—this is the White Thearch, whose image corresponds to the White Tiger. As for the number Heaven Five, the Yellow Thearch rules the center, above all spirits—this is not elaborated here.\n\nAfter the severing of the turtle and the snake, the Five Thearchs assisted the Great Dao. The Dark Emperor possesses the virtues of moistening and engendering, supreme softness and goodness, cleansing filth and dispelling miasma, and tranquil impartiality. His influence extends above to the layered heavens and below to the flying and burrowing creatures; none among the moving and growing fail to depend on him.\n\nFrom the Primordial Blackness of the Dark Origin, across kalpas, he descended, expounding scriptures to deliver humanity. Thus, the Thearch commanded the Dark Emperor to descend into the mortal realm: during the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he appeared as the Perfected of the Great Beginning; during the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of the Great Commencement; and during the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of the Great Simplicity. In those times, governance relied on knotted cords, and records cannot be verified.\n\nBy the dawn of the Kaihuang Kalpa, when the chaotic darkness dissipated and the true Dao was to prevail, the lower realm of the Southern Continent still languished in a state of raw flesh and blood, cave-dwelling and wilderness-roaming. The Thearch then commanded the Five Thearchs to descend in succession to the mortal world, transforming and nurturing the common people.\n\nThe Blue Thearch was the first to descend, alighting upon the earthly realm, where he was named Taihao and styled Fuxi. He established states and domains, observed celestial patterns to discern the laws, and thereby inaugurated the arts of astrology. He defined the proper relations between ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife. The Dragon Chart emerged from the River, the Tortoise Script appeared at the Luo; he drew the trigrams and created writing, spreading virtue and bestowing benevolence.\n\nThe Red Thearch was born in the state of Lishan, now known as Suizhou, where he became the Flame Thearch, styled Shennong. He cultivated the hundred grains, enabling the people to partake of grain-based sustenance. Yet the blazing command of his fire virtue gave rise to strife among the feudal lords and the tyranny of Chiyou—a consequence of the times. Since the Red Thearch governed by fire and the Dark Thearch by water, and water and fire bear signs of inseparability, the Dark Thearch descended thereafter, born in the state of Zhengle as Zhaoyao Tongguang, styled Yunqian.\n\nThe Yellow Thearch was born in the state of Youxiong—historically identified by Shi Huang as present-day Xinzheng in Henan—where he was named Xuanyuan and styled the Yellow Thearch. The White Thearch was also born within the Yellow Thearch’s palace, named Shaohao and styled Jintian.\n\nAll upheld the orthodox succession, nurturing the multitudes, quelling disorder, and recording their merits before returning to their celestial stations. The Dark Thearch, endowed with the essence of Heavenly Unity, devoted himself to tranquil response, disdaining the throne. His aspiration was to return to his root, so the Thearch, with the surplus qi of Heavenly Unity, descended into the palace of Jintian, where he was born as Zhuanxu, styled Gaoyang, to wield the tally and govern the masses in the Dark Thearch’s stead.\n\nUpon examination: the day the Dark Thearch descended into the state of Zhengle coincided with the final years of Shennong’s reign. The year was *guanfeng dunpang*, the cyclical year *jiawu*, in the month of *Guxin*, on the third day of the waxing moon, when the sun’s chariot stood at the celestial meridian at noon. He embodied the yang essence of Heavenly Unity, conceived through divine transformation in the celestial region of the *Yi*, *Han*, and *Lou* constellations, beneath the *Longbian Fandutian*. After gestating for fourteen months in the womb of Lady Shansheng of the state of Jingle, he emerged from his mother’s left side at birth. At the moment of his birth, auspicious clouds and rare fragrances manifested—omens too wondrous to recount.\n\nFrom infancy, he was divinely gifted. By the age of seven, he could peruse astronomical texts and written records, comprehending them at a glance. He devoted himself to the supreme Dao, aspiring to serve the Thearch and bring universal blessings to the people. Seeking seclusion in the hidden valleys to refine his primordial essence, he was moved by the response of the Boundless Purple Prime Lady, who bestowed upon him the highest Dao.\n\nThe Prime Lady pointed to Mount Taihe and declared: “This mountain’s veins rise from *Qian* and *Dui*, winding for fifty thousand li. Its waters flow from the *Zhen* Palace, and its earth corresponds to the *Yi* and *Ji* constellations. It manifests the heavens of *Xiandingji Feng* and *Tai’an Huangya*. You may dwell here, for it accords with the Great Harmony. Ascend and return to your station, assisting the Great Dao, and stand peerless with heaven, earth, sun, and moon.” Having spoken, she ascended upon the clouds and departed.\n\nAt fifteen, he took leave of his parents. Though his father could not restrain his resolve, he entered the mountain, embracing emptiness and the Mysterious Unity, silently communing with the myriad perfected beings. Standing nine feet tall, his face was round as the full moon, his brows arched like dragons, his eyes bright as phoenixes. His hair was bound in a topknot, his beard fine; his countenance was as pure as ice. Clad in garments of pine and vine, his hair unbound and feet bare, he cultivated his true nature for forty-two years, attaining the supreme Dao.\n\nAt that time, Xuanyuan the Yellow Thearch ruled and governed the people. In the year *gengyin*, on the ninth day of the ninth month at dawn, the four qi were luminous and clear. Phoenixes and cranes, celestial blossoms swirling in flight, filled the air, while the forests and peaks resounded with harmony. Spontaneous strains of *buxu* immortal music arose, and the earth transformed into hues of gold and jade. The Dark Thearch stood with hands clasped upon the terrace. In an instant, a host of immortals, mounted escorts, chariots, and banners descended beside the terrace—an assembly beyond mortal perception.\n\nThe Five Perfected presented the *Tai Xuan* Jade Register, declaring: “By the Thearch’s command, we summon you to ascend.” The Dark Thearch reverently bowed. The edict proclaimed:\n\n*“By imperial decree: The divine youth of the state of Jingle, the Dark Thearch, whose name embodies the transformation of the Mysterious Origin and the honor of Heavenly Unity, has fulfilled his merit and perfected the Dao. Ascend to the Golden Portal. You are hereby appointed Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, Judge of the Bureau of Primordial Harmony, and Inspector of Transitions. Bestowed upon you are: the Nine-Virtue Crescent Moon Golden Dawn Jade Crown, the Jade Hairpin of Qionghua, the Jasper Jade Scepter, the Purple Mist Flying Cloud Gold Radiance Robe, the Vermilion Skirt of Feathered Splendor, the Seven-Treasure Gossamer Garment, the Crimson Shoes of Primordial Light, the Sacred Seal, the Dragon Sword, the Feathered Canopy, the Jade Wheel, the Nine-Light Nine-Node Staff, the Ten Mystic Tassels, the Eight Phoenixes and Nine Phoenixes, the Heavenly Soldiers and Jade Maidens, and a retinue of ten thousand chariots. Proceed to the imperial court.”*\n\nThe edict was received and obeyed. The Dark Thearch bowed to the Thearch’s command.\n\nThe Five Perfected advanced and declared, “We are commanded to open the way for you.”\n\nOne Perfected said, “I am your other self, the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder of the Black Knot Spirit Tassel. Though you did not ascend to the royal throne, your resolve lay in returning to the origin—this is truly worthy of praise. Your parents in the mundane world have already attained the rank of Perfected Immortals.”\n\nAt that time, the Five Black Dragon Lords lifted you upward. Arriving at the summit of Purple Empyrean Peak, you doffed your garments of pine and mistletoe and donned the bestowed crown and robes. Soaring through the void above the great summit, you mounted a cinnabar carriage drawn by green chariots, borne aloft by the Five Dragons. Ascending through the celestial clouds, you personally attended the audience of the Supreme Thearch and assumed your office at the palace gate.\n\nLater, the name *Taihe* was changed to *Wudang Mountain*.\n\nBy the end of the *Kaihuang* kalpa, the living beings of the lower world, basking in the prosperity of peace, grew arrogant and extravagant, deceitful and insolent, abandoning substance for vanity. The kalpa’s reckoning approached, and tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials, along with demons and malevolent spirits, mingled between the realms of yin and yang. During the reign of King Zhou of Shang, cruelty and oppression ran rampant. The hordes of the Six Heavens’ demons manifested in various forms, omens and portents arose in succession, and humans and ghosts became indistinguishable. Malice and venom coiled together, harming the common people.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Supreme Thearch was expounding the Dao in the Hall of the Eight Effulgences within the Upper Prime Palace of the Heavenly Palace. The noxious miasma of black poison and bloody pollution surged upward to the Heavenly Gate. The Wondrous Conduct Perfected One knelt and implored the Thearch’s majestic radiance to personally descend and eradicate them.\n\nThe Supreme Thearch proclaimed to the August Heavenly Thearch, rectifying the celestial reckoning: the divine spirit of *Tianyi* of the kalpa would descend and be born in the land of the Ji clan in the Western Regions, named *Fa*, to become King Wu of Zhou and bring order to the world. As the essence of *Tianyi*, the Dark Thearch commanded the gods of *Ding*, *Jia*, wind, rain, water, and fire, all subject to his governance, capable of sweeping away defilement and impurity.\n\nThe Jade Lads of the Right Attendants were dispatched bearing talismans to summon the Dark Thearch. Upon receiving the decree, he ascended to attend the celestial audience and reverently accepted the Thearch’s command. He assembled the true forms of *Kan* and *Li*—the Azure Tortoise and the Mighty Serpent—along with the *Ding*, *Jia*, Five Thunder Divine Soldiers, three hundred thousand spirit generals, the Great Rainbow, lions, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts. Together, they descended to the lower world to carry out the celestial punitive expedition.\n\nAddressing the assembled hosts, he declared: “Born of the Great Yin, the essence of the Water trigram, corresponding above to the constellations *Xu* and *Wei*, the union of tortoise and serpent in form. Within seven days, all demons and malevolent spirits under heaven shall be captured and severed.” The tally was recorded and presented, and the demons were bound and imprisoned in *Beideng*.\n\nHe then returned to the Pure Capital and ascended to the Golden Gate to attend the Thearch’s audience. The Supreme Thearch commended his efforts and commanded the August Heavenly Thearch to advance his immortal rank. The Proclamation was issued to the Celestial Scribe of the Dark Mystery, the Grand Cinnabar Perfected One of the Jade Florescence Academy, who was ordered to compile the Jade Register. The register stated:\n\n*“Of you, who embodies the auspiciousness of the Primal Qi of Chaos, whose Dao is complete and whose yang is revered, who governs the people with meticulous care, not a hairbreadth amiss—now, as the kalpa’s reckoning converges and good and evil intermingle, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings arise, harming the common people of the Nine Lands. Without true power, how could purity and tranquility be restored? Your virtue is profound, your merit lofty; words cannot suffice in praise. You shall return to your root and original position. If not for such illustrious titles, how could your virtue be manifested? The Golden Script is bestowed; do not decline with modesty. You are hereby advanced and enfeoffed as: Grand General of the Dark Warrior Who Guards Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, Grand Marshal of the Right Wall of the Northern Culmen of the Left Heaven, Supreme Commander of the Three Realms’ Affairs of Gods, Immortals, and Ghosts, and Judge of the Right Victory Bureau of the Dark Capital, Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly Unity. As before, you shall serve as Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, overseeing the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and the Office of Transitions. Upon receipt of this register, comply and act accordingly.”*\n\nThe Supreme Thearch commanded the Dark Thearch to resume his original form: hair unbound, feet bare, treading upon the tortoise and serpent, raising the black banner of the early dawn. Clad in armor and bell, he would eternally guard the *Kan* position. On every *Jiazi* and *Gengshen* day, and on the third, seventh, and fifteenth of each month, he would descend to the mortal realm to inspect the good and evil, cultivation and transgressions of humanity, universally bestowing blessings upon the living, upholding and protecting the state and the altars of soil and grain.\n\nAfter receiving the decree, the Dark Thearch manifested in myriad transformations, becoming the Master of Teachings, delivering and saving the world of humans—boundless and immeasurable. In grotto-heavens and blessed lands, his numinous responses were manifest, too vast to be recorded in full. His grace and beneficence were vast, his wisdom and virtue immense. There was never a moment he did not think of sentient beings, never an instant he did not pity the lower world. He is the Great Compassionate Universal Savior, the Supreme Dharma King.\n\nFormerly, on the Heavenly Midst Festival of the second year of *Jiayou* in the Song dynasty, the myriad Perfected of the Three Realms ascended to attend the Primordial Supreme Thearch. The Three Treasures’ August Honored Ones and the August Heavenly Thearch presented the *Jade Calendar of Merit and Transgression of the Myriad Heavens’ Pristine Might*. The Celestial Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Golden Gate, the Great Spirit Marshal, the Perfected Lords of Life-Commanding, Name-Recording, Merit-Investigating, and Transgression-Protecting examined the Dark Thearch’s meritorious deeds. The Five Elders, the Eleven Luminaries, the Northern Dipper, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, from the most ancient times to the present, had governed yin and yang with such accomplishment that his merit equaled that of the Heavenly Worthy. The Three Officials and Four Saints, the Great Unity’s transformative influence, assisting heaven and pacifying earth—his merit was second only to the Heavenly Thearch.\n\nAt that time, the Three Bureaus of the Golden Gate reviewed and deliberated upon his sagely merit, confirming that it rivaled that of the Heavenly Lords of the various heavens. The Three Officials and Four Saints were all enfeoffed with the title of *Imperial Perfected*. On the Celestial Wax Festival, they were summoned to the Three Heavenly Gates, where their names were inscribed upon the Jade Casket. The Celestial Scribe of the Left Attendants of the Golden Gate, the Perfected Lord of Literary Arts of the Pure Mystery Academy, and the Celestial Scribe of the Right Attendants of the Golden Gate, the Perfected Lord of Sacred Texts of the Treasure Chapter Academy, were commanded to compose the Jade Registers. On the Upper Prime Festival, the Three Officials and Four Saints were enfeoffed with imperial titles. The registers were inscribed on jade tablets in golden script, the characters rendered in dragon and phoenix seal script, encased in cloud-brocade and precious satchels, protected by caskets of jasper and jade, secured with golden dragon locks.\n\nThe Jade Register of the Dark Thearch proclaimed:\n\n*“Oh, the majestic and most true, the august and great Dao! When the Grand Luminary first divided, the Mysterious Origin transformed and gave birth. The pivot of the myriad heavens, the revered of the Three Realms—his glory is vast and boundless; fittingly, he is to be exalted and honored. The Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, Grand General of the Dark Warrior Who Guards Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, Grand Marshal of the Right Wall of the Northern Culmen of the Left Heaven, Supreme Commander of the Three Realms’ Affairs of Gods, Immortals, and Ghosts, Judge of the Right Victory Bureau of the Dark Capital, and Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly Unity—Dark Thearch, whose name is Numinous Penetration of the Great Mystery, whose Dao is complete and whose radiance is resplendent, who above opens the mystery of the Primal Transformation and below governs the elegance of *Xu* and *Wei*...”*\n\nHe upholds the earth’s foundation and nurtures the heavens’ origin, sustaining creation through the four seasons and extending the warp and weft through the eight solar terms. His merit surpasses fifty thousand kalpas, his virtue equals the thirty-two heavens—profound and boundless, subtle yet radiant. According to the records, he ranks next to the Imperial Perfected; without exalted honors, how could his power be made manifest? Thus, we respectfully dispatch the Golden Perfected, Purple Yang Grand Master, Golden Watchtower Attendant, Minister of the Jade Capital, Grand Academician of the Plain Spirit Hall, Director of the Three Heavens’ Gate, and Daily Attendant of the Repository of Numinous Treasures, the Memorial-Presenting, Radiant, Supreme Virtue Immortal Lord Xuanyuan Zhibenmai, bearing the jade tablets, to specially appoint him as Preceptor of the Jade Void and Prime Minister to the Dark Thearch of Heaven, concurrently serving as Inspector of the Nine Heavens. Henceforth, he shall assist the Great Dao above, enduring through kalpa after kalpa, and protect the myriad people below, bestowing blessings without end. The dragon-script decree descends in splendor—let him not decline. Upon receipt of this edict, let it be reverently obeyed.\n\nThereupon, the Dark Thearch and his host of perfected beings received their imperial titles upon the Seven-Treasures Jeweled Terrace. The Supreme August One of the Vast Heaven personally conducted the rites, which closely resembled the ceremonies by which mortal emperors invest generals, enfeoff nobles, and establish lineages. The Dark Thearch was bestowed a jeweled banner and a jade tally with nine dragon seals. His crown reached to heaven with twelve streamers, his robes were of dark silk adorned with the twelve imperial emblems, his scepter was of black jade, and his shoes were of red raven leather. Today, when the host of perfected beings pays court, the Four Saints stand at the head of the ranks.\n\nHis abode is the Celestial One True Celebration Palace, located above the Purple Tenuity, between the Supreme Simplicity and the Effulgent Joy of the Great Void’s Two Heavens. Its palaces rise in majesty, formed naturally from wondrous qi; jade trees of chiming splendor stand within, where divine winds sound in perfect harmony with the five notes. Crimson light and purple clouds perpetually shroud its heights—this is the realm of the Jade Void, the realm beyond form.\n\nAfter the Dark Thearch received his imperial title, the Supreme August One posthumously ennobled his sacred father as the Serene Joy Heavenly Lord, Radiant Perfected Great Thearch, and his sacred mother as the Auspicious Victory Grand Empress, Jeweled Perfected Supreme Immortal. Below, at the Heavenly Pass, he conferred upon the Fire Essence the title Dark Yang General of the Great Mystery, Red Numinous Venerable Spirit, and at the Earth’s Axis, upon the Water Essence, the title Dark Yin General of the Great Mystery, Black Numinous Venerable Spirit—both now dwell in the Celestial One True Celebration Palace. From this time forth, the Three Realms have reverently addressed him as the Dark Thearch.\n\nThis compilation records the successive transmissions of the Dao to those who attained perfection, allowing later generations to witness the divine and sagely deeds of the gods—a blessing from past lives.\n\n---\n\n**Auspicious Response at the Radiant Response Palace**\nWhen the Great Yuan unified all under heaven and established its capital at Yan, on the nineteenth day of the twelfth month in the seventh year of the *Zhiyuan* era, a serpent over a foot long, adorned with golden patterns and azure markings, appeared in the Golden Waters of the Gaoliang River west of the city. The next day, a divine tortoise, its shell shimmering with gold and jade, swam in graceful circles. At that time, the Jade Tablet Keeper of the Imperial Treasury, Chibuhua, witnessed the event and reported it in full. An edict was issued to construct a palace and erect a stele, enshrining the sacred image of the Dark Thearch, and the temple was named the Radiant Response Palace. Today, the palace is diligently maintained by female officials and Daoist priests, who manifest the numinous efficacy of the divine response.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, Bestowing a Sacred Title upon the Perfected Martial General**\nTo the Secretariat-Chancellery: We, in Our august wisdom, have sought the blessings of divine favor, and in accordance with ancient precedents, have bestowed distinguished titles to honor the gods. The Perfected Martial, whose numinous might is firmly established in the northern quarter, possesses unfathomable and subtle efficacy. When We governed the capital’s fertile lands, tortoise and serpent omens appeared, earthly treasures ascended, and sacred springs welled forth—naturally pure and cool, sweet to drink. They brought benefit to the Middle Kingdom and dispelled the people’s afflictions. Overwhelmed by such blessings and mindful of repaying this virtue, We chose this propitious site to build a magnificent temple. Having reverently enshrined his majestic image, it is fitting to elevate his praise. Thus, after consulting the illustrious records and perpetuating his glorious auspices, the Perfected Martial General shall henceforth be titled: *Zhentian Zhenwu Lingying Yousheng Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Numinous Response, Guardian of Heaven, Perfected Martial). Let all officials, in solemn reverence, proclaim this decree, that all may know. Issued on the seventh day of the seventh month in the second year of the *Tianxi* era.\n\n---\n\n**Edict of Ennoblement, Second Year of the *Jiading* Era, Eleventh Month, Fourteenth Day**\nGazing up to the layered heavens, we behold the majesty of the Northern Culmen, where the host of spirits encircle in guard, and the Dark Martial stands in solemn dignity. Though his image has long been revered, his title remains incomplete. Now, in accordance with venerable rites, We bestow this honor to extend abundant blessings.\n\nThe *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen), a noble spirit of heaven and a luminous sacrifice of the state, dwells in majesty above. His presence is ever as near as one’s robes and cap; his radiance stirs the people, and no demon dares approach. His wondrous signs have been manifest: in the *Tianxi* era, auspicious omens appeared at the Sweet Springs Abbey; in the *Xining* era, his deeds were recorded in the city of Great Compliance. Our imperial ancestors, in succession, augmented the rites, and the temple was first established by the Mausoleum of Prosperity, its inscribed plaque renewed at the Temple of the Guardian Sage. We, in particular, have revered these sacrifices, and the god has ever heeded Our prayers. His trustworthiness is profound, his responses never obscure. His blessings, subtle and vast, shall extend to myriad generations of descendants; his virtue, lofty and deep, shall universally benefit the people of the four quarters. To extol his greatness, We now enrich his title.\n\nLet the Golden Watchtower and Jade Capital increase the god’s glory in secret; let his cloud chariots and wind steeds eternally guard the mortal realm. May he delight in Our offerings and observe Our sacrifices. By special decree, he is now ennobled as: *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Fude Zhenjun* (True Lord of Blessing and Virtue, Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen). Upon receipt of this edict, let it be reverently obeyed.\n\n---\n\n**Edict of Ennoblement, Fifth Year of the *Baoyou* Era, Second Month**\nThe Northern Culmen is supreme, and the Dark Martial is truly the most exalted—though he faces south to govern the host of spirits, his reverence must be strictly maintained. Having already received the duty of protection in secret, it is fitting to publicly bestow honors to manifest Our respect.\n\nThe *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Fude Yanging Zhenjun* (True Lord of Extended Blessings, Blessing and Virtue, Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen) encompasses the Six Directions with his Dao and subdues the myriad spirits with his might. He embodies the true qi of the primordial chaos, his yin powers are relied upon; he grasps the marvelous essence of kan and li, his divine transformations are boundless. Through him, evil is dispelled and merit established—none is not for the salvation of the people and the protection of the state.\n\nOur successive sagely emperors of this dynasty have maintained a single heart of utmost reverence. During the reigns of the True Emperor and the Benevolent Emperor, they manifested numinous responses and made manifest the communion of feelings; during the reigns of the Filial Emperor and the Tranquil Emperor, they revered the Protector Sage and exalted the Blessing and Virtue. Now in Our humble and youthful reign, it is fitting to augment and extend the title of Blessing; and as you, with your intelligence and wisdom, have already recounted the praises of the Balanced Yang, so too do We now respond. In the profound obscurity, you silently answer; your majestic numen shines brightly all around.

All within the realm of universal governance is embraced within your encompassing care. It is by your benevolence that the breadth of your aid is so vast; it is by your rectitude that your mighty deeds are so grand. Though the exalted true ones are difficult to assist, and your perfect virtue is hard to fathom, may you ever expand the shade of the Dao and eternally shelter the world of men.

He is also called the *Upper Wondrous Heaven*, and his palace is the *Palace of Numinous Treasure*, corresponding below to the *Realm of Serene Joy*.\n\nThe Great Peace August Cliff Heavenly Emperor, whose inner name is *Huidian Ahun* (\"Radiant Offering of the Soul\"), dwells in the Form Realm; his color is white. He is also called the *Utmost Joy Heaven*, and his palace is the *Palace of Illumination*.\n\nThe Manifest-Determination Ultimate Wind Heavenly Emperor, whose inner name is *Huiqiao Wei* (\"Revolving and Towering Might\"), resides in the Form Realm; his color is yellow. He is also called the *Vast Joy Heaven*, and his palace is the *Great Crimson Palace*. These two heavens correspond below to Mount Wudang.\n\nThe Abundant Heavenly Emperor of Primordial Qian: According to the ninth chapter of *The True Martial Record of the Divine Manifestation*, compiled by Imperial Attendant Song Xiang, Duke of Jing, during the Song Dynasty, when the Perfected Warrior (Zhenwu) first studied the Dao, he encountered this emperor, who bestowed upon him the *Black Galloping Chaos-Horn Demon-Slaying Sword*, though its inner name remains undetermined.\n\nThe Celestial Ministers of the *Xu* (Void) and *Wei* (Danger) Lodges—both stars embody the symbol of *Tianyi* (\"Celestial Unity\"), manifesting the forms of tortoise and snake, water and fire—are governed by the Dark Emperor.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Purple Primordial Lady, whose inner name remains undetermined. According to *The Transmissions of the Immortals*, the Dao was transmitted to the Dark Emperor, revealing the root origin of Mount Wudang; today, she is revered as the *Holy Preceptress*.\n\nThe Supreme Celestial Registrar of the Nine Heavens, the Primordial August Emperor Lord, surnamed Zhang and named Ya, is one of the Three Great Deities. He oversees the registers of official emoluments, and all who receive stipends as officials or scholars are subject to his authority. He assists in the administration of the Water Bureau’s calculations and the circulation of resources, aiding the Great Dao and supporting the Dark Emperor in delivering beings. Further details may be found in *The Transmissions of the Immortals*.\n\nThe Supreme Purity Heavenly Mechanism Chief Decree-Receiver, the Divine Responsive Primordial Wisdom Perfected Lord, surnamed Dong and named Suhuang, is a celestial perfected being whose essence remains inscrutable. He assists the Dark Emperor, propagating teachings to deliver beings, and holds the rank of Left Supreme Minister of the Grand Purity’s Western King.\n\nThe Supreme Purity Heavenly Mechanism Chief Decree-Receiver, the Flying Rosy Radiance Perfected Person, the Central Yellow Master, the Supreme Primordial Perfected Person, the Eastern Marchmount’s Supreme Minister of Life—also known as the Great Mao Lord—was a native of Xianyang, named Ying and styled Shushen.\n\nThe Registrar of Determinations, Right Forbidden Minister, and Supreme Minister of Life—also known as the Middle Mao Lord—was named Gu and styled Xiuwei.\n\nThe Three Officials’ Protector of Life Perfected Lord—also known as the Lesser Mao Lord—was named Zhong and styled Sihe.\n\nThe Three Mao Lords serve as prime ministers of the Golden Tower and as the Eastern Marchmount’s Supreme Ministers of Life. The present-day Three Mao Mountain in the blessed land of Juqu is the site of their ascension to perfection. For further details, see *The Immortal Transmissions of Mount Mao*; additional accounts appear in *The Marvelous Records of the Later Court*.\n\nThe Central Heaven Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Great Divine Thunderbolt Marshal Heavenly Lord was originally the Wind-Following General, minister to the Yellow Emperor. After defeating Chiyou, he was enfeoffed as the General of Henan and took Deng as his surname from his fief. Later, he concealed himself on Mount Wudang’s *Diezi Peak*, where divine traces remain; see *The Thunder Canon*.\n\nThe Five Black Dragon Lords of Mount Wudang’s Responsive Manifestations are transformations of *Tianyi* and remnants of the Dragon-Transforming Brahma-Pervading Heaven’s blackness. They guard Mount Wudang, assisting the Dark Emperor’s ascension. In the Tang Dynasty, they visited Prefect Yao to bring rain; in the Song, they transmitted the *Sleeping Method* to Chen Tuan. Their responsive manifestations to prayers for rain or sunshine are too numerous to recount. The Five Dragon Peaks of Mount Wudang are their dwelling places.\n\nThe Five Hundred Divine Officers of Mount Wudang: This grotto-heaven blessed land is where the Celestial Thearch conducts his annual inspections. Five hundred divine officers are appointed to maintain and guard it. When Daoist practitioners achieve success in their cultivation, they are all registered and recommended, serving as the bureau for investigating good and punishing evil.\n\nThe Black Tiger Marshal of Mount Wudang’s Mountain Patrol is a transformation of the Northern *Tianyi*, a guardian deity of the teachings and the mountain. His divine efficacy and numinous power defy full description. For those whose bone configurations are unsuited to Daoist cultivation, he may reveal his true form or issue warnings in dreams, driving them away. By night, he patrols the corridors and responds to invocations, safeguarding the blessed precincts, and his dharma methods are practiced in the world.\n\nThe Loyal, Wise, Mighty, and Valiant King of Mount Wudang was Yao Jian, Prefect of Junzhou during the Tang Dynasty. Further details appear in later transmissions.\n\nThe Celestial Thearch’s Assistant Controller of Perfected Beings commanded the Perfected Lord of Mount Wudang. Mount Wudang is the Assistant Controller’s grotto-heaven of the Central Marchmount, bearing the title *Perfected Lord*. This is recorded in *The Grand Perfected Daoist Canon*.\n\nThe Blessed Land’s Divine Officers of Mount Wudang, the Heaven-Connecting Great Sage of the Palace Precincts, and the Vast Moistening Dragon King of Mount Wudang’s Great Summit—111 divine officers are enfeoffed by the state as the mountain’s native immortals.\n\n**The Enlightened of Past and Present**\nAccording to *The Illustrated Classic*: Mount Wudang is the abode of divine immortals. Since the Yellow Emperor and Laozi established the teachings, divine immortals and perfected beings have gathered here in great numbers. It is also said that those who study the Dao often number in the hundreds, but if their resolve wavers, they are driven away by beasts. Cultivators of life often conceal their names and hide their times, lamenting that the mountains are not deep enough or the forests not dense enough, fearing that their fame might reach others’ ears. The number of those who have attained the Dao and ascended to perfection on this mountain is beyond counting. As the ages grow distant and kalpa fires repeatedly renew the world, many names have been lost. Now, after consulting records and inquiring of elders, we have gathered a few and recorded them here to preserve the mountain’s wondrous traces.\n\nThe Pass Master Perfected Person, a grandee of King Kang of Zhou, surnamed Yin and named Xi, styled *Master of the Beginning of Literature*. At the end of the Zhou, as the Great Dao was about to withdraw, he divined that a purple aura was moving westward and that a perfected being would pass through. He then became the magistrate of Hangu Pass. Soon after, the Most High crossed the pass, and Xi received him with the rites of a disciple, bowing in welcome. The Most High bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Dao* and the *Scripture of Virtue*, arranging to meet again at the Green Ram Market in Shu. Feigning illness, Xi resigned from office and concealed himself in a valley. Later, he entered Shu and returned to dwell on Mount Wudang, beneath the stone walls of the Three Heavenly Gates, in a stone chamber. His former abode contained bronze pillars and a jade table, though these are no longer extant. The site is named *Yin Xi’s Cliff*; the ravine is called *Ox-Dragging Ravine* and *Green Ram Ravine*, both places where the Most High’s divine transformations visited Xi. This account is drawn from *The Record of Geographical Excellence*.\n\nThe immortal Yin Gui, as recorded in *The Traditions of Divine Transcendents*: Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan. A disciple of the Master of the Primordial Beginning, he mastered all manner of texts before turning in later years to the study of the Dao, taking the sobriquet Shanshi Yuan. He often dwelled in forests and foothills, consuming yellow essence, and lived to over a hundred years. His pronouncements on the peace and peril, rise and decline of the realm were never proven wrong. He entered Mount Taihe and later assumed the leadership of the Duanyang Palace as the Perfected One of Grand Harmony, now known as the Master of the Purple Void, Radiant Yang, and the Register of the Dao and Virtue. Source: *Declarations of the Perfected*.\n\nThe immortal Dai Meng, as recorded in *Records of Commanderies and States*: Surnamed Dai, named Zhisheng, he was a Han general. Emperor Wu dispatched him to the northern mountains to gather herbs, but he abandoned his post to study the Dao, taking the name Mengsheng Zi. He received teachings from the Perfected One of Pure Numinosity, Pei, and obtained the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Bell* and the talismans of *Stone Essence and Golden Radiance*. He wandered through famous mountains, covering seven hundred *li* in a day. Later, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, leaving his cap atop a peak of Mount Wudang, which has since been called Falling Cap Peak. Thus, Chen Tuan wrote in verse:\n\nI love the excellence of Wudang,\nWhere the general once attained the Dao.\nAscending into the clouds,\nThe lofty summit bears the name Falling Cap.\nSource: *Declarations of the Perfected* and *Essentials Compiled by Master Yan*.\n\nThe immortal Ma Mingsheng, as recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, bore the surname Ma, the courtesy name Junxian, and the sobriquet Mingsheng. He obtained the secret of the Sun Spirit Elixir, and upon completing the alchemical process, consumed half a dose. He then wandered among the common folk, building huts and gathering disciples, appearing no different from ordinary people. Yet within three years, he and his wife would invariably relocate. The present-day Natural Hermitage of Five Dragons Abbey marks the site of their former dwelling.\n\nThe immortal Yin Changsheng, as noted in the *Records of Yongzhou*, was a kinsman of Empress Yin, consort of Emperor Guangwu of the Han, and hailed from Deng. A disciple of Ma Mingsheng, he received from his master the oral instructions for the Sun Spirit Elixir. Together they secluded themselves on Mount Wudang, and upon completing the elixir, he mastered the art of riding qi to traverse the six directions. Later, he arrived at Immortal Capital in Zhongzhou, where he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe immortal Yan Ji, as recorded in the *Biographies of Daoist Scholars*, was named Ji, with the courtesy name Zhongwei, and lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han. From youth, he was devoted to the arts of the Dao and abandoned officialdom to pursue his studies. Later, he dwelled on Mount Wudang, sleeping and waking without regularity, sometimes resting upon piled stones or leaning against great trees. Though he passed through all four seasons, his garments remained unchanged. He often wore his hair loose, or at times bound it with a white silk kerchief. Moving swiftly through clouds and mist, none could draw near him.\n\nThe immortal Liu Hong, as recorded in the *Biographies of Recluses*, was named Hong, with the courtesy name Lingyu. Gifted with exceptional intelligence, he exhaustively studied the classics and their commentaries. During the Taishi era of the Song, he served as Recorder for the Prince of Jin.\n\nHe resigned his post, practiced grain avoidance, and entered Mount Wudang to ascend as an immortal. The stone chamber where he dwelled was called Liu Shuang Rock, now known as the Hermit’s Rock.\n\nThe immortal Xie Yun, as recorded in the *True Records and Divine Pivot*: his name was Yun, courtesy name Daotong, a native of Liyang. From youth, he possessed heroic resolve, served as magistrate of Luo County, and was well-versed in the classics. His mastery of Daoist studies was especially profound, and his governance was upright and capable, though he harbored the aspiration to withdraw from the world and cast off worldly dust. During the Taikang era of the Jin, he submitted a memorial to resign from office and enter the Dao, and the imperial edict granted his request. He then journeyed westward to Wudang, and upon reaching Xiangyang, he encountered a Daoist who said to him: \"My master, Master Dai Mengshengzi, is no ordinary man. He instructed me: ‘If anyone traveling westward wishes to see me, bring them along—could it be you?’\" Thereupon, they went together to meet him. As they reached the mountain, distant peaks stretched across the horizon, and beneath the pine shadows, they suddenly beheld the master seated upon a stone. His spirit shone with luminous clarity, and he transmitted to Xie the Dao of refining the spirit and attaining emptiness. In an instant, the master vanished from sight. Xie then built a thatched hut by the stone chamber, and within a few years, he attained the subtleties of profound stillness, gaining the ability to fly across sheer cliffs. He styled himself Xie Luoshan, signifying his liberation from the magistracy of Luo County. Later, he ascended as an immortal, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\nFrom the *True and Unadorned* and the *Classic of Waterways*.\n\nPrefect Yao, as recorded in the *Biographies*: his name was Jian, courtesy name Yifu, a man of the Sui. He assisted Emperor Taizong of the Tang and was later appointed military commissioner of Wudang. During the Zhenguan era, as the realm suffered a great drought and swarms of locusts arose, prayers were offered at famous mountains, yet none received a response. Prefect Yao was dispatched to Wudang to conduct solemn rites. There, a scholar of unusual bearing approached him and said: \"We are no ordinary men—we are the Five Dragon Lords. By imperial decree, we guard this mountain. Moved by your integrity and the sincerity of your prayers, we have come to meet you. We have already petitioned the Emperor on High on your behalf. You should return swiftly, for on the third day, there shall be cause for celebration.\" Soon after, clouds surged from the earth, and the scholar vanished from sight. Thunder, lightning, and torrential rains spread across the land, and grasses, trees, and crops all flourished. When news of this divine efficacy reached the court, he was honored with imperial favor. After resigning his post, he brought his family to dwell in seclusion on Wudang, aspiring to the mysteries of emptiness and attaining the truth of the Dao. The Dark Emperor appointed him as the mountain’s guardian deity. In the early Song, his divine manifestations in repelling locusts and relieving droughts were widely renowned, and he was enfeoffed as the Loyal, Wise, Mighty, and Valiant Duke. A temple was established to exhort his virtues, located east of the present-day Purple Cloud Palace.\n\nChen Tuiyi, as recorded in the *Observations of Words and Deeds*: his name was Bo, courtesy name Tunan, a native of Bozhou. From youth, he possessed extraordinary talent and harbored the ambition to benefit others. During the chaotic Five Dynasties period, in Bianliang, he met the future Emperor Taizu of the Song and remarked: \"This is truly the Mandate of Heaven.\"\n\nHe laughed and dismounted his white donkey, then harbored the lofty aspiration to ascend amidst clouds and mist. He entered Wudang Mountain to live in seclusion, reciting the *Book of Changes* beside the Five Dragons Temple, where he moved the Five Black Dragon Lords to impart to him the art of sleeping. His reputation spread far and wide, drawing many visitors. Later, he moved to the Sutra-Recitation Terrace to delve into the mysteries of painting, and then to White Cloud Cliff. At the end of the Five Dynasties, with turmoil raging across the land, he relocated to Hua Peak, where it was said the Five Dragons soared through the sky to escort him. In the early Song, he was repeatedly summoned to court but declined. Later, he journeyed to the capital to request leave to return home, and the imperial edict granted his wish. Further details may be found in his official biography.\n\nGrand Councilor Zhang Shixun, as recorded in the *Biography of Wan Tui*: his name was Shixun, a native of Junzhou. Initially residing in Guanghua, he was orphaned and impoverished in his youth. While studying on Wudang Mountain, a Daoist priest saw him and remarked, \"You possess the qi of the Dao; you should follow me to study immortality.\" The gentleman declined. During the Yongxi reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song, he passed the imperial examinations and rose through the ranks, serving as the emperor’s companion and eventually attaining the position of grand councilor.\n\nThe Immortal Fang Changxu, as recorded in the *Records of Wudang*: Fang Changxu’s given name is unknown. After the Song court crossed south, he lived in seclusion on Wudang Mountain, spending his days planting cedars. The cedars behind the present-day Five Dragons Palace were all planted by his hand, tended and watered without a moment’s rest. One day, he suddenly encountered the Dark Emperor, who had transformed into a Daoist figure. The Emperor asked him the reason for planting cedars and comforted him, saying, \"As a spirit, you are pure indeed, but alas, you lack a beard.\" He then stroked his chin, and this became a common occurrence.\n\nAfter spending the night, he felt something like silk coiling around his chest and heart. Upon inspection, his beard had grown over a foot long. Thereafter, he built the Cloud Grotto to honor the Dark Emperor.\n\nOn the morning of the *jiawu* day in the third month, a crane was faintly seen riding the clouds. Turning to look back at his former dwelling, only his staff and sandals remained.\n\nThe recluse Tian Suoyi, as recorded in the *Records of Wudang*: Tian Suoyi’s given name is unknown. He dwelled in a stone chamber at Hidden Immortal Cliff on Wudang, wearing only a straw raincoat in both winter and summer, and thus people called him by this name. In the depths of winter, his true *qi* steamed like vapor, while in the height of summer, his presence was as cool as jade. Those afflicted with illness or misfortune would seek him out. He would pluck herbs from his robe, blow upon them, and give them to the sufferer—those who consumed them were instantly cured. He refined the Great Elixir. During the *Duanping* era, his whereabouts became unknown. Today, the elixir furnace and kiln remain in his alchemical chamber.\n\nThe recluse Xie Tiandi, as recorded in the *Records of Wudang*: Xie Tiandi’s name is unknown. He abstained from grain and did not eat, moving with such swiftness that his steps seemed to fly. He resided in a stone chamber beneath the Changing Garments Terrace on South Cliff, where sheer cliffs of ten thousand fathoms plunged into a deep ravine—even gibbons and cranes could not traverse it, yet he moved through the air with ease. When questioned, he would only reply, \"Thank Heaven and Earth,\" offering no other words, and so people named him thus. The cliff where he dwelled was also named after him. Later, he ascended as an immortal, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nSun Jiran, as recorded in the *Records*: His given name was Yuanzheng, and his sobriquet was Jiranzi. He inherited the lineage of Maoshan’s Pure Truth Abbey, mastering the wonders of the Shangqing Five Thunder methods, and traveled extensively to pay homage at sacred sites. At the time, the dragons of Bian and Hu had departed, and the Jiang and Han regions suffered under the calamity of Jin soldiers, leaving the halls of Wudang utterly desolate. In the *shaoxi* year of the *Shaoxing* era, he was the first to ascend Wudang, restoring the Five Dragons Palace, laying its foundations, and using talismanic water to exorcise plagues and cure the people’s illnesses. The masses flocked to him, and within a few years, the halls were fully restored. Emperor Gaozong summoned him to court, where his talismanic water met with imperial approval, and ten Daoist priests were ordained by imperial decree. Later, he returned to the mountain and passed away without illness, his remains interred east of Peach Blossom Spring.\n\nDeng Zhenguan, given name Anda, was a disciple of Sun Jiran. From childhood, he accompanied his master in the restoration of Wudang, first receiving imperial favor and fully inheriting his master’s mastery of the Shangqing Five Thunder methods. He commanded wind and lashed thunder, his responses as swift as an echo. Those afflicted with illness from near and far hastened to him. He subsequently petitioned to reside at the Five Dragons Palace, overseeing the construction of the main hall. The stubborn rock stood like a wall, and the labor of quarrying was arduous. Silently invoking divine power, a single night of thunder and rain shattered the stone. He ordained several disciples and entrusted the abbey to them. Secretly, he harmonized the Dragon and Tiger, refining *jia* and *geng* within. During the *Jiatai* era, he foretold his departure to his followers and suddenly passed away. A great wind uprooted trees, and only after some time did it subside—people said he had departed riding the wind. His traces remain evident north of the Sword Seat Abbey.\n\nCao Guanmiao, given name Shide, was a native of Xianshan. He entered the Dao in his youth and resided on Wudang, inheriting the revival of the Five Dragons lineage. By nature quick-witted and extraordinary in bearing, he developed his own calligraphic style, ethereal and imbued with the demeanor of an immortal, which many from all directions emulated. His mastery of Daoist arts and yin-yang was exhaustive, and he was bestowed the title \"Guanmiao,\" assuming the office of abbey overseer. All from near and far revered him as their master. Later, he was transferred to oversee the Chongxi Abbey of the Three Maos.\n\nUpon his return, in his later years he maintained a lofty purity, and the community expected him to ascend lightly into the heavens. One evening, he dreamed that the mountain’s guardian spirit said to him: “The Three Mao Perfected Lords will descend here tomorrow—you should withdraw both near and far.” The next day, he led his disciples to welcome them at Meeting Immortals Peak, but after a long while, no one arrived. As dusk approached, the Perfected Lords transformed into a field laborer, carrying a rain cape, and arrived. None of the assembly recognized them, so they ordered him to carry things back. Upon reaching the abbey, he bowed at the hall’s steps. Soon after, when they sought to offer him hospitality, he could not be found—only an extraordinary fragrance assailed them, filling the courtyard and doors. They regretted their failure to respond in kind.\n\nLater, he admonished his disciples, saying: “This is a place where immortals and mortals dwell together. From now on, for generation after generation, we shall no longer accept the bows of either Daoists or laypeople.” Thus began the custom of Wudang Daoist friends refusing secular bows. Soon after, he established the Hall of Assembled Sages to honor them.\n\nHe once told his disciples: “Because I received the rites of the Three Mao Perfected Lords, I cannot escape the golden blade.” In the final ten days of the tenth month of the third year of the Duanping era, he indeed fell victim to military calamity. His flesh congealed like white fat, with no trace of bloody stench. Those who wielded blades bowed in reverence and departed, sheathing their swords. Later, his divine remains were interred in a burial mound at Peach Spring.\n\nTang Fengxian, whose given name was Shoucheng, was a native of Suizhou. In his youth, he entered Wudang. His appearance was strange and ancient, his body like a crane, his form like a pine. Dozens of gourds were always hung from his staff as he traveled between Jun and Fang. In the renzi year, when Junzhou was reclaimed, the prefect Cheng Jin ordered the revival of the incense fire of Wudang’s Five Dragons. Before long, an imperial edict summoned the Daoist Wang Lichang. Retiring, he delighted in the Dao, and all matters of fortune, misfortune, regret, or shame were foretold with perfect accuracy. He often berated people, yet those who were scolded would immediately receive blessings. Thus, people called him Fengxian.\n\nAt times he would stand amidst piled snow, or lie upon the road, always with tigers and leopards keeping watch and ward. Nobles and officials of the time paid him reverence. In the *kaiqing* *jimo* year, he vanished without a trace.\n\nWang Zhenchang, whose given name was Sizhen and whose Daoist name was Jiranzi—a title bestowed upon him—hailed from a family of Huizhou lineage, descended from Wang Boyan, a prime minister of the Song. Born in Anqing, he inherited the teachings of the Quanzhen school and entered Wudang Mountain. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan era, he led six disciples to restore the Five Dragons sanctuary. Brambles choked the paths, but a black tiger guided their way. He built halls and pavilions, transforming the site into a grand palace. Daoist masters from all directions paid him homage, and he ordained over a hundred disciples, serving as the abbot of the monastery. He foresaw fortune and misfortune, and later, without illness, shed his mortal form. Many commoners dreamed of him walking northward amidst purple clouds.\n\nLu Dongyun, whose given name was Dayou and whose Daoist name was Dongyunzi, was a native of Yingshan in Suizhou. Born into an official family, he entered Wudang in his youth to study the Dao and traveled extensively across the north and south. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan era, he joined Wang Zhenchang in restoring Wudang and resided at Purple Cloud Cliff.\n\nAt over eighty years of age, his Dao spread far and wide, and even a drop of ink on paper could heal illness. He ordained over a hundred disciples. On the day of his liberation, his face remained youthful, from which his attainment of the Dao may be known.\n\nYe Yunlai, whose given name was Xizhen and whose Daoist name was Yunlaizi, was a native of Kuocang in Chuzhou. Born on the fifth day of the third lunar month in the *xinhai* year at the *si* hour, he was a descendant of Tang dynasty Celestial Master Ye Fashan. Born in Jianning, he mastered the subtleties of Qingwei Daoist arts. Skilled in dispelling misfortune through ancient rituals of exorcism and prayer, he entered Wudang and became its abbot. In the *yiyou* year of the Zhiyuan era, he was summoned to the imperial court in response to a prophecy, where he stilled winds, quelled thunder, prayed for rain, and cured illnesses—all to the emperor’s satisfaction. In the *bingxu* year of the Zhiyuan era, he was honored with an imperial decree, appointed Chief Supervisor, and tasked with overseeing Wudang’s protection, a duty that began with him. Later, bearing imperial incense back to the mountain, he passed away peacefully.\n\n---\n\nSince the beginning of the cosmos, though countless grotto-heavens and blessed lands have flourished across the realm, none have gained renown without the presence of extraordinary individuals. Thus, Mount Lu was renamed by Master Kuangsu’s hermitage, and Mount Tiantai was rebranded by Master Tongxiang’s governance. Where immortals dwell, mountains acquire fame—this is self-evident.\n\nFrom childhood, my hair still damp, I heard that Wudang in Junzhou was the sacred birthplace of the Dark Emperor, and I longed for its true essence with deep reverence. Yet I regretted never having beheld its splendor or understood the origin of its name. One day, two scholars, Wang and Mi, arrived from Wudang to visit my hermitage at the foot of Mount Lu. From their sleeves, they produced *The Comprehensive Record of Wudang’s True Realms*, compiled by Liu Dongyang. With solemn respect, I unrolled and read it, and thus came to know this mountain: seventy-two peaks displaying its wonders, thirty-six cliffs monopolizing its beauty, streams, pools, and grottoes exuding serenity, and rare flora and fauna flourishing in abundance. Marvelous immortal traces abound, with nothing left unrecorded. Among the grand and majestic sacred mountains, none but Wudang could be deemed a fitting abode for the Dark Emperor, just as none but the Dark Emperor could have magnified Wudang’s magnificence. The name \"Wudang\" was thus exchanged for \"Taihe,\" derived from this very principle.\n\nHad Liu Dongyang not chronicled these details with such clarity, as if laying them in the palm of one’s hand, how could Daoist devotees across the realm ever fully grasp its origins? Indeed, this mountain shall endure as long as heaven and earth, and this compilation shall likewise persist alongside it, rendering great service to the Dark Teachings.\n\nHaving read it thrice, I could only sigh in admiration and inscribe these words at the end of the scroll. As for the true deeds of the Dark Emperor, they are already amply recorded in previous volumes—what need is there for further repetition?\n\nOn the Flower Festival of the *xinchou* year, Lu Shishun, former *Fengxun Dafu* and overseer of Wudang’s sacred lands in Huaixi, respectfully inscribed this colophon as *Jiangbei Dao* Surveillance Commissioner.\n\n*The Comprehensive Record of Wudang’s True Realms* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Wudang Blessed Land Compendium of Perfected Ones**\n\n**Title:** *Wudang Fudi Zongzhen Ji* (*Compendium of the Wudang Blessed Land of Perfected Ones*). Compiled by Liu Daoming of the Yuan dynasty. Three juan. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Jizhuan* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the *Compendium of the Wudang Perfected Ones***\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the Two Modes began their separation. Water and fire transformed within a single stroke; wind and thunder danced between the two inquiries. The great mass took form, coalescing into seas and mountains. Qi flowed between peaks and marshes, and the ten thousand things took shape. People dwelled in the wilds and caves, their nature simple and unadorned. They pointed to things and images to name them, marking clouds and crows to designate officials. Thus arose the appellations of *Youxiong* and *Youchao*. The sacred traces of the Dark Emperor (Xuandi) on Wudang have endured since antiquity.\n\nThe Dark Emperor’s holy footsteps are fully recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*. This mountain was originally called *Taihe* (Great Harmony). In middle antiquity, when heaven and earth settled into their positions, it corresponded to the celestial fields of *Yi*, *Han*, *Jiao*, and *Kang*. After the Dark Emperor ascended to perfected reality, it was said: \"None but *Xuanwu* (Dark Warrior) is worthy of this place,\" and so it was named accordingly.\n\nAccording to the *Illustrated Classic*, this was the land where Mi Jiu lun cut the earth in high antiquity. The people were rustic and simple, serene and fond of goodness—though likened to deer, they dwelled in peace. The Yellow Emperor was born in the land of *Youxiong*, ranking among the Three Sovereigns, yet later contended with the flooding of Feng waters. Yu pacified the waters and earth, enfeoffed the mountains, and inaugurated the provinces. By the late Spring and Autumn period, it was divided between the domains of *Yu* and *Yong*. During the Qin-Han transition, it belonged to Nanyang Commandery, later renamed Hanzhong Commandery. Under the Wei, it fell under Nanxiang Commandery; under the Jin, Shunyang Commandery. Emperor Huaidi of the Jin established Shiping Commandery during the Yongjia era. The Qi dynasty retained it, later establishing Qixing Commandery. The Liang made it Nan Shiping Commandery. The Later Wei renamed it Wudang Commandery. The Liang established Xingzhou, which the Western Wei made Fengzhou, and the Sui renamed Junzhou. It was also called Xiyang Commandery and Wudang Commandery. The Tang and Song restored Junzhou.\n\nIts springs are sweet, its soil fertile, its scenery beautiful and elegant. The land is numinous, its people outstanding—divine immortals make their home here. Collections on Wudang surely existed in ancient times. Though the mountain inspires reverence, its numinous traces have faded. Though the Daoist lineage is exalted, its records have undergone many changes. It is said that between the Jin and Song dynasties, within a hundred years, it suffered three calamities of fire. The woodblocks were destroyed in earlier days, and matters gradually faded in later times.\n\nFortunately, the Dao of Heaven favors return; the realm was unified under a single script and chariot. Erroneous words were swept away, and the true Dao flourished. Former standards were revived, and no text was left unestablished. I, a humble descendant of Jingmen, a rustic from the outskirts, have knocked at the gates of the Dharma lineage and once lodged in the halls of the worthy. Delighted to encounter an age of good governance, yet unable to aid the enlightened era, I retired to the mountains and forests to cultivate the true and nurture my nature.\n\nYet scholars and gentlemen who climbed its heights were many. Often, they sought traces and probed mysteries, asking me to point out its peaks and ridges. Having dwelled long in the groves, my spirit turned inward, preserving my mind and gathering my qi, weary of social obligations. With reverence, I gathered and excerpted from many books, inquired of elders, and supplemented this with what I had seen and heard. Investigating its definitive discourses and precise words, I penned the *Compendium of the Wudang Perfected Ones*. It gathers the essence of ages past, distills the wind and moon of a single mountain. Opening its pages, all is clear—what need is there for my humble words?\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the Zhongyuan day of the Xinmao year of the Zhiyuan era by Liu Daoming, the Hermit of Dongyang Cave in the Groves.\n\n---\n\n### **Compendium of the Wudang Blessed Land of Perfected Ones, Volume One**\nCompiled by Liu Daoming, the Hermit of Dongyang Cave\n\n### **Facts of Wudang**\n\nThe *Traditions and Records* state: Wudang Mountain, also called *Taihe*, *Great Peak*, and *Immortal Chamber*, is the mountain that assists the Central Peak in its mandate. It corresponds to the celestial fields of *Yi*, *Han*, *Jiao*, and *Kang*, located south of Junzhou. It spans six hundred *li* in circumference, encircling seventy-two peaks, thirty-six cliffs, and twenty-four ravines. It is the reserve of Songgao, a peer among the Five Peaks. It was the site of the *chai* and *wang* sacrifices in the Tang and Yu eras, and one of the seventy-two blessed lands.\n\nIts *qi* originates from *Qian* and *Dui*, coiling for ten thousand *li*, revolving like the image of the earth’s axis and the celestial gate. Its terrain is majestic—none but *Xuanwu* (Dark Warrior) is worthy of it, and so it was named Wudang. After the Perfected Lord of Blessing and Sagacity ascended, its temples and monasteries stood towering, immortals appeared and vanished, and its honors from successive dynasties are too numerous to recount.\n\nIn the twenty-third year of the Zhiyuan era, the Dharma Master Ye Xizhen, Liu Daoming, and Hua Dongzhen were summoned before the throne and appointed *Dudu Dian* (Chief Supervisor) of Wudang Mountain. They memorialized and received imperial decrees for protection, along with repeated offerings of imperial incense for prayers and blessings. Black tigers patrolled the corridors, crows heralded the dawn—truly a realm beyond the dust.",

      "translated_text": "The peaks and crags, streams and ravines—seventy-two in all—culminate in the Great Summit, the Celestial Pillar, whose fame rivals that of Mount Feng and Mount Can. Towering ten thousand *zhang*, it stands supreme among the seventy-two peaks. Above, it aligns with the Three Heavens, positioned at the juncture of the *Yi* and *Han* constellations. Below, it overlooks the prefectures of Dengzhou, Zhou, Xiangyang, and Fangzhou, a thousand *li* of land where the rising and setting of the sun and moon are plainly visible. Radiant clouds often shroud its ridges.\n\nThe summit spans seven *zhang* from east to west and nine *chi* from north to south, its four edges formed of stone ridges gleaming like gold and silver. The ground is carpeted with creeping vines and evergreen foliage that never withers, their fragrance sharp as herbs. At its center stands a stone hall enshrining the sacred countenance of the Dark Emperor. Streams cascade and swirl like dragons and serpents, their depths unfathomable. For it borders the heavens, buffeted by the fierce winds and vast *qi* of the void, even crows and auspicious birds dare not alight, circling instead at its flanks. Gazing down, the surrounding peaks appear no more than mounds. Those who ascend to the summit feel their bones chill and hairs stand on end. At the slightest gesture or murmur, fierce winds and thunderous rains descend.\n\nTo the south, at the base of a sheer cliff, lies a well-like pool called the Heavenly Pond, dwelling of dragons and spirits. In former times, prayers offered here were answered without fail, and the dragon king was enfeoffed as the Great Summit’s Benevolent Dragon King—a title still inscribed in stone. Below grow pines, cypresses, and fragrant trees of various kinds.\n\nTo the north stand three stone gates, known as the Three Celestial Gates. Each soars into the void for ten thousand *ren*, where even gibbons and cranes cannot ascend. Legend holds that the Dark Emperor ascended to the celestial court from here, borne aloft in his chariot. Those who seek audience must first burn incense and offer prayers at the Purple Cloud Palace before ascending the Great Summit, lest they meet with misfortune.\n\nUpon the mountain, one encounters two passes: the first is the Manifest Determination Pass, the second the Imperial Cliff Pass. Here, one must silently recite the immortal scriptures, invoke the patriarchs, and praise their merits—such devotion yields great merit. With a heart pure and reverent, the four *qi* grow bright and clear, the eight directions become transparent, and rare birds and wondrous omens manifest before one’s eyes.\n\nAt the summit stands a bronze pavilion, within which rests an incense burner and a statue of the Dark Emperor. Pilgrims burn incense, inscribe their names, and recite sutras. They must not linger long but descend swiftly, for the winds and rains will cleanse the impurities of the world. Should the will of the sage be unyielding and one insist on ascending, mists will shroud the peaks, obscuring high from low, while giant serpents and fierce beasts crouch beside the path. Truly, this is the realm of the Jade Void, the colorless boundary of reality.\n\nIt is said: *\"Not for a moment does the Great Summit depart, nor for an instant is the Southern Cliff absent.\"* Only after three lifetimes as a human may one ascend this mountain; only after seven may one dwell upon its earth. And again: *\"Only in the clearest and brightest of months may its truth be seen.\"* How true this is!\n\n**Manifest Determination Peak**\nNorth of the Great Summit, also called the Secondary Summit, it aligns above with the Heaven of Manifest Determination and Supreme Wind. Verdant cliffs pierce the sky, untouched by human footsteps, while propitious clouds and auspicious *qi* suffuse the air. Elders of old transmit that this is where the Celestial Perfected records the deeds of immortals—though its appearances shift and vanish.\n\n**Ten-Thousand-*Zhang* Peak**\nNortheast of the Great Summit, its ten-thousand-*ren* heights vanish into the clouds, where the cries of cranes and gibbons echo. None can reach its summit.\n\n**Lion Peak**",

Sheer cliffs soar into the void; unless one has attained the truth of the cavern-heaven, how could one rest here?

      "translated_text": "**Golden Cauldron Peak**\nWest of **Stacked-Character Peak**. The mountain resembles a cauldron, often exhaling clouds and mist. Below lies a crag called **Cloud-Concealing Rock**. Neither is an ordinary place of seclusion—approaching **Dragon Summit**, the yin qi presses upon one.\n\n**Crouching Dragon Peak**\nWest of **Dragon Summit Peak**. The mountain’s form crouches low; gazing in all directions, the dragon’s lair lies near, and few human traces reach here.\n\n**Five Dragons Peak**\nAlso called **Five Dragons Summit**, corresponding above to the **Dragon Transformation Brahmā Heaven**. Five peaks stand in array, with a sacred pool at their center that never fails even in great drought. A stone temple, called **Hall of the True Source**, serves as the divine abode of the Five Black Dragon Lords. To the east is a crag where the Five Black Dragon Lords are venerated; through the ages, prayers here have met with instant response. Though halls were built, they were shifted by wind and thunder. Stone paths wind upward, overgrown with vines, where white serpents and strange centipedes dwell among the grasses and trees. To the east lie **Spirit Response Peak** and **Five Dragons Palace**.\n\n**Spirit Response Peak**\nBehind **Five Dragons Palace**. Pines and cedars interlock in verdant ranks, soaring to the stars. Long ago, the immortal **Fang Changxu** planted these trees and personally encountered the **Dark Emperor**. The account appears in his hagiography. To the west stands the palace gate, with vegetable gardens, mugwort pools, and lotus ponds arranged above and below.\n\n**Hidden Immortal Peak**\nNorth of **Dragon Summit**. Below it lies **Hidden Immortal Crag**; the **Bamboo Pass** ahead is the second gate of the palace precincts. The **Mountain Spirit Hall** stands to the left of the path.\n\n**Yang Crane Peak**\nNorthwest of **Dragon Summit**. Linked peaks rise in layered ridges, with tall bamboo and lush forests. Several ancient cedars stand here, where auspicious cranes once nested—hence the name of the hermitage. Within are medicinal gardens and lotus ponds, where recluses dwell. Along the ridge lies the main ascent to the mountain. The **Shrine of Marshal Yao**, the **Mighty and Ardent King**, stands here.\n\n**Vigorous Man Peak**\nNortheast of the **Great Summit**, to the right of **Three Lords Mountain**. It commands the clouds and skies, thrusting toward the **Ox** and **Dipper** constellations, majestic as if the **Celestial Guards** stood in attendance. Below is a crag called **Daoist’s Rock**.\n\n**Grand Preceptor Peak, Grand Tutor Peak, Grand Guardian Peak**\nThree peaks east of the **Great Summit**, also called **Three Lords Mountain**. Before **Purple Empyrean Palace**, they stand like jade chimes in ordered ranks. Yellow cranes and gibbons leap and clamber, making approach impossible. Even the **Witch Gorge** and **Flowery Summit** seem unworthy to stand beside them. In all the world, no peaks surpass these in sheer grandeur. Below is a crag called **Three Lords Rock**. The mountains are lofty, the clouds deep; sunlight scarcely lingers here. Only those who have transcended grain may dwell in such a place.\n\n**First Elder Peak, True Elder Peak, August Elder Peak, Dark Elder Peak, Primordial Elder Peak**\nFive peaks southeast of the **Great Summit**, also called **Five Elders Peak**. The five peaks stand in formation, resembling an inkstone rest. When the **Dark Emperor** ascended, the Five Elders received the decree to prepare the way and halted their chariot here, where the earth spirits leapt forth in manifestation. Below lie **Ascending Truth Crag** and **White Cloud Gorge**. Its waters encircle the cliffs in cascading torrents, flowing out through **Nine Crossings Gorge**.\n\n**Immortal Peak, Recluse Peak**\nTwo peaks south of the **Great Summit**. The great ridge and towering mountains allow only distant admiration. Below lies **Recluse Crag**. Divine immortals often appear here—some seen with disheveled robes and unbound hair, others in strange and wondrous forms, their hands and feet bearing claws five to seven inches long. Some sit upon boulders, others bathe along the stream’s edge; their true qi presses upon one, making approach impossible. In a moment of inattention, they vanish without a trace.\n\n**Great Brightness Peak**\nWest of the **Great Summit**. Several peaks rise in solemn array, bathed in full yang brightness. Bamboo, trees, springs, and stones flourish in dense shade, where the mountains run deep and the paths are secluded, the land fertile and rich. Those who study the Dao often choose to dwell here. Within stands a hermitage called **Queen Mother’s Palace**. Several great pines stand in ranks around it. Elders of old say that the **Holy Mother, the Victorious and Good Empress**, once sought the **Dark Emperor** here, and the place was later named in her honor.\n\n**Central Nose Peak, Cloud-Gathering Peak, Hand-Clutching Peak, Bamboo Grove Peak, Tooth-Gnashing Peak**\nFive peaks southeast of the **Great Summit**. A ridge flies southward, the five peaks spreading out across towering ridges and deep ravines for several miles. A mountain path called **Magistrate’s Mute** lies here, the route between **Jun** and **Fang**; leeches infest the way, making it impossible to set foot. Below **Cloud-Gathering Peak** is a crag called **Cloud-Assembling**. Serpents and tigers dwell here—no place for cultivation.\n\n**Turtle Gate Peak**\nSoutheast of the **Great Summit**. Cloud-wreathed ridges stretch in layers, strange rocks standing firm. Mist and miasma rise like morning steam. Unless one is a woodsman or firewood gatherer, what business has one here?\n\n**Nine Ministers Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. The peaks are graceful and verdant, their forms rare and wondrous. Pines, bamboo, flowers, and herbs are arranged within and without. Tradition holds this as the place where the **Celestial Perfected** assess blessings. Below is a crag of the same name. Long ago, a Daoist wanderer lodged by the crag and heard the sounds of golden bells and jade chimes in the night. Below lies a deep pool, unreachable by any.\n\n**Subduing Demons Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. It receives the vein of the **Arriving Dragon**, its form mighty and imposing, its forests tall and proud. Below lie the **Great** and **Lesser Ghost Valleys**, where roaring torrents spray like snow, splitting the rocks to let the waters flow. Sacred turtles and giant serpents are often seen moving up and down. Tradition holds this as the place where the **Dark Emperor** subdued demons and awaited the imperial command in the **Hall of Obstructing Evil**.\n\n**Jade Laughing Peak**\nSouth of the **Great Summit**. Locals call it **Stone Man Mountain**, for its peaks resemble human forms. To the north is **Parrot-Crest Ridge**. The peaks split the earth as they rise, like fresh bamboo yet to be trimmed. Beyond the southern gorge lies the border of **Fang Prefecture**, with a mountain path leading through. Below is **Azure Peak Crag**, where the land is secluded and the soil fertile—also a place fit for self-cultivation.\n\n**Pillar of Integrity Peak, Great Leveler Peak**\nTwo peaks southwest of the **Great Summit**. They rival the **Celestial Pillar** and **Song Peak** in grandeur, their ridges and hills level as a sash. One peak arches back like a **pillar of jade**, the other lies flat as a palm holding up the sky—both domains where fierce beasts dwell.",

      "translated_text": "**The Thirty-Six Crags**\n\n**Purple Cloud Crag**, also called **Southern Crag** or **Solitary Yang Crag**, lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Robing Terrace, west of the Reverent Fire Crag, and south of the Immortal Song Crag. Facing the sun’s void and stillness, it leans against the cloudy heavens above and overlooks Tiger Gorge below. Lofty, bright, and expansive, its stones gleam like jade, naturally forming shapes of simurghs and phoenixes. Amid the pines’ wind through ten thousand ravines and the vast qi of a thousand cliffs, this is where the **Dark Emperor** refined his truth—where immortals wander and rest. Temples stand in ranks, housing the bronze statue of the **Blessed Sage**. In the *yichou* year of the Yuan Zhen era, the fangshi **Wang Daoyi** and **Mi Daoxing** rallied the faithful to cast it in Luling. The former **Academician of the Grand College**, Master **Liu Chenweng of Xuxi**, bowed and inscribed:\n\n*\"Before Heaven and Earth—lead in water.*\n*Smelted firm, the numinous wind and mist.*\n*Born the blue lotus;*\n*Sword coiled, altar wreathed.*\n*Survey the great kalpa—tortoise and serpent entwined.*\n*As kalpas turn, the heavens soar.*\n*Mysterious, mysterious, boundless—*\n*Ten thousand, ten thousand years.\"*\n\nThe true countenance was painted and sculpted. In the *jiashen* year of the Zhiyuan era, **Zhang Shouqing**, the crag’s resident, undertook great renovations. Stone paths were laid, pools filled with water, and the site named **Great Harmony Purple Cloud**. Temples arrayed across the crag, where morning bells and evening lamps resound, shaking the mountains and valleys—truly a realm beyond the mundane. At its heart lies a spring called **Sweet Dew**, its water glistening like pearls, sweet and crystalline. Recluses and enlightened scholars often dwell here—this is the first of the thirty-six crags.\n\nA hundred paces west along the ridge, a stone juts from a sheer cliff ten thousand *ren* high, called **Trial Heart Stone**. None reach it without trembling. Ten paces further stands the **Dark Emperor’s Robing Terrace**, where he exchanged his pine-and-moss robes for the bestowed crown and mantle. Below the terrace, a suspended stone chamber marks the **Crag of Gratitude to Heaven**, where he cultivated and refined. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan era, **Lu Dayou**, the **Cave Cloud Daoist**, renowned for his Way, revived the incense and offerings, receiving alms and veneration equal to the **Five Dragons** and **Purple Cloud** palaces.\n\n**Hidden Immortal Crag**, also called **Yin Immortal Crag** or **Northern Crag**, rises above Bamboo Pass. Towering into the clouds and mist, it overlooks the Han River, its stones like jade walls, revealing rare and wondrous forms. The ancient immortals **Yin Xi** and **Yin Gui** dwelled here, and many immortals of later ages refined the Great Elixir in this place. The alchemical chamber and furnace remain. In recent times, **Tian Suoyi** attained the Dao here in reclusion. Beneath a great tree to the crag’s right, a stone Go board lies flat, with stone seats arrayed on either side. Tradition holds this was where **Yin Gui** played Go. In the stillness of night, one often hears the ethereal chants and jade chimes of immortals, and glimpses their comings and goings, guarded by bears and tigers. *Recorded in the* **Gazetteer of Lands and Immortals**.\n\n**Immortal Song Crag** lies north of the Great Summit, facing the Gate of Heaven. The mountain’s meeting ground is level, and a spring flows from the crag with the sound of clashing gold and rinsing jade. Many immortals dwell here. Travelers who reach this place find not a trace of worldly dust. The spring is called **Hundred Flowers**; in ancient times, **Tao You’an** attained the Dao here.\n\n**Outer Dragon Crag** stands on **Pine-Moss Peak**, facing northeast. Open and lofty, it is unmatched in purity. On frosty moonlit nights, the cries of cranes and gibbons are exquisitely serene. Clouds and mist evoke the aura of Nanyang. **Yin Xi Crag**, also called **Immortal Crag**, has **Exhibition Banner Peak** to its north. Verdant peaks rise like brushes, and jade streams play like zithers. Here, **Master Wen Shi** once secluded himself. Below lies a gorge called **Ox Ford**. The **Most High** once transformed and visited **Xi**, and his blue ox remained outside—hence the name.\n\n**Heavenly Void Crag**, also called **Master Yu’s Crag**, lies east of **Immortal Pass** and above **Nine Waves Gorge**. A stone wall hangs midair, the crag soaring a hundred *ren* high. The gorge’s roar shakes like thunder, and wind and mist fill ten thousand ravines. Long ago, the recluse **Yu Huizhe** recited scriptures here, and an old man often came to listen. One day, the old man said: *\"I am a son of the Eastern Darkness, exiled here. My term is fulfilled, and I may return. I wish to offer my dwelling to you, noble one.\"* One night, thunder and rain reshaped the stone. In recent times, people fleeing war sought refuge here, but fire scorched the stone, and it became uninhabitable.",

To the southwest, all is joined with the mountain’s stone; whenever frost descends in the crisp dawn, there sometimes rise white and black mists like clouds, lingering for a time before dispersing—those who witness this feel their hair stand on end and their bones grow cold.\n\nBefore the **Duanping** era, when the mountain gate flourished in full splendor, **Cao Shide**, the monastic overseer, began constructing a treasure repository south of the pool.

If you persist in moving earth and shifting timber, the divine spirits will find no peace—what then will you do?\"* Awakening, he recounted the dream to his fellow monks, and all found their visions in accord. Thus, the repository hall was built but left unused, and a placard was posted by the pool’s edge, inscribed: *\"The Grotto Heaven lies near—passersby, lower your voices.\"*\n\nIn the **Gengshen** year of the **Zhongtong** era, when **Sun Siju**, the Pacification Commissioner, led his followers to submit to the court, it was the seventh month.

      "translated_text": "The Alchemy Pool and the Hermitage of Spontaneity lie paired fifty paces west of the Five Dragons Palace, ascending past the Well and Grip-the-Stars stars, nestled between two mountains. Pines and cedars twist and coil like dragons in disarray, yet though the three summer months swelter, no heat lingers here. Beneath the eastern eaves lies the Alchemy Pool, where a great stone in the water conceals a cavern—home to a dragon, often seen by visitors. Tigers, leopards, birds, and beasts frequent this place to drink.\n\nAccording to the prefectural map, this was the former site of Ma Mingsheng, later occupied by Chen Tuan. Here, Chen encountered the Five Black Dragon Lords, who bestowed upon him the art of sleep, granting him the marvel of foresight. The remnants of Mingsheng’s furnace, where he refined the Solar Spirit Elixir, remain—neither iron nor stone. Though Chen Tuan’s fame spread far, weary of constant visitors, he sought refuge at the Scripture-Recitation Terrace.\n\nThe Salt Pool marks where the Dark Emperor subdued demons, as recorded in the *Temple of the Protector Sage*. The Black Dragon Pool lies above the Immortal Pass, amid the waters of the Purple Cloud Gorge. Two towering stones stand within, their gap a mere thread above, widening below into a cavernous depth. The pool is unfathomable, and prayers for rain in times of drought are answered at once. A temple stands above it.\n\nThere are two White Dragon Pools: one below the Needle-Grinding Gorge, where a thousand-foot waterfall crashes down, and a temple nestles within the cliffs—prayers here are repeatedly answered; the other lies beneath the Ascension Terrace, its waters black and deep, clouds rising from its surface, instantly summoning rain. Few venture here.\n\nThe Thunder Grotto is where Deng Tianjun of the Fire Department cultivated the Dao, as noted at the Folding-Character Peak. The Peach-Blossom Grotto, within the Five Dragons, was where immortals tempered their swords, as recorded at Peach Source Peak. The Sweet Dew Spring lies at Purple Cloud Crag, as detailed in its own records.\n\nThe Dipper Spring sits beneath the Great Summit, south of the Stone Needle Peak. A spring emerges beneath a stone cliff, flanked by two stone wells. The *Illustrated Classic* states: though a thousand draw from it, it never runs dry; left undrawn, it never overflows—its waters correspond to the Dipper Star.\n\nThe Hundred-Flower Spring lies at Immortal Chant Crag, where the immortal Tao You’an attained the Dao, as recorded in its own records. The Dragon Well is at Heavenly Horse Peak, as noted beneath the peak. The Five Dragons Wells lie at the four corners of the Five Dragons Palace, with one well inside the Worship Hall—the traditional site for casting petitions. Today, it is sealed with stone. Its waters are sweet and pure, clear and bright; those who drink it claim it cures illness. Officials and Daoist abodes across the mountain, plagued by pestilence, find their afflictions vanish upon taking office here. Daoist companions draw its water to mix with medicine, healing all manner of ailments—such is the numinous power of the Dragon Well.\n\nThe Star Window is at White Cloud Peak, as recorded in the peak’s own records and the *Gazetteer of Lands*. Tiger Brook, also called the Ten-Thousand Tigers Gorge, is detailed in its own records. The Wind Cavern lies within the Ten-Thousand Tigers Gorge, as noted at Wind Crag. The origins and history of the temples and abbeys follow.",

Soldiers came to the pool to wash their swords, and the dragon gods emerged, their scales and manes rising along their spines.

Such is the immediacy of its numinous response.",

      "translated_text": "**Records of the Five Dragons Numinous Response Abbey**\n\nWhen the Dark Emperor ascended to true reality, the Five Dragons bore his chariot aloft, and their former hermitage became a shrine for venerating the perfected. The *Survey of Scenic Lands* states: \"The Five Dragons Abbey is their place of seclusion.\"\n\nIn the ninth year of the Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song, Prefect Wang Dexian of Junzhou submitted a memorial and was granted an imperial plaque, bestowing the name \"Numinous Response Abbey.\" A stele remains to this day. In the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan reign of the Yuan, Zhang the Perfected, Grand Master of the Dark Teachings and Commander of Jiang-Huai, elevated its official rank.\n\nThe abbey lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Five Dragons Peak, south of the Hidden Immortal Crag, and west of the Green Ram Gorge. Tigers and dragons crouch in coiled majesty, while forests and ridges encircle it in homage. Five wells are arrayed in proper order, with two pools at their center. Its halls rise in towering splendor, and its ritual images stand in solemn ranks. The mountain thrusts forth like the pivot of the earth.\n\nThe central hall, resplendent with gold and azure, is dedicated to the sacred countenance of the Dark Heavenly Emperor. The Emperor is depicted embracing the Five Dragons, his brows like dragons, his eyes like phoenixes, his radiance like the sun and moon. His hair flows unbound, his feet are bare, and all is sculpted from rare incense and pure lacquer. Jade maidens and golden lads strike swords and bear seals, while two ministers in court robes stand in attendance. Below the courtyard, four great heavenly warriors wield halberds and banners, forming a protective escort. The four walls depict scenes of his birth and attainment of the Dao, while behind them rise the forms of a black tortoise and a giant serpent, their water and fire ascending and descending.\n\nAscending the steps, three halls stand in ordered ranks: the central one is the Hall of Illuminating Perfection, dedicated to the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother, the Primordial Lady; to the south is the Hall of the Cassia Register, enshrining the Primordial Emperor; to the north is the Penglai Hall, housing the Ten Perfected Masters. Above them stands the Numinous Response Ascending Clouds Tower. The remaining halls and courtyards are too numerous to record here.\n\nEach year on the third day of the third month and the ninth day of the ninth month, rites are conducted and offerings received. Pilgrims gather like spokes around a hub, their presence as pure and refreshing as this place is unmatched.\n\nIn the early Song, Chen Tuan resided here. After the southward crossing of the Shaoxing reign, Sun Yuanzheng, a Daoist from the Qingzhen Abbey on Mount Mao, established its foundations. When the Jin fell, Tang Shoucheng, the Gourd-and-Straw-Hat Master, restored its former glory. At the end of the Song, Wang Yining of the Chaoran Abbey in Jiangling oversaw it. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan reign, Wang Sizhen of the Quanzhen School revived its ancestral teachings. In the *bingxu* year, Ye Xizhen of Jianning assumed the post of Chief Supervisor. All these were pioneers who cleared the wilderness and laid its foundations, and thus they are recorded here.\n\n---\n\n**Purple Cloud Palace**\n\n\"Purple Cloud\" is another name for the Dark Heaven. The palace lies north of the Great Summit, east of the Unfurled Banner Peak, west of the Temple of Awesome Might, and south of the Crown Prince Crag. Before it stand the Three Lords—peaks like ten-thousand-*ren* jade bamboo leaning against the sky. Behind it rests the distant screen of the Seven Ridges, their dark folds resembling a coiled starry serpent. Pines and cedars stand tall, flowers and trees exude fragrance, halls rise in lofty grandeur, and corridors connect in orderly succession. The imperial visage is revered and solemn, the divine presence awe-inspiring, all modeled after the system of the Five Dragons Abbey. Yet the terrain here is open and expansive, not easily matched.\n\nThis is a place for immortals to refine their nature and cultivate their minds, a court for the state to pray for blessings. It was first built during the Xuanhe reign of the Song. The plaque with its imperial inscription was lost in the *jiawu* conflagration, carried away by its custodian on a journey south. Before the *gengshen* year, the prefectural seat was relocated here, and the people all settled in its vicinity. Later, when Pacification Commissioner Sun Siju led the masses to submit, for fifteen or sixteen years, no officials remained. In the *yihai* year of the Zhiyuan reign, the mountain gates were reopened, and only the main hall remained, still worthy of veneration.\n\nIn the *dingchou* year, the Daoist Li Shouchong cleared the brambles at its front. In the *wuyin* year, the Khitan female official Xiao Shoutong built a hall at its rear. Rites and offerings are conducted here as at the Five Dragons Abbey.\n\n---\n\n**Temple of the Protective Sage**\n\nLocated fifty *li* southeast of the Great Summit, beside the Double Streams Gorge and north of the Salt Pond. To its left rises the Cinnabar Turtle Peak, layered in emerald; to its right crouches the Demon-Quelling Flying Void formation. Salt flowers gleam like snow, green bamboo sways in the wind, level fields spread like acres of golden clouds, and the numinous pond displays the auspicious hues of ten thousand years.\n\nFrom ancient times, it has been said that the Dark Emperor subdued and imprisoned a demonic essence beneath a stone here. A salty spring flows into the pond, commonly called the Ablution Pool. Though officials have forbidden its use, the spring’s source has gradually dried up, and thus a temple was built to suppress it.\n\nThe mountain’s form is steep and striking, narrow yet grand. Since suffering the calamities of war, only its old foundations remain. In the *wuyin* year of the Zhiyuan reign, the Daoist Zhao Shoujie, known as Azure Cloud, renowned for his mastery of the Dao, methods, and divination, led his disciples here. Within a few years, halls and ritual images were all restored. The surrounding mountains stand in ranks, a single plain stretches before it, and the provisions for the Daoist community—rare delicacies and fine foods—require no laborious transport. Rites and offerings are conducted anew, reviving its former glory.\n\n---\n\n**Palace of the Queen Mother**\n\nSituated among the southern peaks of the Great Summit. Clouds and mist intertwine in the heights and depths, forests and foothills rise and fall on either side. Far removed from the clamor of the world, its true traces are manifest. Here, the Sage Mother, the Victorious Empress Dowager, once sought the perfected, and thus it was named. Only those who have severed worldly attachments can dwell here.\n\n---\n\n**Cloud Mist Abbey**\n\nLocated to the right of the Fire-Suppressing Crag and south of the Unfurled Banner Peak. Dark ridges encircle it, clouds and mist unfurl and gather. In the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan reign, Perfected Master Zhang bestowed an abbey plaque and established its foundations.\n\n---\n\n**Divine Immortal Traces**\n\nThe **Grindstone Rock**",

      "translated_text": "Roughly one *li* north of the Five Dragons Abbey lies a ravine called the Grindstone Ravine. Its source descends from the Five Dragons Summit, where cascading springs and strange rocks meet towering trees and fragrant grasses. Along the ravine’s edge lies a spirit stone, its surface bearing the marks of grinding. From ancient times to the present, it has been said: When the Dark Emperor was refining his true nature, he grew weary after long effort, his progress seeming elusive. Wandering to the ravine below, he saw a divine woman grinding an iron pestle—this was the miraculous transformation of the Purple Primordial Sovereign. He asked, *“What are you grinding?”* She replied, *“I live in these mountains, and my mother-in-law lost her needle. I grind to replace it.”* He said, *“Turning an iron pestle into a needle is no easy task.”* She answered, *“It is only a matter of time and effort.”* The Dark Emperor was deeply enlightened. Thereafter, he redoubled his diligence in cultivation and ultimately attained the perfection of the celestial truth.\n\n**Sword-Testing Stone**\nWithin the Second Heavenly Gate of the Great Summit stands a stone split cleanly down the middle, the mark of a sword still vividly visible. Tradition holds this to be where the Dark Emperor tested his blade.\n\n**Immortal’s Chessboard Stone**\nThe place where the immortal Yin Gui played *weiqi*. Located at the Hidden Immortal Crag. (See account under that crag.)\n\n**Heart-Testing Stone**\nWest of the Purple Empyrean Crag. (See account under that crag.)\n\n**Three Heavenly Gates**\nAt the foot of the Great Summit, where Yin Xi once dwelled in truth. (See account under Heavenly Pillar Peak.)\n\n**Shrine of the Mulberry-Plum Immortal Elder**\nNorth of the Five Dragons Abbey and a hundred paces above the Grindstone Stone stand one or two withered trees, beside which rises a towering specimen called the Mulberry-Plum. The fruit of this tree resembles a plum in shape but bears the pit of a peach. Elders of old have passed down that when one of these trees withers, never exceeding the height of a man, another soon flourishes in its place—truly the fruit of immortals. Below stands a shrine dedicated to the Mulberry-Plum Immortal Elder. In the fourth and fifth months, when the fruit ripens, the tree’s height obscures its form. Those who pray to the Immortal Elder find the fruit falls of its own accord after a time. Eaten, its taste is tart yet sweet. Yet it is rarely obtained, serving as an omen of abundance or scarcity: in years of plenty, the fruit is plentiful; in lean years, it vanishes. Tradition holds that when the Dark Emperor gained enlightenment at the Grindstone, he plucked a plum blossom and thrust it into the wood, vowing, *“If I attain the Dao, you shall bear fruit.”* Thus, this numinous root and immortal trace remain unchanged through ten thousand ages.\n\n**Elixir-Calcining Furnace**\nThe place where the perfected ones refined the elixir. (See account under Hidden Immortal Crag.)\n\n**Natural Hermitage**\nWhere the immortal Ma Mingsheng refined the elixir.

      "translated_text": "**Black Tiger**\nA manifestation of the Northern Celestial One, the mountain’s guardian spirit. Its transformations are myriad: at times it assumes human form, clad in golden armor and a morning robe, bearing the aspect of a general; at others, it reveals its true shape—black-maned and dark-furred, resembling a lion. It may appear as large as a *li* or as small as a leopard. To encounter it is inauspicious, yet to dream of it brings fortune. Patrolling the corridors and halls by night, its divine traces endure; those of ill intent are instantly repelled. The *Elixir Canon* states: *\"The tiger is born toward the water.\"*\n\n**White Serpent**\nA remnant breath of winged transcendents, the numinous spirit of blessed lands. Four-nosed and eight-fanged, its manifestations defy prediction. It coils upon boulders or by the banks of outer streams—now as vast as a ridgepole, now as slender as a finger’s tendon. Suddenly it appears in illusions upon stools, tables, or bedding, or pursues the wicked along roads. In dreams, its marvels are boundless, beyond brush or tongue to recount.\n\n**Spirit Crow**\nEndowed with the hue of the north, it serves as the numen of Wudang. Forewarning fortune or misfortune, its omens—whether gentle or stern—never fail to manifest. Several often roost upon the eaves of halls, and at dusk or dawn, they clamor and flutter within. Tradition holds this is the bird that heralds the dawn. Yet, indifferent to the distinction between self and other, they show no fear. At morning and evening offerings, they soar and wait for food; among them, one with a red beak brings good fortune to those who see it.\n\n**White Pheasant**\nResembling a pheasant but with a tail four or five *chi* long, its crest is vermilion and its spurs iron-black, its plumage dark below and pale above. It calls to its kin among the verdant pines and emerald bamboos—truly a transcendent fowl. Yet it refuses captivity, choosing death over confinement.\n\n**Brocarded Pheasant**\nIts colors span all five hues, its feathers attuned to the four seasons. When it preens its wings and combs its plumes, circling cliffs or resting by bamboo, it commands reverence and affection. Often it wanders near courtyards, drinking and pecking at will.\n\n**Flying Squirrel**\nResembling a squirrel but elongated, with a blue tail and short neck, it leaps through trees with the agility of a gibbon’s swing. The people call it the \"immortal mouse.\"\n\n**My Master Bird**\nClad in brown plumage with a golden beak, its head is green and its feet crimson. On clear autumn nights, from the heights of lofty peaks and the depths of forests, it cries: *\"My master!\"*—throughout the night without cease. Tradition says that when the Dark Emperor ascended, the fragrant chambers stood empty, and the mountain birds mourned without end.\n\n**Half-Music**\nShaped like a yellow bunting, they gather in flocks of dozens. Their songs align with the *gong* and *shang* tones, evoking the rhythm of zither music and chanting. Tradition holds that when the Dark Emperor dwelled in truth, the earth spirits presented this auspicious sign, which is still seen from time to time.\n\n**Marvelous Herbs and Sacred Trees**\n\n**Ten-Thousand-Year Pine**\nAn auspicious herb of blessed lands, no taller than five *cun*, its color a deep green, its roots and leaves perfectly proportioned. It grows in the crevices of sheer cliffs and precipices, and is gathered by scaling the rock face. Those who obtain it may plant it in moist soil, and it will revive at once. Pressed and stored in bamboo tubes, it revives as before. If touched by oily hands, it withers and yellows by day’s end, as though afflicted by malevolent spirits.

When autumn dew hovers in the air, it rises like lingzhi from the ground—crimson and crisp, its flavor bittersweet. It cures ailments caused by alcohol excess.\n\n**Pine Lichen**\nThe immortal robe of the Dark Emperor, sacred descendant of the Blessed Court. It grows upon ancient trees of lofty peaks, some over a *zhang* in length. It heals stubborn sores from snakebites, tiger wounds, scalds, and burns. Chew the lichen, swallow its juice, and apply the dregs to the wound—recovery is immediate. Though found on other mountains, none are known to cure illness.\n\n**Heavenly Flower**\nCrimson and elegant, each bloom bears threads over a *chi* long. In late autumn, they bloom in profusion, secluded and lovely. When the Dark Emperor ascended to immortality, he scattered them across the cliffs and valleys, and to this day, his immortal descendants propagate them endlessly.\n\n**Cloud Bamboo**\nA numinous marvel of the earth, congealed within bamboo. Its purple sheen and dark veins astonish all who see it. Amid dense forests, one or two may be glimpsed.\n\n**Shaluo Tree**\nIts leaves never wither, its trunk towering and lofty. Its fruit resembles large chestnuts, growing in the shaded depths of great ravines and mountains, evoking the vast canopy of the Moon Palace.\n\n**Fangqian Tree**\nIts leaves are verdant and graceful, its trunk massive and tall. Its roots and branches naturally intertwine with vines in a manner unmatched by even the finest paintings.

      "translated_text": "The Divine Titles of the Heaven-Sealed Dark Emperor, as Recorded in the *Biographies of Immortals*\n\n**Divine Titles:**\nMarshal and Heaven-Pacifying Great General of the Dark Warrior, Chief Administrator of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Wandering Patrol, Grand Commander of the Left Celestial North Pole and Right Enclosure of the Three Realms, Judge of Divine, Immortal, Ghost, and Spirit Affairs in the Right Victory Prefecture of the Dark Capital, Director of the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and Relocation, Purple Sovereign of the Heaven of the One Celestial Day, Preceptor of the Jade Void, and Dark Heaven Thearch.\n\n**Song-Dynasty Bestowed Titles:**\nTrue Warrior of the North Pole, Heaven-Pacifying, Protective, Holy, Assisting, Compliant, Numinous, Responsive, Blessed, Virtuous, Benevolent, Salvific, Upright, Ardent, Harmonious, and Transformative Lord—originally named the Dark Warrior, but during the Song Dynasty, the name was altered to \"True Warrior\" to avoid taboo.\n\n**The Kingdom of Serene Joy, as Recorded in the Biographies:**\nIt lies beneath the Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent.\n\nThe *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure* states: The Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent is the northern heaven, one of the Four Peoples’ Heavens, situated above the Formless Realm. Its color is red, its aspect that of the Great Void, its palace the Numinous Treasure. Below, it corresponds to the constellation Lou in the western quadrant.\n\nThe *Illustrated Records of Wudang* further notes: The Five Dragon Peaks—one summit aligns with the Heaven of Dragon-Transformed Brahmanic Ascent, where the Five Black Dragon Lords of the North reside.\n\nThirty *li* south of present-day Junzhou, there is a village called Le Du. Tradition holds that this is the ancient and eternal Land of Joy. At the foot of the eastern mountains of the village lie several ancient tombs. Elders pass down that these are the burial mounds of the kings of Serene Joy.\n\nThe *Records of Local Customs* states: In ancient times, Junzhou was known as the Land of Elaphures, where the people were simple and rustic, serene, joyful, and virtuous. Though likened to deer, they dwelt in peace.\n\nThe *Biographies of Immortals* recount: The Yellow Thearch was born in the Land of Youxiong, the Red Thearch in the Land of the Li Mountain Clan, and the Dark Thearch in the present Land of Joy. Given the Dark Thearch’s divine merit and sagely virtue, by which all things are nourished, moistened, and brought to life, it was deemed unfitting to retain the name \"Land of Elaphures.\" Instead, for its people’s serenity, joy, and goodness, it was renamed Serene Joy—thus is the matter made clear.\n\nObserving the customs of Junzhou, the waters of Taihe Bay wind in a hundred bends, forming a grotto-heaven of immortals. Cross-referencing ancient histories and immortal biographies, there is no doubt that the Kingdom of Serene Joy is none other than Junzhou.\n\n**The Divine Lineage:**\nThe *Canon of the Great Mystery* states: Heaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire. The Dark Emperor governs the spirit of Heaven One, hence the saying: \"Essence of the Water Position.\" His palace is called the Palace of Heaven One.\n\nThe *Biographies of Immortals* state: The essence of Heaven One is the Dark Emperor; the *qi* of Heaven One is the Water Star; the spirit of Heaven One is the Five Numinous Elder Lords; the manifestation of Heaven One corresponds to the constellations Xu and Wei, which is the Dark Warrior. Though his name is one, his forms are two—appearing as a dark tortoise and a crimson serpent. His essence and *qi* transform into rain and dew, rivers and lakes, seas and oceans. All things that fly or emit sound are transformations of Heaven One.\n\nWater and fire ascend and descend; tortoise and serpent unite in form. Thus are the myriad beings born, and the Dark Emperor is their sovereign—the Thearch of Heaven One.\n\n**Records of the Dark Emperor:**\nAccording to the *Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Abyss*: Before form and desire arose, the primordial state was indistinct, the Great Dao profound and obscure. One *qi* congealed the Three Treasures in the era before color and desire. The Five Kalpas intermingled in the flux of near and far. From this arose the Supreme, and from it, pattern emerged. Heavy and turbid sank; light and pure rose. Heaven and Earth took their places, each governing its domain.\n\nHeaven One generated water in the Kan Palace; spirit and transformation took form in the Kun Mound. Fire, wood, metal, and earth settled in their directions; red, blue, white, and yellow each assumed their celestial offices. Stars, constellations, sun, and moon unfolded the subtle principles of the cosmos, giving rise to forms. The exalted and profound deities embodied the love of life, adapting their teachings to the times. Vast and boundless, resplendent and luminous—so wondrous as to defy description, so profound as to elude comprehension.\n\nThe North Pole Protective and Holy Dark Warrior, Heaven of the One Celestial Day, Dark Heaven Thearch—Thearch of Heaven One, essence of the Water Position.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Great Ultimate* states: The essence of Heaven One is the Dark Emperor, who presides over the Kan direction, governing the myriad existences. The *qi* of Heaven One is the Water Star, assisting the Great Dao in its revolutions and transformations. The spirit of Heaven One is the Five Numinous Elder Lords, aiding the heavens in their pivot. The manifestation of Heaven One corresponds to the constellations Xu and Wei. Governing the north’s warp and weft, it is the Dark Warrior. Though his name is one, his forms are two—the dark tortoise and the crimson serpent. His essence and *qi* transform into rain and dew, rivers and lakes, seas and oceans. All things that fly or emit sound are transformations of Heaven One. When tortoise and serpent unite in form, Heaven and Earth take their places. Only the Dark Emperor, Thearch of Heaven One, can command and regulate them.\n\nEarth Two generates fire, presiding over the Li direction—this is the Red Thearch, whose image corresponds to the Vermilion Bird. Heaven Three generates wood, presiding over the east—this is the Blue Thearch, whose image corresponds to the Azure Dragon. Earth Four generates metal, presiding over the west—this is the White Thearch, whose image corresponds to the White Tiger. As for the number Heaven Five, the Yellow Thearch rules the center, above all spirits—this is not elaborated here.\n\nAfter the severing of the turtle and the snake, the Five Thearchs assisted the Great Dao. The Dark Emperor possesses the virtues of moistening and engendering, supreme softness and goodness, cleansing filth and dispelling miasma, and tranquil impartiality. His influence extends above to the layered heavens and below to the flying and burrowing creatures; none among the moving and growing fail to depend on him.\n\nFrom the Primordial Blackness of the Dark Origin, across kalpas, he descended, expounding scriptures to deliver humanity. Thus, the Thearch commanded the Dark Emperor to descend into the mortal realm: during the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he appeared as the Perfected of the Great Beginning; during the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of the Great Commencement; and during the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected of the Great Simplicity. In those times, governance relied on knotted cords, and records cannot be verified.\n\nBy the dawn of the Kaihuang Kalpa, when the chaotic darkness dissipated and the true Dao was to prevail, the lower realm of the Southern Continent still languished in a state of raw flesh and blood, cave-dwelling and wilderness-roaming. The Thearch then commanded the Five Thearchs to descend in succession to the mortal world, transforming and nurturing the common people.",

      "translated_text": "The Blue Thearch was the first to descend, alighting upon the earthly realm, where he was named Taihao and styled Fuxi. He established states and domains, observed celestial patterns to discern the laws, and thereby inaugurated the arts of astrology. He defined the proper relations between ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife. The Dragon Chart emerged from the River, the Tortoise Script appeared at the Luo; he drew the trigrams and created writing, spreading virtue and bestowing benevolence.\n\nThe Red Thearch was born in the state of Lishan, now known as Suizhou, where he became the Flame Thearch, styled Shennong. He cultivated the hundred grains, enabling the people to partake of grain-based sustenance. Yet the blazing command of his fire virtue gave rise to strife among the feudal lords and the tyranny of Chiyou—a consequence of the times. Since the Red Thearch governed by fire and the Dark Thearch by water, and water and fire bear signs of inseparability, the Dark Thearch descended thereafter, born in the state of Zhengle as Zhaoyao Tongguang, styled Yunqian.\n\nThe Yellow Thearch was born in the state of Youxiong—historically identified by Shi Huang as present-day Xinzheng in Henan—where he was named Xuanyuan and styled the Yellow Thearch. The White Thearch was also born within the Yellow Thearch’s palace, named Shaohao and styled Jintian.\n\nAll upheld the orthodox succession, nurturing the multitudes, quelling disorder, and recording their merits before returning to their celestial stations. The Dark Thearch, endowed with the essence of Heavenly Unity, devoted himself to tranquil response, disdaining the throne. His aspiration was to return to his root, so the Thearch, with the surplus qi of Heavenly Unity, descended into the palace of Jintian, where he was born as Zhuanxu, styled Gaoyang, to wield the tally and govern the masses in the Dark Thearch’s stead.\n\nUpon examination: the day the Dark Thearch descended into the state of Zhengle coincided with the final years of Shennong’s reign. The year was *guanfeng dunpang*, the cyclical year *jiawu*, in the month of *Guxin*, on the third day of the waxing moon, when the sun’s chariot stood at the celestial meridian at noon. He embodied the yang essence of Heavenly Unity, conceived through divine transformation in the celestial region of the *Yi*, *Han*, and *Lou* constellations, beneath the *Longbian Fandutian*. After gestating for fourteen months in the womb of Lady Shansheng of the state of Jingle, he emerged from his mother’s left side at birth. At the moment of his birth, auspicious clouds and rare fragrances manifested—omens too wondrous to recount.\n\nFrom infancy, he was divinely gifted. By the age of seven, he could peruse astronomical texts and written records, comprehending them at a glance. He devoted himself to the supreme Dao, aspiring to serve the Thearch and bring universal blessings to the people. Seeking seclusion in the hidden valleys to refine his primordial essence, he was moved by the response of the Boundless Purple Prime Lady, who bestowed upon him the highest Dao.\n\nThe Prime Lady pointed to Mount Taihe and declared: “This mountain’s veins rise from *Qian* and *Dui*, winding for fifty thousand li. Its waters flow from the *Zhen* Palace, and its earth corresponds to the *Yi* and *Ji* constellations. It manifests the heavens of *Xiandingji Feng* and *Tai’an Huangya*. You may dwell here, for it accords with the Great Harmony. Ascend and return to your station, assisting the Great Dao, and stand peerless with heaven, earth, sun, and moon.” Having spoken, she ascended upon the clouds and departed.\n\nAt fifteen, he took leave of his parents. Though his father could not restrain his resolve, he entered the mountain, embracing emptiness and the Mysterious Unity, silently communing with the myriad perfected beings. Standing nine feet tall, his face was round as the full moon, his brows arched like dragons, his eyes bright as phoenixes. His hair was bound in a topknot, his beard fine; his countenance was as pure as ice. Clad in garments of pine and vine, his hair unbound and feet bare, he cultivated his true nature for forty-two years, attaining the supreme Dao.\n\nAt that time, Xuanyuan the Yellow Thearch ruled and governed the people. In the year *gengyin*, on the ninth day of the ninth month at dawn, the four qi were luminous and clear. Phoenixes and cranes, celestial blossoms swirling in flight, filled the air, while the forests and peaks resounded with harmony. Spontaneous strains of *buxu* immortal music arose, and the earth transformed into hues of gold and jade. The Dark Thearch stood with hands clasped upon the terrace. In an instant, a host of immortals, mounted escorts, chariots, and banners descended beside the terrace—an assembly beyond mortal perception.\n\nThe Five Perfected presented the *Tai Xuan* Jade Register, declaring: “By the Thearch’s command, we summon you to ascend.” The Dark Thearch reverently bowed. The edict proclaimed:\n\n*“By imperial decree: The divine youth of the state of Jingle, the Dark Thearch, whose name embodies the transformation of the Mysterious Origin and the honor of Heavenly Unity, has fulfilled his merit and perfected the Dao. Ascend to the Golden Portal. You are hereby appointed Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, Judge of the Bureau of Primordial Harmony, and Inspector of Transitions. Bestowed upon you are: the Nine-Virtue Crescent Moon Golden Dawn Jade Crown, the Jade Hairpin of Qionghua, the Jasper Jade Scepter, the Purple Mist Flying Cloud Gold Radiance Robe, the Vermilion Skirt of Feathered Splendor, the Seven-Treasure Gossamer Garment, the Crimson Shoes of Primordial Light, the Sacred Seal, the Dragon Sword, the Feathered Canopy, the Jade Wheel, the Nine-Light Nine-Node Staff, the Ten Mystic Tassels, the Eight Phoenixes and Nine Phoenixes, the Heavenly Soldiers and Jade Maidens, and a retinue of ten thousand chariots. Proceed to the imperial court.”*\n\nThe edict was received and obeyed. The Dark Thearch bowed to the Thearch’s command.",

      "translated_text": "The Five Perfected advanced and declared, “We are commanded to open the way for you.”\n\nOne Perfected said, “I am your other self, the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder of the Black Knot Spirit Tassel. Though you did not ascend to the royal throne, your resolve lay in returning to the origin—this is truly worthy of praise. Your parents in the mundane world have already attained the rank of Perfected Immortals.”\n\nAt that time, the Five Black Dragon Lords lifted you upward. Arriving at the summit of Purple Empyrean Peak, you doffed your garments of pine and mistletoe and donned the bestowed crown and robes. Soaring through the void above the great summit, you mounted a cinnabar carriage drawn by green chariots, borne aloft by the Five Dragons. Ascending through the celestial clouds, you personally attended the audience of the Supreme Thearch and assumed your office at the palace gate.\n\nLater, the name *Taihe* was changed to *Wudang Mountain*.\n\nBy the end of the *Kaihuang* kalpa, the living beings of the lower world, basking in the prosperity of peace, grew arrogant and extravagant, deceitful and insolent, abandoning substance for vanity. The kalpa’s reckoning approached, and tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials, along with demons and malevolent spirits, mingled between the realms of yin and yang. During the reign of King Zhou of Shang, cruelty and oppression ran rampant. The hordes of the Six Heavens’ demons manifested in various forms, omens and portents arose in succession, and humans and ghosts became indistinguishable. Malice and venom coiled together, harming the common people.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Supreme Thearch was expounding the Dao in the Hall of the Eight Effulgences within the Upper Prime Palace of the Heavenly Palace. The noxious miasma of black poison and bloody pollution surged upward to the Heavenly Gate. The Wondrous Conduct Perfected One knelt and implored the Thearch’s majestic radiance to personally descend and eradicate them.\n\nThe Supreme Thearch proclaimed to the August Heavenly Thearch, rectifying the celestial reckoning: the divine spirit of *Tianyi* of the kalpa would descend and be born in the land of the Ji clan in the Western Regions, named *Fa*, to become King Wu of Zhou and bring order to the world. As the essence of *Tianyi*, the Dark Thearch commanded the gods of *Ding*, *Jia*, wind, rain, water, and fire, all subject to his governance, capable of sweeping away defilement and impurity.\n\nThe Jade Lads of the Right Attendants were dispatched bearing talismans to summon the Dark Thearch. Upon receiving the decree, he ascended to attend the celestial audience and reverently accepted the Thearch’s command. He assembled the true forms of *Kan* and *Li*—the Azure Tortoise and the Mighty Serpent—along with the *Ding*, *Jia*, Five Thunder Divine Soldiers, three hundred thousand spirit generals, the Great Rainbow, lions, venomous dragons, and fierce beasts. Together, they descended to the lower world to carry out the celestial punitive expedition.\n\nAddressing the assembled hosts, he declared: “Born of the Great Yin, the essence of the Water trigram, corresponding above to the constellations *Xu* and *Wei*, the union of tortoise and serpent in form. Within seven days, all demons and malevolent spirits under heaven shall be captured and severed.” The tally was recorded and presented, and the demons were bound and imprisoned in *Beideng*.\n\nHe then returned to the Pure Capital and ascended to the Golden Gate to attend the Thearch’s audience. The Supreme Thearch commended his efforts and commanded the August Heavenly Thearch to advance his immortal rank. The Proclamation was issued to the Celestial Scribe of the Dark Mystery, the Grand Cinnabar Perfected One of the Jade Florescence Academy, who was ordered to compile the Jade Register. The register stated:\n\n*“Of you, who embodies the auspiciousness of the Primal Qi of Chaos, whose Dao is complete and whose yang is revered, who governs the people with meticulous care, not a hairbreadth amiss—now, as the kalpa’s reckoning converges and good and evil intermingle, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings arise, harming the common people of the Nine Lands. Without true power, how could purity and tranquility be restored? Your virtue is profound, your merit lofty; words cannot suffice in praise. You shall return to your root and original position. If not for such illustrious titles, how could your virtue be manifested? The Golden Script is bestowed; do not decline with modesty. You are hereby advanced and enfeoffed as: Grand General of the Dark Warrior Who Guards Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, Grand Marshal of the Right Wall of the Northern Culmen of the Left Heaven, Supreme Commander of the Three Realms’ Affairs of Gods, Immortals, and Ghosts, and Judge of the Right Victory Bureau of the Dark Capital, Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly Unity. As before, you shall serve as Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, overseeing the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and the Office of Transitions. Upon receipt of this register, comply and act accordingly.”*\n\nThe Supreme Thearch commanded the Dark Thearch to resume his original form: hair unbound, feet bare, treading upon the tortoise and serpent, raising the black banner of the early dawn. Clad in armor and bell, he would eternally guard the *Kan* position. On every *Jiazi* and *Gengshen* day, and on the third, seventh, and fifteenth of each month, he would descend to the mortal realm to inspect the good and evil, cultivation and transgressions of humanity, universally bestowing blessings upon the living, upholding and protecting the state and the altars of soil and grain.\n\nAfter receiving the decree, the Dark Thearch manifested in myriad transformations, becoming the Master of Teachings, delivering and saving the world of humans—boundless and immeasurable. In grotto-heavens and blessed lands, his numinous responses were manifest, too vast to be recorded in full. His grace and beneficence were vast, his wisdom and virtue immense. There was never a moment he did not think of sentient beings, never an instant he did not pity the lower world. He is the Great Compassionate Universal Savior, the Supreme Dharma King.\n\nFormerly, on the Heavenly Midst Festival of the second year of *Jiayou* in the Song dynasty, the myriad Perfected of the Three Realms ascended to attend the Primordial Supreme Thearch. The Three Treasures’ August Honored Ones and the August Heavenly Thearch presented the *Jade Calendar of Merit and Transgression of the Myriad Heavens’ Pristine Might*. The Celestial Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Golden Gate, the Great Spirit Marshal, the Perfected Lords of Life-Commanding, Name-Recording, Merit-Investigating, and Transgression-Protecting examined the Dark Thearch’s meritorious deeds. The Five Elders, the Eleven Luminaries, the Northern Dipper, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, from the most ancient times to the present, had governed yin and yang with such accomplishment that his merit equaled that of the Heavenly Worthy. The Three Officials and Four Saints, the Great Unity’s transformative influence, assisting heaven and pacifying earth—his merit was second only to the Heavenly Thearch.\n\nAt that time, the Three Bureaus of the Golden Gate reviewed and deliberated upon his sagely merit, confirming that it rivaled that of the Heavenly Lords of the various heavens. The Three Officials and Four Saints were all enfeoffed with the title of *Imperial Perfected*. On the Celestial Wax Festival, they were summoned to the Three Heavenly Gates, where their names were inscribed upon the Jade Casket. The Celestial Scribe of the Left Attendants of the Golden Gate, the Perfected Lord of Literary Arts of the Pure Mystery Academy, and the Celestial Scribe of the Right Attendants of the Golden Gate, the Perfected Lord of Sacred Texts of the Treasure Chapter Academy, were commanded to compose the Jade Registers. On the Upper Prime Festival, the Three Officials and Four Saints were enfeoffed with imperial titles. The registers were inscribed on jade tablets in golden script, the characters rendered in dragon and phoenix seal script, encased in cloud-brocade and precious satchels, protected by caskets of jasper and jade, secured with golden dragon locks.\n\nThe Jade Register of the Dark Thearch proclaimed:\n\n*“Oh, the majestic and most true, the august and great Dao! When the Grand Luminary first divided, the Mysterious Origin transformed and gave birth. The pivot of the myriad heavens, the revered of the Three Realms—his glory is vast and boundless; fittingly, he is to be exalted and honored. The Marshal of the Supreme Mystery, Grand General of the Dark Warrior Who Guards Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Primes, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, Grand Marshal of the Right Wall of the Northern Culmen of the Left Heaven, Supreme Commander of the Three Realms’ Affairs of Gods, Immortals, and Ghosts, Judge of the Right Victory Bureau of the Dark Capital, and Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly Unity—Dark Thearch, whose name is Numinous Penetration of the Great Mystery, whose Dao is complete and whose radiance is resplendent, who above opens the mystery of the Primal Transformation and below governs the elegance of *Xu* and *Wei*...”*",

Proceed to the imperial court.”*\n\nThe edict was received and obeyed. The Dark Thearch bowed to the Thearch’s command.",

      "translated_text": "He upholds the earth’s foundation and nurtures the heavens’ origin, sustaining creation through the four seasons and extending the warp and weft through the eight solar terms. His merit surpasses fifty thousand kalpas, his virtue equals the thirty-two heavens—profound and boundless, subtle yet radiant. According to the records, he ranks next to the Imperial Perfected; without exalted honors, how could his power be made manifest? Thus, we respectfully dispatch the Golden Perfected, Purple Yang Grand Master, Golden Watchtower Attendant, Minister of the Jade Capital, Grand Academician of the Plain Spirit Hall, Director of the Three Heavens’ Gate, and Daily Attendant of the Repository of Numinous Treasures, the Memorial-Presenting, Radiant, Supreme Virtue Immortal Lord Xuanyuan Zhibenmai, bearing the jade tablets, to specially appoint him as Preceptor of the Jade Void and Prime Minister to the Dark Thearch of Heaven, concurrently serving as Inspector of the Nine Heavens. Henceforth, he shall assist the Great Dao above, enduring through kalpa after kalpa, and protect the myriad people below, bestowing blessings without end. The dragon-script decree descends in splendor—let him not decline. Upon receipt of this edict, let it be reverently obeyed.\n\nThereupon, the Dark Thearch and his host of perfected beings received their imperial titles upon the Seven-Treasures Jeweled Terrace. The Supreme August One of the Vast Heaven personally conducted the rites, which closely resembled the ceremonies by which mortal emperors invest generals, enfeoff nobles, and establish lineages. The Dark Thearch was bestowed a jeweled banner and a jade tally with nine dragon seals. His crown reached to heaven with twelve streamers, his robes were of dark silk adorned with the twelve imperial emblems, his scepter was of black jade, and his shoes were of red raven leather. Today, when the host of perfected beings pays court, the Four Saints stand at the head of the ranks.\n\nHis abode is the Celestial One True Celebration Palace, located above the Purple Tenuity, between the Supreme Simplicity and the Effulgent Joy of the Great Void’s Two Heavens. Its palaces rise in majesty, formed naturally from wondrous qi; jade trees of chiming splendor stand within, where divine winds sound in perfect harmony with the five notes. Crimson light and purple clouds perpetually shroud its heights—this is the realm of the Jade Void, the realm beyond form.\n\nAfter the Dark Thearch received his imperial title, the Supreme August One posthumously ennobled his sacred father as the Serene Joy Heavenly Lord, Radiant Perfected Great Thearch, and his sacred mother as the Auspicious Victory Grand Empress, Jeweled Perfected Supreme Immortal. Below, at the Heavenly Pass, he conferred upon the Fire Essence the title Dark Yang General of the Great Mystery, Red Numinous Venerable Spirit, and at the Earth’s Axis, upon the Water Essence, the title Dark Yin General of the Great Mystery, Black Numinous Venerable Spirit—both now dwell in the Celestial One True Celebration Palace. From this time forth, the Three Realms have reverently addressed him as the Dark Thearch.\n\nThis compilation records the successive transmissions of the Dao to those who attained perfection, allowing later generations to witness the divine and sagely deeds of the gods—a blessing from past lives.\n\n---\n\n**Auspicious Response at the Radiant Response Palace**\nWhen the Great Yuan unified all under heaven and established its capital at Yan, on the nineteenth day of the twelfth month in the seventh year of the *Zhiyuan* era, a serpent over a foot long, adorned with golden patterns and azure markings, appeared in the Golden Waters of the Gaoliang River west of the city. The next day, a divine tortoise, its shell shimmering with gold and jade, swam in graceful circles. At that time, the Jade Tablet Keeper of the Imperial Treasury, Chibuhua, witnessed the event and reported it in full. An edict was issued to construct a palace and erect a stele, enshrining the sacred image of the Dark Thearch, and the temple was named the Radiant Response Palace. Today, the palace is diligently maintained by female officials and Daoist priests, who manifest the numinous efficacy of the divine response.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, Bestowing a Sacred Title upon the Perfected Martial General**\nTo the Secretariat-Chancellery: We, in Our august wisdom, have sought the blessings of divine favor, and in accordance with ancient precedents, have bestowed distinguished titles to honor the gods. The Perfected Martial, whose numinous might is firmly established in the northern quarter, possesses unfathomable and subtle efficacy. When We governed the capital’s fertile lands, tortoise and serpent omens appeared, earthly treasures ascended, and sacred springs welled forth—naturally pure and cool, sweet to drink. They brought benefit to the Middle Kingdom and dispelled the people’s afflictions. Overwhelmed by such blessings and mindful of repaying this virtue, We chose this propitious site to build a magnificent temple. Having reverently enshrined his majestic image, it is fitting to elevate his praise. Thus, after consulting the illustrious records and perpetuating his glorious auspices, the Perfected Martial General shall henceforth be titled: *Zhentian Zhenwu Lingying Yousheng Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Numinous Response, Guardian of Heaven, Perfected Martial). Let all officials, in solemn reverence, proclaim this decree, that all may know. Issued on the seventh day of the seventh month in the second year of the *Tianxi* era.\n\n---\n\n**Edict of Ennoblement, Second Year of the *Jiading* Era, Eleventh Month, Fourteenth Day**\nGazing up to the layered heavens, we behold the majesty of the Northern Culmen, where the host of spirits encircle in guard, and the Dark Martial stands in solemn dignity. Though his image has long been revered, his title remains incomplete. Now, in accordance with venerable rites, We bestow this honor to extend abundant blessings.\n\nThe *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen), a noble spirit of heaven and a luminous sacrifice of the state, dwells in majesty above. His presence is ever as near as one’s robes and cap; his radiance stirs the people, and no demon dares approach. His wondrous signs have been manifest: in the *Tianxi* era, auspicious omens appeared at the Sweet Springs Abbey; in the *Xining* era, his deeds were recorded in the city of Great Compliance. Our imperial ancestors, in succession, augmented the rites, and the temple was first established by the Mausoleum of Prosperity, its inscribed plaque renewed at the Temple of the Guardian Sage. We, in particular, have revered these sacrifices, and the god has ever heeded Our prayers. His trustworthiness is profound, his responses never obscure. His blessings, subtle and vast, shall extend to myriad generations of descendants; his virtue, lofty and deep, shall universally benefit the people of the four quarters. To extol his greatness, We now enrich his title.\n\nLet the Golden Watchtower and Jade Capital increase the god’s glory in secret; let his cloud chariots and wind steeds eternally guard the mortal realm. May he delight in Our offerings and observe Our sacrifices. By special decree, he is now ennobled as: *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Fude Zhenjun* (True Lord of Blessing and Virtue, Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen). Upon receipt of this edict, let it be reverently obeyed.\n\n---\n\n**Edict of Ennoblement, Fifth Year of the *Baoyou* Era, Second Month**\nThe Northern Culmen is supreme, and the Dark Martial is truly the most exalted—though he faces south to govern the host of spirits, his reverence must be strictly maintained. Having already received the duty of protection in secret, it is fitting to publicly bestow honors to manifest Our respect.\n\nThe *Beiji Yousheng Zhushun Zhenwu Lingying Fude Yanging Zhenjun* (True Lord of Extended Blessings, Blessing and Virtue, Numinous Response, Perfected Martial, Guardian and Assistant of the Northern Culmen) encompasses the Six Directions with his Dao and subdues the myriad spirits with his might. He embodies the true qi of the primordial chaos, his yin powers are relied upon; he grasps the marvelous essence of kan and li, his divine transformations are boundless. Through him, evil is dispelled and merit established—none is not for the salvation of the people and the protection of the state.",

These two heavens correspond below to Mount Wudang.\n\nThe Abundant Heavenly Emperor of Primordial Qian: According to the ninth chapter of *The True Martial Record of the Divine Manifestation*, compiled by Imperial Attendant Song Xiang, Duke of Jing, during the Song Dynasty, when the Perfected Warrior (Zhenwu) first studied the Dao, he encountered this emperor, who bestowed upon him the *Black Galloping Chaos-Horn Demon-Slaying Sword*, though its inner name remains undetermined.\n\nThe Celestial Ministers of the *Xu* (Void) and *Wei* (Danger) Lodges—both stars embody the symbol of *Tianyi* (\"Celestial Unity\"), manifesting the forms of tortoise and snake, water and fire—are governed by the Dark Emperor.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Purple Primordial Lady, whose inner name remains undetermined. According to *The Transmissions of the Immortals*, the Dao was transmitted to the Dark Emperor, revealing the root origin of Mount Wudang; today, she is revered as the *Holy Preceptress*.\n\nThe Supreme Celestial Registrar of the Nine Heavens, the Primordial August Emperor Lord, surnamed Zhang and named Ya, is one of the Three Great Deities. He oversees the registers of official emoluments, and all who receive stipends as officials or scholars are subject to his authority. He assists in the administration of the Water Bureau’s calculations and the circulation of resources, aiding the Great Dao and supporting the Dark Emperor in delivering beings. Further details may be found in *The Transmissions of the Immortals*.\n\nThe Supreme Purity Heavenly Mechanism Chief Decree-Receiver, the Divine Responsive Primordial Wisdom Perfected Lord, surnamed Dong and named Suhuang, is a celestial perfected being whose essence remains inscrutable. He assists the Dark Emperor, propagating teachings to deliver beings, and holds the rank of Left Supreme Minister of the Grand Purity’s Western King.\n\nThe Supreme Purity Heavenly Mechanism Chief Decree-Receiver, the Flying Rosy Radiance Perfected Person, the Central Yellow Master, the Supreme Primordial Perfected Person, the Eastern Marchmount’s Supreme Minister of Life—also known as the Great Mao Lord—was a native of Xianyang, named Ying and styled Shushen.\n\nThe Registrar of Determinations, Right Forbidden Minister, and Supreme Minister of Life—also known as the Middle Mao Lord—was named Gu and styled Xiuwei.\n\nThe Three Officials’ Protector of Life Perfected Lord—also known as the Lesser Mao Lord—was named Zhong and styled Sihe.\n\nThe Three Mao Lords serve as prime ministers of the Golden Tower and as the Eastern Marchmount’s Supreme Ministers of Life. The present-day Three Mao Mountain in the blessed land of Juqu is the site of their ascension to perfection. For further details, see *The Immortal Transmissions of Mount Mao*; additional accounts appear in *The Marvelous Records of the Later Court*.\n\nThe Central Heaven Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Great Divine Thunderbolt Marshal Heavenly Lord was originally the Wind-Following General, minister to the Yellow Emperor. After defeating Chiyou, he was enfeoffed as the General of Henan and took Deng as his surname from his fief. Later, he concealed himself on Mount Wudang’s *Diezi Peak*, where divine traces remain; see *The Thunder Canon*.\n\nThe Five Black Dragon Lords of Mount Wudang’s Responsive Manifestations are transformations of *Tianyi* and remnants of the Dragon-Transforming Brahma-Pervading Heaven’s blackness. They guard Mount Wudang, assisting the Dark Emperor’s ascension. In the Tang Dynasty, they visited Prefect Yao to bring rain; in the Song, they transmitted the *Sleeping Method* to Chen Tuan. Their responsive manifestations to prayers for rain or sunshine are too numerous to recount. The Five Dragon Peaks of Mount Wudang are their dwelling places.\n\nThe Five Hundred Divine Officers of Mount Wudang: This grotto-heaven blessed land is where the Celestial Thearch conducts his annual inspections. Five hundred divine officers are appointed to maintain and guard it. When Daoist practitioners achieve success in their cultivation, they are all registered and recommended, serving as the bureau for investigating good and punishing evil.\n\nThe Black Tiger Marshal of Mount Wudang’s Mountain Patrol is a transformation of the Northern *Tianyi*, a guardian deity of the teachings and the mountain. His divine efficacy and numinous power defy full description. For those whose bone configurations are unsuited to Daoist cultivation, he may reveal his true form or issue warnings in dreams, driving them away. By night, he patrols the corridors and responds to invocations, safeguarding the blessed precincts, and his dharma methods are practiced in the world.\n\nThe Loyal, Wise, Mighty, and Valiant King of Mount Wudang was Yao Jian, Prefect of Junzhou during the Tang Dynasty. Further details appear in later transmissions.\n\nThe Celestial Thearch’s Assistant Controller of Perfected Beings commanded the Perfected Lord of Mount Wudang. Mount Wudang is the Assistant Controller’s grotto-heaven of the Central Marchmount, bearing the title *Perfected Lord*. This is recorded in *The Grand Perfected Daoist Canon*.\n\nThe Blessed Land’s Divine Officers of Mount Wudang, the Heaven-Connecting Great Sage of the Palace Precincts, and the Vast Moistening Dragon King of Mount Wudang’s Great Summit—111 divine officers are enfeoffed by the state as the mountain’s native immortals.\n\n**The Enlightened of Past and Present**\nAccording to *The Illustrated Classic*: Mount Wudang is the abode of divine immortals. Since the Yellow Emperor and Laozi established the teachings, divine immortals and perfected beings have gathered here in great numbers. It is also said that those who study the Dao often number in the hundreds, but if their resolve wavers, they are driven away by beasts. Cultivators of life often conceal their names and hide their times, lamenting that the mountains are not deep enough or the forests not dense enough, fearing that their fame might reach others’ ears. The number of those who have attained the Dao and ascended to perfection on this mountain is beyond counting. As the ages grow distant and kalpa fires repeatedly renew the world, many names have been lost. Now, after consulting records and inquiring of elders, we have gathered a few and recorded them here to preserve the mountain’s wondrous traces.\n\nThe Pass Master Perfected Person, a grandee of King Kang of Zhou, surnamed Yin and named Xi, styled *Master of the Beginning of Literature*. At the end of the Zhou, as the Great Dao was about to withdraw, he divined that a purple aura was moving westward and that a perfected being would pass through. He then became the magistrate of Hangu Pass. Soon after, the Most High crossed the pass, and Xi received him with the rites of a disciple, bowing in welcome. The Most High bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Dao* and the *Scripture of Virtue*, arranging to meet again at the Green Ram Market in Shu. Feigning illness, Xi resigned from office and concealed himself in a valley. Later, he entered Shu and returned to dwell on Mount Wudang, beneath the stone walls of the Three Heavenly Gates, in a stone chamber. His former abode contained bronze pillars and a jade table, though these are no longer extant. The site is named *Yin Xi’s Cliff*; the ravine is called *Ox-Dragging Ravine* and *Green Ram Ravine*, both places where the Most High’s divine transformations visited Xi.

During the Taikang era of the Jin, he submitted a memorial to resign from office and enter the Dao, and the imperial edict granted his request. He then journeyed westward to Wudang, and upon reaching Xiangyang, he encountered a Daoist who said to him: \"My master, Master Dai Mengshengzi, is no ordinary man. He instructed me: ‘If anyone traveling westward wishes to see me, bring them along—could it be you?’\" Thereupon, they went together to meet him. As they reached the mountain, distant peaks stretched across the horizon, and beneath the pine shadows, they suddenly beheld the master seated upon a stone. His spirit shone with luminous clarity, and he transmitted to Xie the Dao of refining the spirit and attaining emptiness. In an instant, the master vanished from sight. Xie then built a thatched hut by the stone chamber, and within a few years, he attained the subtleties of profound stillness, gaining the ability to fly across sheer cliffs. He styled himself Xie Luoshan, signifying his liberation from the magistracy of Luo County. Later, he ascended as an immortal, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\nFrom the *True and Unadorned* and the *Classic of Waterways*.\n\nPrefect Yao, as recorded in the *Biographies*: his name was Jian, courtesy name Yifu, a man of the Sui. He assisted Emperor Taizong of the Tang and was later appointed military commissioner of Wudang. During the Zhenguan era, as the realm suffered a great drought and swarms of locusts arose, prayers were offered at famous mountains, yet none received a response. Prefect Yao was dispatched to Wudang to conduct solemn rites. There, a scholar of unusual bearing approached him and said: \"We are no ordinary men—we are the Five Dragon Lords. By imperial decree, we guard this mountain. Moved by your integrity and the sincerity of your prayers, we have come to meet you. We have already petitioned the Emperor on High on your behalf. You should return swiftly, for on the third day, there shall be cause for celebration.\" Soon after, clouds surged from the earth, and the scholar vanished from sight. Thunder, lightning, and torrential rains spread across the land, and grasses, trees, and crops all flourished. When news of this divine efficacy reached the court, he was honored with imperial favor. After resigning his post, he brought his family to dwell in seclusion on Wudang, aspiring to the mysteries of emptiness and attaining the truth of the Dao. The Dark Emperor appointed him as the mountain’s guardian deity. In the early Song, his divine manifestations in repelling locusts and relieving droughts were widely renowned, and he was enfeoffed as the Loyal, Wise, Mighty, and Valiant Duke. A temple was established to exhort his virtues, located east of the present-day Purple Cloud Palace.\n\nChen Tuiyi, as recorded in the *Observations of Words and Deeds*: his name was Bo, courtesy name Tunan, a native of Bozhou. From youth, he possessed extraordinary talent and harbored the ambition to benefit others. During the chaotic Five Dynasties period, in Bianliang, he met the future Emperor Taizu of the Song and remarked: \"This is truly the Mandate of Heaven.\"",

Moving swiftly through clouds and mist, none could draw near him.\n\nThe immortal Liu Hong, as recorded in the *Biographies of Recluses*, was named Hong, with the courtesy name Lingyu. Gifted with exceptional intelligence, he exhaustively studied the classics and their commentaries. During the Taishi era of the Song, he served as Recorder for the Prince of Jin.",

He entered Wudang Mountain to live in seclusion, reciting the *Book of Changes* beside the Five Dragons Temple, where he moved the Five Black Dragon Lords to impart to him the art of sleeping. His reputation spread far and wide, drawing many visitors. Later, he moved to the Sutra-Recitation Terrace to delve into the mysteries of painting, and then to White Cloud Cliff. At the end of the Five Dynasties, with turmoil raging across the land, he relocated to Hua Peak, where it was said the Five Dragons soared through the sky to escort him. In the early Song, he was repeatedly summoned to court but declined. Later, he journeyed to the capital to request leave to return home, and the imperial edict granted his wish. Further details may be found in his official biography.\n\nGrand Councilor Zhang Shixun, as recorded in the *Biography of Wan Tui*: his name was Shixun, a native of Junzhou.

Thereafter, he built the Cloud Grotto to honor the Dark Emperor.\n\nOn the morning of the *jiawu* day in the third month, a crane was faintly seen riding the clouds. Turning to look back at his former dwelling, only his staff and sandals remained.\n\nThe recluse Tian Suoyi, as recorded in the *Records of Wudang*: Tian Suoyi’s given name is unknown. He dwelled in a stone chamber at Hidden Immortal Cliff on Wudang, wearing only a straw raincoat in both winter and summer, and thus people called him by this name. In the depths of winter, his true *qi* steamed like vapor, while in the height of summer, his presence was as cool as jade. Those afflicted with illness or misfortune would seek him out. He would pluck herbs from his robe, blow upon them, and give them to the sufferer—those who consumed them were instantly cured. He refined the Great Elixir. During the *Duanping* era, his whereabouts became unknown. Today, the elixir furnace and kiln remain in his alchemical chamber.\n\nThe recluse Xie Tiandi, as recorded in the *Records of Wudang*: Xie Tiandi’s name is unknown.

He resided in a stone chamber beneath the Changing Garments Terrace on South Cliff, where sheer cliffs of ten thousand fathoms plunged into a deep ravine—even gibbons and cranes could not traverse it, yet he moved through the air with ease. When questioned, he would only reply, \"Thank Heaven and Earth,\" offering no other words, and so people named him thus. The cliff where he dwelled was also named after him. Later, he ascended as an immortal, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nSun Jiran, as recorded in the *Records*: His given name was Yuanzheng, and his sobriquet was Jiranzi. He inherited the lineage of Maoshan’s Pure Truth Abbey, mastering the wonders of the Shangqing Five Thunder methods, and traveled extensively to pay homage at sacred sites. At the time, the dragons of Bian and Hu had departed, and the Jiang and Han regions suffered under the calamity of Jin soldiers, leaving the halls of Wudang utterly desolate. In the *shaoxi* year of the *Shaoxing* era, he was the first to ascend Wudang, restoring the Five Dragons Palace, laying its foundations, and using talismanic water to exorcise plagues and cure the people’s illnesses. The masses flocked to him, and within a few years, the halls were fully restored. Emperor Gaozong summoned him to court, where his talismanic water met with imperial approval, and ten Daoist priests were ordained by imperial decree. Later, he returned to the mountain and passed away without illness, his remains interred east of Peach Blossom Spring.\n\nDeng Zhenguan, given name Anda, was a disciple of Sun Jiran. From childhood, he accompanied his master in the restoration of Wudang, first receiving imperial favor and fully inheriting his master’s mastery of the Shangqing Five Thunder methods. He commanded wind and lashed thunder, his responses as swift as an echo. Those afflicted with illness from near and far hastened to him. He subsequently petitioned to reside at the Five Dragons Palace, overseeing the construction of the main hall. The stubborn rock stood like a wall, and the labor of quarrying was arduous. Silently invoking divine power, a single night of thunder and rain shattered the stone. He ordained several disciples and entrusted the abbey to them. Secretly, he harmonized the Dragon and Tiger, refining *jia* and *geng* within. During the *Jiatai* era, he foretold his departure to his followers and suddenly passed away.

      "translated_text": "Upon his return, in his later years he maintained a lofty purity, and the community expected him to ascend lightly into the heavens. One evening, he dreamed that the mountain’s guardian spirit said to him: “The Three Mao Perfected Lords will descend here tomorrow—you should withdraw both near and far.” The next day, he led his disciples to welcome them at Meeting Immortals Peak, but after a long while, no one arrived. As dusk approached, the Perfected Lords transformed into a field laborer, carrying a rain cape, and arrived. None of the assembly recognized them, so they ordered him to carry things back. Upon reaching the abbey, he bowed at the hall’s steps. Soon after, when they sought to offer him hospitality, he could not be found—only an extraordinary fragrance assailed them, filling the courtyard and doors. They regretted their failure to respond in kind.\n\nLater, he admonished his disciples, saying: “This is a place where immortals and mortals dwell together. From now on, for generation after generation, we shall no longer accept the bows of either Daoists or laypeople.” Thus began the custom of Wudang Daoist friends refusing secular bows. Soon after, he established the Hall of Assembled Sages to honor them.\n\nHe once told his disciples: “Because I received the rites of the Three Mao Perfected Lords, I cannot escape the golden blade.” In the final ten days of the tenth month of the third year of the Duanping era, he indeed fell victim to military calamity.

On the day of his liberation, his face remained youthful, from which his attainment of the Dao may be known.\n\nYe Yunlai, whose given name was Xizhen and whose Daoist name was Yunlaizi, was a native of Kuocang in Chuzhou. Born on the fifth day of the third lunar month in the *xinhai* year at the *si* hour, he was a descendant of Tang dynasty Celestial Master Ye Fashan. Born in Jianning, he mastered the subtleties of Qingwei Daoist arts. Skilled in dispelling misfortune through ancient rituals of exorcism and prayer, he entered Wudang and became its abbot. In the *yiyou* year of the Zhiyuan era, he was summoned to the imperial court in response to a prophecy, where he stilled winds, quelled thunder, prayed for rain, and cured illnesses—all to the emperor’s satisfaction. In the *bingxu* year of the Zhiyuan era, he was honored with an imperial decree, appointed Chief Supervisor, and tasked with overseeing Wudang’s protection, a duty that began with him. Later, bearing imperial incense back to the mountain, he passed away peacefully.\n\n---\n\nSince the beginning of the cosmos, though countless grotto-heavens and blessed lands have flourished across the realm, none have gained renown without the presence of extraordinary individuals. Thus, Mount Lu was renamed by Master Kuangsu’s hermitage, and Mount Tiantai was rebranded by Master Tongxiang’s governance. Where immortals dwell, mountains acquire fame—this is self-evident.\n\nFrom childhood, my hair still damp, I heard that Wudang in Junzhou was the sacred birthplace of the Dark Emperor, and I longed for its true essence with deep reverence. Yet I regretted never having beheld its splendor or understood the origin of its name. One day, two scholars, Wang and Mi, arrived from Wudang to visit my hermitage at the foot of Mount Lu. From their sleeves, they produced *The Comprehensive Record of Wudang’s True Realms*, compiled by Liu Dongyang. With solemn respect, I unrolled and read it, and thus came to know this mountain: seventy-two peaks displaying its wonders, thirty-six cliffs monopolizing its beauty, streams, pools, and grottoes exuding serenity, and rare flora and fauna flourishing in abundance. Marvelous immortal traces abound, with nothing left unrecorded. Among the grand and majestic sacred mountains, none but Wudang could be deemed a fitting abode for the Dark Emperor, just as none but the Dark Emperor could have magnified Wudang’s magnificence. The name \"Wudang\" was thus exchanged for \"Taihe,\" derived from this very principle.\n\nHad Liu Dongyang not chronicled these details with such clarity, as if laying them in the palm of one’s hand, how could Daoist devotees across the realm ever fully grasp its origins? Indeed, this mountain shall endure as long as heaven and earth, and this compilation shall likewise persist alongside it, rendering great service to the Dark Teachings.\n\nHaving read it thrice, I could only sigh in admiration and inscribe these words at the end of the scroll. As for the true deeds of the Dark Emperor, they are already amply recorded in previous volumes—what need is there for further repetition?\n\nOn the Flower Festival of the *xinchou* year, Lu Shishun, former *Fengxun Dafu* and overseer of Wudang’s sacred lands in Huaixi, respectfully inscribed this colophon as *Jiangbei Dao* Surveillance Commissioner.\n\n*The Comprehensive Record of Wudang’s True Realms* concludes.",
