  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Central Harmony**\n\nThus spake the Dao:\n\nThe Dao takes central harmony as its virtue, and discord as mutual conflict. Therefore, when Heaven and Earth unite in harmony, the myriad things sprout and blossom, flowers and fruits ripen; when the state unites in harmony, the world knows great peace, and all things dwell in tranquility; when the household unites in harmony, fathers are kind and children filial, and Heaven bestows blessings and felicity.\n\nLet the wise ponder deeply—how can one not seek harmony?\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth fall out of harmony, yin and yang lose their measure: winter thunders, summer frosts, waters surge without rhythm, the myriad things rebel against their nature, blossoms wither and fruits shrivel. When the state falls out of harmony, ruler and minister deceive one another, the strong oppress the weak, barbarians invade the borders, blades clash, the world is thrown into chaos, and the people find no peace. When the household falls out of harmony, fathers show no kindness, children lack filial piety, elders and juniors rage in conflict, resentment festers, grievances accumulate, ghosts and spirits grow disordered, and the family meets ruin and harm. These three calamities arise from disharmony.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth fall out of harmony, yin and yang err, and disaster befalls the people. When the household falls out of harmony, anger and wrath breed, bringing misfortune and ruin. Thus do the wise repeatedly admonish, fearing that people may transgress the law, indulge in wrongdoing, fail to repent, or nurse grievances, deepening their faults. Therefore, they earnestly exhort: all must apply their hearts, urge one another forward, cast off past evils, and cultivate present goodness.\n\nWhen virtue and conduct align with the Dao, the body stabilizes, the spirit finds peace, joy and anger do not linger in the heart, harsh words do not pass the lips, foul sounds do not enter the ears, lust and gain do not meet the eyes, greed and desire do not occupy the mind. Cultivate upright conduct, and true *qi* will draw near; perverse *qi* will depart, past transgressions will vanish, and good fortune will arrive of itself.\n\nIn serving the Dao, one must not be remiss; in serving one’s teacher, one must not be irreverent; in serving one’s parents, one must not be unfilial; in serving one’s lord, one must not be disloyal; one must treasure one’s own body; one must heed teachings and admonitions; one must cherish those of like mind; one must correct one’s outward conduct; one must clearly distinguish truth from falsehood; one must be cautious in speech; one must guard against misfortune; the wise must not fail to inquire; the foolish must not go untaught; benevolence and righteousness must not be neglected; acts of kindness must not be withheld; the orphaned and weak must not be left unaided; the poor and lowly must not be left unrelieved; those in distress must not be left undelivered; evil deeds must not be pursued; lust and desire must be severed; wealth and profit must be kept at a distance; evil people must not be left untransformed.\n\nLet the wise ponder deeply.\n\nIf one’s conduct does not accord with the precepts and admonitions, to seek Heaven’s protection will be difficult. Cultivating goodness brings blessing; doing evil incurs punishment. When punishment arrives, if one does not reflect upon past transgressions but instead laments the futility of present devotion to the Dao, rails against Heaven, wavers in resolve, or turns the mind elsewhere—if one follows the crowd, indulges in heretical delusions, forms cliques, pursues deceit, and falls into wickedness—then the foolish, knowing no better, act thus, drifting ever farther from the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is vast and boundless, its scope without limit. The net of Heaven ensnares all people, who dwell within it as fish in a great net—how would they know the net exists beyond them? Pull the net, and they are caught; loosen it, and they escape. People, unaware of the greatness of the true Dao, are like fish unaware of the net.\n\nThe foolish may abandon truth for falsehood, and if their deeds yield fleeting success, they cannot endure. Those who betray the Dao will not escape punishment. Yet the great Dao is all-embracing, cherishing human life, allowing people to follow their desires and indulge their hearts—only later will they regret it. The profound depths of the supreme Dao are beyond the understanding of the foolish and vulgar.\n\nThe great Dao regards people as a mother does her child. The Dao loves life and abhors killing, and never takes a life itself. When evil people persist in wickedness, the officers of transgression record their misdeeds; when sins accumulate and guilt is complete, the executioners strike—but the Dao itself never kills.\n\nLet the wise, wishing to eliminate harm and return to uprightness, diligently uphold the teachings and precepts, and never transgress them.\n\nThe Dao esteems non-action as supreme. Human transgressions arise from action. The great Dao is without action, and thus endures forever. Heaven and Earth follow the Dao’s non-action, merging with it; the perfected follow the Dao’s non-action, and thus attain immortality. The Dao’s non-action accomplishes all things.\n\nIf one cultivates practice, upholds the precepts, accumulates goodness, and establishes merit and virtue, one’s body will commune with Heaven, and blessings will flow to one’s descendants. This is the joy of the wise, though the foolish wish not to hear of it. Let the seeker strive diligently in practice.\n\nThus spake the Dao:\n\nAll who receive the teachings and precepts and practice them shall, at the highest level, attain immortality; at the middle level, double their lifespan; at the lowest level, extend their years and avoid untimely death. Those who defy their teacher’s teachings will not live out their allotted years but die prematurely.\n\nHow grievous! Why do the wise not cultivate goodness to return to longevity? Even if one cannot attain the middle virtue, one should cultivate the lesser virtue: govern the self in the world, sever love and desire, and reverse the ways of the vulgar—thus will one unite with the Dao.\n\nFirst, one must not indulge in wantonness without cease, harboring perverse thoughts that exhaust the spirit and deplete the essence, causing the hun and po souls to scatter. When uprightness recedes and perversity advances, illness harms the person.\n\nSecond, one must not give free rein to joy and anger, accumulate resentment, vent rage, raise one’s voice in curses, swear oaths, utter imprecations, call upon Heaven and Earth, and disturb ghosts and spirits. Persisting in such transgressions, resentment festers within, damaging the five viscera. Thus does one harm oneself, and the illness becomes incurable.\n\nThose who uphold the Dao possess celestial officials and soldiers within their bodies. Should one repeatedly transgress, these officials and soldiers report one’s faults to the heavenly courts. When transgressions accumulate into guilt, the left tally erases life, while the right tally records death. Minor offenses bring punishment upon the self; grave sins bring calamity upon descendants.\n\nThird, one must not harbor malice, envy others, or constantly nurture ill intent. The heart, ruler of the five viscera, is solely occupied by matters of sorrow and joy. If this one spirit is unsettled, all spirits grow angry; when anger arises, they turn against one another—this is most impermissible. Persisting in such transgressions brings misfortune upon oneself.\n\nFourth, one must not defile the body with prolonged filth, indulge in wine to the point of confusion, alter one’s true nature, follow impulses without restraint, disregard official prohibitions against evil, fail to honor ruler and father as supreme, hurl baseless curses, or act in rebellion and disobedience. Thus does Heaven send down calamity, and the body suffers disaster.\n\nFifth, one must not covet wealth and possessions. Wealth and possessions are but dung and dirt, to be used as circumstances allow. In this degenerate age, the world is shallow, and men crave only treasure, fixating on profit. Those who obtain what they desire rejoice in their hearts; those who do not grow resentful and hateful. From a single spark of wrath, blades clash in violence. Greed and love of wealth are enemies that harm the self—when the body perishes and the name is erased, what use are riches? Those who heed these precepts and comply find them wholly agreeable, declaring such transgressions impermissible. But those who turn from the precepts toward profit? Suddenly, they stir again, facing the peril of treading on ice, the danger of stepping into emptiness—great life topples. When ruin looms and they seek to repent, when guilt is fixed and they claim virtue, when transgressions overflow and accumulate, the Dao of Heaven offers no salvation. Wealth, treasure, and sensual desires are disasters that ensnare the self; the wise shun them, while fools delight in them. In all their sitting, rising, sleeping, waking, movements, and stillness, the wise exercise deep caution, keeping their bodies free from disturbance—thus do they receive blessings.\n\nThe Dao states: Among all Daoist followers, not one in ten thousand focuses the mind with true devotion. Why is this so? The world has grown degenerate, and the age dictates such ways.\n\nThey vie for superiority, the high coveting glory and emolument, riches and honor, splendor and adornment. Benevolence and righteousness are not practiced; cunning and deceit pass for wisdom. Fathers and sons deceive one another; rulers and ministers betray each other’s trust. They entrust one another in turn, using wealth to buy office. The loyal and steadfast are demoted and dismissed; the flattering and perverse are appointed and employed. Cabals of villains form factions, currying favor with the deceitful. The rich and noble chase after one another, while the poor and lowly are cast aside together. Chariots and horses, robes and ornaments—extravagance and ostentation blaze forth. The noble and the base alike share in this, rejoicing in the ways of the world—how could they think of the Dao?\n\nSuch are the fools, not worth aspiring to. The reason I speak thus is that fools are shallow and superficial. When they encounter glory and prominence, they grow arrogant and extravagant, their conduct excessive, indulging their desires to their hearts’ content, heedless of laws and norms. The Dao’s purity and emptiness do not accept such people. The divine shuns them; evil spirits assail them. Some resort to falsehood, turning their backs on truth, praying to ghosts and making entreaties. The net of Heaven is vast—its punishment has yet to be meted out. It is like steaming rice: the fire beneath has gone out, yet the last traces of qi linger in the pot—how could it last long? Though evil men have not yet encountered retribution, they are like those lingering traces of qi.\n\nThe worthy are what people aspire to, for they spend their years in goodness. What people despise is to end in death and lowliness—is this not so? Heaven and Earth govern with impartiality: they reward the good with life and punish the evil with death. This is how fortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities arise from the unseen. Disasters and harms cannot be averted by seeking refuge in wealth and nobility, nor are they incurred by enduring poverty and lowliness. Cultivating goodness brings blessings in response; doing evil brings calamity. Though a ruler may possess boundless treasures, when peril arises, even if he offers a city’s weight in gold to beg for life, can he obtain it?\n\nYet fools, seeing the rich and noble, all desire the same, striving to preserve it with toil and bitter intent—yet what they gain is not enduring. If one wishes to seek blessings, one must cultivate devotion to the Dao’s teachings. Let the entire household, young and old, unite in purpose, sweeping clean and burning incense, maintaining purity and solemnity. Present your prayers and state your desires. The Daoist adept, empty and attuned, responds to all—what could remain unanswered?\n\nIf one seeks blessings, one need not offer gold, silver, jade, silk, wealth, or bribes; one need not curry favor through worldly means, nor sacrifice with wine and meat. Simply turn your heart to the Dao, and what you seek shall be granted, fulfilling your wishes as you desire. The object of your prayer will swiftly manifest—no more is needed. Yet if one imitates the ways of the vulgar, turning from the law to make entreaties, every endeavor will end in failure.\n\nTo obtain blessings, one must devote oneself with diligence, maintaining purity morning and evening, burning incense and raising prayers—then no blessing will fail to respond. Those who delight in this practice will know boundless virtue; those who do not will follow their own hearts. The supreme Dao is vast and accommodating, leaving all to human choice. The worthy devote themselves to the Dao with diligence, ever fearful of falling short; fools treat the great Dao with carelessness, and their downfall is not far off. Such is the difference between the wise and the foolish.\n\nLearners, exert yourselves and practice diligently.\n\nThe Dao states: Among households that profess the Dao, when they encounter calamities, illnesses, death, or disputes with officials—any misfortune—it is always due to their lack of diligence in upholding the teachings. Though they revere the Dao and wish to follow it, their conduct differs little from the vulgar. Seeking to disrupt the true with deceit and falsehood will never succeed. Though such people may be nominally devoted to the Dao, hoping for its protection, the Dao does not save them. Evil men are dull and foolish, and few can truly reform their hearts, repent, and return sincerely to the Dao. Instead, they grow more perverse, claiming the Dao is not divine. Though they may not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor resentment. When their end comes, what use is regret? Fools—how grievous!\n\nThe worthy rectify their minds and guard their thoughts, never daring to slacken or falter. They restrain themselves and remain vigilant, diligently cultivating the Dao in all matters. The great Dao is most revered, lofty and without peer, all-encompassing without boundary, embracing Heaven and Earth, governing the myriad spirits. All living things—winged insects, crawling creatures, and all beings that contain qi—are born of the Dao. The Dao’s majestic spirit gathers all, moves all, dissolves all, and subdues all. It holds the mechanisms of Heaven and commands the myriad spirits.\n\nThe Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, boundless and infinite. Humans dwell within it, their years and lives fleeting as a spark from stone. The great Dao is vast and nurturing, cherishing human life. Human life is fragile and precarious, so it urges diligent cultivation of goodness. Yet people fail to reflect on the Dao, fail to cultivate goodness with devotion. They turn their backs on truth, disobeying teachings and precepts, coveting only wealth, honor, sensual pleasures, and riches—indulging in wine and meat, following their desires without restraint, growing arrogant and extravagant. How could they still think of the Dao?\n\nWhen people do not think of the Dao, the Dao does not think of them. Humans are like fish: they live in water, but perish when it is gone. When the Dao departs from a person, what hope is there for long life? The key lies in diligence and keeping the supreme Dao in mind.\n\nAll worthy ones who wish to preserve their lives must first cast aside past transgressions and cultivate future goodness. When they see others err, they should admonish and exhort one another, teaching each other to do good, repaying kindness with virtue—thus receiving boundless blessings. The Dao has no form or appearance, no visible deeds. If one seeks grace and blessings, one must cultivate practice, maintaining purity day and night.\n\nWhen one sees others ill or in distress, one should aid and assist them, showing compassion in times of urgency. One must not deceive the foolish with cunning, nor abuse power to oppress, nor invoke gods and ghosts to intimidate the simple. Some, possessing a little knowledge, boast and belittle others, sowing doubt and slander, engaging in divisive disputes. The worthy must not respect the noble and despise the lowly, nor harbor love and hatred in their hearts. They must not seek blessings by following their emotions, nor offer charity with ulterior motives, lest they undermine the true teaching and bring misfortune upon themselves.\n\nInstead, they should seek those of like mind, illuminate one another with shared understanding, and instruct one another in the same teachings. If men or women are illiterate, yet sincerely devoted to the Dao, they may approach those who are learned, listening to the recitation of scriptures and precepts in quiet abodes.\n\nOne may also sweep and clean the hall, tidying one’s appearance, settling the body and calming the spirit, listening with focused and clear intent. Let there be no reckless chatter or idle speech, no wayward conduct or deviant thoughts, no distraction from the scriptures and precepts, no drowsy wandering or fitful sleep, no wearying of the spirit or tormenting thoughts, no self-inflicted exhaustion that yields only suffering and no benefit. If one can uphold these precepts with unflagging diligence, blessings will surely follow—heavenly officials and divine soldiers will come to guard them, warding off all misfortunes.\n\nAmong the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble. Yet though all know the month of their birth, none know the day of their death. Whether wise or foolish, wealthy or poor, each claims their allotted span of years, yet who would willingly hasten their own ruin? Ruin is what no one desires, yet fools accumulate sins and commit evil, falling ill unto death, unable to awaken to the blessings of cultivating the Dao and performing good deeds. The span of human life is ordained by Heaven. Though Heaven does not speak, it ever bestows fortune upon the virtuous. Thus the sages adapt to the world: when the age is pure, they appear; when it is benighted, they withdraw. They cannot remain forever, and so they leave behind teachings and precepts. These teachings urge people to do good, to preserve their bodies and protect their lives. If one can uphold the precepts without weariness, how could one merely attain a full lifespan? One may even extend their years and receive boundless blessings. This is not something that wealth and nobility can purchase, nor can it be obtained through offerings of wine and meat or prayers to ghosts and spirits.\n\nDaoist adepts and the worthy revere and uphold these teachings, devoting themselves with single-minded diligence. Though they may endure hardship at first, sweetness follows, and their hidden efforts meet with responsive harmony. Whether wise or foolish, wealthy or poor, all have their desires. Yet only the Daoist, steadfast in purpose, can use the teachings to examine themselves, governing their conduct, movements, and even their loves and desires, never transgressing the precepts and keeping their hearts free from waywardness. When they see beauty or profit, they cover their eyes with the precepts; when they hear praise or slander, they block their ears with the precepts; when they taste sweet and fragrant delicacies, they seal their mouths with the precepts; when they crave wealth or desire, they restrain their hearts with the precepts; when they encounter deceit or incline toward evil, they sever their steps with the precepts. If they uphold these without fail, they may be called enlightened. They must diligently exhort the foolish, enabling them to follow and apply these teachings.\n\nThus, when Daoists cultivate goodness and bestow kindness, the Dao of Heaven responds, and they receive immeasurable blessings. The Dao emerges from spontaneity, existing before Heaven and Earth, named the Supreme, the Mysterious and Ancient, the Most High. The three qi intermingle in primordial chaos as the Supreme and Perfect Dao. Vast and boundless, the Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, transforming and animating the divine qi, extending beyond the eight directions, yet dwelling within the finest hair. It gives life to the ten thousand things, governs the myriad heavens, and oversees the hundred billions. It covers all that is great and enters all that is small. Serene and non-interfering, it endures forever; embracing the turbid and enduring the foul, it becomes the mother of the ten thousand things. The Dao is impartial, yet it befriends only the good. The good, through their efforts, attain divine transcendence—this is not something the wealthy can purchase, nor can the poor, through disdain, fail to attain it. If one can wholeheartedly delight in it, meditate with sincerity, cultivate the body, and perform good deeds, they will align with the Dao.\n\nYet worldly people are shallow, superficial, and deceitful, drifting among the common herd. They chase fleeting pleasures, drinking wine and eating meat to gratify their desires, unwilling to endure hardship in cultivating the Dao, making offerings, burning incense, or revering the true teaching. They should instead cultivate merit, establish teachings, practice humility and benevolence, embrace gentleness and yielding, nurture pure and tranquil thoughts, and cultivate the body through non-action. Though the beginning may be arduous, they will ultimately receive blessings, never to be counted among the vulgar. Yet people cling only to momentary gains, and when their lives end, their names are recorded in the black ledgers of the ghostly registers. The distance between Daoists and worldly people is vast indeed. How can this be explained?\n\nThe Daoist who is pure and upright in life has their name recorded among the celestial officials; the worldly person, defiled and impure, in death belongs to the earthly officials—how vast is the distance between them! Foolish people cling to worldly ways and do not uphold the Dao and its teachings; this is truly great delusion.\n\nIn the life of the body, each person possesses eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind, yet the conduct of the wise and the foolish differs: the foolish fix their eyes on beauty, their ears on praise and blame, their noses on sweet fragrances, their mouths on the finest flavors, and their minds on reckless desires. They follow their impulses, drawn toward deceit and wrongdoing. The wise are not so—their eyes do not seek favored sights, their ears do not heed wicked words, their noses do not indulge in foul odors, their mouths do not crave rich flavors, their minds do not dwell on fleeting pleasures, and their feet do not tread toward evil deeds.\n\nThe Daoist’s practice is to recognize what brings pleasure yet restrain the passions through precepts, thus avoiding wrongdoing. By accumulating good deeds and aligning with the Dao, they receive boundless blessings. The foolish, though they know evil invites misfortune, cannot commit with sincerity and thus oppose the Dao. If they desire blessings, why not emulate the Daoist—uphold the Dao in purity, abide in truth, and practice non-action? They should diligently endure hardship, advance with devotion, and cultivate with care. Then they will know neither poverty nor humiliation, nor oppression by the powerful, nor rivalry with the wealthy, nor the toil of servitude. Why not engage in good works, devote themselves wholly to the Dao, and diligently guard its Way, focusing all thoughts on its practice?\n\nA thousand good deeds must be completed, ten thousand virtues fully realized. Even with nine hundred and ninety-nine acts of goodness, if one remains unfulfilled, the slightest pursuit of gain will undo all prior merit. Govern the thoughts of the world, hold fast to the precepts without wavering, and transcendence into immortality shall be attained.\n\nIn ancient times, Lord Yang at fifteen began his devotion to the Dao. Though he received no reward by sixty, he never wearied in cultivation. By eighty, his blessings were immeasurable, and he communed with Heaven, his fortune flowing to his descendants. How can the worthy Daoist not strive with diligence?\n\nHere ends the *Highest Clarity Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Central Harmony*.",

Should one repeatedly transgress, these officials and soldiers report one’s faults to the heavenly courts. When transgressions accumulate into guilt, the left tally erases life, while the right tally records death. Minor offenses bring punishment upon the self; grave sins bring calamity upon descendants.\n\nThird, one must not harbor malice, envy others, or constantly nurture ill intent. The heart, ruler of the five viscera, is solely occupied by matters of sorrow and joy. If this one spirit is unsettled, all spirits grow angry; when anger arises, they turn against one another—this is most impermissible. Persisting in such transgressions brings misfortune upon oneself.\n\nFourth, one must not defile the body with prolonged filth, indulge in wine to the point of confusion, alter one’s true nature, follow impulses without restraint, disregard official prohibitions against evil, fail to honor ruler and father as supreme, hurl baseless curses, or act in rebellion and disobedience. Thus does Heaven send down calamity, and the body suffers disaster.\n\nFifth, one must not covet wealth and possessions. Wealth and possessions are but dung and dirt, to be used as circumstances allow. In this degenerate age, the world is shallow, and men crave only treasure, fixating on profit. Those who obtain what they desire rejoice in their hearts; those who do not grow resentful and hateful. From a single spark of wrath, blades clash in violence. Greed and love of wealth are enemies that harm the self—when the body perishes and the name is erased, what use are riches? Those who heed these precepts and comply find them wholly agreeable, declaring such transgressions impermissible. But those who turn from the precepts toward profit? Suddenly, they stir again, facing the peril of treading on ice, the danger of stepping into emptiness—great life topples. When ruin looms and they seek to repent, when guilt is fixed and they claim virtue, when transgressions overflow and accumulate, the Dao of Heaven offers no salvation. Wealth, treasure, and sensual desires are disasters that ensnare the self; the wise shun them, while fools delight in them. In all their sitting, rising, sleeping, waking, movements, and stillness, the wise exercise deep caution, keeping their bodies free from disturbance—thus do they receive blessings.\n\nThe Dao states: Among all Daoist followers, not one in ten thousand focuses the mind with true devotion.

      "translated_text": "They vie for superiority, the high coveting glory and emolument, riches and honor, splendor and adornment. Benevolence and righteousness are not practiced; cunning and deceit pass for wisdom. Fathers and sons deceive one another; rulers and ministers betray each other’s trust. They entrust one another in turn, using wealth to buy office. The loyal and steadfast are demoted and dismissed; the flattering and perverse are appointed and employed. Cabals of villains form factions, currying favor with the deceitful. The rich and noble chase after one another, while the poor and lowly are cast aside together. Chariots and horses, robes and ornaments—extravagance and ostentation blaze forth. The noble and the base alike share in this, rejoicing in the ways of the world—how could they think of the Dao?\n\nSuch are the fools, not worth aspiring to. The reason I speak thus is that fools are shallow and superficial. When they encounter glory and prominence, they grow arrogant and extravagant, their conduct excessive, indulging their desires to their hearts’ content, heedless of laws and norms. The Dao’s purity and emptiness do not accept such people. The divine shuns them; evil spirits assail them. Some resort to falsehood, turning their backs on truth, praying to ghosts and making entreaties. The net of Heaven is vast—its punishment has yet to be meted out. It is like steaming rice: the fire beneath has gone out, yet the last traces of qi linger in the pot—how could it last long? Though evil men have not yet encountered retribution, they are like those lingering traces of qi.\n\nThe worthy are what people aspire to, for they spend their years in goodness. What people despise is to end in death and lowliness—is this not so? Heaven and Earth govern with impartiality: they reward the good with life and punish the evil with death. This is how fortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities arise from the unseen. Disasters and harms cannot be averted by seeking refuge in wealth and nobility, nor are they incurred by enduring poverty and lowliness. Cultivating goodness brings blessings in response; doing evil brings calamity. Though a ruler may possess boundless treasures, when peril arises, even if he offers a city’s weight in gold to beg for life, can he obtain it?\n\nYet fools, seeing the rich and noble, all desire the same, striving to preserve it with toil and bitter intent—yet what they gain is not enduring. If one wishes to seek blessings, one must cultivate devotion to the Dao’s teachings. Let the entire household, young and old, unite in purpose, sweeping clean and burning incense, maintaining purity and solemnity. Present your prayers and state your desires. The Daoist adept, empty and attuned, responds to all—what could remain unanswered?\n\nIf one seeks blessings, one need not offer gold, silver, jade, silk, wealth, or bribes; one need not curry favor through worldly means, nor sacrifice with wine and meat. Simply turn your heart to the Dao, and what you seek shall be granted, fulfilling your wishes as you desire. The object of your prayer will swiftly manifest—no more is needed. Yet if one imitates the ways of the vulgar, turning from the law to make entreaties, every endeavor will end in failure.\n\nTo obtain blessings, one must devote oneself with diligence, maintaining purity morning and evening, burning incense and raising prayers—then no blessing will fail to respond. Those who delight in this practice will know boundless virtue; those who do not will follow their own hearts. The supreme Dao is vast and accommodating, leaving all to human choice. The worthy devote themselves to the Dao with diligence, ever fearful of falling short; fools treat the great Dao with carelessness, and their downfall is not far off. Such is the difference between the wise and the foolish.\n\nLearners, exert yourselves and practice diligently.\n\nThe Dao states: Among households that profess the Dao, when they encounter calamities, illnesses, death, or disputes with officials—any misfortune—it is always due to their lack of diligence in upholding the teachings. Though they revere the Dao and wish to follow it, their conduct differs little from the vulgar. Seeking to disrupt the true with deceit and falsehood will never succeed. Though such people may be nominally devoted to the Dao, hoping for its protection, the Dao does not save them. Evil men are dull and foolish, and few can truly reform their hearts, repent, and return sincerely to the Dao. Instead, they grow more perverse, claiming the Dao is not divine. Though they may not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor resentment. When their end comes, what use is regret? Fools—how grievous!\n\nThe worthy rectify their minds and guard their thoughts, never daring to slacken or falter. They restrain themselves and remain vigilant, diligently cultivating the Dao in all matters. The great Dao is most revered, lofty and without peer, all-encompassing without boundary, embracing Heaven and Earth, governing the myriad spirits. All living things—winged insects, crawling creatures, and all beings that contain qi—are born of the Dao. The Dao’s majestic spirit gathers all, moves all, dissolves all, and subdues all. It holds the mechanisms of Heaven and commands the myriad spirits.\n\nThe Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, boundless and infinite. Humans dwell within it, their years and lives fleeting as a spark from stone. The great Dao is vast and nurturing, cherishing human life. Human life is fragile and precarious, so it urges diligent cultivation of goodness. Yet people fail to reflect on the Dao, fail to cultivate goodness with devotion. They turn their backs on truth, disobeying teachings and precepts, coveting only wealth, honor, sensual pleasures, and riches—indulging in wine and meat, following their desires without restraint, growing arrogant and extravagant. How could they still think of the Dao?\n\nWhen people do not think of the Dao, the Dao does not think of them. Humans are like fish: they live in water, but perish when it is gone. When the Dao departs from a person, what hope is there for long life? The key lies in diligence and keeping the supreme Dao in mind.\n\nAll worthy ones who wish to preserve their lives must first cast aside past transgressions and cultivate future goodness. When they see others err, they should admonish and exhort one another, teaching each other to do good, repaying kindness with virtue—thus receiving boundless blessings. The Dao has no form or appearance, no visible deeds. If one seeks grace and blessings, one must cultivate practice, maintaining purity day and night.\n\nWhen one sees others ill or in distress, one should aid and assist them, showing compassion in times of urgency. One must not deceive the foolish with cunning, nor abuse power to oppress, nor invoke gods and ghosts to intimidate the simple. Some, possessing a little knowledge, boast and belittle others, sowing doubt and slander, engaging in divisive disputes. The worthy must not respect the noble and despise the lowly, nor harbor love and hatred in their hearts. They must not seek blessings by following their emotions, nor offer charity with ulterior motives, lest they undermine the true teaching and bring misfortune upon themselves.\n\nInstead, they should seek those of like mind, illuminate one another with shared understanding, and instruct one another in the same teachings. If men or women are illiterate, yet sincerely devoted to the Dao, they may approach those who are learned, listening to the recitation of scriptures and precepts in quiet abodes.",

      "translated_text": "One may also sweep and clean the hall, tidying one’s appearance, settling the body and calming the spirit, listening with focused and clear intent. Let there be no reckless chatter or idle speech, no wayward conduct or deviant thoughts, no distraction from the scriptures and precepts, no drowsy wandering or fitful sleep, no wearying of the spirit or tormenting thoughts, no self-inflicted exhaustion that yields only suffering and no benefit. If one can uphold these precepts with unflagging diligence, blessings will surely follow—heavenly officials and divine soldiers will come to guard them, warding off all misfortunes.\n\nAmong the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble. Yet though all know the month of their birth, none know the day of their death. Whether wise or foolish, wealthy or poor, each claims their allotted span of years, yet who would willingly hasten their own ruin? Ruin is what no one desires, yet fools accumulate sins and commit evil, falling ill unto death, unable to awaken to the blessings of cultivating the Dao and performing good deeds. The span of human life is ordained by Heaven. Though Heaven does not speak, it ever bestows fortune upon the virtuous. Thus the sages adapt to the world: when the age is pure, they appear; when it is benighted, they withdraw. They cannot remain forever, and so they leave behind teachings and precepts. These teachings urge people to do good, to preserve their bodies and protect their lives. If one can uphold the precepts without weariness, how could one merely attain a full lifespan? One may even extend their years and receive boundless blessings. This is not something that wealth and nobility can purchase, nor can it be obtained through offerings of wine and meat or prayers to ghosts and spirits.\n\nDaoist adepts and the worthy revere and uphold these teachings, devoting themselves with single-minded diligence. Though they may endure hardship at first, sweetness follows, and their hidden efforts meet with responsive harmony. Whether wise or foolish, wealthy or poor, all have their desires. Yet only the Daoist, steadfast in purpose, can use the teachings to examine themselves, governing their conduct, movements, and even their loves and desires, never transgressing the precepts and keeping their hearts free from waywardness. When they see beauty or profit, they cover their eyes with the precepts; when they hear praise or slander, they block their ears with the precepts; when they taste sweet and fragrant delicacies, they seal their mouths with the precepts; when they crave wealth or desire, they restrain their hearts with the precepts; when they encounter deceit or incline toward evil, they sever their steps with the precepts. If they uphold these without fail, they may be called enlightened. They must diligently exhort the foolish, enabling them to follow and apply these teachings.\n\nThus, when Daoists cultivate goodness and bestow kindness, the Dao of Heaven responds, and they receive immeasurable blessings. The Dao emerges from spontaneity, existing before Heaven and Earth, named the Supreme, the Mysterious and Ancient, the Most High. The three qi intermingle in primordial chaos as the Supreme and Perfect Dao. Vast and boundless, the Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, transforming and animating the divine qi, extending beyond the eight directions, yet dwelling within the finest hair. It gives life to the ten thousand things, governs the myriad heavens, and oversees the hundred billions. It covers all that is great and enters all that is small. Serene and non-interfering, it endures forever; embracing the turbid and enduring the foul, it becomes the mother of the ten thousand things. The Dao is impartial, yet it befriends only the good. The good, through their efforts, attain divine transcendence—this is not something the wealthy can purchase, nor can the poor, through disdain, fail to attain it. If one can wholeheartedly delight in it, meditate with sincerity, cultivate the body, and perform good deeds, they will align with the Dao.\n\nYet worldly people are shallow, superficial, and deceitful, drifting among the common herd. They chase fleeting pleasures, drinking wine and eating meat to gratify their desires, unwilling to endure hardship in cultivating the Dao, making offerings, burning incense, or revering the true teaching. They should instead cultivate merit, establish teachings, practice humility and benevolence, embrace gentleness and yielding, nurture pure and tranquil thoughts, and cultivate the body through non-action. Though the beginning may be arduous, they will ultimately receive blessings, never to be counted among the vulgar. Yet people cling only to momentary gains, and when their lives end, their names are recorded in the black ledgers of the ghostly registers. The distance between Daoists and worldly people is vast indeed. How can this be explained?",

Foolish people cling to worldly ways and do not uphold the Dao and its teachings; this is truly great delusion.\n\nIn the life of the body, each person possesses eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind, yet the conduct of the wise and the foolish differs: the foolish fix their eyes on beauty, their ears on praise and blame, their noses on sweet fragrances, their mouths on the finest flavors, and their minds on reckless desires. They follow their impulses, drawn toward deceit and wrongdoing. The wise are not so—their eyes do not seek favored sights, their ears do not heed wicked words, their noses do not indulge in foul odors, their mouths do not crave rich flavors, their minds do not dwell on fleeting pleasures, and their feet do not tread toward evil deeds.\n\nThe Daoist’s practice is to recognize what brings pleasure yet restrain the passions through precepts, thus avoiding wrongdoing. By accumulating good deeds and aligning with the Dao, they receive boundless blessings. The foolish, though they know evil invites misfortune, cannot commit with sincerity and thus oppose the Dao. If they desire blessings, why not emulate the Daoist—uphold the Dao in purity, abide in truth, and practice non-action? They should diligently endure hardship, advance with devotion, and cultivate with care. Then they will know neither poverty nor humiliation, nor oppression by the powerful, nor rivalry with the wealthy, nor the toil of servitude. Why not engage in good works, devote themselves wholly to the Dao, and diligently guard its Way, focusing all thoughts on its practice?\n\nA thousand good deeds must be completed, ten thousand virtues fully realized. Even with nine hundred and ninety-nine acts of goodness, if one remains unfulfilled, the slightest pursuit of gain will undo all prior merit.
