When the Great Ultimate first divided, the Two Modes emerged, both transformed from the singular *qi* of the Dao.\n\nPrior to the *Longhan* and *Yankang* eras, the *qi* of the Dao stretched boundlessly, forms and images yet unformed, without shape or vessel—only swirling, surging mists. At the dawn of the *Chiming* era, the radiance of yang essence first shone, its revolutions unfathomable—what is called \"transformation without transformation,\" spontaneous and self-so.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Longhan* era, three thousand billion, nine hundred fifty-one myriad years passed. The Jade Clarity [Heaven] began its revolution, precisely aligning with the Great Beginning, flowing into the myriad images and weaving the *qi* of the Dao. During the Shangqing transformations, seventy-nine billion, thirty-nine myriad years elapsed; the Great Elixir took form, and the sun, moon, and five planets first appeared. The mechanisms of the Dao lay hidden, its transformative beginnings faintly revealed.\n\nDuring the Taiqing refinement, fifty billion, twelve myriad years passed. The ten thousand heavens spread like a chessboard, divine transformations shone brilliantly, creation poured forth, and the cosmos took shape. The High Mystery became luminous and vast, and the Great Dao unfolded.\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, in the Wondrous Realm of Jade Clarity within the Divine Empyrean of the Pure Tenuity Heaven, transmitted the teachings to the Lord of the Dao: the *True Scripture of the Mysterious Unity*, the *Golden Pronouncements of the Numinous Treasure*, and the *Boundless Wondrous Secrets*. From the dawn of enlightenment to the present age, the Lord of the Dao has descended into the world one thousand five hundred twenty times.\n\nNow, as the Yang Ninth Fortune nears its end, heaven and earth undergo transformation, and the people and creatures suffer untimely harm. Moved by compassion, the Lord of the Dao expounded these three scrolls of scripture and dispatched the Left Mysterious Perfected to bestow them upon the Penglai Palace. The Perfected within the palace inscribed them upon jade tablets, reciting and chanting them daily.\n\nBeholding the multitudes below enduring myriad hardships, adrift in the mire of suffering, scarcely able to regain human form, the decree of the Jade Dawn descended to the world, entrusting the scripture to the faithful. Those who guard their bodies and preserve their lives must not reveal it to the wicked or unbelieving, lest they mock or profane it. To do so would bring calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the ghostly officials. Strive to practice it, guarding it in secrecy and reverence.\n\nThis scripture bears three names:\n1. *The Golden Casket and Jade Mirror True Scripture*\n2. *Illuminating the Mysteries and Repenting Hidden Transgressions*\n3. *The Divine Treasure Secret Chapters*\n\nIts wondrous principles dispel delusion and awaken those with karmic affinity. Cultivate and advance in it, and you may summon the numinous *qi* to the Three Passes, and cause the radiant blossoms of the Nine Portals to flourish. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, your name shall be inscribed in the Jade Court.\n\nFor those of utmost filial piety, repaying the roots of their ancestors and upholding the rites of recitation—though their ancestors, myriad in number and distant by a hundred generations, may be bound in the hidden sufferings—by this merit, all shall immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Mound.\n\nFor those in the world afflicted by yearly misfortunes, monthly calamities, or inexplicable entanglements, let them uphold the rites of recitation and veneration. Thus shall heavenly disasters be averted above, and poisonous harms dispelled below, ensuring the peace of family and state.\n\nFor those of good karmic affinity who cultivate the truth, delving into and awakening to it, their hidden sins shall dissolve in the dark paths, their numinous perfection shall be complete in pure virtue, and they shall merge with the wondrous Dao, attaining the body of an immortal. If they further establish conduct and merit, aiding others and all beings, they shall transcend a hundred generations of ancestors, extending blessings to descendants, bringing prosperity and flourishing through the ages, giving rise to the worthy and the sagely.\n\nThis Dao is most revered and wondrous, its merits boundless. To revere and uphold it is to attain all things.\n\n---\n\n**Rites for Recitation**\n\nBefore reciting this scripture, first bathe in fragrant waters and purify yourself for seven days. In a clean chamber, sit facing east, and knock the teeth together thirty-six times. Close the eyes and meditate, envisioning yourself seated amidst clouds of cyan, yellow, and purple *qi*. Visualize the Northern Dipper covering your head, the *Gang* star pointing before you, and at a distance of seven feet, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior emerging from their respective positions, arrayed to your left, right, front, and rear.\n\nNext, visualize between your eyebrows, in the two small cavities, the sun emerging from the left, its nine rays of purple and crimson, and the moon from the right, its ten rays of yellow and white, each extending nine feet, filling the chamber with radiant mist. Then, envision the light of the sun and moon pouring into your nose, entering the Golden Flower Palace four inches behind the brain. From the nape of your neck, a circular image, vast as a chariot wheel, emerges, its brilliance resplendent. When this is vividly clear, silently recite the *Mysterious Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture*.\n\nAfterward, burn incense, open the scripture, kneel, bow, and invoke the sacred name of the Celestial Venerable. Divine generals and guardian spirits shall encamp to protect you. If your devotion is sincere, the merits of your recitation shall be beyond enumeration.\n\n---\n\n**Mysterious Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture**\n\nIn the Palace of Cinnabar of the Heavenly Perfected,\nWithin the Jade Chamber of the Pure and Numinous,\nThe Sixfold Unity of the Verdant Mystery,\nThe Primordial Terrace of the August Lord.\nPrimal thoughts generate the essence-*qi*,\nSoaring through the lofty void, the celestial chariot follows.\nThe *Heart Scripture* conceals the Three Abodes,\nPerfuming the fragrant chamber of longevity.\nThe Purple Hall connects to the Crimson Gate,\nThe Scarlet City, the wondrous field and granary.\nThe Gate of the Spirit observes the true principle,\nPristine, the incense of Dao and wisdom.\nGuard life and nature in emptiness and nothingness,\nEmbrace the pearl and hold the jade yang.\nReturn the spirit to the wealth of the homeland,\nAscend in clarity to the Purple Longevity Realm.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Golden Casket and Jade Mirror Scripture for Prolonging Life, Illuminating the Mysteries, and Repenting Hidden Transgressions**\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao, upon the Seven Treasures Terrace in the Mysterious Capital Mountain of the Great Clarity Heaven, convened the assembly of celestial immortals. Burning the natural sandalwood incense, he addressed the immortals, saying:\n\n\"The sentient beings below are all born through the wombs of their parents, receiving life from heaven and form from earth. The sun is their *hun*, the moon their *po*. Endowed with the numinous among the myriad things, only humans are so honored. At the moment of birth, they receive the pure and tranquil *qi* of heaven and earth, originally unstained, destined to endure as long as the cosmos. Yet after the dispersal of simplicity, they become entangled in love and desire, turning from truth and losing their nature. They follow things and follow emotions, indulging in deceit, greed, lust, cruelty, killing, theft, malicious speech, duplicity, anger, ignorance, jealousy, disloyalty, unfiliality, betrayal of righteousness, ingratitude, slander of the Dao, and defamation of the true. They commit all manner of transgressions, flowing into the Three Wretched Realms, with no hope of escape.\"\n\nSome offend against the stars, trespassing against heaven and earth, thereby bringing forth military disasters, floods and droughts, plagues and poisons, infestations of insects, snakes, tigers, and wolves, as well as malevolent spirits, curses, and demonic illusions. Sickness, official punishments, and all manner of calamities arise together, extinguishing households and casting them adrift in seas of suffering.\n\nAt that moment, among the assembly, a Perfected One named Universal Salvation rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, gazed upon the august countenance, and knelt to say: \"Such beings, enduring these bitter retributions—by what cause and condition may they escape their suffering? I pray you bestow your profound grace to broadly deliver those sunk in the depths.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Return to your seat and compose your thoughts; I shall expound for you.\"\n\nDevout men and women beset by calamities and misfortunes, entangled in inextricable troubles, may bathe and fast according to the Dharma, purify body and mind before the images of the Three Clarities, and offer rare flowers, precious fruits, pure water, fine incense, lamps, candles, and sweet wine. With sincere reverence, they shall make their confession:\n\n\"Disciple So-and-so, from kalpas past until this day, has not believed in the scriptures and teachings, practicing only transgressions. Stirring the Ten Evils, the mind deluded by the Five Poisons; performing the Three Karmas, committing boundless sins. Evil draws evil, summoning manifold disasters. Today, by good fortune, I have heard the true teaching, awakened to past wrongs, and earnestly pray with utmost sincerity, repenting with a single mind. I humbly beseech the sagely compassion to eradicate all former sins. With devoted heart, I bow in reverence:\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, Self-So from the Void.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Jade Dawn Dao Lord of the Great Dao.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Most High Sagely Ancestor Lord Lao.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects Life and Safeguards the Body.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy Who Protects Life.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy Who Dispels Disasters and Eliminates Illness.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy Who Oversees Birth, Records Merit, and Extends Longevity.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Fixes Destiny and Inspects the Registers.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Perfected One Who Expounds the Dharma by Decree of August Heaven.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Great Compassionate Perfected One Who Descends to Save the Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Compassionate Perfected One Who Delivers from Calamity.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Perfected One Who Responds to Cries and Saves the Suffering.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Perfected One Who Aids the Living and Delivers the Dead.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Perfected One of Myriad Blessings Who Protects the Body.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Dharma Master Who Upholds the Teaching of Penglai.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Dharma Master of Penglai Who Communicates with Heaven.\n\nTo these sagely titles, one should pay reverent homage. Reciting them forty-nine times daily, or even a hundred times, will summon the divine soldiers of the Dharma-protectors and the Perfected Ones Who Save the Suffering to constantly guard and shield, averting disasters and dangers. Myriad calamities will silently dissolve, and blessings and longevity will increase. If any being hears these sagely titles and reverently bows in homage, the merit will be no different from the above. After the rites conclude, with utmost sincerity, one shall again make confession:\n\n\"Disciple and subject So-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this day, has been disloyal to the sovereign, disrespectful to honored kin, irreverent to teachers, unkind to siblings, flattering superiors and oppressing inferiors, turning from kin toward strangers, heeding the words of wives and concubines, defying parents’ teachings. Or, as a woman, one’s nature and conduct are impure, disobeying parents, unfilial to in-laws, disrupting the six relations, belittling one’s husband, wasting the five grains, cutting cloth without reason, stealing and slandering, quarreling with neighbors, constantly harboring jealousy, nursing secret resentments—such transgressions must summon bitter retribution. In life, one is despised by others; in death, one falls into hell. Reverently facing the sagely Perfected, I confess all these sins.\"\n\n\"Disciple and subject So-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this day, has acted without righteousness, behaved contrary to principle, flaunted power when wealthy, raged violently when poor, taken evil as ability, raged at the sight of killing, killed for wealth, overthrown others for position, slaughtered the surrendered, oppressed the orphaned and widowed, disrupted state governance, scorned the people, envied the worthy and talented, concealed good and proclaimed evil, taught others to do wrong, drawn others into one’s own sins, shot flying birds, pursued running beasts, startled roosting fowl, filled burrows and destroyed nests, harmed fetuses and crushed eggs, stolen, committed adultery, spoken false and frivolous words, drunk wine and eaten meat, cursed with two tongues, been miserly, greedy, angry, and foolish, cruel, obstinate, cunning, deceitful, treacherous, and harmful, known wrongs but not corrected them, known good but not practiced it—all manner of evil causes and sins have been committed without exception. Today, I reveal them all, daring not to conceal. Reverently facing the sagely Perfected, I beseech forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Disciple and subject So-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this day, has not recognized the true Dao, repeatedly committing transgressions: resenting heaven and cursing earth, reviling wind and rain, loathing cold and heat, despising the Three Luminaries, slandering sages and worthies, encroaching upon the Dao and virtue, belittling sacred scriptures, obstructing good affinities, rejecting the Most High Perfected, defiling temple images, staring at the sun and moon, pointing at the Three Luminaries, pointing at rainbows and spitting at stars, polluting wells and hearths, cursing and swearing by spirits, breaking vows and violating precepts, misinterpreting sacred discourses, recklessly revealing heavenly secrets. Today, I disclose all these, daring not to repeat them. Reverently facing the sagely Perfected, I beseech forgiveness.\"\n\nWith sincere repentance, one shall bow in reverence with devoted heart:\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, Self-So from the Void.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Jade Dawn Dao Lord of the Great Dao.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Most High Sagely Ancestor Lord Lao.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the August Jade Emperor of August Heaven.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Great Emperor of the Southern Culmen Who Records Birth.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Imperial Lord of the Sun Palace.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the August Sovereign of the Moon Palace.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of Wood Virtue, the Year Star.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of Fire Virtue, Mars.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of Metal Virtue, Venus.\n\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of Water Virtue, Mercury.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of Earth Virtue, Saturn.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of the Head of the Celestial Net, Rāhu.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of the Tail of the Celestial Net, Ketu.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of the Celestial Unity and Purple Qi.\nWith devoted heart, I bow in reverence to the Star Lord of the Great Unity and Moon Comet.\nThe rites completed in reverence, I now make confession.\n\nThis disciple, your humble servant so-and-so, from the beginningless past until this very day, has often strayed from the true Dao, amassing roots of transgression. I have trodden the heavens and earth yet remained unaware of their sheltering and sustaining; I have gazed upon the sun and moon yet failed to feel their illumination. The Five Constants have long lain neglected in inner cultivation, while the Six Defilements have proven inescapable, bringing calamity in their wake.\n\nPerhaps in this life or past existences, I have accumulated lingering misfortunes—committing the gravest of killings and injuries, harming creatures and wounding others. Or perhaps I have broken fasts and violated precepts, betrayed vows and deceived my own heart, harboring love and hatred in my thoughts, breeding flattery and malice in my mind. I have sworn oaths beneath the stars and spoken ill of divine beings. I have defaulted on debts and betrayed kindness, indulging in greed without remorse, pursuing a thousand schemes in my endeavors, ever bent on securing my livelihood. How could I distinguish the rules of good and evil? How could I comprehend the measures of life and death?\n\nNow, I reflect and seek to amend my faults, fully confessing my transgressions. With utmost sincerity, I humbly beseech your merciful forgiveness. I dare to lay bare the earnestness of my foolish heart, distantly entreating the august ones of the boundless heavens.\n\nI pray that you may turn your divine favor toward me and look upon my humble devotion. Erase the transgressions recorded in the Black Registers and inscribe goodness upon the Vermilion Terrace. May the gods dissolve my calamities, and may my fortunes of adversity be dispelled. Let misfortunes sink into past kalpas, and blessings descend upon this very moment. In all things, may I ever bask in the shade of the Dao.\n\nYour servant, overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, offers this prayer with utmost reverence. I prostrate before the Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\n\nLord Lao said: \"Whenever one performs the rites of this scripture, one must bathe in fragrant water and observe purification. Only then may one attain spiritual resonance, for the merit and virtue are boundless and universally salvific.\"\n\nOne inquired: \"May I be instructed in the method of purification and bathing?\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Fragrant water is the Five Fragrances Decoction. The method is as follows: take *qingmuxiang* (costus root), white sandalwood, *maoxiang* (cogon grass), *chenxiang* (aloeswood), and *xunluxiang* (frankincense)—quantities as appropriate—and one *dan* of pure water. First, boil with peach bark and bamboo leaves, bringing it to a rolling boil several times, then strain to remove the dregs. Next, add the five fragrances in appropriate amounts. If dwelling in secluded mountains or lacking means, peach and bamboo alone will suffice.\n\nBegin by washing the hair. Take a wooden ladle, point its handle toward the moon, and visualize five-colored clouds of qi filling the room, with the light of the Three Luminaries shining upon the basin. Stir the fragrant water with the ladle, moving leftward thirty-six times. As you gaze upon the fragrant water, recite the incantation:\n\n*True liquid of the Great Mystery, refining qi to birth clouds.\nBathe and nourish the verdant blossoms, chanting the Cavernous Scriptures.\nMay my seven ancestors ascend as immortals, and may I soar to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nRecite this seven times. Then, approach your couch, disrobe, and recite the incantation:\n\n*Five Pecks arrayed as garments, dragons and tigers attend the perfected.\nThe Three Luminaries shine resplendent, ascending to the Jade Dawn.\nLoosening my sash, I become immortal, granting me eternal life.*\n\nNext, untie your hair and proceed to wash it, reciting the incantation:\n\n*Divine officials shake the heavens, black clouds disperse and part.\nMolten gold and fire bells cast forth boundless radiance.\nGrant me communion with the perfected, roaming the myriad heavens.\nUnlimited deliverance of beings, summoning the immortals of destiny.*\n\nAfter washing your hair, gather it into a topknot and don your cap, reciting the incantation:\n\n*Layers of azure mystery, towering peaks of jade capital.\nCrown and topknot summon immortals, the Five Qi gather the perfected.\nDivine splendor radiates from my hair, ascending to the imperial court.*\n\nThen enter the bath. Take the ladle, draw in the qi of the five directions, and stir the water thirty-six times. Upon completion, hold the ladle toward the auspicious direction and recite the incantation:\n\n*Jade springs of the Rain Pool, bathe my form.\nWithin, refine the Five Viscera; without, unblock the Nine Gates.\nMay the qi flow freely, washing away corpse impurities and cleansing defilements.\nTen thousand recitations ensure my ascent to the imperial court.*\n\nNext, visualize the Three Luminaries entering the water, soak for a while, then bathe. Afterward, take a separate portion of the Five Fragrances Decoction, drink a cup, and compose your spirit in silent contemplation, envisioning inner and outer purity. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*Yellow gods guard the passes, the Azure Emperor protects my soul.\nCelestial couriers roar, myriad demons lose their sight.\nCorpse blood is wholly cleansed, blue worms extinguished in form.\nThe Seven Po are refined and transformed, purple clouds arise of themselves.\nRoaming and feasting in the Great Void, high immortals join in companionship.*\n\nThen don your clothes and recite the incantation:\n\n*Divine youths attend my garments, jade maidens burn incense.\nAscending to venerate the scriptural treasures, jade tones resound in harmony.\nDeliver my seven ancestors, eradicate calamities and misfortunes.\nProlong years and extend life, bestowing cloud nectar and celestial sustenance.*\n\nPurification means inwardly purifying the heart and outwardly purifying the form. Precepts mean inwardly upholding resolve and outwardly upholding conduct. When setting up an offering altar and presenting memorials, follow this same method. There is no calamity that will not be eradicated, no wish that will not be fulfilled. Those who cultivate the true must diligently and reverently adhere to this.\n\nThe Dao teaches: \"No virtue is greater than cherishing life; no merit is greater than cultivation and completion.\" All beings within the dusty realm—though their endowments differ—share the same nature and life. When one sees others suffering from illness, official punishment, hunger, poverty, or distress, or creatures—whether on land, in water, or in flight—trapped in dire straits, and is able to compassionately aid and rescue them, this is called the virtue of cherishing life.\n\nFurthermore, when men and women joyfully donate wealth to construct palaces and temples, paint and sculpt divine images, print and transcribe scriptures, recite and teach them, craft banners and flowers, offer lamps and candles, or perform various acts of almsgiving and offerings—even such deeds as repairing roads, building bridges, planting trees, or mending dikes and canals—this is called the merit of cultivation and completion.\n\nIf there are beings who, in their ignorance and recklessness, disparage the scriptures, harm life, or destroy merit, know that such persons will find their roots of transgression difficult to eradicate. Their lives will sink into the Six Realms, forever losing the human form. Kalpa after kalpa, life after life, they will have no means of escape. Faithful men and virtuous women, be warned and take heed.\n\nLord Lao said: \"This scripture was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Dao Lord. I now transmit it to you for dissemination in the world. When recited, its sound ascends to the Purple Ultimate, and all the heavens hear it.\"\n\nThe Most High rejoiced in song, and all Perfected Ones paid reverence. Thus could they rescue the suffering from the Three Wretched Realms and exalt both form and spirit to the Upper Clarity. Countless generations of ancestors were all immediately delivered. Those still living received blessings—fortune and emolument increased and extended, and their virtue of cherishing life grew ever broader. The merit of cultivation and completion encompassed honoring and nourishing one’s parents, revering and serving teachers and friends, aiding and relieving the poor and destitute, and redressing long-buried grievances. Such virtues and powers surpassed all others. Following this scripture, both life and completion were fully realized.\n\nI dispatch inspectors to record your conduct and report it to the Jade Clarity, where your name is inscribed in the Golden Register. According to the depth of your practice, you may attain the rank of Perfected One. Those who encounter this scripture should redouble their efforts. Thus did the Universal Salvation receive the true scripture.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy, they spoke this gāthā:\nProfound is the Primordial Venerable Lord,\nThe compassionate father and mother of all beings.\nHis teachings unfold the inconceivable,\nUniversally rescuing from boundless suffering.\nIf one can hold it with sincere devotion,\nBoth the living and the dead are delivered.\nVirtue and power treasure life and completion,\nFollowing the practice to ascend the immortal path.\n\nAt that time, having spoken this gāthā, all the heavenly immortals with one voice praised its goodness. They bowed their heads in reverence, prostrating twice before the Most Venerable, then withdrew in respect.\n\nThus concludes the *Golden Casket, Jade Mirror, Luminous Mystery, Illuminating the Hidden Repentance for Prolonging Life*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Golden Casket and Jade Mirror Scripture for Prolonging Life, Illuminating the Mysteries, and Repenting Hidden Transgressions**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Golden Casket and Jade Mirror Scripture for Prolonging Life, Illuminating the Mysteries, and Repenting Hidden Transgressions* (One Scroll)\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Weiyi* Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface by the Void-Unity Perfected**\n\nBefore the separation of purity and turbidity, there was no distinction between darkness and dawn. When the Great Ultimate first divided, the Two Modes emerged, both transformed from the singular *qi* of the Dao.\n\nPrior to the *Longhan* and *Yankang* eras, the *qi* of the Dao stretched boundlessly, forms and images yet unformed, without shape or vessel—only swirling, surging mists. At the dawn of the *Chiming* era, the radiance of yang essence first shone, its revolutions unfathomable—what is called \"transformation without transformation,\" spontaneous and self-so.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Longhan* era, three thousand billion, nine hundred fifty-one myriad years passed. The Jade Clarity [Heaven] began its revolution, precisely aligning with the Great Beginning, flowing into the myriad images and weaving the *qi* of the Dao. During the Shangqing transformations, seventy-nine billion, thirty-nine myriad years elapsed; the Great Elixir took form, and the sun, moon, and five planets first appeared. The mechanisms of the Dao lay hidden, its transformative beginnings faintly revealed.\n\nDuring the Taiqing refinement, fifty billion, twelve myriad years passed. The ten thousand heavens spread like a chessboard, divine transformations shone brilliantly, creation poured forth, and the cosmos took shape. The High Mystery became luminous and vast, and the Great Dao unfolded.\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, in the Wondrous Realm of Jade Clarity within the Divine Empyrean of the Pure Tenuity Heaven, transmitted the teachings to the Lord of the Dao: the *True Scripture of the Mysterious Unity*, the *Golden Pronouncements of the Numinous Treasure*, and the *Boundless Wondrous Secrets*. From the dawn of enlightenment to the present age, the Lord of the Dao has descended into the world one thousand five hundred twenty times.\n\nNow, as the Yang Ninth Fortune nears its end, heaven and earth undergo transformation, and the people and creatures suffer untimely harm. Moved by compassion, the Lord of the Dao expounded these three scrolls of scripture and dispatched the Left Mysterious Perfected to bestow them upon the Penglai Palace. The Perfected within the palace inscribed them upon jade tablets, reciting and chanting them daily.\n\nBeholding the multitudes below enduring myriad hardships, adrift in the mire of suffering, scarcely able to regain human form, the decree of the Jade Dawn descended to the world, entrusting the scripture to the faithful. Those who guard their bodies and preserve their lives must not reveal it to the wicked or unbelieving, lest they mock or profane it. To do so would bring calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under the ghostly officials. Strive to practice it, guarding it in secrecy and reverence.\n\nThis scripture bears three names:\n1. *The Golden Casket and Jade Mirror True Scripture*\n2. *Illuminating the Mysteries and Repenting Hidden Transgressions*\n3. *The Divine Treasure Secret Chapters*\n\nIts wondrous principles dispel delusion and awaken those with karmic affinity. Cultivate and advance in it, and you may summon the numinous *qi* to the Three Passes, and cause the radiant blossoms of the Nine Portals to flourish. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, your name shall be inscribed in the Jade Court.\n\nFor those of utmost filial piety, repaying the roots of their ancestors and upholding the rites of recitation—though their ancestors, myriad in number and distant by a hundred generations, may be bound in the hidden sufferings—by this merit, all shall immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Mound.\n\nFor those in the world afflicted by yearly misfortunes, monthly calamities, or inexplicable entanglements, let them uphold the rites of recitation and veneration. Thus shall heavenly disasters be averted above, and poisonous harms dispelled below, ensuring the peace of family and state.\n\nFor those of good karmic affinity who cultivate the truth, delving into and awakening to it, their hidden sins shall dissolve in the dark paths, their numinous perfection shall be complete in pure virtue, and they shall merge with the wondrous Dao, attaining the body of an immortal. If they further establish conduct and merit, aiding others and all beings, they shall transcend a hundred generations of ancestors, extending blessings to descendants, bringing prosperity and flourishing through the ages, giving rise to the worthy and the sagely.\n\nThis Dao is most revered and wondrous, its merits boundless. To revere and uphold it is to attain all things.\n\n---\n\n**Rites for Recitation**\n\nBefore reciting this scripture, first bathe in fragrant waters and purify yourself for seven days. In a clean chamber, sit facing east, and knock the teeth together thirty-six times. Close the eyes and meditate, envisioning yourself seated amidst clouds of cyan, yellow, and purple *qi*. Visualize the Northern Dipper covering your head, the *Gang* star pointing before you, and at a distance of seven feet, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior emerging from their respective positions, arrayed to your left, right, front, and rear.\n\nNext, visualize between your eyebrows, in the two small cavities, the sun emerging from the left, its nine rays of purple and crimson, and the moon from the right, its ten rays of yellow and white, each extending nine feet, filling the chamber with radiant mist. Then, envision the light of the sun and moon pouring into your nose, entering the Golden Flower Palace four inches behind the brain. From the nape of your neck, a circular image, vast as a chariot wheel, emerges, its brilliance resplendent. When this is vividly clear, silently recite the *Mysterious Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture*.\n\nAfterward, burn incense, open the scripture, kneel, bow, and invoke the sacred name of the Celestial Venerable. Divine generals and guardian spirits shall encamp to protect you. If your devotion is sincere, the merits of your recitation shall be beyond enumeration.\n\n---\n\n**Mysterious Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture**\n\nIn the Palace of Cinnabar of the Heavenly Perfected,\nWithin the Jade Chamber of the Pure and Numinous,\nThe Sixfold Unity of the Verdant Mystery,\nThe Primordial Terrace of the August Lord.\nPrimal thoughts generate the essence-*qi*,\nSoaring through the lofty void, the celestial chariot follows.\nThe *Heart Scripture* conceals the Three Abodes,\nPerfuming the fragrant chamber of longevity.\nThe Purple Hall connects to the Crimson Gate,\nThe Scarlet City, the wondrous field and granary.\nThe Gate of the Spirit observes the true principle,\nPristine, the incense of Dao and wisdom.\nGuard life and nature in emptiness and nothingness,\nEmbrace the pearl and hold the jade yang.\nReturn the spirit to the wealth of the homeland,\nAscend in clarity to the Purple Longevity Realm.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Golden Casket and Jade Mirror Scripture for Prolonging Life, Illuminating the Mysteries, and Repenting Hidden Transgressions**\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao, upon the Seven Treasures Terrace in the Mysterious Capital Mountain of the Great Clarity Heaven, convened the assembly of celestial immortals. Burning the natural sandalwood incense, he addressed the immortals, saying:\n\n\"The sentient beings below are all born through the wombs of their parents, receiving life from heaven and form from earth. The sun is their *hun*, the moon their *po*. Endowed with the numinous among the myriad things, only humans are so honored. At the moment of birth, they receive the pure and tranquil *qi* of heaven and earth, originally unstained, destined to endure as long as the cosmos. Yet after the dispersal of simplicity, they become entangled in love and desire, turning from truth and losing their nature. They follow things and follow emotions, indulging in deceit, greed, lust, cruelty, killing, theft, malicious speech, duplicity, anger, ignorance, jealousy, disloyalty, unfiliality, betrayal of righteousness, ingratitude, slander of the Dao, and defamation of the true. They commit all manner of transgressions, flowing into the Three Wretched Realms, with no hope of escape.\"",

I have trodden the heavens and earth yet remained unaware of their sheltering and sustaining; I have gazed upon the sun and moon yet failed to feel their illumination. The Five Constants have long lain neglected in inner cultivation, while the Six Defilements have proven inescapable, bringing calamity in their wake.\n\nPerhaps in this life or past existences, I have accumulated lingering misfortunes—committing the gravest of killings and injuries, harming creatures and wounding others. Or perhaps I have broken fasts and violated precepts, betrayed vows and deceived my own heart, harboring love and hatred in my thoughts, breeding flattery and malice in my mind. I have sworn oaths beneath the stars and spoken ill of divine beings. I have defaulted on debts and betrayed kindness, indulging in greed without remorse, pursuing a thousand schemes in my endeavors, ever bent on securing my livelihood. How could I distinguish the rules of good and evil? How could I comprehend the measures of life and death?\n\nNow, I reflect and seek to amend my faults, fully confessing my transgressions. With utmost sincerity, I humbly beseech your merciful forgiveness. I dare to lay bare the earnestness of my foolish heart, distantly entreating the august ones of the boundless heavens.\n\nI pray that you may turn your divine favor toward me and look upon my humble devotion. Erase the transgressions recorded in the Black Registers and inscribe goodness upon the Vermilion Terrace. May the gods dissolve my calamities, and may my fortunes of adversity be dispelled. Let misfortunes sink into past kalpas, and blessings descend upon this very moment. In all things, may I ever bask in the shade of the Dao.\n\nYour servant, overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, offers this prayer with utmost reverence. I prostrate before the Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\n\nLord Lao said: \"Whenever one performs the rites of this scripture, one must bathe in fragrant water and observe purification. Only then may one attain spiritual resonance, for the merit and virtue are boundless and universally salvific.\"\n\nOne inquired: \"May I be instructed in the method of purification and bathing?\"\n\nLord Lao said: \"Fragrant water is the Five Fragrances Decoction. The method is as follows: take *qingmuxiang* (costus root), white sandalwood, *maoxiang* (cogon grass), *chenxiang* (aloeswood), and *xunluxiang* (frankincense)—quantities as appropriate—and one *dan* of pure water. First, boil with peach bark and bamboo leaves, bringing it to a rolling boil several times, then strain to remove the dregs. Next, add the five fragrances in appropriate amounts. If dwelling in secluded mountains or lacking means, peach and bamboo alone will suffice.\n\nBegin by washing the hair. Take a wooden ladle, point its handle toward the moon, and visualize five-colored clouds of qi filling the room, with the light of the Three Luminaries shining upon the basin. Stir the fragrant water with the ladle, moving leftward thirty-six times. As you gaze upon the fragrant water, recite the incantation:\n\n*True liquid of the Great Mystery, refining qi to birth clouds.\nBathe and nourish the verdant blossoms, chanting the Cavernous Scriptures.\nMay my seven ancestors ascend as immortals, and may I soar to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nRecite this seven times. Then, approach your couch, disrobe, and recite the incantation:\n\n*Five Pecks arrayed as garments, dragons and tigers attend the perfected.\nThe Three Luminaries shine resplendent, ascending to the Jade Dawn.\nLoosening my sash, I become immortal, granting me eternal life.*\n\nNext, untie your hair and proceed to wash it, reciting the incantation:\n\n*Divine officials shake the heavens, black clouds disperse and part.\nMolten gold and fire bells cast forth boundless radiance.\nGrant me communion with the perfected, roaming the myriad heavens.\nUnlimited deliverance of beings, summoning the immortals of destiny.*\n\nAfter washing your hair, gather it into a topknot and don your cap, reciting the incantation:\n\n*Layers of azure mystery, towering peaks of jade capital.\nCrown and topknot summon immortals, the Five Qi gather the perfected.\nDivine splendor radiates from my hair, ascending to the imperial court.*\n\nThen enter the bath. Take the ladle, draw in the qi of the five directions, and stir the water thirty-six times. Upon completion, hold the ladle toward the auspicious direction and recite the incantation:\n\n*Jade springs of the Rain Pool, bathe my form.\nWithin, refine the Five Viscera; without, unblock the Nine Gates.\nMay the qi flow freely, washing away corpse impurities and cleansing defilements.\nTen thousand recitations ensure my ascent to the imperial court.*\n\nNext, visualize the Three Luminaries entering the water, soak for a while, then bathe. Afterward, take a separate portion of the Five Fragrances Decoction, drink a cup, and compose your spirit in silent contemplation, envisioning inner and outer purity. Then recite the incantation:\n\n*Yellow gods guard the passes, the Azure Emperor protects my soul.\nCelestial couriers roar, myriad demons lose their sight.\nCorpse blood is wholly cleansed, blue worms extinguished in form.\nThe Seven Po are refined and transformed, purple clouds arise of themselves.\nRoaming and feasting in the Great Void, high immortals join in companionship.*\n\nThen don your clothes and recite the incantation:\n\n*Divine youths attend my garments, jade maidens burn incense.\nAscending to venerate the scriptural treasures, jade tones resound in harmony.\nDeliver my seven ancestors, eradicate calamities and misfortunes.\nProlong years and extend life, bestowing cloud nectar and celestial sustenance.*\n\nPurification means inwardly purifying the heart and outwardly purifying the form. Precepts mean inwardly upholding resolve and outwardly upholding conduct. When setting up an offering altar and presenting memorials, follow this same method. There is no calamity that will not be eradicated, no wish that will not be fulfilled. Those who cultivate the true must diligently and reverently adhere to this.\n\nThe Dao teaches: \"No virtue is greater than cherishing life; no merit is greater than cultivation and completion.\" All beings within the dusty realm—though their endowments differ—share the same nature and life. When one sees others suffering from illness, official punishment, hunger, poverty, or distress, or creatures—whether on land, in water, or in flight—trapped in dire straits, and is able to compassionately aid and rescue them, this is called the virtue of cherishing life.\n\nFurthermore, when men and women joyfully donate wealth to construct palaces and temples, paint and sculpt divine images, print and transcribe scriptures, recite and teach them, craft banners and flowers, offer lamps and candles, or perform various acts of almsgiving and offerings—even such deeds as repairing roads, building bridges, planting trees, or mending dikes and canals—this is called the merit of cultivation and completion.\n\nIf there are beings who, in their ignorance and recklessness, disparage the scriptures, harm life, or destroy merit, know that such persons will find their roots of transgression difficult to eradicate. Their lives will sink into the Six Realms, forever losing the human form. Kalpa after kalpa, life after life, they will have no means of escape. Faithful men and virtuous women, be warned and take heed.\n\nLord Lao said: \"This scripture was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Dao Lord. I now transmit it to you for dissemination in the world. When recited, its sound ascends to the Purple Ultimate, and all the heavens hear it.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Most High rejoiced in song, and all Perfected Ones paid reverence. Thus could they rescue the suffering from the Three Wretched Realms and exalt both form and spirit to the Upper Clarity. Countless generations of ancestors were all immediately delivered. Those still living received blessings—fortune and emolument increased and extended, and their virtue of cherishing life grew ever broader. The merit of cultivation and completion encompassed honoring and nourishing one’s parents, revering and serving teachers and friends, aiding and relieving the poor and destitute, and redressing long-buried grievances. Such virtues and powers surpassed all others. Following this scripture, both life and completion were fully realized.\n\nI dispatch inspectors to record your conduct and report it to the Jade Clarity, where your name is inscribed in the Golden Register. According to the depth of your practice, you may attain the rank of Perfected One. Those who encounter this scripture should redouble their efforts. Thus did the Universal Salvation receive the true scripture.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy, they spoke this gāthā:\nProfound is the Primordial Venerable Lord,\nThe compassionate father and mother of all beings.\nHis teachings unfold the inconceivable,\nUniversally rescuing from boundless suffering.\nIf one can hold it with sincere devotion,\nBoth the living and the dead are delivered.\nVirtue and power treasure life and completion,\nFollowing the practice to ascend the immortal path.\n\nAt that time, having spoken this gāthā, all the heavenly immortals with one voice praised its goodness. They bowed their heads in reverence, prostrating twice before the Most Venerable, then withdrew in respect.\n\nThus concludes the *Golden Casket, Jade Mirror, Luminous Mystery, Illuminating the Hidden Repentance for Prolonging Life*.",
      "overlap_context": "persons will find their roots of transgression difficult to eradicate. Their lives will sink into the Six Realms, forever losing the human form. Kalpa after kalpa, life after life, they will have no means of escape. Faithful men and virtuous women, be warned and take heed.\n\nLord Lao said: \"This scripture was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Dao Lord. I now transmit it to you for dissemination in the world. When recited, its sound ascends to the Purple Ultimate, and all the heavens hear it.\"",
