  "full_translation": "**The Transformations of the Dao**\n*By Tan Qiao of the Five Dynasties*\n*Scroll One: The Transformations of the Dao*\n\nWhere the Dao abides, the Void transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into form—form arises, and the myriad things are thus obstructed. Where the Dao operates, form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Void—the Void becomes luminous, and the myriad things are thus permeable. Therefore, the ancient sages exhausted the origins of obstruction and permeability, grasped the source of creation and transformation, forgot form to nourish qi, forgot qi to nourish spirit, forgot spirit to nourish the Void. When the Void and the full interpenetrate, this is called the Great Harmony.\n\nThus, when stored, it is the primordial essence; when employed, it is the ten thousand numina; when contained, it is the Great One; when released, it is the Great Clarity. Hence, Kan and Li wax and wane within the body, wind and clouds issue forth from the seven orifices. True qi steams and rises, and the seasons know no cold or heat; pure yang flows and circulates, and the people know no death or life—this is the Way of spiritual transformation.\n\n**Snake and Sparrow**\nThe snake transforms into a tortoise, the sparrow into a clam. The one suddenly forgets its coiled form and gains a plodding substance; the other abruptly loses its flying and singing demeanor and acquires a shelled body. Carving and cutting cannot enhance its work, compass and square cannot define its form—how swift is this transformation!\n\nMoreover, when a lump hangs in empty space, one sees the lump but not the space; when one grinds the lump to seek the space, one sees the space but not the lump. Form poses no obstacle, yet people create obstacles for themselves; things offer no hindrance, yet people hinder themselves—how lamentable!\n\n**Old Maple**\nThe old maple transforms into a feathered immortal, the rotting wheat into a butterfly—from the inanimate to the animate. The virtuous maiden transforms into steadfast stone, the mountain earthworm into a lily—from the animate to the inanimate. Thus, earth, wood, metal, and stone all possess sentience, essence, and spirit.\n\nThe Void reaches everywhere, spirit penetrates all, qi is never disparate, form knows no bounds. What is \"that,\" and what is \"this\"? What has awareness, and what lacks it? The ten thousand things are one thing; the ten thousand spirits are one spirit—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\n\n**Eyes and Ears**\nWhat the eye cannot see, set up a bright mirror to see; what the ear cannot hear, set up an empty vessel to hear. Though the spirit resides in me, seeing and hearing depend on that. Feet can be severed, lips can be patched—thus, ears and eyes can be falsely arranged, and appearances can be deceptively placed. Layered upon layer, delusion upon delusion.\n\nThus do I know that souls and specters bewitch me, blood and qi intoxicate me, the seven orifices imprison me, the five senses enslave me. Only when spirit takes form does form develop excrescences. If there were no excrescences, what could not be achieved?\n\n**Circular Dance**\nThose who perform the circular dance find halls and chambers all spinning; those who gaze at swirling currents find their heads and eyes revolving. It is not that the halls and chambers are illusory, but that people delude themselves; it is not that the swirling currents change, but that people transform themselves.\n\nThus, powdered kerchief becomes a rabbit, medicinal stone becomes a horse—and people do not doubt; sweet words and artful smiles, painted faces and penciled brows—and people do not know. Only the pure and tranquil cannot be deceived.\n\n**Lead and Cinnabar**\nThere are arts of firing and refining lead and cinnabar to replace grain as food—this must be so. Yet in years of plenty, one may be sated; in lean years, one may hunger. This is not the grace of cinnabar, but rather the sincerity of the person. Thus, I am not inherently hungry, yet I hunger myself; cinnabar is not inherently sating, yet I sate myself. Hunger is a great delusion; satiety, a great illusion—this is because their Ways are not unified.\n\nTherefore, if one can unify being and non-being, death and life, emotion and nature, inner and outer, then one can shed the five phases, cast off the three luminaries. Why fear eating a hundred meals in a day, or worry about eating but one meal in a hundred days?\n\n**Form and Shadow**\nUse one mirror to reflect the form, and other mirrors to reflect the shadow.\n\nMirror reflects mirror, shadow transmits shadow—unchanged remain the crown and sword’s form, undiminished the embroidered robes’ hues. Thus is the form no different from the shadow, the shadow no other than the form. Then we know: the form is not truly real, the shadow not truly void; neither real nor void, they may join the Dao.\n\n**Concealment**\nAmong things, some excel in concealment: some ward off bitter cold, some banish ravenous hunger, some live ten thousand years without dying. Their hearts rest in profound obscurity, knowing nothing; their spirits delight in boundless ease, going nowhere; their qi flows gently, doing nothing. Ten thousand cares cannot confuse them; even death cannot be sought. Thus the great person embodies things to know the self, embodies the self to know the spirit, embodies the spirit to know the true—this is called the ford of the auspicious one.\n\n**Owl and Fowl**\nThe owl sees clearly by night but is blind by day; the fowl sees clearly by day but is blind by night—such is their difference and sameness. If one calls the owl strange, then the fowl is ordinary; if one calls the fowl strange, then the owl is ordinary. Which is it: does the owl and fowl differ in day and night? Or do day and night differ in owl and fowl? Which is it: do day and night share sameness with owl and fowl? Or do owl and fowl share sameness with day and night? The chime in the ear—I hear it myself; the flower in the eye—I see it myself. My day and night are their day and night, so that day cannot be called bright, nor night called dark. Only the great person can equalize darkness and light!\n\n**Four Mirrors**\nThe petty person always has four mirrors: one called *bi*, one called *zhu*, one called *di*, and one called *yu*. The *bi* makes one appear large, the *zhu* makes one appear small, the *di* makes one appear upright, the *yu* makes one appear inverted. Observing those vessels, examining one’s own form, one thus knows no great or small, no long or short, no beauty or ugliness, no good or evil. This is how form and qi flatter me, essence and spirit betray me, treacherous ministers honor me, rites and music exalt me. Therefore, the heart cannot be their lord, the king cannot be their master. Guard against them as against fire, defend against them as against tigers. Purity and frugality must not be assumed lightly; clarity and stillness must not be slighted. Only then can one’s bearing expand and ascend to the Three and Five.\n\n**Shooting the Tiger**\nTo shoot what resembles a tiger: one sees the tiger but not the stone.\n\nTo slay the fierce flood-dragon: one sees the dragon but not the water.\nThus one knows that the myriad things may be voided, and one’s own body may be made nothing.\nWith my nothingness, I unite with their void.\nNaturally, one may then conceal or reveal, die or live, without constraint.\nDust in the void flies like snow, yet the eye never sees it;\nants in a burrow battle like oxen, yet the ear never hears it—\nhow much less what lies beyond seeing and hearing!\n\n**Dragon and Tiger**\nThe dragon transforms, the tiger changes:\none may tread the empty void, yet the void is not nothing;\none may pierce metal and stone, yet metal and stone are not solid.\nBeing and non-being interflow, self and things become one.\nIts birth is no beginning, its death no end.\nHe who knows this Dao cannot be slain in form, nor can his spirit depart.\n\n**Wandering Clouds**\nWandering clouds have no substance, so the five colors lodge in them;\na flawless mirror has no blemish, so the myriad things are reflected in it.\nTo say that water contains the sky is necessarily to say that the sky contains water.\nFrom a hundred paces away, a mirror sees a man, yet the man does not see his reflection—\nthis is proof.\nThus one knows that within the Great Void there is nothing not present,\nand within the ten thousand radiances there is nothing not seen.\nYet世人 perceive only the mind gazing into the vastness,\nnot the traces dwelling in emptiness.\nThe vastness admits no gaps, and the numinous is not far.\nTherefore, the noble person constantly rectifies his heart and maintains a solemn bearing.\nOnly then may he swim in the vastness, befriend the numinous, and incur no blame.\n\n**Retching**\nWhen words describe putrid and foul states, one immediately retches;\n\nAt the mere mention of delicacies, one vainly swallows.\nPutrid and foul are clearly void, while delicacies are surely nonexistent—\nyet retching cannot cease, nor can swallowing be stilled.\nSome dread bean paste as if it were grubs,\nwhile others cherish salted fish as if it were phoenix fat.\nOne who understands this principle may equalize extravagance and frugality,\ntranscend honor and disgrace, discard right and wrong, and forget fortune and misfortune.\n\nThe Great Transformation:\nemptiness transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi,\nqi transforms into form, form transforms into essence,\nessence transforms into glances, glances transform into bows,\nbows transform into ascent and descent, ascent and descent transform into hierarchy,\nhierarchy transforms into distinctions, distinctions transform into caps and crowns,\ncaps and crowns transform into carriages, carriages transform into palaces,\npalaces transform into attendants, attendants transform into feasts,\nfeasts transform into excess, excess transforms into hoarding,\nhoarding transforms into deceit, deceit transforms into punishment,\npunishment transforms into rebellion, rebellion transforms into weapons,\nweapons transform into strife, strife transforms into ruin.\nIts coming is a force unstoppable; its going, a power unremovable.\nThus the great person swims in it through Dao and virtue,\nhunts in it through benevolence and righteousness,\nand encompasses it through punishments and rites—\nall to preserve their state and safeguard their wealth and nobility.\n\nThus, where Dao and virtue prove unrealized, where benevolence and righteousness fail to reach, where punishments and rites fall short—this teaches the people to be cunning and deceitful, drives them toward licentiousness and depravity, transforms them into rebels, and goads them into banditry. Above, the ruler remains dazed, unaware of the decay; below, the people drift in confusion, oblivious to their affliction. How then can they be saved?\n\n**The Orthodox Unity**\nAll know that purslane can split a turtle’s shell, yet none know that the vermilion herb can split a man. By this, the petty man learns that the numinous may be divided, that qi may be dissolved, that form may be dispersed. Dispersed into the myriad, it is not called excess; gathered into one, it is not called deficiency. Like a gale scattering hair, like souls and spirits fleeing in dreams, like a sandal’s tooth severing an earthworm—head and tail both stir. Why? The Great Void is but one void; the Great Spirit, but one spirit; the Great Qi, but one qi; the Great Form, but one form. Name them as four, yet root them as one. Hold fast to it and you lose it; relinquish it and you do not. This is called the Orthodox Unity.\n\n**Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven and earth steal from the Great Void to live; man and insects steal from heaven and earth to live; *yingding* steal from man and insects to live. *Yingding*—the worms in the intestines—seize my essence and qi, melt my soul and spirit, plunder my nourishment, and claim life for themselves. By this, I see that I must die, and thus know that heaven must collapse. If heaven collapses, where shall I abide? If I die, where shall the *yingding* dwell? This is like treacherous ministers stealing the state: when the state falls, the house perishes. Like borers gnawing wood: when the wood is consumed, the worms die. Therefore, the great person gathers essence and qi, conceals soul and spirit, moderates nourishment, restrains desires, and rejects wealth and nobility. Though heaven and earth age, I do not fall; though *yingding* die, I attain long life; though treacherous ministers depart, the state knows great peace.\n\n**The Child**\nThe child plays with its shadow, unaware it is the shadow playing with the child; the madman mocks the statue, unaware it is the statue mocking the madman. Those who transform the household do not know they are transformed by the household; those who transform the state do not know they are transformed by the state; those who transform the world do not know they are transformed by the world. The Three Sovereigns were possessors of the Dao, yet did not know their Dao transformed into the virtue of the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors were possessors of virtue, yet did not know their virtue transformed into the benevolence and righteousness of the Three Kings. The Three Kings were possessors of benevolence and righteousness, yet did not know their benevolence and righteousness transformed into the wars of Qin and Han. The drunkard clings to his drunkenness, the scabbed treats his scabs—the more they persist, the more they stumble; the more they struggle, the more severe their affliction—yet none turn back.\n\n**The Burning Mirror**\nThe burning mirror summons fire, the *fangzhu* vessel summons water—the way of resonance and arousal lies not far off.\n\nThe lofty gaze is forceful, the lowered gaze is predatory;\nThe sidelong glance is cunning, the level gaze is benevolent;\nThe wide-eyed stare is wrathful, the narrowed gaze is sycophantic;\nThe distant gaze is wise, the near gaze is clumsy;\nThe outward gaze is dull, the inward gaze is luminous.\nThus, that which bears me is the body, that which employs me is the spirit; employing the spirit to unite with the real can ensure enduring existence.\n\n**Life and Death**\nVacuity transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into blood, blood transforms into form, form transforms into infancy, infancy into childhood, childhood into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death.\nDeath reverts to vacuity, vacuity reverts to spirit, spirit reverts to qi, qi reverts to things.\nTransformation upon transformation knows no interruption, like a cycle without end.\nAll things do not desire life, yet cannot but live; all things do not desire death, yet cannot but die.\nThose who grasp this principle remain empty and nurture it—then the spirit need not transform, and form need not arise.\n\n**Nails and Hair**\nNails and hair are part of my form.\nWhy can nails be cut without harm, hair severed without pain?\nBecause they lie beyond the reach of *rong* and *wei*.\nThus, what is inherently harmless is made harmful by sinews and bones, what is inherently painless is made painful by blood and flesh.\nFrom this we know: joy and anger are not of my making, sorrow and delight are not of my stirring.\nI am obscured by form, and form is cherished by me.\nThose who grasp this principle can transcend birth and death.\n\n**The Way of Spirit**\nThe supreme is the spirit of vacuity and nothingness;\nHeaven and Earth are the spirit of yin and yang;\nHumans and creatures are the spirit of blood and flesh.\nWhat they share is spirit; what differs is form.\nThus, form is not numinous, but qi is numinous;\nSpeech is not numinous, but sound is numinous;\nWaking is not numinous, but dreams are numinous;\nLife is not numinous, but death is numinous.\nWater is utterly clear, yet when it freezes it is no longer clear;\nSpirit is utterly luminous, yet when it congeals into form it is no longer luminous.\nWhen ice melts, clarity returns; when form scatters, luminosity returns.\nThose who know true death can wander the capital of the Supreme.\n\n**Spiritual Union**\nThe way of the female and male: when tortoises face one another, it is a union of spirit; when cranes call to one another, it is a union of qi.\nFor it arises from the mutual touch of love and affection, whereby spirit and qi may unite.\nThus, the great person expands the Way to harmonize with Heaven and Earth, broadens the heart to accord with the utmost real, fuses qi to give life to the myriad things, and harmonizes spirit to connect with the multitudes.\nMy heart is joyful, and the people’s hearts are at ease.\nHearts at ease—yet unaware of what they ponder; forms in reverie—yet unaware of what they do.\nLike the harmony of a single qi, like the blending of a single spirit, like the sorrow or joy of a single sound, like the adversity or prosperity of a single form.\nWhat need is there for banners and flags? What need for gongs and drums? What need for rewards and punishments? What need for ranks and formations?\nWith this, one can command the armies of the world and extinguish the enemies of the world.\nThis is called the Way of spiritual union.\n\n**The Great Embrace**\nVacuity transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into form—form and qi interact to produce sound.\nThe ear does not listen to sound, yet sound comes of itself;\nThe valley does not echo, yet the echo fills it of itself.\nThe ear is a small aperture; the valley is a great aperture.\nMountains and marshes are small valleys; Heaven and Earth are a great valley.\nWhen one aperture sounds, all apertures sound; when one valley resounds, all valleys resound.\nSound guides qi, qi guides spirit, spirit guides vacuity;\nVacuity embraces spirit, spirit embraces qi, qi embraces sound.\nSound, qi, and form—each guides and embraces the other.\nEven the faint hum of autumn mosquitoes or the buzzing of flies reaches everywhere without exception.\nFrom this we know: even the subtlest thought is surely perceived; even the faintest whisper is surely heard.\nOnly the mechanism of the great person—Heaven and Earth cannot see it, yin and yang cannot know it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause it is the work of the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness.\n\n**Book Two: Arts and Transformations**\n\n**Cloud-Dragon**\nCloud-dragon and wind-tiger embody the Dao of spirit and qi. Spirit arises from the mother, qi from the child. To summon qi with spirit is to summon the child with the mother—who would dare not come? To dispel filth, one must invoke the qi of the Five Emperors; if the summons fails, how can filth be cleansed? To subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars; if the command fails, how can vipers be subdued? From this, the petty person knows that yin and yang may be set in motion, wind and clouds may be gathered, mountains and hills may be uprooted, rivers and seas may be overturned. Yet to summon from without is not as sure as to guard within, and only then deploy without—then nothing is impossible.\n\n**Fierce Tiger**\nWhen the fierce tiger strides, grasses and trees lie flat; when the venomous shrike rages, earth and stone are overturned. Where its might blazes, where its qi strikes, even the stubborn and perverse are moved to action. From this, the petty person knows that swords may be made to fly, mountains and rivers may be shifted, and the myriad things may be made to follow. When spirit is whole, might is great; when essence is whole, qi is mighty. A thousand delusions cannot drown it, and the myriad things may be made to serve. Thus, one man may oppose ten thousand not by skill with bow or blade, but by the utmost of might; one man may please ten thousand not by gifts of speech or laughter, but by the utmost of harmony.\n\n**Using Spirit**\nSome creatures lack feet: the snake coils and bends, the leech contracts and folds, the snail retracts and withdraws. The petty person perceives their mechanism, learns from their example, and may thus sit and reach a thousand miles without haste. Therefore, those who walk with feet cannot reach all places, those who fly with wings cannot arrive everywhere, those who see with eyes cannot perceive all things, those who hear with ears cannot catch every sound. Why is this? The former know form but not spirit; the latter know spirit but not form. To employ spirit through form is to perish; to employ form through spirit is to thrive.\n\n**Water Channel**\nA water channel may drown one below, a pestle’s chaff may cure choking. These things were first fashioned by man, then turned to man’s use. Methods have no origin, arts no fixed form; the master finds them in the heart, grasps them in the image. Yang is subdued by yin, man is controlled by woman, the hard is overcome by the soft, the wise are outwitted by the foolish. Employed thus, drums and bells may be silenced, chariot hubs may be made to clash, wives and children may be made to change, rulers and ministers may be made to part or unite. The myriad things are fundamentally empty, the myriad methods fundamentally nonexistent. He who grasps the aperture of emptiness knows the essence of arts and methods!\n\n**Wangliang Spirits**\nWangliang spirits attach themselves to shamans and oracles, speaking of fortune and misfortune. When they come, food, drink, and speech all become divine; when they depart, food, drink, and speech all return to human. One does not know whether the wangliang attach to the shaman or the shaman to the wangliang. From this, the petty person knows that hearts may be exchanged, qi may be altered, spirit may be seized, and souls may be captured. Form is the palace of spirit, spirit the countenance of form. Judged thus, what is impossible?\n\nThe spirit of emptiness and nothingness can command ghosts, the transformations of dragons can be employed, vipers and adders can be made unable to sting, and halberds and spears can be made unable to strike. Only the heartless cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by blades, or killed by Heaven’s decree. Why is this so? One whose will is set on joy forgets hunger; one whose will is set on sorrow forgets pain; one whose will is set on emptiness and nothingness can forget life and death.\n\n**Vacuity and Substance**\nA block of wood a foot square, when placed upon the ground, leaves ample room for a man to tread upon it. The same block, when placed at the tip of a pole, leaves no room for a man to stand upon it. It is not that the object itself has grown larger or smaller—rather, the heart has become vacuous or substantial. Thus, one who frets in the scorching heat feels it all the more, and one who dreads the cauterizing iron feels the pain all the more. The human heart has no fixed nature, and things have no fixed properties. From this, the petty person knows that water can be made not to wet, and fire can be made not to scorch.\n\n**Fox Spirits**\nThe illusions of fox spirits and the enchantments of sparrows and rats cannot deceive the reflection of a bright mirror, for the bright mirror is without heart. Thus, the empty void, being without heart, knows all things; the vast heavens, being without heart, allow the ten thousand images to gallop freely. A general without form leaves his enemy no opening to deceive him; the great man without cares draws primordial essence to himself. One who takes emptiness as their master can go anywhere without hindrance.\n\n**Turning the Boat**\nTo turn a boat of ten thousand *hu*, one relies on a single *xun* of wood; to loose a crossbow of a thousand *jun*, one relies on a single inch of the trigger. A single glance can take in the vastness of Heaven; a single person can rule over millions of people. The great void, though boundless, has its limits; the supreme ultimate, though vast, has its form. Grasp the warp of Heaven and Earth, know the chambers of yin and yang, perceive the storehouse of spirit and essence—then numbers can be altered, fate can be revived, and Heaven and Earth can be overturned.\n\n**The Heart’s Transformations**\nThe most debauched may transform into a woman; the most violent may transform into a fierce tiger. What the heart transforms into, it cannot but become. Thus, the joyful assume a harmonious form, the delighted assume a carefree form, the angry assume a rigid form, and the sorrowful assume a mournful form. This, too, is the Dao of transformation. From this, the petty person knows that this six-foot frame can become dragon or snake, gold or stone, grass or tree. How great are these words!\n\n**Pearls and Jade**\n\nGrief brings forth tears like rain; bitterness brings forth mucus like rain. Rage knots into goiters; fury knots into ulcers. What the heart desires, what qi belongs to—nothing fails to gestate. If the perverse acts thus, the upright must act otherwise. Thus the great person tempers grief and bitterness, guards against rage and fury; finding the gate of vast qi, they gather its root; knowing the vessel of primordial spirit, they sheathe its radiance. Like the clam’s inner guard, like the stone’s inner concealment—this is how the chamber of pearls and jade is made.\n\n**The Potter Wasp**\nThe potter wasp nurtures the grub of the green caterpillar, transmitting its essence, exchanging its essence, blending its qi, harmonizing its spirit. Adapting to the creature’s size, all attain their true nature. The dull and moving have no fixed disposition; the myriad things have no fixed form. From this, the petty person knows that horses may be made to fly, fish may be made to gallop, clay and wooden figures may be made sentient, and infants may resemble their wet nurses—this Dao is not far off.\n\n**The Hu Husband**\nThe Hu husband and Yue wife bear a child with a bearded face and stunted feet.\n\nThe Man husband and Qiang wife bear a child with a crooked nose and upturned head.\n\nWhen a pear is grafted onto a peach, if the rootstock is strong, its fruit becomes fuzzy. When a plum is grafted onto an apricot, if the rootstock is strong, its fruit becomes sweet.\n\nWith yin conceiving yang, with softness conceiving hardness, with the crooked conceiving the straight, with the short conceiving the long, with the large conceiving the small, with the round conceiving the square, with water conceiving fire, with cinnabar conceiving yellow—the petty person knows thereby that gold and stone may be wrought, pearls and jade may be formed, strange kinds may arise, and monstrous shapes may appear. Such is the Dao of creation and transformation.\n\n**Yin and Yang**\nWhen yin and yang contend, mushrooms and fungi grow without root. When dryness and dampness nurture each other, grubs and beetles emerge without mother. Thus, when the people of the world embody yin and yang as their root and emulate dryness and dampness as their nurturers, nothing fails to thrive. The petty person knows thereby that refining the Five Phases is the Dao of fire, that ceaseless flow is the Dao of water, that the revolving of the Eight Trigrams is the Dao of heaven and earth, and that numinous things arise—such is the Dao of transformation. Therefore, the noble person embodies things to know the self and embodies the self to know the Dao. The Dao of the great person is profound and subtle, so none can discern what is right or wrong.\n\n**Sea Fish**\nThere are sea fish that use shrimp as eyes, and people laugh at them. Yet they do not know that the ancients used bags of fireflies as lamps, nor do they realize that by day, without the sun’s light, one cannot gallop, and by night, without the candle’s brightness, one is deceived. They observe the falseness of puppets yet do not doubt themselves; they lament the passing of wise friends yet do not grieve for themselves. The worthy rise and the foolish sink, none knowing why—only those who embrace pure whiteness and nurture the Great Mystery avoid falling into its mechanism.\n\n**Gorge Pines**\nGorge pines endure frost because they conceal upright qi. Beautiful jade withstands fire because it stores perfect essence. Thus, the great person by day moves the banner of spirit and by night records the numinous fungus (Song and Yuan editions: by day moves the vitality of life, by night records spirits and ghosts), awakening what is unawakened and contemplating what is unthought. They can wear wind in winter without cold and face fire in summer without heat. Therefore, the noble person who conceals upright qi can distance ghosts and gods and subdue treacherous flatterers; one who stores perfect essence can bless living spirits and preserve wealth and longevity. What is the reason? It lies in the matter of abundance and scarcity.\n\n**Movement and Stillness**\n\nMovement and stillness grind against each other, thus transforming into fire;\nDryness and dampness steam against each other, thus transforming into water;\nWater and fire contend, thus transforming into clouds;\nBoiling water poured into a well transforms into hail;\nDrinking water beneath the rain on a sunny day transforms into rainbows.\nFrom this, the petty person knows that yin and yang can be summoned,\nThe Five Phases can be commanded,\nHeaven and earth can be reconstructed,\nAnd the sun and moon can be made to act at my will.\nThose who hear these words will surely deem them absurd.\nYet consider the form of man:\nThe head is round, the feet are square,\nAbove moves, below is still,\nThe Five Phases revolve within,\nThe two luminaries shine without—\nThis, too, is the Way of reconstruction.\n\n**Sound and Qi**\n\nPlucking the zither’s notes brings a light and leisurely ease;\nPlaying the melodies of Deng and Wei induces joyful abandon;\nThe shattering of tiles and bricks sends shivers down the spine;\nThe beating of war drums and battle drums makes even goose feathers hesitate—\nSuch is the power of stirring resonance.\nThrough harmony, one summons yang qi,\nTransforms it into gentle winds,\nAnd gives life to the myriad things.\nThrough disharmony, one generates yin qi,\nTransforms it into harsh winds,\nAnd humiliates the myriad things.\nQi arises from sound, and sound arises from qi.\nWhen qi moves, sound is emitted;\nWhen sound is emitted, qi is stirred;\nWhen qi is stirred, winds arise and the myriad things transform.\nThus, wind and clouds can be commanded,\nFrost and hail can be summoned,\nPhoenixes can be made to sing,\nBears and brown bears to dance,\nAnd the numinous spirits to befriend—\nThe art of music holds such great power.\n\n**Great Unity**\n\nEmptiness contains emptiness,\nSpirit contains spirit,\nQi contains qi,\nLight contains light,\nThings contain things.\nThose who grasp this principle can commune in feeling,\nAnd unite in form.\nOne who unites with fire becomes fire,\nOne who unites with water becomes water,\nOne who unites with the sun and moon becomes the sun and moon,\nOne who unites with metal and stone becomes metal and stone.\nOnly the great person is without fixed union,\nYet transforms without limit,\nSufficient to ride alongside the August Void.\n\n**Teacher of Emperors**\n\nThe mirror does not seek to reflect things, yet things present themselves to it;\nThe bellows does not seek to be filled with qi, yet qi naturally fills it.\nThus, the nose receives scents through emptiness,\nThe ear receives sounds through emptiness,\nThe eye receives colors through emptiness,\nThe tongue receives flavors through emptiness.\nWhen the mind unites with the obscure and dark, nothing is not received;\nWhen spirit unites with emptiness and nothingness, nothing is unknown.\n\nThus the great person seizes the pivotal moment, conceals the subtle, and commands the most wondrous talismanic transformations—profound and marvelous are the yin essences—sufficient to guard a nation, to rescue an age, to sit as teacher to emperors and kings.\n\n**Amber**\n\nAmber cannot summon decaying mustard seeds,\nCinnabar cannot enter scorched metal,\nLodestone cannot attract weary iron,\nPrimordial qi cannot ignite a sealed kiln.\nThus the great person excels in wielding the essence of the Five Phases,\nExcels in seizing the numinous spirit of the myriad things,\nFeeds on the emoluments of heaven and humanity,\nRides the glory of wind and horses.\nTheir Way lies in forgetting form to seek true nature.\n\n**Scroll Three: The Transformations of Virtue**\n\n**The Five Constants**\n\nThe Confucians expound the Way of the Five Constants,\nDividing them into five affairs,\nAttributing them to the Five Phases,\nDispersing them into five colors,\nTransforming them into five tones,\nBowing to them as the Five Peaks,\nGazing upon them as the Five Stars,\nRefining them into the Five Metals,\nAssembling them as the Five Numinous Creatures,\nPairing them with the Five Flavors,\nStirring them into the Five Emotions.\nThus those who listen are like vinegar flies wandering the Great Void,\nLike well frogs afloat on the vast ocean,\nNever glimpsing the boundless expanse of the primordial chaos,\nNever fathoming the immeasurable course of its vastness.\nAs dusk falls and the road stretches far, all proceed in reverse—\nYet none realize that the Way of the Five Constants is one.\nForget their names, and you grasp their principles;\nForget their principles, and you grasp their true nature.\nThen govern them with clarity and stillness,\nSettle them in the profound and obscure,\nSo that they merge with my spirit and qi,\nHarmonize with my heart and numen.\nLike water poured into water, its clarity undivided;\nLike fire cast into fire, its brightness unbroken.\n\nThis is called seizing the essence of the Five Phases, stealing the quintessence of the Five Constants—gathered, a mustard seed may contain it; scattered, the myriad mechanisms flourish as one. In its application, it is like pouring sweet wine into vessels; in its response to things, it is like a hanging mirror reflecting forms. Thus it transforms into the myriad images, transmutes into the myriad beings, penetrates the Yin and Yang, and empties into the numinous brightness. Therefore, it wields the strategies of emperors and kings, supplants the scales of Heaven and Earth—such was Confucius.\n\nYet the world’s wise and foolish, like moths drawn to a night candle or flies striking the dawn window, swarm ceaselessly. They know how to advance but not to retreat, how to proceed but not to return. They only know to avoid harm and seek profit, never realizing that amassing profit invites harm. To be wise toward others but not toward oneself—what wisdom is this? To be learned in things but not in oneself—what learning is this? Thus the great person forgets both profit and harm—where then is there not goodness?\n\n**Divergent Hearts**\nThe tiger crouches in the forest, the serpent glides through the marsh—not the owl’s or kite’s enemy. Yet the owl and kite cry out against them, for they harbor divergent hearts. The ox grazes in the field, the pig slumbers in the garden—not the crows’ or magpies’ foe. Yet the crows and magpies alight upon them, for they hold no divergent hearts. Thus the qilin’s sharp horns keep the beasts from submitting; the phoenix’s keen beak keeps the birds from attending; the ruler’s extraordinary wisdom keeps the world from serving. The swiftest runner stumbles in the end; the fiercest fighter falls in defeat. Where there is fate, there is an end; where there is cunning, there is exhaustion. The clever are ruled by the unskilled; the deceitful are governed by the honest.\n\n**Bows and Arrows**\nThe Son of Heaven fashions bows and arrows to awe the world, yet the world steals bows and arrows to mock the Son of Heaven. The noble create rites and music to restrain the petty, yet the petty steal rites and music to usurp the noble. Those who hold states love to amass wealth, hoarding grain and silk, preparing armor and weapons to defend against bandits—yet bandits seize armor and weapons, commandeer grain and silk, and take their states. Some say, “Safety and peril lie in virtue.” Others say, “Rise and fall are a matter of fate.” If virtue could be relied upon, why stockpile grain and silk? If fate could be trusted, why prepare armor and weapons?\n\n**Cleverness**\nOne who is capable in all things has one great incapacity.\n\nOne who knows all things has one great unknowing. Only by forgetting the bow and arrow does one grasp the Dao of archery; only by forgetting the reins and bit does one grasp the Dao of charioteering; only by forgetting the strings and pipes does one grasp the Dao of music; only by forgetting cleverness and calculation does one grasp the Dao of the great person. Thus, the ruler of all under Heaven—his Dao and virtue arise from others; the ruler who governs a state—his benevolence and righteousness arise from others; the ruler who loses his state—his cleverness and discernment arise from others.\n\n**Rites of the State**\nThe rites of a state include offering sacrifices at the suburban altars and ancestral temples, revering ghosts and spirits; scrutinizing tortoise shells and milfoil stalks to divine good and ill fortune. Revering ghosts and spirits is the duty of trusting in misfortune and blessing; divining good and ill fortune is the duty of trusting in the fate of rise and fall. Yet how can one harbor such great distrust, exhausting the people’s strength to build walls and ramparts, seizing the people’s food to amass stores? This is to believe that blessing can be seized by force, that misfortune can be resisted by force; this is to waver in faith toward ghosts and spirits, to deceive and confuse the omens of tortoise and milfoil, to distrust the people of all under Heaven. Such a Dao—rewards cannot encourage, punishments cannot deter, and the state cannot be defended.\n\n**The Yellow Sparrow**\nThe yellow sparrow, as a creature, daily roams the courtyard, daily draws near to people yet constantly fears them, and people constantly disturb it. The swallow, as a creature, at times flies through the door, at times draws near to people yet does not fear them, and people do not disturb it. The one moves hurriedly, the other leisurely; the one chirps faintly, the other sings resoundingly; the one gazes restlessly, the other gazes serenely; the one’s heart is anxious, the other’s heart is magnanimous. Thus, one who suspects others is suspected by others; one who guards against others is guarded against by others. The Dao of the noble person—benevolence and righteousness, centrality and uprightness—what worry, what harm!\n\n**The Caged Ape**\nThe ape in the cage leaps and bounds in myriad transformations yet cannot escape the cage; the tiger in the box rages in myriad transformations yet cannot escape the box. The schemes of the petty person, the calculations in myriad transformations, cannot escape the Dao of the great person. The Dao of the great person is like the earth bearing all, like the heavens covering all. Though none cease resenting, though none cease deceiving, resentment does not enrage me, deceit does not level me—only then do the myriad things know where to return.\n\n**The Constant Dao**\nBenevolence and righteousness are the constant Dao of conduct, yet if one practices them without mastering their art, it leads to the ruin of the state. Loyalty and trustworthiness are the constant Dao of employment, yet if one employs them without mastering their art, it leads to incurring punishment. Integrity is the constant Dao of preservation, yet if one preserves it without mastering its art, it leads to oppressing the people. Wealth and eloquence are the constant Dao of governance, yet if one governs with them without mastering their art, it leads to encountering disaster. For clumsiness lies in using them on others, while skill lies in using them on oneself. If you cause the people to cherish farming, they resent it; if you warn them against frivolous consumption, they grow angry. Bait is what fish crave, and the scent of fat is what ants desire—yet cast bait to fish, and they surely grow wary; offer fat to ants, and they surely flee, for this is not the Dao of transformation.\n\n**Stirred by Joy**\nTo be moved by a father’s kindness is not filial piety;\n\nStirred by a lord’s favor is not loyalty. To feel begins in non-feeling, and joy begins in non-joy. Excessive feeling must bring excessive resentment; excessive joy must bring excessive anger. Feeling and joy reside in the heart, yet they arise from things that bear poison, from fire concealed in reeds—one cannot but be cautious. Thus the noble person’s vocation lies in this: rank holds no esteem, rites hold no grandeur, kin remain unrecognized, and strangers arouse no suspicion; even humiliation cannot take hold—how then could feeling or joy arise?\n\n**The Grand Physician**\nThe Way of the Grand Physician: when the pulse is harmonious and full, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of life; when it is agitated and floating, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of death. The Way of the Grand Diviner: when the stalks lie level and unhurried, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of fortune; when they curve and turn sharp, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of misfortune. Judging by this, the principle of all under Heaven is one. Thus, observe a state, and you know its ministers; observe its ministers, and you know its lord; observe its lord, and you know its rise and fall. Ministers may choose their lords to serve, and lords may choose their ministers to employ.\n\nBows and courtesies may be feigned, but restlessness and stillness cannot; robes and caps may be counterfeited, but form and vessel cannot; speech may be embellished, but voice cannot.\n\n**Slanderous Speech**\nWhat lies hidden in others is called a mechanism; what surprises others is called a stratagem. Yet the mechanism of virtue and power is known to all, while the stratagem of benevolence and righteousness is possessed by none. Thus, where rewards and punishments are taught, perverse ways advance; where distinctions of closeness and distance are made, petty persons enter. Cast gold in the marketplace, and thieves dare not take it; inquire of governance in the court, and slanderers dare not speak—this is the utmost impartiality of all under Heaven.\n\n**Carving and Painting**\nPainters dare not alter the likeness in an image; if they alter it, misfortune surely follows. Carvers dare not mock the original form of a figurine; if they mock it, calamity is surely left behind. First, the creation begins with me; then, reverence is demanded of me; finally, disaster is placed upon me. Thus, those who set traps die by traps; those who establish peril perish by peril; those who build merit are shamed by merit; those who establish laws are ensnared by laws.\n\nMove one aperture, and a hundred apertures respond; undertake one matter, and ten thousand matters suffer harm. Therefore, mechanisms prize clarity; peril prizes levelness; merit prizes formlessness; law prizes imagelessness. Those who can transcend carving and painting may be called masters of the Great Image.\n\n**Wine and Sweet Wine**\nWith wine and sweet wine, the more one is pressed to drink, the less one drinks; the more one is forgiven for drinking, the more one desires to drink. Thus, those who suppress others are suppressed by others; those who tolerate others are tolerated by others. Pardon a man’s death, and he delights in death; pardon his tribute, and he delights in tribute. Thus the people steal their lord’s virtue, and the lord steals the people’s strength. Those who understand the Way of reversal may hold the office of governing the multitudes.\n\n**Favor and Reward**\nA marquisate is what people esteem; gold is what people value. Yet when the multitude enfeoffs a duke and one obtains a marquisate, it is not deemed fine; when the multitude divides jade and one obtains gold, it is not deemed joyful. Thus rewards must not be recklessly bestowed, nor favor recklessly granted. When fitting, they become the beginning of contention; when unfitting, they become the foundation of chaos and ruin. Therefore, if I humble myself, rewards cannot be grand; if I practice frugality, favor cannot be extraordinary. Surveying the histories of chaos and ruin, all stem from arrogance and extravagance—this is how favor and reward operate.\n\n**Nurturing the People**\nThe people do not resent fire but resent those who forbid it; they do not resent theft but resent those who guard against it. Thus, aiding the people is not as good as not aiding them; loving the people is not as good as not loving them. Heaven has rain and dew to invite their resentment; spirits receive prayers and offerings to invite their slander. Therefore, forbidding the people’s fire is not as good as forbidding the fire in their hearts; guarding against others’ theft is not as good as guarding against one’s own theft—this is how the people are nurtured.\n\n**Book Four: The Transforming Power of Benevolence**\nAttaining Unity...\n\nThe Dao is called that which is vast and without action; the power to preserve itself is called virtue; virtue giving rise to the myriad things is called benevolence; benevolence rescuing from peril and securing safety is called righteousness; righteousness having departures and approaches is called propriety; propriety having adaptations and transformations is called wisdom; wisdom having sincerity and truthfulness is called trustworthiness; and their thorough mastery and application is called sageliness.\n\nThe Dao is emptiness and nothingness—without means to preserve itself, it is therefore endowed with virtue. Virtue is purity and quiescence—without means to apply itself, it is therefore endowed with benevolence. Benevolence in use gives rise to the myriad things; the myriad things arising must have safety and peril, so it is therefore endowed with righteousness. Righteousness aids the secure and rescues the imperiled; there must be judgments of good and ill, so it is therefore endowed with propriety. Propriety upholds rules and maintains standards; there must be doubts and obstructions, so it is therefore endowed with wisdom. Wisdom being unobstructed entails much change, so it is therefore endowed with trustworthiness—trustworthiness being that by which the myriad things are completed.\n\nThe Five Phases and the virtue of the Dao are Heaven and Earth. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. Benevolence is called that which engenders life, thus it presides over Wood. Righteousness is called that which rescues from difficulty, thus it presides over Metal. Propriety is called that which clarifies, thus it presides over Fire. Wisdom is called that which adapts and transforms, thus it presides over Water. Trustworthiness is called that which is steadfast, thus it presides over Earth.\n\nWhen benevolence is insufficient, righteousness aids it—Metal fells Wood. When righteousness is insufficient, propriety aids it—Fire melts Metal. When propriety is insufficient, wisdom aids it—Water extinguishes Fire. When wisdom is insufficient, trustworthiness aids it—Earth dams Water. In the beginning, the Five Constants mutually aid one another; in the end, the Five Constants mutually overcome one another—such is the course of the great transformation.\n\n**Hunting and Fishing**\nWhat difference is there between birds and beasts and humans? They have dwellings in nests and dens, mates in pairs, the nature of parent and child, and the feelings of life and death. The crow returns to feed its parent—this is benevolence. The falcon pities its unhatched young—this is righteousness. The bee has a sovereign—this is propriety. The lamb kneels to suckle—this is wisdom. The pheasant does not mate twice—this is trustworthiness. Who has fully explored their Way? Among the myriad things, the Five Constants and a hundred practices are all present, yet teaching sets nets and snares as the guiding principle, compelling them to devote themselves to hunting and fishing.\n\nMoreover, burning their nests and dens is not benevolence; seizing their beloved kin is not righteousness; making this the offering is not propriety; teaching the people cruelty is not wisdom; causing the myriad things to harbor doubt is not trustworthiness. The desire for rank odors does not cease; the mechanism of killing and harm does not end. Though feathers and fur cannot speak, they must depict us as ravenous wolves and giant boars; though scales and shells lack awareness, they must name us as great whales and monstrous serpents. How can one be at ease—how can one not feel shame? Alas! One might well suspect that since ancient times there have been no true noble persons.\n\n**Sacrificial Offerings**\nThe offering of sacrificial animals, the presentation of lambs and wild geese—these were the rites of antiquity. Moreover, the noble persons of old were not unaware that the sorrows and joys of emotions, the grief and delight of sounds, could move Heaven and Earth and stir ghosts and spirits. With the knife and block set before them, the sorrows and joys of their emotions could be known; with hawks and hounds arrayed, the grief and delight of their sounds could be known. To use such things in sacrifice to Heaven and Earth, to use them in prayer to the divine luminaries—Heaven and Earth would surely not accept them, and if they did, calamity would follow; the divine luminaries would surely not delight in them, and if they did, regret would follow.\n\nThus we know that when the divine dragon appears, it portends the loss of the signs of wind and cloud; when the phoenix comes, it portends the loss of the symbols of honor and esteem; when the qilin emerges, it portends the demise of the state and its lands. Judging by our righteousness, the birds and beasts must deem us unrighteous; taking them as auspicious, the birds and beasts must deem them inauspicious.\n\n**Great Harmony**\nIt is not the hare that is cunning—it is the hunter who is cunning. It is not the people who are deceitful—it is the officials who are deceitful. Take care not to resent thieves and bandits, for thieves and bandits are only summoned by us; take care not to resent rebellion and disorder, for rebellion and disorder are only taught by us. Without harmony and concord, how could there be enmity and strife? Without rewards and encouragements, how could there be struggle and contention?\n\nThus the great person is without closeness or distance, without love or aversion—this is called *Great Harmony*.\n\n**Inkfish**\nAmong sea fish, there are those that spew ink to shield their bodies as they swim, yet men catch them by means of that very ink. The wise are often thwarted, the eloquent often humiliated, the perceptive often blinded, the brave often slain. When bolts and locks are secure, thieves and bandits rejoice; when taboos are strict, enemy states delight. Prohibitions that can be transgressed are but empty proclamations; weapons that can be seized are but tokens. Shu was undone by mountains, Jin by horses.\n\nThe mechanism of the great person lies in nothing more than Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness.\n\n**Spirit Bow**\nThose who praise others will be praised in turn; those who slander others will be slandered. Thus the noble person, by blaming themselves, blames others; by not repaying resentment, they repay it. This is what is meant by the *spirit bow* and *ghost arrows*—they loose without drawing, strike without aiming. Heaven obtains them to lend to men; men obtain them to lend to the world.\n\n**Saving Things**\nThose who save things and call it righteousness are deemed unrighteous by others; those who bestow favors seeking repayment are not repaid. Such is the nature of the people: yield to them, and they multiply; contend with them, and they diminish. Approach them, and they flee; avoid them, and they come. Give freely, and they treat it lightly; withhold, and they seize it. Thus great righteousness has no form, great kindness no image. When great righteousness is achieved, even the unaware bear it; when great kindness is realized, even the unknowing repay it.\n\n**The Way of Writing**\nWhen the mind does not doubt the hand, and the hand does not doubt the brush—when hand and brush are forgotten—only then does one know the Way of writing. Harmony and fluency are not craft; simplicity and antiquity are not artlessness.\n\nGentleness is not beauty;\nstrength and aggression are not courage.\nWhere the spirit bathes,\nwhere qi is cleansed—\nthus do dots and strokes harbor blood and qi,\nglances and gazes contain nature and temperament.\nNo trace of ink’s darkness,\nno semblance of cunning or wit;\nno appearance of hardness or softness,\nno image of galloping or racing.\nLike the Dao of the August Emperor, radiant and harmonious,\nlike the demeanor of the noble man, solemn and serene.\nThus those who behold it find their hearts joyful,\ntheir spirits harmonious,\ntheir qi flowing,\ntheir governance at peace,\ntheir Way without seam.\nWhy is this so?\nSeeing mountains, one thinks of stillness;\nseeing water, one thinks of movement;\nseeing clouds, one thinks of change;\nseeing stone, one thinks of constancy—\nsuch is the nature of man.\n\n**Phoenix and Owl**\nThe phoenix knows not beauty,\nthe owl knows not ugliness.\nThe men of Taotang knew not sageliness,\nthe men of Youmiao knew not tyranny.\nHad the men of Taotang relied on their sageliness, they would not have been sagely;\nhad the men of Youmiao recognized their tyranny, they would not have been tyrannical.\n\n**The Multitude**\nAll can depict another’s form,\nyet none can depict their own;\nall can seek another’s faults,\nyet none can seek their own;\nall can know another’s misfortune,\nyet none can know their own.\nThus the great man listens to my voice,\nobserves my countenance,\nawaits my form,\nwatches my qi—\nonly then does he know the truth or falsity of others.\n\n**Knowing Others**\nObserve their writings, and you know their nobility or baseness;\nobserve their calligraphy, and you know their nature and temperament;\nhear their zither and lute, and you know their virtue and power;\nhear their decrees and commands, and you know their fortune or misfortune.\nBy this, the petty man knows:\nthe bearing of Tang Yao, pure and unadorned;\nthe bearing of Yu Shun, radiant and joyful;\nthe bearing of Lord Yu, magnanimous and unbounded;\nthe bearing of Shang Tang, majestic and dignified;\nthe bearing of King Wen, towering and awe-inspiring;\nthe bearing of King Wu, forthright and unyielding;\nthe bearing of Confucius, august and luminous.\nThus the people of the world may know their own foolishness or wisdom.\n\n**Ants**\nEven ants have their lord:\na fist-sized palace, shared with the multitude;\na clod-sized terrace, ascended with the crowd;\na single grain of food, stored with all;\na morsel of insect flesh, savored by all;\na single doubt of guilt, punished by all.\nThus when hearts connect, spirits connect;\nwhen spirits connect, qi connects;\nwhen qi connects, forms connect.\nTherefore, if I am ill, all are ill;\nif I am in pain, all are in pain.\nWhence could resentment arise?\nWhence could rebellion begin?\nSuch was the transformation of the great antiquity.\n\n**Song and Dance**\n\nThose who can sing, the unskilled listen;\nthose who can dance, the unskilled watch;\nthe skillful, the unskillful discern;\nthe worthy, the unworthy employ.\n\nHe who tends trees must fell them;\nhe who awaits scholars must bury them.\nAdorn them with crowns and robes,\nbait them with ranks and emoluments.\nLike horses harnessed to a chariot—\nthe honor is not theirs to claim;\nlike swine fed on husks and chaff—\nthe fatness is not theirs to keep.\n\nThus the great man does not vainly exalt the Dao,\nnor idly uphold virtue;\nthe poor have something to rely on,\nthe advancing have something to depend on.\nThose who withdraw do not delight in cold poverty,\nnor willingly cast themselves aside.\n\n**Hesitation**\nHesitation’s wine,\ncrow-pecked jerky,\nhenbane’s grease,\nmoonflower’s milk.\nFirst tasted, it seems mustard;\ntasted again, it seems millet;\ntasted once more, it seems a pellet;\ntasted yet again, it seems dried meat.\nThus the petty man learns that a mighty crossbow may be drawn by degrees,\na great cauldron may be lifted by degrees,\nfire and water may be gradually accustomed to,\ntigers and rhinos may be gradually befriended.\nThe rebellious are what I transform,\nthe humiliated are what I accompany,\nthe unresponsive are what I command,\nthe disobedient are what I take.\nThus I know that a restive horse cannot be driven,\nand a creeping thief cannot be warded off.\nThis is the mother of all transformations.\n\n**Quelling Strife**\nHe who would stop others’ fights incites their fighting;\nhe who would suppress others’ wrath stokes their wrath.\nHe who is skilled at halting strife anticipates strife;\nhe who is skilled at resolving anger abets anger.\nThus the heart cannot be subdued—\nto subdue it is to make it more chaotic;\nthe people cannot be governed—\nto govern them is to breed more resentment.\nWater stirs easily but clears itself;\nthe people change easily but settle themselves.\nThe Way lies in not opposing the nature of all things.\n\n**Symbolic Talismans**\nThere are arts to dispel the hidden poisons of the myriad things—\nthen interlock arms and crook fingers, shaping them into talismans.\nThus the talisman of the sinuous is scaled,\nthe talisman of the soaring is feathered,\nthe talisman of the recumbent is furred,\nthe talisman of the clenched is armored,\nand so one knows that the clasped hands are the talisman of man.\nHe who clasps his hands, others will clasp theirs;\nhe who bows at the waist, others will bow theirs—\nthis is the root of ritual.\nYet when dispersed, they become the ten thousand forms;\nwhen distinguished, they become the ten thousand postures.\n\nTo teach them the dance is not the dance itself.\n\nTo teach them prayer and incantation is not prayer and incantation itself.\nI am already meager in substance, while they are abundant in emptiness.\nTo demand sincerity from others is inherently insincere;\nto condemn ritual for its lack of efficacy is inherently inefficacious.\n\n**Good and Evil**\nThose who do evil fear being recognized—yet there are always those who recognize them;\nthose who do good desire to be known—yet there are always those who remain unaware.\nThus, those unrecognized by others are called great evil;\nthose unknown to others are called supreme good.\nHe who delights in bestowing favors does not spread kindness widely;\nhe who pursues the extraordinary does not achieve great merit;\nhe who excels at games of skill lacks far-reaching wisdom;\nhe whose words are ornate and flowery does not long endure in renown.\nTherefore, the noble person values only the Dao and guards only virtue,\nthus attaining undying legacy through the ages.\n\n**Book Five: The Transformation of Nourishment**\n**Seven Usurpations**\nTo go one day without food is to grow weary;\ntwo days without food is to fall ill;\nthree days without food is to die.\nNo human affair is more urgent than food,\nyet the ruler usurps one share,\nministers and officials another,\nsoldiers and clerks another,\nwar and conquest another,\ncraftsmen another,\nmerchants another,\nthe followers of Dao and Buddha another,\nyears of plenty another,\nand frugality another.\nThus, when silkworms have spun their last thread, one wears garments of hemp and ramie;\nwhen the harvest is complete, one eats the fruits of oak and chinquapin.\nThe ruler’s punishments and governance are unjust—this is the height of injustice;\nthe great man’s Way seeks to remedy wrongdoing—this is the height of wrongdoing.\nYet to practice earnest benevolence and employ anxious ritual—\nhow can these ever make amends?\n\n**Shamans and Idols**\nWhere there are shamans, spirits inevitably attach themselves;\nwhere idols are set up, gods inevitably take residence—\nfor they delight in what is offered.\nThe rites of the Rong and Jie peoples honor the mother but not the father;\nthe nature of birds and beasts follows the mother but not the father;\nin human suffering, one cries for the mother but not the father—\nall due to the nurture of nursing.\nTigers and wolves do not exceed their craving for meat,\ndragons and serpents do not exceed their craving for blood,\nyet humans crave everything.\nThus, when needs are unmet, they fight;\nwhen denied, they rebel,\nstirring the world’s resentment\nand provoking the fury of the valiant.\nThe Way of nourishment is no small matter.\n\n**Raising Horses**\nThe master raises the horse, but the groom tends to it closely;\nthe mother bears the child, but the wet nurse nurtures it intimately.\nLord and minister are not to be compared,\nyet they are equated by salary;\nmother and child are not to be loved equally,\nyet they are loved through nursing.\nA dull horse has no innate understanding,\nan infant has no innate cunning,\nyet understanding begins here,\nand cunning arises from this.\nThus, love and hatred emerge,\nthus, self and other take shape,\nthus, strife and deceit accumulate.\n\n**Silk and Cord**\nThe king takes the silk,\nthe official takes the cord;\nthe king takes the cord,\nthe official takes the tassel.\nTaking without end leads to deception;\ndeception without end leads to flogging;\nflogging without end leads to theft;\ntheft without end leads to murder;\nmurder without end leads to execution.\nDeception is not the people’s love—it is the teaching of those who amass and extort;\nmurder is not the people’s desire—it is the lesson of those who wield the lash.\nWhen fire presses close, one leaps into water,\nknowing escape is impossible—yet valuing the delay;\nwhen a tiger is about to strike, one throws oneself into a ravine,\nknowing survival is unlikely—yet hoping for life.\nTo draw such parallels is lamentable indeed!\n\n**Extravagance and Transgression**\nThe noble person refuses to tell others of his hunger—\nsuch shame is profound.\nHe also refuses to boast of his fullness—\nsuch humiliation is deep.\nHaving aroused another’s shame and humiliation,\nhe inevitably provokes their resentment and blame—\nsuch is the harm of food.\nGold platters and jade bowls are the adornments of food;\ndrums, bells, and chiming stones are its diversions;\nelaborate embroidery and fine weaves are its distractions;\nexhausting birds and beasts is its violence;\nrich and meager flavors are its strife;\nrefined and coarse distinctions are its contention.\nThe more desire grows, the more it cannot be stilled;\nthe more one seeks, the more it cannot be satisfied.\nThe poor find their food ever insufficient,\nthe rich find theirs ever unpalatable.\nThus, extravagance and transgression arise from this,\nand war and conquest begin from this.\nHe who can equalize food can govern the world.\n\n**Charred Bones**\nThose who gnaw charred bones scorch their lips and rot their tongues yet feel no pain;\nthose who drink fine liquor retch their guts and vomit their stomachs yet feel no bitterness.\nGluttony forgets pain,\nhunger and hardship make light of life.\nPain forgotten, nothing is not deceived;\nlife made light of, nothing is not done.\nThus, the ruler uses his own desires to seek the people’s desires,\nuses his own hunger to seek the people’s hunger.\nMy anger, the people’s anger;\nmy resentment, the people’s resentment.\nHe who knows this Way—\nhow could the world rebel against him?\n\n**The Obsession with Food**\nThere are those who die from overeating their favorite food,\nthose who choke to death on gluttony,\nthose who die for righteousness over a meal,\nthose who perish in humiliation over food,\nthose who fight to the death over a morsel—\nothers may laugh at them.\nYet they do not realize that officials strive for salary,\nand salary is for food;\nmerchants strive for wealth,\nand wealth is for food.\nOfficials die from flattery, deceit, and slander in pursuit of law,\nmerchants drown in the waves of rivers and seas—\nyet they do not grasp the root of their striving,\nnor the cause of their deaths,\ninstead shifting blame to their peers\nand faulting the rivers and seas—\nsuch is the delusion of food.\n\n**The Battle of Desire**\nThe desire for food—\nwhen one imagines the taste of salt and plum, saliva flows uncontrollably;\nwhen one sees a feast laid out, the urge to swallow is irresistible.\nHunger craves the flesh of oxen,\nthirst craves the waters of the sea.\nThus, desire is like a thief to man,\nand man’s relation to desire is like war.\nIn the heat of battle,\nbrocade and pearls cannot make one feel rich,\ncrowns and banners cannot make one feel noble,\nthe sounds of metal, stone, strings, and bamboo go unheard,\nthe splendor of palaces and terraces goes unseen.\nHow much more when the people’s bellies are always empty,\ntheir circumstances always dire—\ncan they be expected to believe in benevolence and righteousness?\n\n**On Governance by Punishment—Can It Be Feared?**\nThe wielding of glue-poles—\none grasps a glue-pole to snare sparrows, and sparrows flock to screech at it;\none offers a platter of food to crows, and crows gather to caw their thanks.\nThus, the most brutal know no difference in kind,\nand the most ravenous know no distinction in taste.\nSerpents and swine may befriend and herd together,\ntigers and rhinos may be tamed and trained,\nthe four barbarians may be led and made guests.\nIf even alien tribes are thus,\nhow much more so man to man.\n\n**Geng and Xin**\nThe Geng clan hollowed out a pond,\nerecting bamboo railings—\nthose who climbed them made a *ce-ce* sound.\nThe Xin clan hollowed out a pond,\nerecting wooden railings—\nthose who climbed them made a *tang-tang* sound.\nBoth clans raised fish in their ponds,\nand whenever they leaned on the railings to cast feed,\nthe fish would leap and surge forth.\nLater, at the mere sound of *ce-ce* or *tang-tang*,\neven without feed, the fish would leap and surge forth.\nThus, the Geng clan’s fish could be called *Ce-ce*,\nthe Xin clan’s fish could be called *Tang-tang*—\nsuch is the transformation wrought by food.\n\n**Rise and Fall**\nA wound is man’s pain,\nfire is man’s urgency—\nyet the people liken hunger to a wound,\ncompare starvation to fire,\nfor their plight is deeply felt.\nRotten fish differs not from a decaying corpse,\ndried minnows differ not from foot grime—\nyet men eat them as a matter of course.\nIf this is so when sated,\nhow much worse when starving?\nWhen hunger knows no bounds, nothing is inedible;\nwhen desperation knows no limits, nothing is unthinkable.\nThis is the pivot of rise and fall.\n\n**Sparrows and Rats**\nMen despise sparrows and rats,\ncalling them thieves by nature;\nsparrows and rats suspect men,\ncalling them brigands at heart.\nWhen superiors humiliate inferiors through food,\nwhen inferiors deceive superiors through food—\nhow can superiors not despise inferiors,\nhow can inferiors not suspect superiors?\nEach acts from dire need.\nTo carve flesh and devour it—\none cannot but weep;\nto choke the throat and seize the morsel—\none cannot but rage.\nThe people’s emaciation comes from carved flesh,\ntheir starvation from seized morsels.\nAlas, what pity!\n\n**Non-Action**\nOxen may be made to pull,\nhorses to bear loads,\ndogs to guard,\nhawks to strike—\nsuch is the influence of food.\nGibbons may be made to dance,\nparrots to speak,\nowls and kites to fight to the death,\nants to wage war—\nsuch is the instruction of food.\nFish may be made to swallow hooks,\ntigers to fall into pits,\ngeese to entangle in nets,\nenemy states to offer themselves—\nsuch is the profit of food.\nHeaven and earth may be made harmonious,\nspirits and gods may be made protective,\nthe lofty may be made to bend,\nbarbarians may be made to submit—\nsuch is the offering of food.\nThus, from the Son of Heaven to the common folk,\nand all the myriad beings,\nall may be moved through food.\nIf I wear plain cloth, the people are warmed;\nif I eat coarse greens, the people are sated.\nOne who skillfully employs the Dao\nmay shoulder the transformation of non-action.\n\n**The King**\nThe huntress is the mother,\nthe one who shares milk is the child.\nThe one who preserves life is the child,\nthe one who strikes the net is the mother.\nThe mother knows not the child’s burdens,\nthe child knows not the mother’s hardships.\nThe king’s expenditure on robes and caps,\nthe cost of his feasts,\nscarcely exceeds a million in a year—\nyet the lands of his vassals,\nthe wealth and rank of his subjects,\nare a hundred million times a million.\nAs if sucking the king’s flesh,\nas if drinking the king’s blood.\nJoy lies with the people below,\nresentment with the ruler above;\nprofit flows to the masses,\nblame falls upon the king.\nIf he does not exalt himself, who in the world would dare exalt him?\nIf he does not enrich himself, who in the world would dare enrich themselves?\n\n**Owls and Kites**\nThe wise pity owls and kites for striking at rotten mice,\nlament ants for riding dead insects to their doom,\nsaying that to be an insect is worse than to be a man.\nYet they do not know that in years of famine,\nmen fight over putrid corpses,\nand in times of siege,\nthey eat the flesh of father and son—\nacts even jackals and wolves cannot bear,\nyet men commit them.\nThus, to be a man is worse than to be an insect.\nKnow this:\nwithout food, the ruler cannot be benevolent;\nwithout food, the minister cannot be righteous;\nwithout food, the scholar cannot be proper;\nwithout food, the people cannot be wise;\nwithout food, all beings cannot be trustworthy.\nThus, food is the root of the Five Constants,\nand the Five Constants are the branches of food.\nIf the king can equalize clothing,\ncan yield in matters of food,\nthen the black-haired people will rejoice in one another—\nthe height of benevolence;\nfather and son will love one another—\nthe height of righteousness;\nthe hungry and full will yield to one another—\nthe height of propriety;\nadvance and retreat will be in harmony—\nthe height of wisdom;\npromises will be kept—\nthe height of trust.\nGood instruction lies in food,\nand bad instruction lies in food.\nThough its substance is humble,\nits use is exalted;\nthough its name is trifling,\nits transformation is vast.\n\nThis is called a priceless treasure.\n\n**Scroll Six: Frugality Transforms, Great Peace**\n\nNow, water and fire are things in constant use; if used without following the Dao, they may lead to the ruin of a household—this is the fault of lacking simplicity. Food and drink are things in constant consumption; if consumed without following the Dao, they may lead to the loss of one’s life—this is the fault of lacking moderation. Ritual loses its way through extravagance, and music loses its way through excess. Extravagance and excess are like water: once gone, they do not return. If one wishes to remedy this, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality is the Dao of equalizing food. When food is equalized, benevolence and righteousness arise; when benevolence and righteousness arise, ritual and music are ordered; when ritual and music are ordered, the people do not resent; when the people do not resent, the spirits are not angered—this is the enterprise of Great Peace.\n\n**The Balance**\n\nThose who wear coarse cloth do not feel cold, yet those who dress in fine silks feel colder still; those who eat coarse greens do not feel hungry, yet those who feast on millet and sorghum feel hungrier still. Thus, one’s own feelings must not go unconsidered, and the people’s hearts must not go unguarded. Generally, the people’s hearts are such that when they see one carrying a stone, they delight in carrying mud; when they see one carrying mud, they delight in carrying straw. Hunger and cold have no fixed appearance, and lightness and heaviness have no certainty—they are all shaped by the contrast between abundance and frugality, and the balance between self and other. If my heart is heavy, the people’s hearts grow heavy; if my burden is light, the people’s burdens grow light. One who can attain frugality can serve as the people’s balance.\n\n**The Dao of Ritual**\n\nRitual values splendor, while frugality values the absence of splendor; ritual values completeness, while frugality values incompleteness; ritual values ornate headdresses, while frugality values plain cloth; ritual values brilliance, while frugality values simplicity. The richer one becomes, the less joy one finds in wealth; the more honored one becomes, the less beauty one finds in honor; the more rewarded one becomes, the less satisfaction one finds in reward; the more beloved one becomes, the less reverence one receives. Gold and jade are the common trappings of wealth; official rank is the common trappings of nobility. Only when thirsty does one find drink sweet, and only when hungry does one find food fragrant. It is through frugality alone that one can recognize the extraordinary.\n\n**The Image of Food**\n\nThose who observe the image of food find that eating beef is never enough; those who observe the wearing of crowns find that wearing a cap is never enough. Insufficiency has its origin, and lack of integrity has its beginning. Thus, if the king favors extravagance, his ministers will never have enough; if the ministers favor extravagance, the scholars will never have enough; if the scholars favor extravagance, the people will never have enough; if the people favor extravagance, the world will never have enough. Of the world’s goods, there are ten parts: if the king favors one, the people will favor one; if the king favors five, the people will favor five; if the king favors ten, the people will favor ten. Judging by these ten parts, it is as if ten households become one household, ten states become one state, ten worlds become one world—how could this not lead to ruin?\n\n**The People’s Nature**\n\nIf a husband favors drinking, his wife will surely be poor. If a son favors falconry, his family will surely be impoverished. Supporting one servant with three bowls of rice a day amounts to a thousand bowls a year. Calculated over a year, this could sustain a thousand soldiers. If a king annually indulges in such excess, he will surely invite weariness and gather resentment—the malady lies in increase, not in reduction. If the king rides in an ox-cart, the people will grow arrogant in their travels; if the king dwells on an earthen dais, the people will feel shame in level ground. Block it at its onset, transform it through frugality. Thus, when one sees that creeping vines are insufficient, one gladly wears plain cloth; when one sees a cracked cup, one joyfully uses earthenware vessels—such is the nature of the people.\n\n**The Name of Stinginess**\n\nThe world calls stinginess a great disgrace, yet it does not realize that this is the beginning of the pure Dao of frugality. It gives nothing of itself and takes nothing from the people. I plow and I eat; I raise silkworms and I wear. My wife and children do not suffer cold, and my servants do not suffer hunger. The people do not resent me, and the spirits do not punish me. Thus, if one person knows frugality, one household becomes wealthy; if a king knows frugality, the world becomes wealthy.\n\n**Ruler and People**\n\nThe ruler and the people have different names, yet their love is the same.\n\nThe ruler delights in riding and hunting, and the people delight in it as well; the ruler takes pleasure in music and beauty, and the people take pleasure in it as well; the ruler loves pearls and jade, and the people love them as well; the ruler craves rich flavors, and the people crave them as well. Their names differ, but their love is the same.\n\nThus, those who wear plain cloth love the courtier’s headdress and sash; those who wear the courtier’s headdress and sash love the high minister’s sword and girdle; those who wear the high minister’s sword and girdle love the royal crown and tassels. The king, therefore, dwells in the place loved by all the people and cannot but be cautious. Moreover, golden chariots and jade carriages seize their wealth; lofty towers and grand pavilions exhaust their strength—this is to incur the people’s resentment, to teach them love of extravagance.\n\nThus, to store firewood and grain is a year’s planning, yet to exchange gold for jade is a day’s expense. They cannot but be impoverished, cannot but be frugal.\n\n**The Nursing Child**\nA nursing child clasps its hands—who would dare mock it? Does this depend on embroidered robes? A shepherd boy bows—who would dare defy him? Does this depend on laws and governance?\n\nWith the respect of host and guest, millet and chicken can serve as a grand feast—does this depend on the *Xiaoshao* music? With a gentle and virtuous demeanor, coarse hemp can fulfill a wife’s duty—does this depend on brocade and embroidery?\n\nYet the king’s system sets moats and ramparts to control them, arrays halberds and spears to guard them, stores grain and silk to sustain them, and erects railings and barriers to distance them. This is because he has designs upon the people and cannot but conceal them; he has private interests and cannot but defend them.\n\nIf one can extend the mechanism of frugality, the people will not deceive; if one employs the privacy of frugality, one will not be suspicious. Frugality, then, can serve as the teacher of great men.\n\n**The Handle of Transformation**\nFrugality in listening nurtures emptiness; frugality in seeing nurtures spirit; frugality in speech nurtures *qi*; frugality in private affairs brings wealth; frugality in public affairs preserves nobility; frugality at the gate and threshold prevents theft; frugality in defense prevents rebellion; frugality in office prevents treachery; frugality among consorts preserves life; frugality in the heart transcends life and death. Thus, frugality can serve as the handle of all transformations.\n\n**Governing the One**\nAll rulers know that governing the One can order the world, yet they do not know what this One is. The myriad Ways all have a One: benevolence also has a One, righteousness also has a One, ritual also has a One, wisdom also has a One, trust also has a One. The One can thread through the Five, and the Five can revere the One. Those who attain the One can govern the world.\n\nIts Way is simple, yet if one departs from simplicity, its words are not abstruse, yet people make them abstruse. Thus, they forever miss its essentials and remain confused by its wonders. Therefore, in discussing the Way of guarding the One, nothing surpasses frugality. Where frugality governs, benevolence does not overflow, righteousness does not disorder, ritual does not become extravagant, wisdom does not change, and trust does not waver.\n\nThus, the heart has its master, and use has its root. When use has its root, the people have something to rely upon.\n\n**The Three Sovereigns**\nWhen the ruler is frugal, ministers know contentment; when ministers are frugal, scholars know contentment; when scholars are frugal, the people know contentment; when the people are frugal, the world knows contentment. When the world knows contentment, there is no greed for wealth, no competition for fame, no treachery, no deceit, no flattery or sycophancy.\n\nThus, ritual and righteousness arise naturally, punishments and governance become tranquil, moats and ramparts level themselves, armor and weapons cease, and wanderers return to the plow. This is how the transformation of the Three Sovereigns spread.\n\n**Heavenly Shepherding**\nThe extravagant plan for three years but use for one; the frugal plan for one year but use for three. The most extravagant still fall short, while the most frugal still have surplus. The extravagant are never satisfied though rich, while the frugal have surplus though poor. The extravagant always feel impoverished in heart, while the frugal always feel wealthy in heart.\n\nThe extravagant love to draw near to others, thus incurring many faults; the frugal can distance themselves from others, thus avoiding many misfortunes. The extravagant, in serving their lord, are sure to suffer disgrace; the frugal, in serving their lord, are sure to preserve their emoluments. The extravagant have many worries, while the frugal have much good fortune. Those who can maintain frugality to the end can shepherd the world.\n\n**Carved Cages**\nHang a carved cage and feed yellow millet to yellow sparrows—the yellow sparrows will never be happy. Display ritual and music, establish rewards and punishments to teach the people—the people will never be at peace.\n\nThe heart cannot be forced to rest yet rests of itself; the Dao cannot be guarded yet guards of itself; the people cannot be transformed yet transform of themselves. Thus, frugality in towers and pavilions leaves the people’s strength in surplus; frugality in treasures leaves the people’s wealth in surplus; frugality in warfare leaves the people’s time in surplus.\n\nNot giving is the reason for giving; not taking is the reason for taking. The Sea Lord’s fish do not flee the sea; the ruler’s horses do not leave the state.\n\n**The Essentials of Ritual**\nRitual emerges from the ruler, yet the ruler does not know it; affairs arise from office, yet office is not clear about them. Scholars dwell in mountains and forests, revering teachers and friends, exhausting principles and delighting in learning, discussing roots and branches.\n\nYet when they see feathered canopies and chariots, the sounding of bells and the *Xiaoshao* music, they startle like deer and delight like pigs—drunk as if with wine, drowned as if in water. They do not know the root of the Dao, nor fathom the purport of ritual.\n\nIf one calls a bow a \"curve,\" the people will not understand; if one calls a horse a \"team,\" the people will not believe. Thus, multiplicity leads to disorder, not simplicity; ritual confuses in its grandeur, not in its smallness. Those who take frugality as their teacher can grasp its essentials.\n\n**Tranquility**\nThe extravagant love movement, while the frugal love stillness; the extravagant love difficulty, while the frugal love ease; the extravagant love complexity, while the frugal love simplicity; the extravagant love pleasure and indulgence, while the frugal love tranquility and plainness.\n\nThere are those who preserve one vessel all their lives without a crack, who hang one fur robe for ten years without decay. Such people can befriend the common folk, can manage grain and silk, can hold seals and tallies, and can enter the Dao of tranquility.\n\n**Reduction and Augmentation**\n\nVirtue without frugality is not true virtue;\nrighteousness without frugality is not true righteousness;\nritual without frugality is not true ritual;\nwisdom without frugality is not true wisdom;\ntrustworthiness without frugality is not true trustworthiness.\nThus, frugality is the root of the Five Constants, while the Five Constants are the branches of frugality.\n\nRitual is the Way of augmentation;\nfrugality is the Way of reduction.\nAugmentation is the intent of reduction,\nwhile reduction is the principle of augmentation.\nExcess in ritual leads to decadence;\nexcess in frugality leads to simplicity.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nno state has ever perished through frugality.\n\n**Dispelling Delusion**\n\nThe humble are revered by all;\nthe frugal are treasured by all.\nYet to command humility is to ensure its absence,\nand to command frugality is to ensure its neglect.\nIf I am humble, the people will naturally be humble;\nif I am frugal, the people will naturally be frugal.\nThe mechanism lies here, not there—\nthe handle rests with the ruler, not with others.\nThose who despise such conduct are deluded;\nthus, it is given form in writing.",

      "translated_text": "**The Transformations of the Dao**\n*By Tan Qiao of the Five Dynasties*\n*Scroll One: The Transformations of the Dao*\n\nWhere the Dao abides, the Void transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into form—form arises, and the myriad things are thus obstructed. Where the Dao operates, form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Void—the Void becomes luminous, and the myriad things are thus permeable. Therefore, the ancient sages exhausted the origins of obstruction and permeability, grasped the source of creation and transformation, forgot form to nourish qi, forgot qi to nourish spirit, forgot spirit to nourish the Void. When the Void and the full interpenetrate, this is called the Great Harmony.\n\nThus, when stored, it is the primordial essence; when employed, it is the ten thousand numina; when contained, it is the Great One; when released, it is the Great Clarity. Hence, Kan and Li wax and wane within the body, wind and clouds issue forth from the seven orifices. True qi steams and rises, and the seasons know no cold or heat; pure yang flows and circulates, and the people know no death or life—this is the Way of spiritual transformation.\n\n**Snake and Sparrow**\nThe snake transforms into a tortoise, the sparrow into a clam. The one suddenly forgets its coiled form and gains a plodding substance; the other abruptly loses its flying and singing demeanor and acquires a shelled body. Carving and cutting cannot enhance its work, compass and square cannot define its form—how swift is this transformation!\n\nMoreover, when a lump hangs in empty space, one sees the lump but not the space; when one grinds the lump to seek the space, one sees the space but not the lump. Form poses no obstacle, yet people create obstacles for themselves; things offer no hindrance, yet people hinder themselves—how lamentable!\n\n**Old Maple**\nThe old maple transforms into a feathered immortal, the rotting wheat into a butterfly—from the inanimate to the animate. The virtuous maiden transforms into steadfast stone, the mountain earthworm into a lily—from the animate to the inanimate. Thus, earth, wood, metal, and stone all possess sentience, essence, and spirit.\n\nThe Void reaches everywhere, spirit penetrates all, qi is never disparate, form knows no bounds. What is \"that,\" and what is \"this\"? What has awareness, and what lacks it? The ten thousand things are one thing; the ten thousand spirits are one spirit—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\n\n**Eyes and Ears**\nWhat the eye cannot see, set up a bright mirror to see; what the ear cannot hear, set up an empty vessel to hear. Though the spirit resides in me, seeing and hearing depend on that. Feet can be severed, lips can be patched—thus, ears and eyes can be falsely arranged, and appearances can be deceptively placed. Layered upon layer, delusion upon delusion.\n\nThus do I know that souls and specters bewitch me, blood and qi intoxicate me, the seven orifices imprison me, the five senses enslave me. Only when spirit takes form does form develop excrescences. If there were no excrescences, what could not be achieved?\n\n**Circular Dance**\nThose who perform the circular dance find halls and chambers all spinning; those who gaze at swirling currents find their heads and eyes revolving. It is not that the halls and chambers are illusory, but that people delude themselves; it is not that the swirling currents change, but that people transform themselves.\n\nThus, powdered kerchief becomes a rabbit, medicinal stone becomes a horse—and people do not doubt; sweet words and artful smiles, painted faces and penciled brows—and people do not know. Only the pure and tranquil cannot be deceived.\n\n**Lead and Cinnabar**\nThere are arts of firing and refining lead and cinnabar to replace grain as food—this must be so. Yet in years of plenty, one may be sated; in lean years, one may hunger. This is not the grace of cinnabar, but rather the sincerity of the person. Thus, I am not inherently hungry, yet I hunger myself; cinnabar is not inherently sating, yet I sate myself. Hunger is a great delusion; satiety, a great illusion—this is because their Ways are not unified.\n\nTherefore, if one can unify being and non-being, death and life, emotion and nature, inner and outer, then one can shed the five phases, cast off the three luminaries. Why fear eating a hundred meals in a day, or worry about eating but one meal in a hundred days?\n\n**Form and Shadow**\nUse one mirror to reflect the form, and other mirrors to reflect the shadow.",

Thus is the form no different from the shadow, the shadow no other than the form. Then we know: the form is not truly real, the shadow not truly void; neither real nor void, they may join the Dao.\n\n**Concealment**\nAmong things, some excel in concealment: some ward off bitter cold, some banish ravenous hunger, some live ten thousand years without dying. Their hearts rest in profound obscurity, knowing nothing; their spirits delight in boundless ease, going nowhere; their qi flows gently, doing nothing. Ten thousand cares cannot confuse them; even death cannot be sought. Thus the great person embodies things to know the self, embodies the self to know the spirit, embodies the spirit to know the true—this is called the ford of the auspicious one.\n\n**Owl and Fowl**\nThe owl sees clearly by night but is blind by day; the fowl sees clearly by day but is blind by night—such is their difference and sameness.

      "translated_text": "Thus, where Dao and virtue prove unrealized, where benevolence and righteousness fail to reach, where punishments and rites fall short—this teaches the people to be cunning and deceitful, drives them toward licentiousness and depravity, transforms them into rebels, and goads them into banditry. Above, the ruler remains dazed, unaware of the decay; below, the people drift in confusion, oblivious to their affliction. How then can they be saved?\n\n**The Orthodox Unity**\nAll know that purslane can split a turtle’s shell, yet none know that the vermilion herb can split a man. By this, the petty man learns that the numinous may be divided, that qi may be dissolved, that form may be dispersed. Dispersed into the myriad, it is not called excess; gathered into one, it is not called deficiency. Like a gale scattering hair, like souls and spirits fleeing in dreams, like a sandal’s tooth severing an earthworm—head and tail both stir. Why? The Great Void is but one void; the Great Spirit, but one spirit; the Great Qi, but one qi; the Great Form, but one form. Name them as four, yet root them as one. Hold fast to it and you lose it; relinquish it and you do not. This is called the Orthodox Unity.\n\n**Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven and earth steal from the Great Void to live; man and insects steal from heaven and earth to live; *yingding* steal from man and insects to live. *Yingding*—the worms in the intestines—seize my essence and qi, melt my soul and spirit, plunder my nourishment, and claim life for themselves. By this, I see that I must die, and thus know that heaven must collapse. If heaven collapses, where shall I abide? If I die, where shall the *yingding* dwell? This is like treacherous ministers stealing the state: when the state falls, the house perishes. Like borers gnawing wood: when the wood is consumed, the worms die. Therefore, the great person gathers essence and qi, conceals soul and spirit, moderates nourishment, restrains desires, and rejects wealth and nobility. Though heaven and earth age, I do not fall; though *yingding* die, I attain long life; though treacherous ministers depart, the state knows great peace.\n\n**The Child**\nThe child plays with its shadow, unaware it is the shadow playing with the child; the madman mocks the statue, unaware it is the statue mocking the madman.

      "translated_text": "**Book Two: Arts and Transformations**\n\n**Cloud-Dragon**\nCloud-dragon and wind-tiger embody the Dao of spirit and qi. Spirit arises from the mother, qi from the child. To summon qi with spirit is to summon the child with the mother—who would dare not come? To dispel filth, one must invoke the qi of the Five Emperors; if the summons fails, how can filth be cleansed? To subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars; if the command fails, how can vipers be subdued? From this, the petty person knows that yin and yang may be set in motion, wind and clouds may be gathered, mountains and hills may be uprooted, rivers and seas may be overturned. Yet to summon from without is not as sure as to guard within, and only then deploy without—then nothing is impossible.\n\n**Fierce Tiger**\nWhen the fierce tiger strides, grasses and trees lie flat; when the venomous shrike rages, earth and stone are overturned. Where its might blazes, where its qi strikes, even the stubborn and perverse are moved to action. From this, the petty person knows that swords may be made to fly, mountains and rivers may be shifted, and the myriad things may be made to follow. When spirit is whole, might is great; when essence is whole, qi is mighty. A thousand delusions cannot drown it, and the myriad things may be made to serve. Thus, one man may oppose ten thousand not by skill with bow or blade, but by the utmost of might; one man may please ten thousand not by gifts of speech or laughter, but by the utmost of harmony.\n\n**Using Spirit**\nSome creatures lack feet: the snake coils and bends, the leech contracts and folds, the snail retracts and withdraws. The petty person perceives their mechanism, learns from their example, and may thus sit and reach a thousand miles without haste. Therefore, those who walk with feet cannot reach all places, those who fly with wings cannot arrive everywhere, those who see with eyes cannot perceive all things, those who hear with ears cannot catch every sound. Why is this? The former know form but not spirit; the latter know spirit but not form. To employ spirit through form is to perish; to employ form through spirit is to thrive.\n\n**Water Channel**\nA water channel may drown one below, a pestle’s chaff may cure choking. These things were first fashioned by man, then turned to man’s use. Methods have no origin, arts no fixed form; the master finds them in the heart, grasps them in the image. Yang is subdued by yin, man is controlled by woman, the hard is overcome by the soft, the wise are outwitted by the foolish. Employed thus, drums and bells may be silenced, chariot hubs may be made to clash, wives and children may be made to change, rulers and ministers may be made to part or unite. The myriad things are fundamentally empty, the myriad methods fundamentally nonexistent. He who grasps the aperture of emptiness knows the essence of arts and methods!\n\n**Wangliang Spirits**\nWangliang spirits attach themselves to shamans and oracles, speaking of fortune and misfortune. When they come, food, drink, and speech all become divine; when they depart, food, drink, and speech all return to human. One does not know whether the wangliang attach to the shaman or the shaman to the wangliang. From this, the petty person knows that hearts may be exchanged, qi may be altered, spirit may be seized, and souls may be captured. Form is the palace of spirit, spirit the countenance of form. Judged thus, what is impossible?",

Only the heartless cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by blades, or killed by Heaven’s decree. Why is this so? One whose will is set on joy forgets hunger; one whose will is set on sorrow forgets pain; one whose will is set on emptiness and nothingness can forget life and death.\n\n**Vacuity and Substance**\nA block of wood a foot square, when placed upon the ground, leaves ample room for a man to tread upon it. The same block, when placed at the tip of a pole, leaves no room for a man to stand upon it. It is not that the object itself has grown larger or smaller—rather, the heart has become vacuous or substantial. Thus, one who frets in the scorching heat feels it all the more, and one who dreads the cauterizing iron feels the pain all the more. The human heart has no fixed nature, and things have no fixed properties. From this, the petty person knows that water can be made not to wet, and fire can be made not to scorch.\n\n**Fox Spirits**\nThe illusions of fox spirits and the enchantments of sparrows and rats cannot deceive the reflection of a bright mirror, for the bright mirror is without heart. Thus, the empty void, being without heart, knows all things; the vast heavens, being without heart, allow the ten thousand images to gallop freely. A general without form leaves his enemy no opening to deceive him; the great man without cares draws primordial essence to himself. One who takes emptiness as their master can go anywhere without hindrance.\n\n**Turning the Boat**\nTo turn a boat of ten thousand *hu*, one relies on a single *xun* of wood; to loose a crossbow of a thousand *jun*, one relies on a single inch of the trigger. A single glance can take in the vastness of Heaven; a single person can rule over millions of people. The great void, though boundless, has its limits; the supreme ultimate, though vast, has its form. Grasp the warp of Heaven and Earth, know the chambers of yin and yang, perceive the storehouse of spirit and essence—then numbers can be altered, fate can be revived, and Heaven and Earth can be overturned.\n\n**The Heart’s Transformations**\nThe most debauched may transform into a woman; the most violent may transform into a fierce tiger. What the heart transforms into, it cannot but become. Thus, the joyful assume a harmonious form, the delighted assume a carefree form, the angry assume a rigid form, and the sorrowful assume a mournful form. This, too, is the Dao of transformation. From this, the petty person knows that this six-foot frame can become dragon or snake, gold or stone, grass or tree. How great are these words!\n\n**Pearls and Jade**",

Revering ghosts and spirits is the duty of trusting in misfortune and blessing; divining good and ill fortune is the duty of trusting in the fate of rise and fall. Yet how can one harbor such great distrust, exhausting the people’s strength to build walls and ramparts, seizing the people’s food to amass stores? This is to believe that blessing can be seized by force, that misfortune can be resisted by force; this is to waver in faith toward ghosts and spirits, to deceive and confuse the omens of tortoise and milfoil, to distrust the people of all under Heaven.

The one moves hurriedly, the other leisurely; the one chirps faintly, the other sings resoundingly; the one gazes restlessly, the other gazes serenely; the one’s heart is anxious, the other’s heart is magnanimous.

The schemes of the petty person, the calculations in myriad transformations, cannot escape the Dao of the great person. The Dao of the great person is like the earth bearing all, like the heavens covering all. Though none cease resenting, though none cease deceiving, resentment does not enrage me, deceit does not level me—only then do the myriad things know where to return.\n\n**The Constant Dao**\nBenevolence and righteousness are the constant Dao of conduct, yet if one practices them without mastering their art, it leads to the ruin of the state. Loyalty and trustworthiness are the constant Dao of employment, yet if one employs them without mastering their art, it leads to incurring punishment. Integrity is the constant Dao of preservation, yet if one preserves it without mastering its art, it leads to oppressing the people. Wealth and eloquence are the constant Dao of governance, yet if one governs with them without mastering their art, it leads to encountering disaster. For clumsiness lies in using them on others, while skill lies in using them on oneself. If you cause the people to cherish farming, they resent it; if you warn them against frivolous consumption, they grow angry. Bait is what fish crave, and the scent of fat is what ants desire—yet cast bait to fish, and they surely grow wary; offer fat to ants, and they surely flee, for this is not the Dao of transformation.\n\n**Stirred by Joy**\nTo be moved by a father’s kindness is not filial piety;",

      "translated_text": "Stirred by a lord’s favor is not loyalty. To feel begins in non-feeling, and joy begins in non-joy. Excessive feeling must bring excessive resentment; excessive joy must bring excessive anger. Feeling and joy reside in the heart, yet they arise from things that bear poison, from fire concealed in reeds—one cannot but be cautious. Thus the noble person’s vocation lies in this: rank holds no esteem, rites hold no grandeur, kin remain unrecognized, and strangers arouse no suspicion; even humiliation cannot take hold—how then could feeling or joy arise?\n\n**The Grand Physician**\nThe Way of the Grand Physician: when the pulse is harmonious and full, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of life; when it is agitated and floating, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of death. The Way of the Grand Diviner: when the stalks lie level and unhurried, it belongs to the noble person, the Way of fortune; when they curve and turn sharp, it belongs to the petty person, the Way of misfortune. Judging by this, the principle of all under Heaven is one. Thus, observe a state, and you know its ministers; observe its ministers, and you know its lord; observe its lord, and you know its rise and fall. Ministers may choose their lords to serve, and lords may choose their ministers to employ.\n\nBows and courtesies may be feigned, but restlessness and stillness cannot; robes and caps may be counterfeited, but form and vessel cannot; speech may be embellished, but voice cannot.\n\n**Slanderous Speech**\nWhat lies hidden in others is called a mechanism; what surprises others is called a stratagem. Yet the mechanism of virtue and power is known to all, while the stratagem of benevolence and righteousness is possessed by none. Thus, where rewards and punishments are taught, perverse ways advance; where distinctions of closeness and distance are made, petty persons enter. Cast gold in the marketplace, and thieves dare not take it; inquire of governance in the court, and slanderers dare not speak—this is the utmost impartiality of all under Heaven.\n\n**Carving and Painting**\nPainters dare not alter the likeness in an image; if they alter it, misfortune surely follows. Carvers dare not mock the original form of a figurine; if they mock it, calamity is surely left behind. First, the creation begins with me; then, reverence is demanded of me; finally, disaster is placed upon me. Thus, those who set traps die by traps; those who establish peril perish by peril; those who build merit are shamed by merit; those who establish laws are ensnared by laws.\n\nMove one aperture, and a hundred apertures respond; undertake one matter, and ten thousand matters suffer harm. Therefore, mechanisms prize clarity; peril prizes levelness; merit prizes formlessness; law prizes imagelessness. Those who can transcend carving and painting may be called masters of the Great Image.\n\n**Wine and Sweet Wine**\nWith wine and sweet wine, the more one is pressed to drink, the less one drinks; the more one is forgiven for drinking, the more one desires to drink. Thus, those who suppress others are suppressed by others; those who tolerate others are tolerated by others. Pardon a man’s death, and he delights in death; pardon his tribute, and he delights in tribute. Thus the people steal their lord’s virtue, and the lord steals the people’s strength. Those who understand the Way of reversal may hold the office of governing the multitudes.\n\n**Favor and Reward**\nA marquisate is what people esteem; gold is what people value. Yet when the multitude enfeoffs a duke and one obtains a marquisate, it is not deemed fine; when the multitude divides jade and one obtains gold, it is not deemed joyful. Thus rewards must not be recklessly bestowed, nor favor recklessly granted. When fitting, they become the beginning of contention; when unfitting, they become the foundation of chaos and ruin. Therefore, if I humble myself, rewards cannot be grand; if I practice frugality, favor cannot be extraordinary. Surveying the histories of chaos and ruin, all stem from arrogance and extravagance—this is how favor and reward operate.\n\n**Nurturing the People**\nThe people do not resent fire but resent those who forbid it; they do not resent theft but resent those who guard against it. Thus, aiding the people is not as good as not aiding them; loving the people is not as good as not loving them. Heaven has rain and dew to invite their resentment; spirits receive prayers and offerings to invite their slander. Therefore, forbidding the people’s fire is not as good as forbidding the fire in their hearts; guarding against others’ theft is not as good as guarding against one’s own theft—this is how the people are nurtured.\n\n**Book Four: The Transforming Power of Benevolence**\nAttaining Unity...",

If you cause the people to cherish farming, they resent it; if you warn them against frivolous consumption, they grow angry. Bait is what fish crave, and the scent of fat is what ants desire—yet cast bait to fish, and they surely grow wary; offer fat to ants, and they surely flee, for this is not the Dao of transformation.\n\n**Stirred by Joy**\nTo be moved by a father’s kindness is not filial piety;",

      "translated_text": "The Dao is called that which is vast and without action; the power to preserve itself is called virtue; virtue giving rise to the myriad things is called benevolence; benevolence rescuing from peril and securing safety is called righteousness; righteousness having departures and approaches is called propriety; propriety having adaptations and transformations is called wisdom; wisdom having sincerity and truthfulness is called trustworthiness; and their thorough mastery and application is called sageliness.\n\nThe Dao is emptiness and nothingness—without means to preserve itself, it is therefore endowed with virtue. Virtue is purity and quiescence—without means to apply itself, it is therefore endowed with benevolence. Benevolence in use gives rise to the myriad things; the myriad things arising must have safety and peril, so it is therefore endowed with righteousness. Righteousness aids the secure and rescues the imperiled; there must be judgments of good and ill, so it is therefore endowed with propriety. Propriety upholds rules and maintains standards; there must be doubts and obstructions, so it is therefore endowed with wisdom. Wisdom being unobstructed entails much change, so it is therefore endowed with trustworthiness—trustworthiness being that by which the myriad things are completed.\n\nThe Five Phases and the virtue of the Dao are Heaven and Earth. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. Benevolence is called that which engenders life, thus it presides over Wood. Righteousness is called that which rescues from difficulty, thus it presides over Metal. Propriety is called that which clarifies, thus it presides over Fire. Wisdom is called that which adapts and transforms, thus it presides over Water. Trustworthiness is called that which is steadfast, thus it presides over Earth.\n\nWhen benevolence is insufficient, righteousness aids it—Metal fells Wood. When righteousness is insufficient, propriety aids it—Fire melts Metal. When propriety is insufficient, wisdom aids it—Water extinguishes Fire. When wisdom is insufficient, trustworthiness aids it—Earth dams Water. In the beginning, the Five Constants mutually aid one another; in the end, the Five Constants mutually overcome one another—such is the course of the great transformation.\n\n**Hunting and Fishing**\nWhat difference is there between birds and beasts and humans? They have dwellings in nests and dens, mates in pairs, the nature of parent and child, and the feelings of life and death. The crow returns to feed its parent—this is benevolence. The falcon pities its unhatched young—this is righteousness. The bee has a sovereign—this is propriety. The lamb kneels to suckle—this is wisdom. The pheasant does not mate twice—this is trustworthiness. Who has fully explored their Way? Among the myriad things, the Five Constants and a hundred practices are all present, yet teaching sets nets and snares as the guiding principle, compelling them to devote themselves to hunting and fishing.\n\nMoreover, burning their nests and dens is not benevolence; seizing their beloved kin is not righteousness; making this the offering is not propriety; teaching the people cruelty is not wisdom; causing the myriad things to harbor doubt is not trustworthiness. The desire for rank odors does not cease; the mechanism of killing and harm does not end. Though feathers and fur cannot speak, they must depict us as ravenous wolves and giant boars; though scales and shells lack awareness, they must name us as great whales and monstrous serpents. How can one be at ease—how can one not feel shame? Alas! One might well suspect that since ancient times there have been no true noble persons.\n\n**Sacrificial Offerings**\nThe offering of sacrificial animals, the presentation of lambs and wild geese—these were the rites of antiquity. Moreover, the noble persons of old were not unaware that the sorrows and joys of emotions, the grief and delight of sounds, could move Heaven and Earth and stir ghosts and spirits. With the knife and block set before them, the sorrows and joys of their emotions could be known; with hawks and hounds arrayed, the grief and delight of their sounds could be known. To use such things in sacrifice to Heaven and Earth, to use them in prayer to the divine luminaries—Heaven and Earth would surely not accept them, and if they did, calamity would follow; the divine luminaries would surely not delight in them, and if they did, regret would follow.\n\nThus we know that when the divine dragon appears, it portends the loss of the signs of wind and cloud; when the phoenix comes, it portends the loss of the symbols of honor and esteem; when the qilin emerges, it portends the demise of the state and its lands. Judging by our righteousness, the birds and beasts must deem us unrighteous; taking them as auspicious, the birds and beasts must deem them inauspicious.\n\n**Great Harmony**\nIt is not the hare that is cunning—it is the hunter who is cunning. It is not the people who are deceitful—it is the officials who are deceitful. Take care not to resent thieves and bandits, for thieves and bandits are only summoned by us; take care not to resent rebellion and disorder, for rebellion and disorder are only taught by us. Without harmony and concord, how could there be enmity and strife? Without rewards and encouragements, how could there be struggle and contention?",

The wise are often thwarted, the eloquent often humiliated, the perceptive often blinded, the brave often slain.

Heaven obtains them to lend to men; men obtain them to lend to the world.\n\n**Saving Things**\nThose who save things and call it righteousness are deemed unrighteous by others; those who bestow favors seeking repayment are not repaid.

Give freely, and they treat it lightly; withhold, and they seize it. Thus great righteousness has no form, great kindness no image.

recognize them;\nthose who do good desire to be known—yet there are always those who remain unaware.\nThus, those unrecognized by others are called great evil;\nthose unknown to others are called supreme good.\nHe who delights in bestowing favors does not spread kindness widely;\nhe who pursues the extraordinary does not achieve great merit;\nhe who excels at games of skill lacks far-reaching wisdom;\nhe whose words are ornate and flowery does not long endure in renown.\nTherefore, the noble person values only the Dao and guards only virtue,\nthus attaining undying legacy through the ages.\n\n**Book Five: The Transformation of Nourishment**\n**Seven Usurpations**\nTo go one day without food is to grow weary;\ntwo days without food is to fall ill;\nthree days without food is to die.\nNo human affair is more urgent than food,\nyet the ruler usurps one share,\nministers and officials another,\nsoldiers and clerks another,\nwar and conquest another,\ncraftsmen another,\nmerchants another,\nthe followers of Dao and Buddha another,\nyears of plenty another,\nand frugality another.\nThus, when silkworms have spun their last thread, one wears garments of hemp and ramie;\nwhen the harvest is complete, one eats the fruits of oak and chinquapin.\nThe ruler’s punishments and governance are unjust—this is the height of injustice;\nthe great man’s Way seeks to remedy wrongdoing—this is the height of wrongdoing.\nYet to practice earnest benevolence and employ anxious ritual—\nhow can these ever make amends?\n\n**Shamans and Idols**\nWhere there are shamans, spirits inevitably attach themselves;\nwhere idols are set up, gods inevitably take residence—\nfor they delight in what is offered.\nThe rites of the Rong and Jie peoples honor the mother but not the father;\nthe nature of birds and beasts follows the mother but not the father;\nin human suffering, one cries for the mother but not the father—\nall due to the nurture of nursing.\nTigers and wolves do not exceed their craving for meat,\ndragons and serpents do not exceed their craving for blood,\nyet humans crave everything.\nThus, when needs are unmet, they fight;\nwhen denied, they rebel,\nstirring the world’s resentment\nand provoking the fury of the valiant.\nThe Way of nourishment is no small matter.\n\n**Raising Horses**\nThe master raises the horse, but the groom tends to it closely;\nthe mother bears the child, but the wet nurse nurtures it intimately.\nLord and minister are not to be compared,\nyet they are equated by salary;\nmother and child are not to be loved equally,\nyet they are loved through nursing.\nA dull horse has no innate understanding,\nan infant has no innate cunning,\nyet understanding begins here,\nand cunning arises from this.\nThus, love and hatred emerge,\nthus, self and other take shape,\nthus, strife and deceit accumulate.\n\n**Silk and Cord**\nThe king takes the silk,\nthe official takes the cord;\nthe king takes the cord,\nthe official takes the tassel.\nTaking without end leads to deception;\ndeception without end leads to flogging;\nflogging without end leads to theft;\ntheft without end leads to murder;\nmurder without end leads to execution.\nDeception is not the people’s love—it is the teaching of those who amass and extort;\nmurder is not the people’s desire—it is the lesson of those who wield the lash.\nWhen fire presses close, one leaps into water,\nknowing escape is impossible—yet valuing the delay;\nwhen a tiger is about to strike, one throws oneself into a ravine,\nknowing survival is unlikely—yet hoping for life.\nTo draw such parallels is lamentable indeed!\n\n**Extravagance and Transgression**\nThe noble person refuses to tell others of his hunger—\nsuch shame is profound.\nHe also refuses to boast of his fullness—\nsuch humiliation is deep.\nHaving aroused another’s shame and humiliation,\nhe inevitably provokes their resentment and blame—\nsuch is the harm of food.\nGold platters and jade bowls are the adornments of food;\ndrums, bells, and chiming stones are its diversions;\nelaborate embroidery and fine weaves are its distractions;\nexhausting birds and beasts is its violence;\nrich and meager flavors are its strife;\nrefined and coarse distinctions are its contention.\nThe more desire grows, the more it cannot be stilled;\nthe more one seeks, the more it cannot be satisfied.\nThe poor find their food ever insufficient,\nthe rich find theirs ever unpalatable.\nThus, extravagance and transgression arise from this,\nand war and conquest begin from this.\nHe who can equalize food can govern the world.\n\n**Charred Bones**\nThose who gnaw charred bones scorch their lips and rot their tongues yet feel no pain;\nthose who drink fine liquor retch their guts and vomit their stomachs yet feel no bitterness.\nGluttony forgets pain,\nhunger and hardship make light of life.\nPain forgotten, nothing is not deceived;\nlife made light of, nothing is not done.\nThus, the ruler uses his own desires to seek the people’s desires,\nuses his own hunger to seek the people’s hunger.\nMy anger, the people’s anger;\nmy resentment, the people’s resentment.\nHe who knows this Way—\nhow could the world rebel against him?\n\n**The Obsession with Food**\nThere are those who die from overeating their favorite food,\nthose who choke to death on gluttony,\nthose who die for righteousness over a meal,\nthose who perish in humiliation over food,\nthose who fight to the death over a morsel—\nothers may laugh at them.\nYet they do not realize that officials strive for

seas—\nyet they do not grasp the root of their striving,\nnor the cause of their deaths,\ninstead shifting blame to their peers\nand faulting the rivers and seas—\nsuch is the delusion of food.\n\n**The Battle of Desire**\nThe desire for food—\nwhen one imagines the taste of salt and plum, saliva flows uncontrollably;\nwhen one sees a feast laid out, the urge to swallow is irresistible.\nHunger craves the flesh of oxen,\nthirst craves the waters of the sea.\nThus, desire is like a thief to man,\nand man’s relation to desire is like war.\nIn the heat of battle,\nbrocade

      "translated_text": "This is called a priceless treasure.\n\n**Scroll Six: Frugality Transforms, Great Peace**\n\nNow, water and fire are things in constant use; if used without following the Dao, they may lead to the ruin of a household—this is the fault of lacking simplicity. Food and drink are things in constant consumption; if consumed without following the Dao, they may lead to the loss of one’s life—this is the fault of lacking moderation. Ritual loses its way through extravagance, and music loses its way through excess. Extravagance and excess are like water: once gone, they do not return. If one wishes to remedy this, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality is the Dao of equalizing food. When food is equalized, benevolence and righteousness arise; when benevolence and righteousness arise, ritual and music are ordered; when ritual and music are ordered, the people do not resent; when the people do not resent, the spirits are not angered—this is the enterprise of Great Peace.\n\n**The Balance**\n\nThose who wear coarse cloth do not feel cold, yet those who dress in fine silks feel colder still; those who eat coarse greens do not feel hungry, yet those who feast on millet and sorghum feel hungrier still. Thus, one’s own feelings must not go unconsidered, and the people’s hearts must not go unguarded. Generally, the people’s hearts are such that when they see one carrying a stone, they delight in carrying mud; when they see one carrying mud, they delight in carrying straw. Hunger and cold have no fixed appearance, and lightness and heaviness have no certainty—they are all shaped by the contrast between abundance and frugality, and the balance between self and other. If my heart is heavy, the people’s hearts grow heavy; if my burden is light, the people’s burdens grow light. One who can attain frugality can serve as the people’s balance.\n\n**The Dao of Ritual**\n\nRitual values splendor, while frugality values the absence of splendor; ritual values completeness, while frugality values incompleteness; ritual values ornate headdresses, while frugality values plain cloth; ritual values brilliance, while frugality values simplicity. The richer one becomes, the less joy one finds in wealth; the more honored one becomes, the less beauty one finds in honor; the more rewarded one becomes, the less satisfaction one finds in reward; the more beloved one becomes, the less reverence one receives. Gold and jade are the common trappings of wealth; official rank is the common trappings of nobility. Only when thirsty does one find drink sweet, and only when hungry does one find food fragrant. It is through frugality alone that one can recognize the extraordinary.\n\n**The Image of Food**\n\nThose who observe the image of food find that eating beef is never enough; those who observe the wearing of crowns find that wearing a cap is never enough. Insufficiency has its origin, and lack of integrity has its beginning. Thus, if the king favors extravagance, his ministers will never have enough; if the ministers favor extravagance, the scholars will never have enough; if the scholars favor extravagance, the people will never have enough; if the people favor extravagance, the world will never have enough. Of the world’s goods, there are ten parts: if the king favors one, the people will favor one; if the king favors five, the people will favor five; if the king favors ten, the people will favor ten. Judging by these ten parts, it is as if ten households become one household, ten states become one state, ten worlds become one world—how could this not lead to ruin?\n\n**The People’s Nature**\n\nIf a husband favors drinking, his wife will surely be poor. If a son favors falconry, his family will surely be impoverished. Supporting one servant with three bowls of rice a day amounts to a thousand bowls a year. Calculated over a year, this could sustain a thousand soldiers. If a king annually indulges in such excess, he will surely invite weariness and gather resentment—the malady lies in increase, not in reduction. If the king rides in an ox-cart, the people will grow arrogant in their travels; if the king dwells on an earthen dais, the people will feel shame in level ground. Block it at its onset, transform it through frugality. Thus, when one sees that creeping vines are insufficient, one gladly wears plain cloth; when one sees a cracked cup, one joyfully uses earthenware vessels—such is the nature of the people.\n\n**The Name of Stinginess**\n\nThe world calls stinginess a great disgrace, yet it does not realize that this is the beginning of the pure Dao of frugality. It gives nothing of itself and takes nothing from the people. I plow and I eat; I raise silkworms and I wear. My wife and children do not suffer cold, and my servants do not suffer hunger. The people do not resent me, and the spirits do not punish me. Thus, if one person knows frugality, one household becomes wealthy; if a king knows frugality, the world becomes wealthy.\n\n**Ruler and People**\n\nThe ruler and the people have different names, yet their love is the same.",

      "translated_text": "The ruler delights in riding and hunting, and the people delight in it as well; the ruler takes pleasure in music and beauty, and the people take pleasure in it as well; the ruler loves pearls and jade, and the people love them as well; the ruler craves rich flavors, and the people crave them as well. Their names differ, but their love is the same.\n\nThus, those who wear plain cloth love the courtier’s headdress and sash; those who wear the courtier’s headdress and sash love the high minister’s sword and girdle; those who wear the high minister’s sword and girdle love the royal crown and tassels. The king, therefore, dwells in the place loved by all the people and cannot but be cautious. Moreover, golden chariots and jade carriages seize their wealth; lofty towers and grand pavilions exhaust their strength—this is to incur the people’s resentment, to teach them love of extravagance.\n\nThus, to store firewood and grain is a year’s planning, yet to exchange gold for jade is a day’s expense. They cannot but be impoverished, cannot but be frugal.\n\n**The Nursing Child**\nA nursing child clasps its hands—who would dare mock it? Does this depend on embroidered robes? A shepherd boy bows—who would dare defy him? Does this depend on laws and governance?\n\nWith the respect of host and guest, millet and chicken can serve as a grand feast—does this depend on the *Xiaoshao* music? With a gentle and virtuous demeanor, coarse hemp can fulfill a wife’s duty—does this depend on brocade and embroidery?\n\nYet the king’s system sets moats and ramparts to control them, arrays halberds and spears to guard them, stores grain and silk to sustain them, and erects railings and barriers to distance them. This is because he has designs upon the people and cannot but conceal them; he has private interests and cannot but defend them.\n\nIf one can extend the mechanism of frugality, the people will not deceive; if one employs the privacy of frugality, one will not be suspicious. Frugality, then, can serve as the teacher of great men.\n\n**The Handle of Transformation**\nFrugality in listening nurtures emptiness; frugality in seeing nurtures spirit; frugality in speech nurtures *qi*; frugality in private affairs brings wealth; frugality in public affairs preserves nobility; frugality at the gate and threshold prevents theft; frugality in defense prevents rebellion; frugality in office prevents treachery; frugality among consorts preserves life; frugality in the heart transcends life and death. Thus, frugality can serve as the handle of all transformations.\n\n**Governing the One**\nAll rulers know that governing the One can order the world, yet they do not know what this One is. The myriad Ways all have a One: benevolence also has a One, righteousness also has a One, ritual also has a One, wisdom also has a One, trust also has a One. The One can thread through the Five, and the Five can revere the One. Those who attain the One can govern the world.\n\nIts Way is simple, yet if one departs from simplicity, its words are not abstruse, yet people make them abstruse. Thus, they forever miss its essentials and remain confused by its wonders. Therefore, in discussing the Way of guarding the One, nothing surpasses frugality. Where frugality governs, benevolence does not overflow, righteousness does not disorder, ritual does not become extravagant, wisdom does not change, and trust does not waver.\n\nThus, the heart has its master, and use has its root. When use has its root, the people have something to rely upon.\n\n**The Three Sovereigns**\nWhen the ruler is frugal, ministers know contentment; when ministers are frugal, scholars know contentment; when scholars are frugal, the people know contentment; when the people are frugal, the world knows contentment. When the world knows contentment, there is no greed for wealth, no competition for fame, no treachery, no deceit, no flattery or sycophancy.\n\nThus, ritual and righteousness arise naturally, punishments and governance become tranquil, moats and ramparts level themselves, armor and weapons cease, and wanderers return to the plow. This is how the transformation of the Three Sovereigns spread.\n\n**Heavenly Shepherding**\nThe extravagant plan for three years but use for one; the frugal plan for one year but use for three. The most extravagant still fall short, while the most frugal still have surplus. The extravagant are never satisfied though rich, while the frugal have surplus though poor. The extravagant always feel impoverished in heart, while the frugal always feel wealthy in heart.\n\nThe extravagant love to draw near to others, thus incurring many faults; the frugal can distance themselves from others, thus avoiding many misfortunes. The extravagant, in serving their lord, are sure to suffer disgrace; the frugal, in serving their lord, are sure to preserve their emoluments. The extravagant have many worries, while the frugal have much good fortune. Those who can maintain frugality to the end can shepherd the world.\n\n**Carved Cages**\nHang a carved cage and feed yellow millet to yellow sparrows—the yellow sparrows will never be happy. Display ritual and music, establish rewards and punishments to teach the people—the people will never be at peace.\n\nThe heart cannot be forced to rest yet rests of itself; the Dao cannot be guarded yet guards of itself; the people cannot be transformed yet transform of themselves. Thus, frugality in towers and pavilions leaves the people’s strength in surplus; frugality in treasures leaves the people’s wealth in surplus; frugality in warfare leaves the people’s time in surplus.\n\nNot giving is the reason for giving; not taking is the reason for taking. The Sea Lord’s fish do not flee the sea; the ruler’s horses do not leave the state.\n\n**The Essentials of Ritual**\nRitual emerges from the ruler, yet the ruler does not know it; affairs arise from office, yet office is not clear about them. Scholars dwell in mountains and forests, revering teachers and friends, exhausting principles and delighting in learning, discussing roots and branches.\n\nYet when they see feathered canopies and chariots, the sounding of bells and the *Xiaoshao* music, they startle like deer and delight like pigs—drunk as if with wine, drowned as if in water. They do not know the root of the Dao, nor fathom the purport of ritual.\n\nIf one calls a bow a \"curve,\" the people will not understand; if one calls a horse a \"team,\" the people will not believe. Thus, multiplicity leads to disorder, not simplicity; ritual confuses in its grandeur, not in its smallness. Those who take frugality as their teacher can grasp its essentials.\n\n**Tranquility**\nThe extravagant love movement, while the frugal love stillness; the extravagant love difficulty, while the frugal love ease; the extravagant love complexity, while the frugal love simplicity; the extravagant love pleasure and indulgence, while the frugal love tranquility and plainness.\n\nThere are those who preserve one vessel all their lives without a crack, who hang one fur robe for ten years without decay. Such people can befriend the common folk, can manage grain and silk, can hold seals and tallies, and can enter the Dao of tranquility.",
