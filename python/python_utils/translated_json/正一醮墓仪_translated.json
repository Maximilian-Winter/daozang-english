One fascicle.\n*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongshen Section, Wei Yi Category.\n\n---\n\n**Zhengyi Jiao Tomb Ritual**\n\nWhen a tomb has stood for many years and months, or has collapsed and requires repair, or when misfortune and decline arise due to the waxing and stirring of earthly *qi*, leading to the impoverishment of descendants, unexpected calamities, and a hundred affairs turning inauspicious, one must offer sacrifices to the mountain and river spirits and the local earth deities of the tomb. By pacifying the deceased, descendants will attain peace, and all undertakings will prosper.\n\n**Offerings:**\n- Thirty-five fine mats (or, if unavailable, fresh reeds)\n- Two large mats\n- One *liang* of incense\n- One small table\n- Four incense burners\n- Thirty-five small plates\n- Five *sheng* of glutinous millet rice\n- Three *sheng* of non-glutinous rice\n- One *sheng* of millet rice\n- Seventy walnuts\n- Thirty-five dried jujubes\n- One *sheng* of chestnuts\n- Thirty-five cakes\n- Purified water, a knife, and a hoe\n- Four bamboo baskets, each twelve *chi* in length\n- One lacquered tray\n- One small rope, thirty-six *chi* long\n- One bronze mirror\n- One *dou* and two *sheng* of salt\n- One *dou* and two *sheng* of fermented beans\n\nThe above items may be adjusted according to abundance or scarcity.\n\n**Ritual Setup:**\nOn the left side of the path near the tomb, prepare a ritual platform (*tan*) measuring thirty-six *chi* square. Erect markers at the four corners. At the center of the platform, arrange seats for the deities of the Five Directions. Beyond these, set seats for the Twenty-Four Deities. At the four outer directions, place seats for the deities of the tomb paths (*qianmo*). To the left of the tomb’s front, set a seat for the *Tingzhang* (Local Warden), and to the right, a seat for the *Zhangren* (Elder of the Tomb). Each seat is furnished with one fine mat and one plate of food. The ritual coins and offerings should be adjusted according to means but must align with the numbers of the Five Phases, Four Quarters, and the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. All items must be pure and new, free from filth. Prepare them a day in advance with utmost cleanliness.\n\nOn the day of the ritual, arrange the food offerings on the southeast side of the platform. The officiant stands to the south of the platform, the invocator to the southwest, and the disciples to the east. The attendants ascend the platform, arrange the ritual coins, present the food, and place incense burners at the four corners.\n\nFirst, offer incense, bow twice, and kneel to recite the invocation.\n\nDaoist masters in monastic orders need only sit and do not bow.\n\n**Invocation:**\n*\"In this year, month, and first day of the lunar cycle, [Name], holding the office of [Title] (or, if without office, of [State, County, Village]), respectfully announces to the Earth Deity, the deities of the Five Directions and Five Phases, the myriad spirits of this land’s mountains and rivers, and the deities of this family’s tomb paths and burial mounds:*\n\n*Formerly, through divination by tortoise shell and milfoil, this mountain’s source was deemed auspicious for the interment of our deceased ancestors. With the Azure Dragon and White Tiger flanking left and right, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior facing front and rear, the tomb domain was established, its paths aligned, to endure for a thousand years and ten thousand generations, forever bound to this mountain’s source.*\n\n*Yet with the passage of time, the tomb has grown desolate. The Four Spirits have lost their guardianship, the Eight Generals lack support, and the luminous spirits of the netherworld no longer bestow their hidden blessings. Thus, in recent years, our household has been beset by hardship: all endeavors falter, fortunes dwindle, and nothing prospers. Gains turn to losses, success to failure. Wealth scatters, official matters entangle, fields yield meager harvests, silkworms fail to thrive, descendants perish young, and careers stagnate. Our distress deepens daily, and we find no relief.*\n\n*Today, with utmost sincerity, we present these humble offerings and sundry items, though our fare is modest, our devotion complete. We reverently invite the Earth Deity, the deities of the tomb, the Twenty-Four Functionaries, the messengers of the tomb paths, and all their retinues to descend to their seats in order and partake of these offerings. Your disciples bow twice.\"*\n\n**Proceed with the following in sequence:**\n- Offer incense\n- Present tea\n- Offer wine\n\n*\"With profound reverence, we once more offer to the Earth Deity and all deities: Our ancestors’ descendants, who have inherited this lineage through generations, fear the tomb’s instability and dread the extinction of our ancestral line. Today, with sincere hearts, we perform this *jiao* ritual. We humbly beseech that the deceased find peace in the netherworld, and that descendants receive blessings in the days to come.*\n\n*May this hill, lush and verdant, flourish year after year, and our family prosper generation after generation. May it align with the celestial patterns above and harmonize with the earthly principles below. May it be flanked by the Golden Treasury on the left and the Jade Hall on the right. May sons and daughters fulfill their roles, and nothing be amiss. May wealth flow from the Five Directions, and descendants enjoy riches and nobility. May careers ascend, households thrive, children be virtuous and wise, fields and silkworms yield abundance, treasures accumulate like mountains, and granaries overflow without end. May the deceased receive grace, and descendants be blessed with favor. Your disciples bow twice.\"*\n\n**Proceed with the following in sequence:**\n- Offer incense\n- Offer wine\n\n*\"With utmost sincerity, we have earnestly invited you. Now that the fragrant offerings are presented and our gratitude expressed, though our gifts are meager, our reverence is profound. We humbly receive your vast blessings and accept our modest devotion. We bow twice and offer triple thanks. Having received the ritual coins and offerings, we pray that your divine carriages return to your abodes. We entreat the Generals of the Roads to survey the paths before and behind, to expel wandering malevolent spirits, and to pacify the netherworld. May the Elder of the Tomb and the deities of the burial mounds grant tranquility, and may descendants flourish with unbroken blessings, as decreed by the statutes. Your disciples bow twice.\"*\n\nUpon completing the ritual, bury the offerings for the tomb path deities in the southeast corner of the platform. Spread the mats before the tomb, return the food plates to offer sustenance to the deceased, and recite the concluding incantation before distributing and consuming all offerings. Do not perform the *jiao* ritual on inauspicious days.\n\n**Auspicious Months for Tomb Deities:**\n- **First Month:** *Zi, Yin, Mao, Chen, Shen, Xu, Hai*\n- **Second Month:** *Zi, Hai*\n- **Third Month:** *Mao, Si, Wu, Shen, Xu, Hai*\n- **Fourth Month:** *Si, Wu, Wei, Xu, Hai*\n- **Fifth Month:** Same as the fourth\n- **Sixth Month:** *Chou, Mao, Chen, Si, Wei, Hai*\n- **Seventh and Eighth Months:** *Yin*\n- **Ninth Month:** *Zi, Chou, Yin, Chen, Wei, Xu*\n- **Tenth Month:** *Mao, Xu, Hai*\n- **Eleventh Month:** *Zi, Mao, Chen, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai*\n- **Twelfth Month:** *Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Hai*\n\nThe aforementioned earthly afflictions that harm the living are inauspicious; if the tomb lies beyond fifteen paces, there is no taboo, yet on such days, one must not perform tomb sacrifices. The *Zhengyi* tomb-*jiao* ritual concludes here.",
