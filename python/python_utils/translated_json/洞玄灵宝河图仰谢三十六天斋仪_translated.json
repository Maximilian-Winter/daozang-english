  "full_translation": "**Dongxuan Lingbao Hetu Yangxie Sanshiliu Tian Zhai Yi**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Dongxuan Lingbao Hetu Yangxie Sanshiliu Tian Zhai Yi* (The Dongxuan Lingbao Rites of the River Chart for Reverently Thanking the Thirty-Six Heavens). Four fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Ritual Dignity.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\n**1. Altar, Lamps, and Banners**\n\nThe altar platform (*shantan*) measures three *zhang* and six *chi* on each side. The outer perimeter is marked with placards for the ten directions, following the transmission rites as in external altars. Within one *chi* of the inner boundary, eight lamps are lit. The names of the thirty-two heavens are inscribed in black on white tablets, while the imperial taboo names and official titles are written in red below, arranged in the order prescribed by the scriptures.\n\nAt the center, a green banner is suspended, its length one *zhang* and six *chi*, inscribed with the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns, fifteen characters each, filling the space. The banner pole is two *zhang* and four *chi* long, secured with ropes to ensure stability.\n\nDuring the circumambulation, the number of circuits may vary as needed. For petitions, six circuits are optimal. Should there be two exceptions, the rest follow the prior model.\n\n**2. Ritual of Reverence and Thanksgiving to the Thirty-Two Heavens**\n\nAfter offering incense and reciting the prayers, face north and intone:\n\n*\"Your servants, with reverence, prostrate ourselves before the August Emperor of the Supreme Yellow and August Heaven, bowing twice in succession. Proceeding through the eight heavens, we prostrate and kowtow until the repentance is complete.\"*\n\nIn times of great calamity, the hair is loosened. The Dharma Master reads the text in a low voice; loosening the hair is not required.\n\n*\"Your servants [names] humbly address the August Emperor of the Supreme Yellow and August Heaven, invoking the taboo name, and the various spirit officials of the Purple Ultimate Palace, proceeding through the eight heavens. With sincere hearts, we beseech the Emperors of the eight heavens—those of the Northern Dipper, the Eastern Wall, the Encampment, the Rooftop, the Emptiness, the Weaving Girl, the Oxherd, and the Southern Dipper’s seven lodges in the northeast—to bestow their compassionate grace and permit a great amnesty. We pray for the absolution of the accumulated sins of past lives for the named fleshly persons, extending to our own selves, our three immediate and five ancestral generations, and our seven generations of parents, erasing all transgressions across lifetimes. Through the mercy of the three amnesties, may we offer thanks to the eight Emperors of the North. May the entanglements of our karmic offenses in life and death, the celestial nets and earthly snares, and all banishments and dispersions be dissolved. May our years be prolonged, and may we begin anew. From this day forward, may our blessed karma flourish, public and private affairs prosper, official and scholarly pursuits excel, merits be accomplished, and virtue perfected, bringing joy to our entire household. May our aspirations bear fruit, and may we receive this great benevolence.\"*\n\nUpon completion, rise together and face east, then south, then west, offering reverence and thanksgiving in the same manner as before.\n\nBy steadfastly practicing this, one may avert the disaster of great floods, perpetually preserve the lineage of humanity, and secure the joy of eternal abiding.\n\n**3. Prohibitions**\n\nDuring the mid-Yuan period of prayer, as the days accumulate, other affairs must be set aside to prepare the necessary offerings, establishing a separate place for the retreat. Outsiders are forbidden within the four boundaries; chickens and dogs must not be allowed to enter. Should they intrude, the prohibition is violated, requiring separate purification and the observance of taboo days to avoid obstacles. Only those with firm resolve should be preemptively selected.\n\nThe offerings for the retreat—cleansing, sweeping, food, and drink—must be prepared by carefully chosen individuals, not those entangled in worldly affairs. The Dharma bodies of Daoist disciples must be pure, meticulous, loyal, and trustworthy, clean and capable of service. Only those necessary for the tasks at hand should be employed; excess numbers invite excess sins. Some may fall ill or grow infirm, or encounter unforeseen public or private matters, disrupting the retreat’s continuity. Conducting a retreat is no easy task—vigilance and careful deliberation are essential.\n\nThose of like mind and numinous spirit who partake in the retreat must not leave the premises. Should outsiders arrive to procure necessities, they must remain outside the gate and not enter. Items are received at the gate and taken to a separate, purified chamber. If afflicted by illness, misfortune, or urgent matters, one may depart but must not return. Should one return, they may reach the gate but must not re-enter. Chickens and dogs are strictly forbidden, and theft must be rigorously prevented. Even close kin, though they may be Dharma bodies, are not permitted to share this retreat space.\n\n**4. Altar Lamps (Part Two)**\n\nThe altar ground must be level, spacious, and pure, measuring twelve *zhang* on each side.\n\nThe railing shall be bound with cords, and three layers of placards shall be posted. The closing of the gates follows the transmitted instructions, with the only distinction being that the three altar grounds are of varying sizes.\n\nChoose a secluded location near mountains and waters. The eighteen lamps shall be placed within the outer altar railing, approximately three *chi* from the cords, evenly aligned and firmly secured, all standing five *chi* in height. Each lamp shall hold enough oil to fill a *dou* vessel, with one incense stick per lamp, spaced six *chi* apart. The flames must burn fiercely, and the smoke must not be interrupted. Should wind or rain arise, move the lamps into the main hall, which measures two *zhang* on each side. The eighteen lamps shall be spaced roughly one *chi* apart; if any are lacking, they must be promptly replenished. On evenings without lamps, one may not perform the Daoist practices—only morning recitations, lectures, and scripture study are permitted.\n\nBeyond the ritual lamps, additional lamps may be placed as needed in other locations, their number and size determined by what one can provide.\n\n**3. Banner Inscriptions**\n\nAt the center of the altar ground, erect a sturdy, tall pole. The pole shall be made of thick bamboo, over one *chi* in circumference and four *zhang* and five *chi* in length. Hang a blue banner thirty-six *chi* long, inscribed fully with the texts of the Three Sovereigns. Affix an iron crossbar and hooks at the top, with pulleys and ropes for smooth raising and lowering, protecting it from rain and wind. The ropes must be taut, allowing the banner to be rolled and unfurled with precision. Should the ropes snap or the pole break, it is considered inauspicious. One must immediately perform repentance, confess the transgression, and seek forgiveness, then reconstruct it according to the proper method, ensuring it is sturdy and solemn.\n\nIf auspicious omens appear—such as clouds gathering or the characters of the *Shangqing* scriptures becoming perceptible—one shall offer thanks and report the blessing.\n\nOn the evening the retreat begins, arrange the hall and altar ground, set up the lamps, and raise the banner, all with meticulous order. The plain silk shall be prepared according to the method, inscribed with the texts of the Three Sovereigns, and spread upon three tables with stands on either side. Cover them with ritual cloths, leaving the top exposed during the circumambulation, then covering them afterward. Upon the retreat’s conclusion, the celestial texts shall be sent upward, the terrestrial texts buried in the altar ground, and the aquatic texts cast into flowing water, each following its respective rite.\n\n**4. Retreat Officials and Their Distinctions**\n\nThe Dharma Master, Chief Lecturer, Retreat Supervisor, Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant—six in total—shall enter the altar ground, following the previously described protocol. The only difference lies in the observance of the dispersed retreat.\n\nGiven the abundance of incense and lamps, separate officials may be appointed to manage them. These officials shall perform their prostrations outside the altar ground and not enter the hall. Their duties are solely to prepare incense, refine oil, and maintain the flames, with no more than nine individuals. It is better to have fewer but more skilled and diligent ones, all of whom must be capable, respectful, and trustworthy.\n\nBeyond these, no one else shall approach the altar hall. The Chief Lecturer and Retreat Supervisor shall consult the Dharma Master on all matters, ensuring every action is correct and clearly understood without error.\n\nShould errors occur in speech, one must immediately repent, perform rites of confession, and make vows. Failure to do so will incur divine scrutiny—let all be mindful of this.\n\n**Section Five: Differences in Overnight Assembly**\nFor the overnight assembly, meals, morning rites, and the invocation of the Dao are conducted as usual. The recitation of precepts, reading of the tablets, distribution of duties, reception by officials, and the procession with incense burners while chanting all follow the standard protocol.\n\nThe only difference lies in the roles of the Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant, who are to stand guard at the altar ground.\n\n**Section Six: Differences in the Main Retreat**\nOn the day of the main retreat, at dawn, one enters the altar ground, performs ablutions and invocations, circumambulates while chanting, engages in visualization, offers obeisance, ignites the incense burner, processes with the officials, presents incense, and makes vows—all as per the standard protocol.\n\nThe only difference is in the invocation during the presentation of incense by the officials, where the following is added: *\"To the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns.\"*\n\n**Ninefold Prostration and Confession Facing the Eastern Nine Heavens**\n*\"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the First Boundless, Formless, and Immeasurable Heavenly Emperor. We bow twice, prostrate, and kowtow five times. Upon completing the confession, all rise together.\"*\n\nIn times of great calamity or severe illness, one may prostrate with hair unbound and kowtow without striking the cheeks.\n\n*\"Your servants [Names] humbly invoke: The Most Supreme, Utterly Non-Being, Perfectly True, Unsurpassed, Non-Acting Great Dao, Responsive and Spiritually Attuned, the First Boundless, Formless, and Immeasurable Heavenly Emperor [Name withheld].*\n\n*Our present sovereign, by the profound grace of the Dao and the lingering blessings of ancestors, bears the weight of myriad affairs, ruling over countless subjects. His burdens are as vast as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and his aspirations emulate those of Yao and Shun. Having inherited this great enterprise, he constantly reflects with humility upon his own limitations. Yet the Dao and its followers decline, and the restoration of pure governance proves difficult. Without the vast protection of the heavens, how can the people attain peace? Droughts and floods bring disaster, and the common folk face countless hardships. Witnessing these afflictions, we beseech the celestial grace, hoping for the exaltation of the state and the well-being of all beings.*\n\n*Now, with utmost sincerity, we dedicate ourselves to the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrust ourselves to the Perfectly True. We humbly request that your servants establish the Great Retreat of the Three Sovereigns’ Middle Prime for supplication.*\n\n*Though we are foolish and unworthy, not fit to assist in grand designs, we dare not forget the vows we have sworn. With reverence and discipline, we follow the methods of the Cavernous Spirit. We establish the altar and arrange the positions, symbolizing the Thirty-Six Heavens; we burn incense and light lamps, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Earths. Dissolving darkness, we summon the divine, displaying the true texts for [Name], raising banners to invoke the mandate, baring our hearts and loosening our hair in repentance and renewal.*\n\n*We pray that the Heavenly Emperor bestow boundless mercy, showering limitless blessings, granting the fortune of salvation and the benevolence of rebirth. May the Dao reach the spirit-qi, harmonizing the divine officials to guard and protect [Name], absolving all past and present transgressions. May this merit extend to the spirits of [Name]’s seven ancestral temples, the nine generations and seven ancestors, and all departed kin, liberating them from suffering to ascend the halls of fortune, transforming their cycles to attain perfection, and benefiting the living.*\n\n*May the imperial mausoleums and ancestral tombs be serene, misfortunes severed, palaces and homes secure, and nightmares dispelled. May Heaven and Earth harmonize, the Seven Luminaries align in brightness, winds and rains arrive in season, warmth and coolness follow their course. May the people be at peace, weapons laid down, the realm prosperous, and barbarians submit.*\n\n*May [Name]’s afflictions and illnesses swiftly heal. Whether from official matters, theft, or other misfortunes, may all be averted—let each concern be addressed. May all calamities be overcome, and life extended. May the imperial house’s virtue flourish daily, disasters vanish from the four seas, auspicious signs gather, and the eight seasons remain harmonious. May all beings receive blessings, embrace the true teaching, and return to the natural order. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\"*\n\n*Concluded. All rise. Proceed in order to the Second Heavenly Emperor. Only the name in red differs; the rest remains the same.*\n\n*\"Your servants [Names] humbly invoke: The Most Supreme, Utterly Non-Being, Perfectly True, Unsurpassed, Non-Acting Great Dao, Responsive and Spiritually Attuned, the Second Formless Heavenly Emperor of the Pure and Subtle Realm, [Feng Ti’asha Yuejia Moxuyun Chi].*\n\n*Our present sovereign, by the profound grace of the Dao and the lingering blessings of ancestors, bears the weight of myriad affairs, ruling over countless subjects.

His burden is as weighty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and his Dao emulates that of Yao and Shun. Having inherited the great enterprise, he frequently reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. The Dao and the secular have declined, and the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the vast canopy of hidden assistance, how can the people attain tranquility? Whether afflicted by drought and flood or beset by the people’s many hardships, witnessing these plagues, he invokes the celestial favor.

The common people all dwell in peace, weapons of war fall silent, the realm attains great tranquility, and barbarous foes submit in surrender. May the afflictions and ailments of so-and-so swiftly be healed and cured. Whether in matters of official strife or banditry, may they be spared from transgression as circumstances dictate. May all calamities be dispelled, and life extended. May the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious.

After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nThe *Dongxuan Lingbao Hetu Yangxie Sanshiliu Tian Zhai Yi*, Scroll Three, concludes.\nThe *Dongxuan Lingbao Hetu Yangxie Sanshiliu Tian Zhai Yi*, Scroll Four.\n\nFacing the Nine Heavens of the North, we offer repentance.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we take refuge and entrust our lives to the Heavenly Emperor of the Twenty-Eighth Heaven, the Continuing Prime of the Void Brahma, the Indāna Heaven: **Zhusheng**, whose name is **Yuanajing Rushi Qiong**.\n\nWe, your servants, humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Twenty-Eighth Heaven, the Continuing Prime of the Void Brahma, the Indāna Heaven, whose taboo name is **Zhusheng**, and whose epithet is **Yuanajing Rushi Qiong**.\n\nThe present emperor has encountered profound grace, fortunately inheriting residual blessings, shouldering the myriad affairs of state, and ruling over the teeming multitudes. His burdens weigh as heavily as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and his Dao emulates that of Yao and Shun. Having inherited the great enterprise, he constantly reflects with trepidation upon his humble self.\n\nThe Dao among the people has declined, and the pure transformation is difficult to revive. Without the hidden support of vast shelter, how can the living beings attain ease and security? Some suffer from the disasters of drought and flood, while others endure manifold hardships among the common folk. Witnessing these afflictions, we beseech the celestial grace, that the altars of state be exalted and the myriad people and creatures flourish in abundance.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we turn toward the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrust our lives to the Perfected. We humbly beseech that we, your servants, may establish the Great Fast of the Three Sovereigns’ Middle Prime for supplication.\n\nWe, your servants, are truly foolish and dull, unworthy to assist in grand designs. Yet mindful of our undeserved favor and fearful of betraying our sworn covenant, we earnestly purify ourselves and adhere to the methods of the Cavernous Spirit. We erect the sacred altar and arrange the ritual stations, emulating the thirty-six heavens; kindling incense and lighting lamps, we respond to the thirty-six earthly realms. Dispelling darkness and gloom, we summon the divine luminaries. On behalf of so-and-so, we display the true scriptures, unfurl the banners to invoke the mandate, bare our hearts and loosen our hair, repenting of transgressions and renewing ourselves.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Heavenly Emperor to bestow boundless compassion, to pour forth inexhaustible grace, to extend salvific blessings, and to grant the benevolence of rebirth. May the Dao reach the divine qi, harmonizing the spirit-officials, guarding and protecting so-and-so’s person, absolving and pardoning the immeasurable sins of past and present, and commending the sincerity of this moment’s repentance and reform.\n\nThrough these meritorious deeds, may the blessings flow to the spirits of so-and-so’s seven ancestral temples, to the nine depths and seven generations, and to all departed forebears, that they may together escape the sufferings of darkness, ascend to the halls of fortune, achieve perfection through the turning wheel, and bring benefit and protection to the living. May the imperial mausolea and tombs be serene and undisturbed, misfortunes severed and averted, palaces and dwellings secure and tranquil, and nightmares dispelled.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite in harmony, the seven luminaries align in brightness, wind and rain arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common folk all enjoy peace, weapons fall silent, the realm attain great tranquility, and barbarous foes submit in surrender. May so-and-so’s afflictions and illnesses swiftly be cured. Whether in matters of officialdom or banditry, may all transgressions be averted as circumstances dictate. May all calamities be overcome, and lifespans extended.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, all embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nWe, your servants, humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Twenty-Ninth Heaven, the Boundless Purple Void of the Great Ultimate, the Dark and Mysterious Brahma of the Vajra Heaven: **Xuanyu**, whose name is **He Apang Xuegu Ping**.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Heavenly Emperor Lord bestow great merciful kindness, pour forth boundless grace, extend salvific blessings, and grant the benevolence of renewal. May the Dao reach the spirit-qi, harmonizing the numinous officials, guarding and protecting this body, pardoning and absolving all past and present transgressions without limit, and cherishing the sincere repentance now offered.\n\nThrough these meritorious virtues, may the spirits of our seven ancestral temples, the nine lineages and seven generations of ancestors, and all departed kin together escape the sufferings of darkness, ascend to the Hall of Blessings, attain perfection through the Turning Wheel, and bring benefit and protection to the living. May imperial mausolea and ancestral tombs be solemn and tranquil, misfortunes and karmic retributions cease, palaces and dwellings remain secure, and ominous dreams vanish.\n\nWhen the Two Modes [Heaven and Earth] intermingle in harmony, the Seven Luminaries will align in brightness, winds and rains arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all dwell in peace, weapons fall silent, the realm enjoy great tranquility, and rebellious foes submit. May the afflictions and illnesses of this petitioner swiftly be cured. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may all perils be averted as circumstances require. May all calamities be overcome, and lifespans extended.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, all embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-First Heaven, the Mysterious Brahma of the Great Practice, the Boundless and Unshadowed, the Wisdom of Non-Attachment: **Xuantan**, whose name is **Qiyidan A**, the **Dingshi Yinjie Ronghe**.\n\nWe note that the present emperor has encountered profound grace, fortunately inheriting residual blessings, shouldering the myriad affairs of state, ruling over the multitudes, bearing the weight of lofty mountains, and emulating the Dao of Yao and Shun. Having inherited this great enterprise, he constantly reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. Yet the Dao and its customs decline, and the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the vast sheltering canopy of Heaven’s aid, how can the people attain peace and security? Whether afflicted by drought and flood or beset by manifold hardships, upon witnessing these calamities, we knock upon Heaven’s mercy. We yearn for the exaltation of the altars of state and the prosperity of all people and creatures.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we turn toward the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrust ourselves to the Perfected. We, your servants, have convened the Great Retreat of the Three Sovereigns’ Middle Prime to offer these prayers. Though we are truly foolish and dull, unworthy to assist in grand designs, we recall our past presumption and dare not betray the oaths we have sworn. With reverent diligence, we follow the methods of the *Dongshen*. We establish the sacred altar and arrange the ritual stations, symbolizing the Thirty-Six Heavens; we burn incense and light lamps, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Earths. Dissolving the darkness of the unseen, we summon the divine spirits. For this petitioner, we display the true scriptures, raise the banners to invoke the mandate, bare our hearts and loosen our hair, repenting of past wrongs and renewing ourselves.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Heavenly Emperor Lord bestow great merciful kindness, pour forth boundless grace, extend salvific blessings, and grant the benevolence of renewal. May the Dao reach the spirit-qi, harmonizing the numinous officials, guarding and protecting this body, pardoning and absolving all past and present transgressions without limit, and cherishing the sincere repentance now offered.\n\nThrough these meritorious virtues, may the spirits of our seven ancestral temples, the nine lineages and seven generations of ancestors, and all departed kin together escape the sufferings of darkness, ascend to the Hall of Blessings, attain perfection through the Turning Wheel, and bring benefit and protection to the living. May imperial mausolea and ancestral tombs be solemn and tranquil, misfortunes and karmic retributions cease, palaces and dwellings remain secure, and ominous dreams vanish.\n\nWhen the Two Modes [Heaven and Earth] intermingle in harmony, the Seven Luminaries will align in brightness, winds and rains arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all dwell in peace, weapons fall silent, the realm enjoy great tranquility, and rebellious foes submit. May the afflictions and illnesses of this petitioner swiftly be cured. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may all perils be averted as circumstances require. May all calamities be overcome, and lifespans extended.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, all embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-First Heaven of Mysterious Brahma, the Great Practice of Non-Action and Non-Attachment: **Xuanyi**, whose name is **Tan A**, the **Dingshi Yinjie Ronghe**.\n\nMay the imperial mausoleums and ancestral tombs be solemn and at peace, all misfortunes and calamities severed, palaces and residences secure and stable, and strange dreams dispelled. When the Two Modes harmonize, the Seven Luminaries align in brightness, wind and rain arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all be at ease, weapons laid down, the realm attain great peace, and barbarous foes submit in surrender. May the afflictions and illnesses of Your servants be swiftly healed. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may they escape harm as circumstances dictate. May all disasters be transcended, and lifespans extended.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, all embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-Second Heaven of Cloud Brahma’s Upper Realm of Radiant Light and Alaya: **Weiguang**, whose name is **Zhongyun Xunbo**, the **Zhongbao Shuruo Laihua**.\n\nThe present emperor, having encountered profound grace and relied upon accumulated blessings, now shoulders the myriad affairs of state, ruling over countless subjects. His burden is as weighty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, yet his Dao emulates that of Yao and Shun. Having inherited the great enterprise, he constantly reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. The Dao and its customs have declined, and the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the vast sheltering protection, how can the people attain peace and security? Whether afflicted by drought or flood, or beset by the manifold hardships of the common folk, he beholds these plagues and pestilences and thus invokes the celestial favor. Hoping for the exaltation of the altars of soil and grain and the well-being of all people and creatures, he now directs his utmost sincerity toward the Great Dao, takes refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrusts his fate to the Utmost Perfection. He has summoned your servants to establish the Great Offering of the Three Sovereigns’ Middle Prime for supplication.\n\nYour servants, though sincere yet foolish, sincere yet dull, are unworthy to assist in grand plans. Yet mindful of the grace already received, we dare not betray the oaths sworn at our initiation. With utmost reverence, we adhere to the methods of the *Dongshen*. We erect the altar and arrange the positions, symbolizing the Thirty-Six Heavens; we burn incense and light lamps, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Earths. We dispel the darkness of the unseen, summon the divine luminaries, display the true scriptures on behalf of Your servants, raise the banners to invoke the mandate, bare our hearts and loosen our hair, repent our transgressions, and renew ourselves. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Emperor to bestow the great mercy of boundless grace, extend the blessings of salvation, and grant the benevolence of rebirth. May the Dao reach the qi of the spirits, harmonizing the numinous officials to guard and protect Your servants’ persons, absolving the immeasurable sins of past and present, and rewarding the sincerity of our present repentance.\n\nThrough these meritorious deeds, may the spirits of Your servants’ seven ancestral temples, the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, and all departed kin alike be delivered from the sufferings of the dark realms, ascend to the halls of fortune, attain perfection through the turning of the Wheel, and receive blessings and protection in the present. May the imperial mausoleums and ancestral tombs be solemn and at peace, all misfortunes and calamities severed, palaces and residences secure and stable, and strange dreams dispelled. When the Two Modes harmonize, the Seven Luminaries align in brightness, wind and rain arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all be at ease, weapons laid down, the realm attain great peace, and barbarous foes submit in surrender. May the afflictions and illnesses of Your servants be swiftly healed. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may they escape harm as circumstances dictate. May all disasters be transcended, and lifespans extended.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-Third Heaven of Formless Mystery and Pure Purity’s Cavernous Subtlety and Ripple Response: **Wuse Xuanging Dongwei Poli Dahe**, whose name is **Wang Lingyin**, the **Huangyuan Yuanli Yun’a**.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish day by day, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain peaceful and harmonious.

Four fascicles. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Ritual Dignity.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\n**1. Altar, Lamps, and Banners**\n\nThe altar platform (*shantan*) measures three *zhang* and six *chi* on each side. The outer perimeter is marked with placards for the ten directions, following the transmission rites as in external altars. Within one *chi* of the inner boundary, eight lamps are lit. The names of the thirty-two heavens are inscribed in black on white tablets, while the imperial taboo names and official titles are written in red below, arranged in the order prescribed by the scriptures.\n\nAt the center, a green banner is suspended, its length one *zhang* and six *chi*, inscribed with the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns, fifteen characters each, filling the space. The banner pole is two *zhang* and four *chi* long, secured with ropes to ensure stability.\n\nDuring the circumambulation, the number of circuits may vary as needed. For petitions, six circuits are optimal. Should there be two exceptions, the rest follow the prior model.\n\n**2. Ritual of Reverence and Thanksgiving to the Thirty-Two Heavens**\n\nAfter offering incense and reciting the prayers, face north and intone:\n\n*\"Your servants, with reverence, prostrate ourselves before the August Emperor of the Supreme Yellow and August Heaven, bowing twice in succession. Proceeding through the eight heavens, we prostrate and kowtow until the repentance is complete.\"*\n\nIn times of great calamity, the hair is loosened. The Dharma Master reads the text in a low voice; loosening the hair is not required.\n\n*\"Your servants [names] humbly address the August Emperor of the Supreme Yellow and August Heaven, invoking the taboo name, and the various spirit officials of the Purple Ultimate Palace, proceeding through the eight heavens. With sincere hearts, we beseech the Emperors of the eight heavens—those of the Northern Dipper, the Eastern Wall, the Encampment, the Rooftop, the Emptiness, the Weaving Girl, the Oxherd, and the Southern Dipper’s seven lodges in the northeast—to bestow their compassionate grace and permit a great amnesty. We pray for the absolution of the accumulated sins of past lives for the named fleshly persons, extending to our own selves, our three immediate and five ancestral generations, and our seven generations of parents, erasing all transgressions across lifetimes. Through the mercy of the three amnesties, may we offer thanks to the eight Emperors of the North. May the entanglements of our karmic offenses in life and death, the celestial nets and earthly snares, and all banishments and dispersions be dissolved. May our years be prolonged, and may we begin anew. From this day forward, may our blessed karma flourish, public and private affairs prosper, official and scholarly pursuits excel, merits be accomplished, and virtue perfected, bringing joy to our entire household. May our aspirations bear fruit, and may we receive this great benevolence.\"*\n\nUpon completion, rise together and face east, then south, then west, offering reverence and thanksgiving in the same manner as before.\n\nBy steadfastly practicing this, one may avert the disaster of great floods, perpetually preserve the lineage of humanity, and secure the joy of eternal abiding.\n\n**3. Prohibitions**\n\nDuring the mid-Yuan period of prayer, as the days accumulate, other affairs must be set aside to prepare the necessary offerings, establishing a separate place for the retreat. Outsiders are forbidden within the four boundaries; chickens and dogs must not be allowed to enter. Should they intrude, the prohibition is violated, requiring separate purification and the observance of taboo days to avoid obstacles. Only those with firm resolve should be preemptively selected.\n\nThe offerings for the retreat—cleansing, sweeping, food, and drink—must be prepared by carefully chosen individuals, not those entangled in worldly affairs. The Dharma bodies of Daoist disciples must be pure, meticulous, loyal, and trustworthy, clean and capable of service. Only those necessary for the tasks at hand should be employed; excess numbers invite excess sins. Some may fall ill or grow infirm, or encounter unforeseen public or private matters, disrupting the retreat’s continuity. Conducting a retreat is no easy task—vigilance and careful deliberation are essential.\n\nThose of like mind and numinous spirit who partake in the retreat must not leave the premises. Should outsiders arrive to procure necessities, they must remain outside the gate and not enter. Items are received at the gate and taken to a separate, purified chamber. If afflicted by illness, misfortune, or urgent matters, one may depart but must not return. Should one return, they may reach the gate but must not re-enter. Chickens and dogs are strictly forbidden, and theft must be rigorously prevented. Even close kin, though they may be Dharma bodies, are not permitted to share this retreat space.\n\n**4. Altar Lamps (Part Two)**\n\nThe altar ground must be level, spacious, and pure, measuring twelve *zhang* on each side.",

      "translated_text": "The railing shall be bound with cords, and three layers of placards shall be posted. The closing of the gates follows the transmitted instructions, with the only distinction being that the three altar grounds are of varying sizes.\n\nChoose a secluded location near mountains and waters. The eighteen lamps shall be placed within the outer altar railing, approximately three *chi* from the cords, evenly aligned and firmly secured, all standing five *chi* in height. Each lamp shall hold enough oil to fill a *dou* vessel, with one incense stick per lamp, spaced six *chi* apart. The flames must burn fiercely, and the smoke must not be interrupted. Should wind or rain arise, move the lamps into the main hall, which measures two *zhang* on each side. The eighteen lamps shall be spaced roughly one *chi* apart; if any are lacking, they must be promptly replenished. On evenings without lamps, one may not perform the Daoist practices—only morning recitations, lectures, and scripture study are permitted.\n\nBeyond the ritual lamps, additional lamps may be placed as needed in other locations, their number and size determined by what one can provide.\n\n**3. Banner Inscriptions**\n\nAt the center of the altar ground, erect a sturdy, tall pole. The pole shall be made of thick bamboo, over one *chi* in circumference and four *zhang* and five *chi* in length. Hang a blue banner thirty-six *chi* long, inscribed fully with the texts of the Three Sovereigns. Affix an iron crossbar and hooks at the top, with pulleys and ropes for smooth raising and lowering, protecting it from rain and wind. The ropes must be taut, allowing the banner to be rolled and unfurled with precision. Should the ropes snap or the pole break, it is considered inauspicious. One must immediately perform repentance, confess the transgression, and seek forgiveness, then reconstruct it according to the proper method, ensuring it is sturdy and solemn.\n\nIf auspicious omens appear—such as clouds gathering or the characters of the *Shangqing* scriptures becoming perceptible—one shall offer thanks and report the blessing.\n\nOn the evening the retreat begins, arrange the hall and altar ground, set up the lamps, and raise the banner, all with meticulous order. The plain silk shall be prepared according to the method, inscribed with the texts of the Three Sovereigns, and spread upon three tables with stands on either side. Cover them with ritual cloths, leaving the top exposed during the circumambulation, then covering them afterward. Upon the retreat’s conclusion, the celestial texts shall be sent upward, the terrestrial texts buried in the altar ground, and the aquatic texts cast into flowing water, each following its respective rite.\n\n**4. Retreat Officials and Their Distinctions**\n\nThe Dharma Master, Chief Lecturer, Retreat Supervisor, Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant—six in total—shall enter the altar ground, following the previously described protocol. The only difference lies in the observance of the dispersed retreat.\n\nGiven the abundance of incense and lamps, separate officials may be appointed to manage them. These officials shall perform their prostrations outside the altar ground and not enter the hall. Their duties are solely to prepare incense, refine oil, and maintain the flames, with no more than nine individuals. It is better to have fewer but more skilled and diligent ones, all of whom must be capable, respectful, and trustworthy.\n\nBeyond these, no one else shall approach the altar hall. The Chief Lecturer and Retreat Supervisor shall consult the Dharma Master on all matters, ensuring every action is correct and clearly understood without error.",

Dispelling the shadows of darkness, we summon the divine luminaries.

May the Dao reach and the spirit-qi harmonize, uniting the numinous officials to guard and protect so-and-so’s person, absolving and pardoning all past and present sins without measure, and rewarding the sincerity of this moment’s repentance.\n\nThrough these meritorious deeds, may the spirits of so-and-so’s seven ancestral temples, the nine lineages and seven generations of forebears, and all departed ancestors alike be delivered from the sorrows of darkness, ascend to the halls of fortune, attain transformation into perfection, and receive blessings in the present. May the imperial mausoleums and tombs be serene, misfortunes severed, palaces and dwellings secure, and ominous dreams dispelled. As heaven and earth unite in harmony, may the seven luminaries align in brightness, winds and rains arrive in season, warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people enjoy peace, weapons fall silent, the realm attain great tranquility, and rebellious foes submit. May so-and-so’s afflictions and ailments swiftly be cured. Whether entangled with officials, thieves, or other adversities, may all be spared and resolved according to circumstance. May all calamities be transcended, and life prolonged.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, disasters across the four seas vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Thearch in perfection.\n\nYour ministers now reverently address the *Taishang Wuwu Zhi Zhen* (Supreme Vastness of the Utmost Perfected), the *Wushang Wuwei Da Dao Yinggan Zhenjing* (Responsive Essence of the Unsurpassed, Non-Acting Great Dao), the *Fifteenth Flying Brahma-Realm Perfected of the Upper Mystery*, the *Heavenly Thearch of Virtue and Blessing*, whose sacred name is *Wang Weibo Li* and whose divine epithet is *Boyini Fan Baozhen*.\n\nWe note that the present emperor has encountered profound grace, fortunately inheriting residual blessings. Charged with the myriad affairs of state, he governs the teeming multitudes, bearing burdens as weighty as Mount Song and emulating the Dao of Yao and Shun. Having inherited the great enterprise, he constantly reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. As the Dao and the secular decline, the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the hidden support of vast shelter, how may the living attain tranquil peace? Some suffer calamities of drought and flood; others endure manifold hardships among the people. Witnessing these afflictions, we implore the celestial grace, hoping for the exaltation of the altars of soil and grain and the well-being of all creatures.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we turn toward the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Thearch, and entrust ourselves to the Perfected.

May the Dao reach the spirit-qi, harmonizing the numinous officials, guarding and protecting this body, pardoning and absolving all past and present transgressions without limit, and cherishing the sincere repentance now offered.\n\nThrough these meritorious virtues, may the spirits of our seven ancestral temples, the nine lineages and seven generations of ancestors, and all departed kin together escape the sufferings of darkness, ascend to the Hall of Blessings, attain perfection through the Turning Wheel, and bring benefit and protection to the living. May imperial mausolea and ancestral tombs be solemn and tranquil, misfortunes and karmic retributions cease, palaces and dwellings remain secure, and ominous dreams vanish.\n\nWhen the Two Modes [Heaven and Earth] intermingle in harmony, the Seven Luminaries will align in brightness, winds and rains arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all dwell in peace, weapons fall silent, the realm enjoy great tranquility, and rebellious foes submit. May the afflictions and illnesses of this petitioner swiftly be cured. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may all perils be averted as circumstances require. May all calamities be overcome, and lifespans extended.\n\nMay the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish daily, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain harmonious. May all living beings receive blessings and felicity, all embrace the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-First Heaven, the Mysterious Brahma of the Great Practice, the Boundless and Unshadowed, the Wisdom of Non-Attachment: **Xuantan**, whose name is **Qiyidan A**, the **Dingshi Yinjie Ronghe**.\n\nWe note that the present emperor has encountered profound grace, fortunately inheriting residual blessings, shouldering the myriad affairs of state, ruling over the multitudes, bearing the weight of lofty mountains, and emulating the Dao of Yao and Shun. Having inherited this great enterprise, he constantly reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. Yet the Dao and its customs decline, and the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the vast sheltering canopy of Heaven’s aid, how can the people attain peace and security? Whether afflicted by drought and flood or beset by manifold hardships, upon witnessing these calamities, we knock upon Heaven’s mercy. We yearn for the exaltation of the altars of state and the prosperity of all people and creatures.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we turn toward the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrust ourselves to the Perfected. We, your servants, have convened the Great Retreat of the Three Sovereigns’ Middle Prime to offer these prayers. Though we are truly foolish and dull, unworthy to assist in grand designs, we recall our past presumption and dare not betray the oaths we have sworn. With reverent diligence, we follow the methods of the *Dongshen*. We establish the sacred altar and arrange the ritual stations, symbolizing the Thirty-Six Heavens; we burn incense and light lamps, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Earths. Dissolving the darkness of the unseen, we summon the divine spirits. For this petitioner, we display the true scriptures, raise the banners to invoke the mandate, bare our hearts and loosen our hair, repenting of past wrongs and renewing ourselves.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Heavenly Emperor Lord bestow great merciful kindness, pour forth boundless grace, extend salvific blessings, and grant the benevolence of renewal.

Dissolving the darkness of the unseen, we summon the divine luminaries, display the true writ for so-and-so, raise the banner to invoke the mandate, bare our hearts and loosen our hair, repenting of past transgressions and renewing ourselves.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, praying that the Heavenly Emperor may bestow great compassion, extend boundless grace, confer the blessing of salvation and deliverance, and grant the benevolence of renewal. May the Dao reach the spirit-qi, harmonizing the numinous officials, guarding and protecting so-and-so’s person, pardoning and absolving the immeasurable sins of past and present, and commending the sincerity of this present repentance and reform.\n\nThrough this merit, may it flow to the spirits of so-and-so’s seven ancestral temples, the nine generations and seven ancestors, and all departed forebears, that they may together escape the sufferings of the dark realms, ascend to the halls of fortune, revolve the wheel to attain perfection, and benefit and protect the living. May the imperial mausoleums and ancestral tombs be solemn and peaceful, the flow of misfortunes severed, the palaces and residences secure and stable, and strange dreams dispelled. May the Two Modes harmoniously interact, the seven luminaries regulate their brightness, wind and rain arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow their proper cycles. May the common people all be at ease, weapons laid down, the realm attain great peace, and barbarous foes submit in surrender. May the afflictions and illnesses of Your servants be swiftly healed. Whether entangled in official disputes or threatened by bandits, may they escape harm as circumstances dictate. May all disasters be transcended, and lifespans extended. May the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish day by day, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain peaceful and harmonious. May all living beings alike receive blessings and felicity, all submit to the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nYour servants humbly address the Most High, the Utterly Non-Being and Perfectly Real, the Unsurpassed and Non-Acting Great Dao, the Responsive and True Essence, the Heavenly Emperor of the Thirty-Sixth Heaven of Ultimate Form and Primordial Brahmanic Action’s Celestial Realm of Preceding Radiance: **Yuanyuan Zhu Jinyin Bao Zhuyang Bo**, whose name is invoked.",

      "translated_text": "With deepest reverence, we acknowledge the present Emperor, who has encountered profound grace and been favored with lingering blessings, shouldering the myriad affairs of state and ruling over countless subjects. His burden is as weighty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, yet his Dao aspires to that of Yao and Shun. Having inherited the great enterprise, he often reflects with trepidation upon his humble self. The Way and its customs have declined, and the restoration of pure transformation proves difficult. Without the vast sheltering protection, how can the living beings attain tranquil peace? Some suffer from droughts and floods, while others endure manifold hardships among the common people. Witnessing these afflictions, we beseech the celestial grace, hoping for the exaltation of the altars of state and the well-being and prosperity of all people and creatures.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we turn toward the Great Dao, take refuge in the Heavenly Emperor, and entrust our lives to the Utmost Truth. We, your servants, humbly establish the Great Retreat of the Middle Primordial Festival of the Three Sovereigns to offer our supplications. Though we are truly foolish and unworthy, unfit to assist in grand designs, we dare not betray the oaths we have sworn, mindful of the undeserved favor we have already received. Thus, we earnestly purify ourselves and adhere to the methods of the *Dongshen*. We erect the sacred altar and arrange the ritual positions, symbolizing the Thirty-Six Heavens; we burn incense and light lamps, corresponding to the Thirty-Six Earths. Dispelling the darkness of the unseen, we summon the divine spirits, displaying the true scriptures on behalf of [Name], raising the banners to invoke the mandate, baring our hearts and loosening our hair to confess our transgressions and renew ourselves.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, praying that the Heavenly Emperor will bestow great merciful kindness, shower boundless blessings, extend salvific grace, and grant the benevolence of renewal. May the Dao and the spirit-qi harmonize, and the numinous officials unite to guard and protect [Name]’s person, absolving and pardoning all past and present, infinite transgressions and faults. May they take pity and reward [Name]’s present sincerity in repentance and reform.\n\nThrough these meritorious deeds, may the blessings flow to [Name]’s seven ancestral temples, the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of forebears, and all departed kin, enabling them together to escape the sufferings of the netherworld, ascend to the halls of fortune, transform through the wheel of rebirth, and attain perfection, bringing benefit and protection to the living. May the imperial mausoleums and ancestral tombs be solemn and peaceful, the flow of misfortune severed, palaces and dwellings secure and stable, and ominous dreams dispelled. May Heaven and Earth interact harmoniously, the seven luminaries align in brightness, wind and rain arrive in due season, and warmth and coolness follow the proper nodes. May the common people live in peace, weapons of war fall silent, the realm enjoy great tranquility, and the barbarian foes submit in surrender. May [Name]’s afflictions and illnesses swiftly be cured, official troubles and bandit threats be averted as circumstances dictate, all calamities be transcended, and lifespans extended. May the imperial house’s virtue and power flourish day by day, the four seas’ disasters vanish, auspicious omens gather like clouds, and the eight seasonal nodes remain peaceful and harmonious. May all living beings alike receive blessings and felicity, all submit to the true teaching, and together return to the natural state. After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Heavenly Emperor in perfection.\n\nHere concludes the fourth fascicle of the *Dongxuan Lingbao Hetu Yangxie Sanshiliu Tian Qiyi*.",
