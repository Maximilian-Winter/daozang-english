Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Miscellaneous Arts Category*\n\n---\n\n**Poem on Guarding the One**\n\nTo attain the origin of the One—\nThe term \"One\" signifies the formless beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n*Qi* is the mysterious origin of generation and transformation;\nLaozi forcibly named it the *Dao*.\n\nThe origin of life lies in the primordial chaos before division,\nIn the boundless obscurity where no name or form exists—\nThis is called *ziran* (spontaneity).\nNo one knows what came after, nor what came before;\nIts height is unfathomable, its depth immeasurable.\nIt embraces *yin* and exhales *yang*,\nThereby manifesting the Three Luminaries.\nVast enough to encompass Heaven and Earth,\nSubtle enough to enter the tip of a hair.\nThose who comprehend this may be said to know the origin of the One.\n\nLord Lao said to Master Yin: \"I contemplate this *Dao*,\nWhich originally emerged from obscurity.\nThe foolish cannot distinguish it and claim it arises spontaneously.\"\nHe also said: \"I embrace the origin and guard the One, thereby transcending to become an immortal.\"\nThe above are all direct quotations from Lord Lao’s *Scripture of Western Ascension*.\n\nLord Lao’s *Scripture of Internal Contemplation* speaks of the origin of the One:\n\"The *Dao* cannot be seen; it is revealed through the extension of life.\nLife cannot be prolonged; it is preserved through the *Dao*.\nWhen life and the *Dao* unite as one, the divine immortal endures forever.\"\n\nTo say that life and the *Dao* unite as one is to enter the formless,\nMerging with the *Dao* into a single body.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* states:\n\"Those who cultivate this knowledge are called sages.\"\nIt also says: \"Observe the *Dao* of Heaven, grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection.\"\nAnd: \"The alternation of *yin* and *yang* is manifest in the luminous progression of images.\"\nThese are the true understandings of the mysterious origin of generation and transformation.\n\nNot received from Heaven—\nThis phrase means that those who attain the origin of the One\nCan endure hardship and solitude, still the mind and refine the body,\nNaturally causing spirit to congeal and form to dissolve,\nBones and flesh to fuse entirely.\nThey merge with the origin of transformation,\nShedding their form to divide their body,\nExiting the manifest and entering the void,\nSitting or standing in dissolution,\nSoaring through the Great Void.\n\nOnce this is known, it must be firmly guarded.\nDaily effects will respond like an echo to sound,\nLike a shadow following form.\nThere is no need to wait for heavenly beings to serve as teachers\nBefore undertaking cultivation.\nIf one encounters a master who has thoroughly penetrated this gate of the origin of transformation,\nThey may become a teacher, faithfully receiving and practicing the teachings.\nIt depends solely on the strength of one’s resolve!\n\nWhen the *Dao* is accomplished,\nOne associates with immortals and sages,\nReceives further instructions,\nOr is bestowed with divine medicines—\nThese cannot be predetermined.\n\nThe Perfection of Supreme Nonbeing—\nThis phrase describes the highest rank among celestial perfected beings.\n\nThe Immortal of the Utmost Above—\nThis phrase describes the highest rank among celestial immortals.\n\nThose who attain the origin of the One,\nEmbrace the origin and guard the One,\nAchieve the congealment of spirit and the dissolution of form,\nAscend to Jade Clarity,\nAre appointed as Perfected of the Great Mystery,\nOr are ennobled as Immortals of the Utmost Above.\nThe functions and experiences of their practice are detailed below.\n\nLight contained, shadow concealed—\nThis phrase describes the moment of attaining high perfection:\nWhen the work is complete,\nLight is first contained and shadow concealed.\nThis means bones and flesh fuse entirely,\nSpirit congeals within form—\nCalled \"Heavenly Light illuminating within.\"\nThis is the pure *yang* spirit suffusing the body,\nNaturally casting no shadow,\nHence \"shadow concealed.\"\nAt this stage of accumulated merit,\nEven if one wished to be stained by worldly dust,\nThere would be no means to do so.\n\nThe speed of response to this *Dao* depends on diligence,\nBut alas, the world lacks the talent of high immortals—\nHow could one indulge in such aspirations?\nIf one possesses the talent and encounters the right teacher,\nThis too is natural.\nThe administrators of immortals secretly assist and facilitate,\nFor the *Dao* does not betray the resolve of mortals.\n\nForm emerges spontaneously—\nThis phrase describes those who guard the One:\nThrough steadfast practice,\nLight is contained and shadow concealed,\nNaturally congealing into form within boundless obscurity.\nThus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:\n\"Suddenly, form is achieved—know that it is not eternal life.\"\nIt also states: \"Before form congeals,\nIn the midst of obscurity,\nPure *yin* harmonizes with pure *yang*,\nNot yet distinctly manifest.\"\nAnd: \"Within the formless, form arises;\nWithin the obscure and inaudible, clarity emerges.\"\nThus, one may exit the manifest and enter the void,\nDivide the body into a hundred million,\nAscend to pay homage in Jade Clarity,\nRest and feast in the Great Ultimate,\nWander the human world with a grass rope,\nOr conceal oneself from the world without distress.\n\nPerfection and tranquility are not sought—\nThis phrase means that when the *Dao* is accomplished and form congeals within the body,\nIt is not achieved through external force,\nNor can it be congealed by cleverness.\nOne must still the mind until it is no-mind,\nDissolve the body until it is no-body.\nIf there remains even a trace of body or mind,\nSpirit will not congeal.\n\nThe spirit’s enduring abode—\nWhen the work of guarding the One is complete,\nSpirit congeals,\nAnd the true form rests within the *zigong* (child’s palace).\nThe *zigong* refers to the *qi* sea in men,\nAnd the blood sea in women.\nWhen the true form abides in the *zigong*,\nIt is called \"the spirit’s enduring abode.\"\nThis is not achieved through cleverness or external force,\nBut by guarding the spirit and the One,\nAccumulating merit through steadfast practice over long years,\nBefore form is finally achieved.\n\nIn short, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:\n\"If spirit does not leave the body, lifespan is without limit.\"\nAnd: \"Conceal the person within the person without emergence,\nConceal the body within the body without manifestation—\nOnly then is the *Dao* of Heaven flourishing.\"\nIt also says: \"The mind of no-mind, the body of no-body—\nThis is called the *Dao*.\"\nIf one can prevent spirit from leaving the body,\nOne naturally endures with the *Dao* forever.\nIt further states: \"Spirit gives birth to form,\nForm in turn gives birth to spirit—\nOnly then do form and spirit unite as one.\"\n\nPure and beautiful, then true—\nThis phrase describes the moment when *yin* and *yang* harmonize,\nAt the initial congealment of spirit,\nWhen the true form becomes distinct,\nAnd transformations occur freely.\nThe *Dao*’s generation and transformation of the myriad things are likewise,\nThough not enduring.\n\nThe nature of the body is both firm and yielding—\nThis phrase describes the perfected person congealed by the *Dao*:\nAn intangible form,\nWhose nature is both firm and yielding.\n\nThe so-called \"yielding\"—nothing in the world is more yielding than darkness, and nothing is more yielding than darkness itself save the *Dao*. The *Dao*’s capacity for firmness lies in its embrace of Heaven and Earth, its permeation of the myriad things. Though metal and stone may daily grow firm and hard, all are penetrated by the *Dao*. Thus it is said: nothing in the world is more yielding than the *Dao*, and nothing is more firm than the *Dao*. The body perfected by the *Dao* can likewise penetrate metal and stone, encompass Heaven and Earth, and enter even the tiniest speck of dust.\n\n*Cinnabar Skies and Azure Wastes*—\nThis phrase refers to the domains of the Three Clarities, the celestial regions of Jade Capital and Golden Towers, where the Heavenly Worthies, Emperors, and Lords reside. Those who attain the primordial unity, who cultivate and guard it with steadfast resolve, who perfect the *Dao* and congeal spirit—all return to this realm, ascending to the highest celestial offices, becoming Heavenly Worthies, Emperors, and Lords.\n\n*The Companions of Supreme Sages*—\nThis phrase is an honorific title for the Heavenly Worthies and Emperors, the collective name for the Great Immortals of Heaven. It speaks of those who attain the primordial unity, who perfect the *Dao* and shed their mortal forms, ascending to the Jade Clarity to join the Heavenly Worthies and Emperors as their peers, no longer consorting with lesser immortals.\n\n*After a hundred years, naught remains but an empty grave mound*—\nThese lines declare that this *Dao* is the loftiest, crowning all immortals. Those who attain it naturally possess profound wisdom and far-reaching vision, unwilling to display their brilliance before the world’s eyes or adorn themselves with ostentatious splendor. Are the immortals of the middle ranks content merely to ride dragons and mount clouds, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight? The divine immortals esteem the vanishing and the hidden transformations: some replace their forms with medicinal staffs, others conceal their departure with swords and sandals, leaving behind a corpse-like semblance while their true selves withdraw in secret. Though their kin may weep in grief, their true bodies have already soared away in flying chariots to the immortal courts of the Terrace of Darkness. There, the Celestial Thearch sends jade maidens to bestow sacred elixirs, and they shed their forms entirely—is this not sublime?\n\nAlas! The people of this world, lacking even a single virtue, yet ashamed if others remain unaware, toss their heads and prance with glee. Such conduct chills the hearts of immortals and sages, for their minds are like the insects of the earth or the mushrooms of dawn—though they may strive for swiftness, they lack the means to attain it. Even the immortals of the lower realms, who still retain form, do not engage with the world, refusing all intercourse with the age—how much more so the divine immortals, whose forms are formless? After a hundred years, if you dig to look for me, you will find only the empty remnants of my robes, my sword, and my staff. Above the Jade Clarity, she is the daughter of the Heavenly Thearch.\n\n*The Precious Chapter on Guarding the One in the Great Dao*—\nThe *Dao* is non-action...\n\nThe *Scripture of the Dao* states: The supreme Dao is non-action. Non-action means abiding in emptiness and spontaneity, profound and obscure, serene and tranquil, unattached to any thing, while concentrating the mind. Thus, the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: Dismantle the limbs, cast aside brilliance, depart from form, abandon wisdom, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare. Then, inwardly, one knows not one’s own body; outwardly, one knows not heaven and earth. Desolate and indifferent, one hears no sound, sees no form—this is true non-action.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Stabilized Contemplation* says: Guard the Dao of non-action and spontaneity. Whenever a single thought arises in the mind, it must be extinguished. Only the moving mind is to be extinguished, not the illuminating mind. Simply concentrate the empty mind, not the attached mind.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Western Ascent* says: The supreme Dao nurtures the Mother. By constantly nurturing the Mother, the body endures long. The Dao takes emptiness as its Mother; emptiness takes non-action as its Mother; non-action takes spontaneity as its Mother. Spontaneity is the root of the Dao. Those who constantly nurture the root truly attain the Dao of emptiness and non-action. There is nothing it does not do.\n\nThe Dao is non-action, yet not that it does not act. To speak of guarding non-action is also to act. To speak of non-action in the Dao means that the Dao’s non-being—all things external to the body—drain my spirit and consume my nature and life. Regardless of poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness, none realize that their form and spirit are enslaved by external things, leading to decline, illness, and death. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: All in the world take beauty, sound, and flavor as the highest joy, not knowing that beauty, sound, and flavor are the great unhewn blocks of misfortune. Therefore, the sage, knowing this, does not desire and so returns to desirelessness.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* says: The myriad things and human adornments steal a person’s qi, leading to decline and aging. Laozi said to Yin Xi: The reason people treat life lightly and die early is not that heaven and earth kill them, nor that ghosts and spirits harm them, but that people bring it upon themselves—through their excessive indulgence in life. Those who do not take life as their aim are wiser than those who prize life.\n\nThe *Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: Those who comprehend the essence of life do not strive for what is unnecessary to life. Those who comprehend the essence of destiny do not strive for knowledge of what is unnecessary to destiny. How so? To nourish the form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are those whose forms are not nourished despite an abundance of things—how could this be the fault of only the foolish and unenlightened? In the world, those who speak of comprehending the Dao are many, but few put it into practice. Thus, the sage values action over words. All these examples illustrate that one should not act upon the non-being of the Dao.\n\nThis can be realized through the heart, not through the intellect. These two lines mean that the supreme Dao is formless and can only be attained through the utmost heart. Those who practice it silently perceive its effects, for it cannot be grasped by worldly wisdom or cleverness.\n\nWhat is knowing? What is realization? These two lines are reiterative. Knowing dispels intellect. This line means that after knowing, one must dispel all wisdom, concealing one’s traces and veiling one’s light. The world values the sage’s sagacity but not the sage’s foolishness. Realization responds to emptiness. To guard emptiness and non-action for long is to witness divine efficacy, like an echo responding to sound, like a shadow following form. The response arises without source. The efficacy of the supreme Dao arises from no discernible origin, yet it is so. One simply perceives that within the spontaneity of non-action, spiritual penetration and freedom naturally arise. The heart then becomes unobstructed.\n\nLaozi taught that cultivating the Dao is cultivating the heart; cultivating the heart is cultivating the Dao. The heart is the spirit of the body. When the heart is empty and practices non-action for long, it illuminates the Dao. Illuminating the Dao leads to spiritual penetration, and the spiritually penetrated person is unobstructed in all things. Simply practice to the utmost, and you will know. Being unobstructed in the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nLaozi said to the Perfected Yin: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete. How much more so for one spiritually unobstructed in the One? This means embracing the origin and guarding the One, entering formlessness, merging with the form of the formless spontaneity of emptiness, and becoming one body with it—then all affairs are complete. When this body transforms into the great, it can encompass the myriad existences of a hundred million worlds; when it transforms into the small, it can enter a single mote of dust. Within a single mote of dust, it can again contain a hundred million worlds. When spiritual penetration reaches this point, all affairs are complete.\n\nThe One is the root. Affairs are the gate. The One is the primordial root of the great Dao. Affairs refer to obtaining the One and knowing its origin, attaining the Supreme’s heart-seal. Affairs are merely the gateway to guarding the One. Affairs return to the One. The One abides eternally. These two lines mean that the myriad things are born from the One, die in the One, gain in the One, lose in the One, depart from the One, and return to the One. They also mean that in the practice of guarding the One, when the work is accomplished and one returns to the One, the body merges with the formless spontaneity of emptiness and abides eternally.\n\nThe remainder lies in the following lines. Abide without existence, provisionally speak of guarding. These two lines mean that when the One abides eternally, do not allow the self to have form. To speak of guarding is merely provisional. Thus, the *Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* says: Emptiness and stillness, purity within the void—make the form thus, and it shall not be defiled. Then you may soar and enter the cloud paths.\n\nThe remainder lies in the following meaning. Guard emptiness, and you will naturally endure long. Simply guard emptiness, and naturally the form and spirit will endure long with the Dao.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Stabilized Contemplation* says: Those who study the Dao pass through five stages of the heart:\nThe first stage: the heart is more often moved than still.\nThe second stage: the heart is more often still than moved.\nThe third stage: the heart is equally moved and still.\nThe fourth stage: when the heart is without affairs, it is still; when touched, it moves again.\nThe fifth stage: whether the heart has affairs or not, even when touched, it does not move.\n\nWhen the heart reaches this state, one can pacify the heart and focus on the mysterious, embrace the origin and guard the One, empty the form and spirit, and become as if without substance. Thereafter, when touched, the efficacy of the Dao renews daily.\n\nThose who attain the Dao pass through the heart’s five stages and enter the seven stages of the body:\nThe first stage: all chronic illnesses vanish, and the body and heart become light and joyful...\n\nThe second stage: it replenishes premature harm, restores youth and revives destiny, surpasses the common lifespan, and the complexion reverts to that of a child.\n\nThe third stage: one extends life to a thousand years and is called an immortal.\n\nThe fourth stage: one refines the body into luminous essence and is called a perfected one.\n\nThe fifth stage: one refines luminous essence into spirit and is called a spirit person.\n\nThe sixth stage: one refines spirit to merge with the Dao and is called a realized one.\n\nThe seventh stage: one transcends the Three Realms and is enthroned as the Sovereign of the Void and August Dao, the Jade Dawn Lord, whose spiritual penetration and numinous awareness encompass all things with wisdom.\n\nObserving these stages, one sees that people of this world who study the Dao their entire lives often fail to attain even one stage. Their brief, impure lives fade, their vitality withers, and they return to emptiness—yet they claim to have attained the Dao. In truth, such claims have never accorded with the universal principle.\n\n*Annotations on the Heart-Mirror of the Mystic Pearl* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "The so-called \"yielding\"—nothing in the world is more yielding than darkness, and nothing is more yielding than darkness itself save the *Dao*. The *Dao*’s capacity for firmness lies in its embrace of Heaven and Earth, its permeation of the myriad things. Though metal and stone may daily grow firm and hard, all are penetrated by the *Dao*. Thus it is said: nothing in the world is more yielding than the *Dao*, and nothing is more firm than the *Dao*. The body perfected by the *Dao* can likewise penetrate metal and stone, encompass Heaven and Earth, and enter even the tiniest speck of dust.\n\n*Cinnabar Skies and Azure Wastes*—\nThis phrase refers to the domains of the Three Clarities, the celestial regions of Jade Capital and Golden Towers, where the Heavenly Worthies, Emperors, and Lords reside. Those who attain the primordial unity, who cultivate and guard it with steadfast resolve, who perfect the *Dao* and congeal spirit—all return to this realm, ascending to the highest celestial offices, becoming Heavenly Worthies, Emperors, and Lords.\n\n*The Companions of Supreme Sages*—\nThis phrase is an honorific title for the Heavenly Worthies and Emperors, the collective name for the Great Immortals of Heaven. It speaks of those who attain the primordial unity, who perfect the *Dao* and shed their mortal forms, ascending to the Jade Clarity to join the Heavenly Worthies and Emperors as their peers, no longer consorting with lesser immortals.\n\n*After a hundred years, naught remains but an empty grave mound*—\nThese lines declare that this *Dao* is the loftiest, crowning all immortals. Those who attain it naturally possess profound wisdom and far-reaching vision, unwilling to display their brilliance before the world’s eyes or adorn themselves with ostentatious splendor. Are the immortals of the middle ranks content merely to ride dragons and mount clouds, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight? The divine immortals esteem the vanishing and the hidden transformations: some replace their forms with medicinal staffs, others conceal their departure with swords and sandals, leaving behind a corpse-like semblance while their true selves withdraw in secret. Though their kin may weep in grief, their true bodies have already soared away in flying chariots to the immortal courts of the Terrace of Darkness. There, the Celestial Thearch sends jade maidens to bestow sacred elixirs, and they shed their forms entirely—is this not sublime?\n\nAlas! The people of this world, lacking even a single virtue, yet ashamed if others remain unaware, toss their heads and prance with glee. Such conduct chills the hearts of immortals and sages, for their minds are like the insects of the earth or the mushrooms of dawn—though they may strive for swiftness, they lack the means to attain it. Even the immortals of the lower realms, who still retain form, do not engage with the world, refusing all intercourse with the age—how much more so the divine immortals, whose forms are formless? After a hundred years, if you dig to look for me, you will find only the empty remnants of my robes, my sword, and my staff. Above the Jade Clarity, she is the daughter of the Heavenly Thearch.\n\n*The Precious Chapter on Guarding the One in the Great Dao*—\nThe *Dao* is non-action...",

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of the Dao* states: The supreme Dao is non-action. Non-action means abiding in emptiness and spontaneity, profound and obscure, serene and tranquil, unattached to any thing, while concentrating the mind. Thus, the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: Dismantle the limbs, cast aside brilliance, depart from form, abandon wisdom, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare. Then, inwardly, one knows not one’s own body; outwardly, one knows not heaven and earth. Desolate and indifferent, one hears no sound, sees no form—this is true non-action.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Stabilized Contemplation* says: Guard the Dao of non-action and spontaneity. Whenever a single thought arises in the mind, it must be extinguished. Only the moving mind is to be extinguished, not the illuminating mind. Simply concentrate the empty mind, not the attached mind.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Western Ascent* says: The supreme Dao nurtures the Mother. By constantly nurturing the Mother, the body endures long. The Dao takes emptiness as its Mother; emptiness takes non-action as its Mother; non-action takes spontaneity as its Mother. Spontaneity is the root of the Dao. Those who constantly nurture the root truly attain the Dao of emptiness and non-action. There is nothing it does not do.\n\nThe Dao is non-action, yet not that it does not act. To speak of guarding non-action is also to act. To speak of non-action in the Dao means that the Dao’s non-being—all things external to the body—drain my spirit and consume my nature and life. Regardless of poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness, none realize that their form and spirit are enslaved by external things, leading to decline, illness, and death. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: All in the world take beauty, sound, and flavor as the highest joy, not knowing that beauty, sound, and flavor are the great unhewn blocks of misfortune. Therefore, the sage, knowing this, does not desire and so returns to desirelessness.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* says: The myriad things and human adornments steal a person’s qi, leading to decline and aging. Laozi said to Yin Xi: The reason people treat life lightly and die early is not that heaven and earth kill them, nor that ghosts and spirits harm them, but that people bring it upon themselves—through their excessive indulgence in life. Those who do not take life as their aim are wiser than those who prize life.\n\nThe *Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: Those who comprehend the essence of life do not strive for what is unnecessary to life. Those who comprehend the essence of destiny do not strive for knowledge of what is unnecessary to destiny. How so? To nourish the form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are those whose forms are not nourished despite an abundance of things—how could this be the fault of only the foolish and unenlightened? In the world, those who speak of comprehending the Dao are many, but few put it into practice. Thus, the sage values action over words. All these examples illustrate that one should not act upon the non-being of the Dao.\n\nThis can be realized through the heart, not through the intellect. These two lines mean that the supreme Dao is formless and can only be attained through the utmost heart. Those who practice it silently perceive its effects, for it cannot be grasped by worldly wisdom or cleverness.\n\nWhat is knowing? What is realization? These two lines are reiterative. Knowing dispels intellect. This line means that after knowing, one must dispel all wisdom, concealing one’s traces and veiling one’s light. The world values the sage’s sagacity but not the sage’s foolishness. Realization responds to emptiness. To guard emptiness and non-action for long is to witness divine efficacy, like an echo responding to sound, like a shadow following form. The response arises without source. The efficacy of the supreme Dao arises from no discernible origin, yet it is so. One simply perceives that within the spontaneity of non-action, spiritual penetration and freedom naturally arise. The heart then becomes unobstructed.\n\nLaozi taught that cultivating the Dao is cultivating the heart; cultivating the heart is cultivating the Dao. The heart is the spirit of the body. When the heart is empty and practices non-action for long, it illuminates the Dao. Illuminating the Dao leads to spiritual penetration, and the spiritually penetrated person is unobstructed in all things. Simply practice to the utmost, and you will know. Being unobstructed in the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nLaozi said to the Perfected Yin: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete. How much more so for one spiritually unobstructed in the One? This means embracing the origin and guarding the One, entering formlessness, merging with the form of the formless spontaneity of emptiness, and becoming one body with it—then all affairs are complete. When this body transforms into the great, it can encompass the myriad existences of a hundred million worlds; when it transforms into the small, it can enter a single mote of dust. Within a single mote of dust, it can again contain a hundred million worlds. When spiritual penetration reaches this point, all affairs are complete.\n\nThe One is the root. Affairs are the gate. The One is the primordial root of the great Dao. Affairs refer to obtaining the One and knowing its origin, attaining the Supreme’s heart-seal. Affairs are merely the gateway to guarding the One. Affairs return to the One. The One abides eternally. These two lines mean that the myriad things are born from the One, die in the One, gain in the One, lose in the One, depart from the One, and return to the One. They also mean that in the practice of guarding the One, when the work is accomplished and one returns to the One, the body merges with the formless spontaneity of emptiness and abides eternally.\n\nThe remainder lies in the following lines. Abide without existence, provisionally speak of guarding. These two lines mean that when the One abides eternally, do not allow the self to have form. To speak of guarding is merely provisional. Thus, the *Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* says: Emptiness and stillness, purity within the void—make the form thus, and it shall not be defiled. Then you may soar and enter the cloud paths.\n\nThe remainder lies in the following meaning. Guard emptiness, and you will naturally endure long. Simply guard emptiness, and naturally the form and spirit will endure long with the Dao.\n\nThe *Scripture of Laozi’s Stabilized Contemplation* says: Those who study the Dao pass through five stages of the heart:\nThe first stage: the heart is more often moved than still.\nThe second stage: the heart is more often still than moved.\nThe third stage: the heart is equally moved and still.\nThe fourth stage: when the heart is without affairs, it is still; when touched, it moves again.\nThe fifth stage: whether the heart has affairs or not, even when touched, it does not move.\n\nWhen the heart reaches this state, one can pacify the heart and focus on the mysterious, embrace the origin and guard the One, empty the form and spirit, and become as if without substance. Thereafter, when touched, the efficacy of the Dao renews daily.\n\nThose who attain the Dao pass through the heart’s five stages and enter the seven stages of the body:\nThe first stage: all chronic illnesses vanish, and the body and heart become light and joyful...",
