of the Inner Yellow Court: The Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs, and Methods of Tonification and Drainage**\n*Preface by Master Hu Jiāshù of the Pure Essence Sect, seen at Mount Tàibái*\n\nThe Celestial is dominated by **Yáng**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Qi** (五氣);\nThe Terrestrial is dominated by **Yīn**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Flavors** (五味).\nWhen **Qi** and flavors interact, they coalesce into the **Five Zàng-Organs** (五臟).\nThe **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs disperses into the four limbs, sixteen segments (十六部),\nand the three hundred and sixty joints (三百六十關節),\nwhile forming the sinews and vessels (筋脈),\nthe **jīn-yè** (津液) and blood marrow (血髓),\nand nurturing the Six Fǔ-Organs (六腑),\nthe Three Burners (三焦),\nand the Twelve Channels (十二經),\nall converging to permeate the nine orifices (九竅).\n\nThus, the Five Zàng-Organs are the foundation of human form.\nIf one organ is damaged, illness arises;\nIf all five are impaired, the spirit perishes.\nHence, the Five Zàng-Organs are the dwelling of **shén** (神), **míng** (明), **hún** (魂), **pò** (魄), **zhì** (志), and **jīng** (精),\neach organ presiding over its own aspect.\nTherefore:\nThe **Heart** (心) governs **shén**,\nThe **Lungs** (肺) govern **pò**,\nThe **Liver** (肝) governs **hún**,\nThe **Spleen** (脾) governs **yì** (意),\nThe **Kidneys** (腎) govern **zhì**.\n\nWhen these energies manifest externally,\nthey correspond above to the **Five Stars** (五星),\nand below to the **Five Sacred Mountains** (五嶽).\nAll are patterned after the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth,\nembodying the **symbols** of the Sun and Moon,\ntouching upon categories and drawing analogies—\ntoo vast to fully articulate.\n\nIf one can cultivate the spirit (存神),\nnourish the **Qi** (修養),\nrestrain oneself (克己),\nand strengthen resolve (勵志),\nthen the **Dao** is achieved.\n\nWhen the Five Zàng-Organs are firm and robust,\nthey resist the intrusion of **xīng-fǔ** (腥腐) toxins within,\nand external diseases and **Qi** cannot harm them.\nClarity and insight are pure,\naging is reversed and life prolonged,\nambition soars toward the **Immortal Way** (神仙),\nthe body knows no fatigue or constraint,\nwhile the **luminous essences** of the Sun and Moon (日月精光) come to adhere to my form,\nand the **Six Qi** (六氣) of the four seasons merge harmoniously with my body.\nEntering the **path of transformation** (變化之道),\npenetrating the **principles of the spirit** (神明之理),\ngrasp the interplay of **Yīn** and **Yáng** (把握陰陽),\nand breathe in the **refined spirit** (呼吸精神).\nThe **Creator** (造物者) will be turned to my own dominion.\n\nAt this stage,\nno need for **elixirs of gold and jade** (金丹玉液),\nor the **Great Return** (琅牙大還).\nNaturally, the spirit ascends to **emptiness** (神化沖虚),\n**Qi** harmonizes with **Tàihé** (氣合太和),\nand one ascends to the **Celestial River** (升雲漢).\nThe **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs coalesces into **Five Clouds** (五雲) and enters the heavens,\nleft calling forth the **Yáng-spirit** (陽神) of the **Six Jiǎ** (六甲),\nright invoking the **Yīn-spirit** (陰神) of the **Six Dīng** (六丁),\nthrough myriad transformations,\nriding the **flying clouds and winds** (驭飛輸) at will.\n\nThus, those who fail to awaken\ntoil and seek externally,\ntruly unaware of the **Dao of Life** (知生之道).\n\nTherefore, the **Tàishàng** (太上) says:\n*\"Essence is my spirit, Qi is my Dao.\nNurture the essence to preserve the Qi,\nmaintain firm and steadfast integrity,\nand let Yīn and Yáng converge\nto establish my form.\"*\n\nAlas, my innate nature is dull,\nyet from youth I have aspired to the **Mystic Gate** (玄門),\nrefining my resolve to **non-action** (無為),\ndwelling my heart in **tranquility** (澹泊).\nStudying the profound **Dao** of the *Yellow Court*,\nexhausting the remnants of the *Blue Scroll*,\nwith burning focus and meticulous effort,\nI have spent many years.\nWhen I encountered the old diagram’s hidden depths,\nits **passages** (津路) were profound and obscure,\nits words and principles esoteric—\nfew dared to follow its traces.\n\nSome merely pointed to its **colors and symbols** (色象)\nor vaguely noted the names of the spirits (神名),\nleading later generations astray,\nwhile sectarian compilers introduced erroneous doctrines.\nThus, disciples of later years rarely found its true path,\nand even slight deviations led to vast errors.\n\nNow, I dare to compile what I have observed,\nto exhaust all I have heard,\ncross-referencing the **scriptures** (經),\nand creating new diagrams.\n\nFirst, I clarify the Zàng and Fǔ-organs,\nthen expound upon cultivation methods,\nand further trace the origins of diseases,\nexpelling and absorbing **Qi** to dispel afflictions.\nAdditionally, I gather **pharmacological principles** (藥理),\n**guided movements** (導引) and **flexible extensions** (屈伸),\n**diagnostic coloration** (察色) and **evidence-seeking** (尋證),\nas well as **monthly dietary restrictions and prohibitions** (月禁食忌),\nso that future scholars,\nupon unfolding the diagram, may discern the **Six Emotions** (六情),\nand opening the **scriptures**, may reveal all **myriad truths** (萬品).\n\nWritten in the **year Wùchén of the Dàzhōng era** (大中二年戊辰).\n\n**Master Sūn Sīmiào’s Commentary** states:\n*\"Mortals receive their life from Heaven and Earth,\nthus within they possess the Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,\n**jīng** and **Qi** (精氣),\nbones and marrow (骨髓),\nsinews and vessels (筋脈),\nand externally, the four limbs and nine orifices (四肢九竅),\nskin, fur, claws, and teeth (皮毛爪齿),\nthroat, esophagus, lips, and tongue (喉咽唇舌),\nanus, and the **pāngnáng** (胖囊)—\nall these combine to form the body.\n\nThus, when **rest and activity** (將息) are regulated properly,\nthe hundred limbs are in perfect harmony,\nbut when **labor and exertion** (役用) are misapplied,\nthey lead to the **Five Strains, Seven Injuries, and Six Extremities** (五勞七傷六極).\nIf there is a method to heal, even illness has no other cause;\nif no method can be relied upon, one’s fate is sealed.\n\nTherefore, this diagram comprehensively describes\nthe Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,\nthe **roots and sources of blood and vessels** (血脈根源),\ntheir **circulation and interconnection** (循環連注),\nand the **convergence with the nine orifices** (九竅應會處所).\nIf one can **retain the mind** (留心),\nexamine and practice accordingly,\nthen all internal and external maladies have no refuge.\n\nAs for cultivation:\nThe hair should be **frequently combed** (發宜多栉),\nthe teeth **often struck** (齿宜數叩),\nthe **jīn-yè** (津液) **must be swallowed** (液宜常咽),\nthe **Qi** **must be refined** (氣宜清煉),\nand the hands **should rest upon the face** (手宜在面).\nThese five principles are what is meant by:\n*'A son who wishes not to die must cultivate Mount Kūnlún.'*\n\nFrom this arises the **refinement of elixirs** (煉丹) to fortify the body,\n**rejecting grains** (卻粒) to lighten it,\ndiscarding **earthly talismans** (土符),\nand inscribing **golden patterns** (金格).\nOne **faces Heaven and absorbs the Sun’s essence** (朝天吸日),\n**commands the Qi** (驭氣) to attain **emptiness** (沖虚)—\nthese are the arts of the **adept** (術士).\n\nThe *Yuānshǐ Tàixuān Jīng* (元始太玄經) states:\n*\"Excessive joy and anger harm one’s nature,\nand even slight indulgence in pleasure harms the spirit.\nIf the nature is impaired, life is endangered;\nIf the spirit is harmed, the body is threatened.\nThus, one must **nourish the nature** (養性) to preserve the **Qi**,\nand **protect the spirit** (保神) to calm the heart.\nWhen the **Qi** is complete, the body is balanced;\nWhen the heart is tranquil, the spirit is free—\nthis is the **mystic key** (妙訣) to preserving life.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Lung-Zàng (肺臟圖)**\n*\"To treat the Lungs, one must **swallow** (咽).\n**Swallowing** (咽) is **drainage** (泻),\n**absorbing** (吸) is **tonification** (補).\nThe Lungs are the **Metal** (金) **Lung-Zàng** (商肺),\nthe **canopy** (華蓋) of the Five Zàng-Organs,\nrooted above in the chest.\nThey have six lobes, their color like **unbleached silk** (色如缟) tinged with red.\n\nIn general, when a man reaches eighty,\nhis **Lung-Qi** (肺氣) weakens,\nand his **pò** (魄) scatters and dissipates.\nTheir weight is **three cātyīn, three liǎng** (重三斤三兩).\nThe **West** (西方) is associated with **white** (白色),\nwhich permeates the Lungs,\nopens the orifices at the **nose** (鼻),\nand manifests externally as **skin and fur** (皮毛).\nThe Lung vessels emerge at the **Lesser Commercial** point (少商).\nThe Lungs are the **source of the hundred breaths** (長氣),\nthe **foundation of all Qi** (本氣),\nand thus all **Qi** belongs to them.\nProlonged **lying down** (久臥) harms the **Qi**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Qi** (天氣) circulates through the Lungs,\nfor they are the **precise origin** (精源) of **breathing** (呼吸),\nthe **office of transmission and delivery** (傳送之官).\nThey are also the **Gate of the pò** (魄門),\nthe **Upper Jade Hall** (上玉堂).\"\n\nThe Lungs are the **office of reception and transmission** (相傳之官),\ntheir **liquid** (於液) manifests as **nasal mucus** (涕).\n**Nasal mucus** (涕) is the Lung’s **vital essence** (津液);\nwhen **Kidney evils** (腎邪) invade the Lungs, **nasal mucus** becomes excessive.\n\nThe Lungs originate on the **right** (右),\nthey govern **wheezing and coughing** (喘咳).\nAmong the **Six Fu** (六腑), the **Large Intestine** (大腸) is the Lung’s **granary** (府),\njoined with the Lungs as the **office of transmission, discharge, and guidance** (傳泻行導之府).\nOf the **Five Senses** (五官), the **nose** (鼻) is the Lung’s **orifice** (官);\nwhen the Lung-**Qi** (肺氣) flows freely, the nose discerns **fragrance and stench** (香臭).\nIf the Lungs are diseased, the nose fails to perceive **fragrance and stench**.\n\nThe Lungs connect with **skin** (皮), nourishing **hair and fur** (毛).\nWhen **skin hardens** (皮聚) and **hair falls out** (毛落), the Lungs are the first to die.\n\nThe Lungs belong to the **West** (西方), the **Jue/Metal** (兑金) phase.\nMetal receives **Qi** at the **Yin Hour** (寅),\ngenerates it at the **Si Hour** (巳),\nreigns at the **You Hour** (酉),\nfalls ill at the **Hai Hour** (亥),\ndies at the **Wu Hour** (午),\nis buried at the **Chou Hour** (丑),\nand corresponds to **Autumn** (秋日),\nthe **Geng/Xin/Regent days** (庚辛辰),\nthe **Shen/You days** (申酉),\nand the **Metal element** (金).\nTheir **tone** (聲) is **Shang** (商),\ntheir **color** (色) is **white** (白),\ntheir **taste** (味) is **spicy** (辛),\nand their **odor** (臭) is **rancid** (腥).\nWhen **Heart evils** (心邪) enter the Lungs, one loathes **rancid odors**.\n\nTheir **nature** (性) is **righteous** (義),\ntheir **emotion** (情) is **anger** (怒).\nExternally, they respond to **Mount Tai** (西岳),\nascending to **Tàibái** (太白) and receiving its **refined essence** (精).\nThey unite with the **Large Intestine** (大腸),\nand govern above the **nose** (鼻).\n\nThus, when **Lung-Wind** (肺風) afflicts a person, it causes **nasal congestion** (鼻塞).\nWhen a person’s **complexion is withered** (容色枯), the Lungs are **dry** (乾).\nWhen a person’s **nose itches** (鼻痒), the Lungs harbor **parasites** (虫).\nWhen a person is **prone to fright** (多怖), the **pò** (魄) has departed the Lungs.\nWhen a person’s **body is dark and dull** (體黨黯), the Lung-**Qi** is **weak** (微).\nWhen a person is **excessively breathy** (多氣), the Lungs are **abundant** (盛).\nWhen a person **cannot endure cold** (不耐寒), the Lungs are **exhausted** (勞).\nWhen a person **favors spicy foods** (好食辛味), the Lungs are **deficient** (不足).\nWhen a person’s **intestines rumble** (肠呜), the Lung-**Qi** is **obstructed** (壅).\nWhen a person’s **complexion is fresh and white** (颜色鮮白), the Lungs harbor no **evils** (無惡).\nIf **Lung evils** (肺邪) enter from within, one tends to **weep excessively**.\n\nSince the Lungs govern **Shang** (商), when they fall ill, one must use **coughing** (咽).\n**Coughing** (咽) is the Lung’s **Qi** (氣).\nTheir **righteous Qi** (義氣) can **draw out Lung evils** (抽肺之疾),\nthus when a person’s **chest is filled with resentment** (怨氣), causing **oppression** (填塞胸臆),\nthey must **cough deeply** (長咽) and **discharge it** (泄之),\nfor this is the **natural principle** (自然之理).\nIf one fails to **cough**, the **evils** will surely **injure and defeat** (傷敗),\nrelying on **coughing** (咽) to **preserve wholeness** (獲全).\nThus, for Lung **illnesses** (疾), one must **cough and discharge** (用咽泄之).\nIf a person **coughs without distress** (無苦而咽), this is **ominous**.\n\n**Cultivation Methods** (修養法):\nIn the **three months of Autumn** (秋三月), at the **beginning or end of the month** (朔望) and **dawn** (旭旦),\nface the **West** (西), sit upright,\n**cough seven times** (鼓七) to the **Heavenly Qi** (天氣),\n**drink three mouthfuls** (玉泉三) from the **Jade Spring** (玉泉),\nthen close the eyes, steady the mind,\nand **inhale the white Jue-Qi** (吸兑宫白氣) from the **West** (入口),\nswallowing it **seven times** (七吞),\nand **retain the breath for seventy breaths** (閉氣七十息).\nThis is to **harmonize and supplement the spirit** (調補神氣),\nand **settle the wandering pò** (息靈魄之所致).\n\n**Diagnosing Lung Diseases** (相肺脏病法):\nIf the Lung is **hot** (熱), the **right cheek** (右頬) turns **red** (赤).\nIf the Lung is diseased, the **complexion is pale** (色曰) and **hair withered** (毛槁),\nwith **wheezing and coughing** (喘咳逆),\n**discomfort and pain in the chest, back, and limbs** (胸背及四肢煩疼),\nor dreams of **beautiful women suddenly arriving to be intimate** (美人乍來親近).\nIf the Lungs are **empty** (虛), one has **shortness of breath** (少氣) and **cannot exhale fully** (不能報息).\nIf the Lungs are **dry** (燥), the **throat is parched** (喉乾).\nIf **Lung-Wind** (風) afflicts, one **sweats profusely** (多汗) and **fears the wind** (畏風),\nwith **frequent coughing** (時欲咳) like **breathing difficulties** (氣喘),\nbetter in the **morning** (日一則善),\nworse in the **evening** (暮則甚).\nIf **Lung-Qi** (肺氣) **rises in reverse** (上逆), one must **consume bitter foods** (急食苦) to **discharge it** (泄之).\nIt is also said:\nWhen the Lungs are diseased and **tend to collapse** (欲收), one must **consume sour foods** (食酸以收之),\nuse **spicy** (辛) to **supplement** (補之),\nand **bitter** (苦) to **discharge** (泻之).\n**Avoid cold foods**, for the Lungs **detest cold**.\n\nIf the Lungs are diseased, the **nose is congested** (鼻塞不通),\n**cannot perceive fragrance or stench** (不聞香臭),\nor **polypi** (瘟肉) form,\nor **sores** (疮) arise,\nwith **itchy skin** (皮膚癢痒),\n**loathsome sores and scabies** (惡疮疥癬),\n**rising Lung-Qi** (上氣) causing **coughing** (咳嗽),\nand **nasal mucus mixed with pus and blood** (涕唾脓血),\none should **administer the Pái Fēng Sǎn prescription** (宜服排風散方):\n\n**Ren Shen** (人參) – seven parts\n**Fáng Fēng** (防風) – eight parts\n**Qiāng Huó** (羌活) – eight parts\n**Shā Shēn** (沙參) – five parts\n**Tiān Xióng** (天雄) – eight parts\n**Shǔ Pián** (薯苹) – ten parts\n**Dān Shēn** (丹參) – seven parts\n**Kǔ Shēn** (苦參) – eight parts\n**Qín Huāng** (秦荒) – eight parts\n**Shān Zhū Yú** (山茱萸) – eight parts\n**Xuán Shēn** (玄參) – seven parts\n**Pound into powder** (右捣篩為末),\n**take on an empty stomach** (空腹) with **Fáng Fēng broth** (防風湯),\n**three qián, one sháo** (下三錢一匕).\n\n**Method for Regulating the Six Lung-Qi** (治肺六氣法):\nUse **coughing and inhaling** (吐納用咽法),\nwith **gentle nasal inhalation** (以鼻微長引氣),\nand **swallowing through the mouth** (以口咽之),\n**ensuring the ears do not hear** (勿令耳聞).\nFirst, **adjust the Qi** (調氣) and **order it** (令和),\nthen **swallow** (咽之).\nFor Lung **illnesses** (病), use **deep coughing thirty times** (大咽三十遍),\nand **gentle swallowing thirty times** (細咽三十遍),\nto **eliminate Lung evils** (去肺家勞),\n**rising heat** (熱上氣), **coughing** (咳嗽),\n**itchy skin** (皮膚癢痒),\n**limb fatigue and discomfort** (四肢勞煩),\nand **nasal coldness** (鼻寒) with **chest and back pain** (胸背疼痛).\nFollow the method; when the **illness abates** (疾差), cease.\n**Overdoing it** (過度) will **harm** (损).\n\n**Monthly Dietary Restrictions** (月禁食忌法):\nIn the **seventh month** (七月), **avoid eating Shan Zhu Yu** (勿食茱萸),\nfor consuming it causes **bloody dysentery** (血痢).\nIn the **eighth and ninth months** (八月、九月),\n**avoid eating too much raw ginger** (勿多食生姜),\nfor it **aggravates Liver, Heart, and Lung diseases** (並肝心肺之病).\nIt is fitting to **consume millet and peaches** (宜食黍桃),\nand **forbid bitter tastes**.\n\n**Lung Organ Guidance Method** (肺脏导引法):\nPerform in the **seventh, eighth, and ninth months** (七月八月九月行之).\nSit upright,\nplace both hands on the ground,\n**curl the body** (縮身) and **bend the spine** (曲脊),\n**lift upward three times** (向上三舉) to **remove Lung evils** (去肺家風邪积勞).\n**Pound the fists against the upper back** (反拳槌背上),\n**three to five times on each side** (左右各三五度),\nto **expel chest and diaphragm Wind evils** (去胸臆问風毒),\nand **retain the breath** (閉氣為之).\nUpon completion, **close the eyes for a long while** (良久閉目),\n**swallow three times** (三咽掖),\n**knock the teeth together three times** (三叩齿),\nand **rest**.\n\nThe Heart’s correspondences lie with the **pulse**, its **honor** being its color.\nWhen the Heart’s pulse is **depleted and scant**, failing to nourish the **zàng-fu organs**, the Heart dies first.\n\nIt governs the **south**, the **summer season**, the **celestial stems** *bing* and *ding*, the **earthly branches** *chen* and *wu*, **fire**, the **zhi voice**, the **red hue**, the **bitter taste**, its **odor** is **burnt**, its **virtue** is **propriety**, its **emotion** is **joy**.\nExternally, it corresponds to **Southern Mount**, ascending to commune with the **precise essence of Mars**.\nThe Heart merges with the **small intestine**, governing its **blood and pulse**, ascending to govern the **tongue**.\nThus, when a person’s **Heart Wind** arises, the **tongue retracts** and speech is lost.\nWhen **blood stagnates**, the **Heart is startled**.\nWhen the **tongue discerns no flavors**, the **Heart is vacuous**.\nWhen one **forgets much**, the **Heart’s spirit is detached**.\nWhen speech is **repetitive**, the **Heart is disordered**.\nWhen one is **excessively sorrowful**, the **Heart is injured**.\nWhen one **cravs bitter tastes**, the **Heart is deficient**.\nWhen the **face is green-black**, the **Heart is frozen**.\nWhen the **complexion is ruddy and fair**, the **Heart harbors no vice**.\n\nWhen **Lung evils invade the Heart**, speech becomes **prolific**.\nThe Heart governs the **zhi voice**; when the Heart is diseased, one must use the **method of exhalation (he)**.\n**Exhalation (he)** is the Heart’s **qi**; its **virtue** is propriety.\nExhalation can **calm the Heart** and **harmonize the spirit**.\nThus, those in **confusion and disorder** often exhale—\nthis is the **natural breath of Heaven**.\nHence, when the Heart is diseased, exhalation must be employed to **drain it**.\n\n---\n**Cultivation Method**:\nIn the **fourth and fifth months**, at the **new moon’s dawn**, face south and sit upright.\n**Strike the Golden Beam nine times** (叩金梁),\n**rinse the Jade Spring three times** (漱玉泉),\nand **meditate quietly**, inhaling the **crimson qi of the *Li Gong*** through the mouth,\nswallowing it **three times**.\nHold the breath for **thirty breaths** to **restore the loss from exhalation**.\n\n---\n**Diagnosing Heart Organ Diseases**:\nWhen the Heart is **hot**, the **complexion is red** and the **pulse overflows**.\nWhen the Heart is diseased, the **face first reddens**, **ulcers form in the mouth** and rot,\npain radiates through the **chest, shoulders, ribs, back, and inner arms**.\nSome dream of **a red-clad figure wielding a red blade and fire** to terrify them.\nWhen the Heart is **vacuous**, pain **draws the chest, abdomen, and waist together**.\n\nIt is also said:\nWhen the Heart is diseased, it **yearns for moisture**—\nurgently consume **salty foods to moisten it**,\nuse **bitter** to **supplement it**,\nuse **sweet** to **drain it**.\nAvoid **damp garments and hot foods**; the Heart **abhors heat and water**.\n\nWhen the Heart is diseased, **dynamic qi** appears **above the navel**.\nPressing it feels **firm and painful**; the patient is **agitated and restless**.\nWhen the Heart is diseased, the **palms and soles are hot**.\n\nIf the Heart is diseased:\nThe **mouth is dry**, the **tongue stiff**, the **throat and mouth painful**,\nswallowing is **difficult**, **ulcers form in the mouth**,\none **forgets what came before and after**, and dreams of **furnaces and forges**.\n**Five-Parameter Pill** is indicated:\n**Xinjiang Aster (秦艽)** – 7 parts\n**Ginseng (人参)** – 7 parts\n**Salvia Root (丹参)** – 7 parts\n**Scrophularia (玄参)** – 10 parts\n**Dried Ginger (干姜)** – 10 parts\n**Glutinous Millet (沙参)** – 5 parts\n**Ziziphus Spines (酸枣仁)** – 8 parts\n**Kudzu Root Powder (苦参粉)** – 8 parts\n**Pulverize and sift**, mix into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**.\nTake **20 pills** in **empty stomach with ginseng decoction**, twice daily.\n\n---\n**Six Qi Method**:\nTo treat Heart diseases, use the **exhalation (he) method**:\nGradually draw breath through the **nose**, then exhale through the **mouth**,\nadjusting the **qi** as above—**do not let the sound reach the ears**—\nthen exhale forcefully.\n\nWhen the Heart is diseased, perform **three deep exhalations**, followed by **ten gentle exhalations**,\nto **dispel Heart labor-heat and all agitation**.\nWhen the illness abates, **stop**; overuse **harms**.\n\n---\n**Taboos During Lunar Eclipses**:\nIn the **fourth month**, avoid **garlic**—\nit **prematurely whitens hair** and causes **hair loss**.\nIn the **fifth month**, avoid **leeks**—\nthey **injure Heart qi** and are **toxic**; also avoid **Heart and Kidney foods**.\n\nWhen the Heart **aches**, consume **wheat, barley, and lotus seeds**; avoid **salty foods**.\n\n---\n**Heart Organ Guidance Method** (to be practiced in the **fourth and fifth months**):\nSit upright, clench both hands into **fists**, and **pound the chest** **five to six times** on each side.\nAlternatively, sit upright and **raise one arm upward**, striking the air as if **lifting a heavy stone**.\nThen, **clasp both hands tightly** and **stomp on them with the feet**, **five to six times**.\nThis **expels Wind evils from the Heart and chest**.\nHold the breath during the exercise.\nUpon completion, **close the eyes for a long while**, **swallow saliva three times**, and **knock the teeth together three times** before resting.\n\n---\n**Liver Organ Diagram**:\nTo treat the Liver, use the **inhale-exhale (xū) method**—\n**exhalation (xū)** drains, **inhalation** supplements.\n\nThe Liver is the **Wood Palace**, residing **left-lower and near the Heart**, with **three lobes on the left** and **four on the right**, its hue like **white silk, patterned like tongs**.\nBy age **sixty**, a man’s **Liver qi declines**, the **lobes thin**, the **gallbladder fades**, and **vision dims**.\n\nWeighing **four *liang* and four *two-liang*** (十二两),\nits **bundle-direction** is **east**, its **color green**, penetrating the **Liver**, opening at the **eyes**, manifesting in the body as **sinews**.\nThe Liver’s pulse emerges from **Mù** (木),\nits color **green and lustrous**, symbolizing **superimposed large and small**.\nThe Liver is the **source of exhaustion**, the **dwelling of the soul (hun)**.\nIts **fluid** is **tears**; when **Kidney evils invade the Liver**, **tears flow excessively**.\n\nThe **gallbladder**, a **fu organ**, is the Liver’s **storehouse**, merging with it.\nThe **eyes** are the Liver’s **official**.\nWhen **Liver qi flows**, the **five colors are discerned**; when the Liver is **replete**, the **eyes turn red-yellow**.\n\nThe Liver merges with the **pulse**, its **honor being the nails**.\nWhen the Liver’s **sinews relax** and the **pulse cannot sustain itself**, the Liver dies first.\n\nIt governs the **east**, the **spring season**, the **celestial stems** *jia* and *yi*, the **earthly branches** *yin* and *mao*, **wood**, the **jiao voice**, the **green hue**, the **sour taste**, its **odor** is **turbulent**.\nWhen **Heart evils invade the Liver**, **irritability arises**.\n\nExternally, it corresponds to **Eastern Mount**, ascending to commune with the **precise essence of Jupiter**.\nIn **spring’s third month**, **store the green qi of Jupiter** within the Liver.\n\nThe Liver merges with the **gallbladder**, ascending to govern the **eyes** and also the **sinews**.\nThus, when a person’s **Liver is vacuous**, the **sinews contract**.\nWhen the **skin is withered**, the **Liver is hot**.\nWhen **muscles bear dark patches**, it is **Liver Wind**.\nWhen a person’s **complexion is green**, the **Liver is盛 (shèng)**.\nWhen one **cravs sour tastes**, the **Liver is deficient**.\nWhen **hair withers**, the **Liver is injured**.\nWhen the **hands and feet sweat profusely**, the **Liver is undiseased**.\n\nWhen **Lung evils invade the Liver**, one **laughs excessively**.\nThe Liver governs the **sinews**; when the Liver is diseased, one must use the **inhale-exhale (xū) method**.\n\n「嘘者，肝之气，其气仁能除毁痛，皆自然之理也。\n**Xū** is the **Liver’s qi**; its **qi** is gentle and can dispel destructive heat—all are natural principles.\n\n修养法 以春三月朔旦，束面平坐，叩齿三通，闭气九息，吸震宫青气，入口九吞之，以补嘘之损，享青龙之杞。\n**Cultivation Method**: On the first day of the **third month of spring**, bind the face and sit upright, strike the teeth three times, hold the breath for nine inhalations, and draw in **Jupiter’s green qi** from the **Shèn Palace**. Swallow it nine times to replenish what **xū** has depleted, thus nourishing the **Green Dragon’s virtue**.\n\n相肝脏病法 肝热者，左颊赤。\n**Diagnosing Liver Organ Diseases**: When the **Liver is hot**, the left cheek is red.\n\n肝病者，目夺而胁下痛引小腹，令人喜怒。\nWhen the **Liver is diseased**, the **eyes are obscured**, and pain radiates from the **sides** to the lower abdomen, causing one to be prone to **joy and anger**.\n\n肝虚则恐如人将捕之，实则怒； 虚则寒，寒则阴气壮，梦见山树园林。\nWhen the **Liver is vacuous**, one feels **fear as if seized by others**; when it is **replete**, one feels **anger**. When vacuous, one feels **cold**; cold strengthens **yin qi**, leading to dreams of **mountains, trees, gardens, and forests**.\n\n肝气逆则头痛，耳聋，颊肿。\nWhen **Liver qi** is **rebellious**, one suffers **headaches**, **deafness**, and **swollen cheeks**.\n\n又曰，肝病欲散，急食辛以散之，用酸补之，辛泻之。\nIt is also said: When **Liver disease** seeks to **dispel**, quickly consume **pungent foods** to scatter it, and use **sour foods** to **replenish**; **pungent** drains it.\n\n禁当风，肝恶风也。\n**Avoid winds**, for the **Liver abhors wind**.\n\n肝病脐左有动气，按之牢若，痛支满，淋没，大小便难，好转筋，肝有病，昏昏饶睡，眼膜视物不明，飞蝇上下，努肉漫睛，或生晕映，冷泪下，两角赤痒，宜服升麻散：\nWhen **Liver disease** manifests as **moving qi** in the left side of the **navel**, pressing it feels **tight and firm**, with **pain radiating outward**, **dribbling urine**, **difficulty in urination and defecation**, and a **tendency to stretch the sinews**, the **Liver is diseased**. Symptoms include **drowsiness**, **blurred vision** (as if through a **membrane**), **flitting flies** before the eyes, **protruding flesh obscuring the pupils**, **occasional vertigo**, **cold tears**, and **itchy redness at the outer corners of the eyes**—**the Decoction of Cimicifuga (Shēngmá)** is appropriate:\n- **Cimicifuga (Shēngmá)** – 8 fen\n- **Scutellaria (Huángqín)** – 8 fen\n- **Artemisia capillaris (Huángwèizǐ)** – 8 fen\n- **Gardenia (Zhìzǐ)** – 10 fen\n- **Centella (Yángmíngzǐ)** – 10 fen\n- **Plantago (Chēqiánzǐ)** – 10 fen\n- **Dried ginger (Gānjiāng)** – 10 fen\n- **Bitter gourd (Kǔhù)** – 5 fen\n- **Gentiana (Lóngdàn)** – 5 fen\n**Pulverize all ingredients on the right side**, then take **one qì** (cubic inch) in **warm congee water**, twice daily.\n\n六气法 治肝脏用嘘法，以鼻渐长引气，以口嘘之。\n**Six Qi Method**: To treat **Liver Organ diseases**, use the **xū method**—**gradually lengthen the breath** through the nose and exhale it through the mouth.\n\n肝病用大嘘三十遍，细嘘十遍，自然去肝家虚热，亦除四肢壮热。\nFor **Liver disease**, employ **deep xū thirty times** and **gentle xū ten times**; this naturally dispels **vacuous heat** in the **Liver** and also removes **excessive heat** in the **four limbs**. For **blurred vision** and **various heat-related afflictions**, perform **repeated xū**, continuously and without pause—cease only when the condition improves. Overuse will **injure**.\n\n月食禁忌法 正月，不食生葱，熟者不食益佳。\n**Prohibitions During Lunar Eclipses**:\nIn the **first month**, avoid **raw scallions**; consuming **cooked scallions** is even better.\n\n二月、三月，不食梦子、小蒜及百草心，勿食肝肺。\nIn the **second and third months**, avoid **dream seeds (Mèngzǐ)**, **small garlic (Xiǎosuàn)**, and **the hearts of all grasses**, as well as **Liver and Lung meats**.\n\n肝病宜食麻子、豆、李子、禁辛。\nFor **Liver disease**, consume **sesame seeds (Mázǐ)**, **beans**, and **plums (Lǐzǐ)**—**avoid pungent foods**.\n\n肝脏导引法正月二月三月行之 可正坐，以两手相重按臂上，徐徐缓线身左右，各三五度。\n**Liver Organ Guiding and Pulling Method** (to be practiced in the **first, second, and third months**):\nSit upright, place both hands overlapping on the upper arms, and **slowly rotate the torso** left and right, each **three to five times**.\n\n又可正坐，两手相叉，翻覆向胸，三五度，此能去肝家积聚、风邪毒气。\nAlternatively, sit upright, **cross both hands over the chest**, and **flip them repeatedly**, three to five times—this dispels **Liver stagnation**, **Wind evils**, and **toxic qi**.\n\n脾脏图 洽脾用呼，呼为泻，吸为补。\n**Spleen Organ Diagram**:\nTo **harmonize the Spleen**, use **hū**—**exhalation drains**, **inhalation replenishes**.\n\n脾上宫也，掩大仓上，在脐上三寸，色缟映黄。\nThe **Spleen** is the **upper palace**, covering the **Great Granary (Dàcāng)**, located **three cun above the navel**, with a **pale yellow hue**.\n\n凡丈夫至七十，脾气虚而皮肤枯瘦也。\nFor **men**, by the age of **seventy**, the **Spleen qi** becomes **vacuous**, causing **withered, emaciated skin**.\n\n重二斤二两，中央黄色入通於脾，开窍於口，在形为颊，脾脉出干隐白。\nWeighing **two jīn and two liǎng**, its **central yellow color** connects with the **Spleen**, which **opens the orifices at the mouth** and manifests as the **cheeks**. The **Spleen pulse** emerges at **Yǐnbái**.\n\n脾为五脏之枢也。\nThe **Spleen** is the **pivot of the five zàng organs**.\n\n脾者，肉之本意之处也，谷气通於脾。\nThe **Spleen** is the **root of flesh and the origin of intent**—**grain qi** flows through it.\n\n於液为涎，肾邪入脾则多涎。\nIn **fluids**, it governs **saliva**; when **Kidney evils invade the Spleen**, one produces **excessive saliva**.\n\n六腑胃为脾之府，胃与脾合为五谷之府。\nAmong the **six fǔ organs**, the **stomach** is the **Spleen’s domain**; the **stomach and Spleen together** form the **palace of the five grains**.\n\n五官口为脾之官，脾气通则口知五味，脾病则口乾，不能食，不知五味也。\nAmong the **five senses**, the **mouth** is the **Spleen’s domain**. When **Spleen qi** flows freely, the **mouth discerns the five flavors**; when the **Spleen is diseased**, the **mouth is dry**, one **cannot eat**, and **loses taste**.\n\n脾合於肉，其荣历也，夫肌肉消瘦者，脾先死也。\nThe **Spleen merges with flesh**; its **glory** is the **muscles**. When **flesh and muscles wither and atrophy**, the **Spleen is the first to die**.\n\n为中央，为季夏日，为戊己辰，为辰未戊丑，为土，声宫，色黄，味甘，其臭香，心邪入脾则恶香也。\nIt corresponds to the **center**, to **late summer**, to the **days of wù-jǐ (戊己)**, to the **hours of chén-wèi (辰未) and wù-chǒu (戊丑)**, to **Earth**, to the **palace of sound**, to the **yellow color**, to the **sweet flavor**, and to the **fragrant odor**. When **Heart evils invade the Spleen**, one emits a **foul odor**.\n\n脾之外应中岳，上通镇星之精，季夏并四季各十八日存镇星在脾中，亦作黄气存之。\nExternally, the **Spleen** responds to **Mount Sōng (中岳)**, ascending to **communicate with the **Jupiter’s Settling Star (Zhènxīng)精**. In **late summer** and the **last eighteen days of each season**, **store the Settling Star’s essence** in the **Spleen**, also referred to as **retaining yellow qi**.\n\n脾连於胃，上主於口，消谷府也，如磨转之，化其生而入於熟者也。\nThe **Spleen** connects with the **stomach**, ascending to **govern the mouth** as the **palace of grain digestion**—like a **grinding mill**, it **transforms raw into cooked**.\n\n食不消，脾不转也，食坚物者，脾磨不化也，则为食患。\nWhen **food is not digested**, the **Spleen does not rotate**. Consuming **hard foods** causes the **Spleen’s grinding** to fail in **transformation**, leading to **food-related ailments**.\n\n故诸脏不调则伤脾，脾脏不调则伤质，质神俱伤，则伤人之速也。\nThus, when **all zàng organs are unbalanced**, the **Spleen is injured**; when the **Spleen itself is unbalanced**, the **essence is harmed**; and when **both essence and spirit are injured**, the **harm to the person is swift**.\n\n故人不欲食坚物者，全身之道也。\nTherefore, one should **avoid consuming hard foods**—this is the **Dao/Way of preserving the whole body**.\n\n人之不欲食者，脾中有不化之食。\nWhen a person **loses appetite**, the **Spleen contains undigested food**.\n\n人之多惑者，脾不安。\nWhen a person **is prone to confusion**, the **Spleen is unsettled**.\n\n人之多食者，脾实也。\nWhen a person **eats excessively**, the **Spleen is replete**.\n\n人之食不下者，脾虚也。\nWhen a person **cannot swallow food**, the **Spleen is vacuous**.\n\n人之无颜色者，脾伤也。\nWhen a person **lacks color**, the **Spleen is injured**.\n\n人之好食甘味者，脾不足也。\nWhen a person **cravs sweet flavors**, the **Spleen is deficient**.\n\n人之肌肉鲜白滑者，脾无疾也。\nWhen a person’s **flesh and muscles are fresh, white, and smooth**, the **Spleen is undiseased**.\n\n肺邪入脾则多歌。\nWhen **Lung evils invade the Spleen**, one **sings excessively**.\n\n夫脾土宫，故脾之有疾当用呼。\nThe **Spleen** is the **Earth Palace**—thus, when the **Spleen is diseased**, one must use **hū**.\n\n呼者，脾之气，其气信，能抽脾之疾，故人中热者，则呼以驱其弊也。\n**Hū** is the **Spleen’s qi**; its **qi** is **trustworthy and firm**, capable of **drawing out Spleen diseases**. When a person **suffers from central heat**, **hū** is used to **expel its harm**.\n\n修养法 常以季夏之月朔旦，并四季之末十八日之旭旦，正坐中官，禁气五息，呜天鼓十二通，吸坤宫之黄气，入口十二吞之，以补呼之损。\n**Cultivation Method**: On the **first day of late summer** and the **last eighteen days of each season at dawn**, sit upright in the **central palace**, **hold the breath for five inhalations**, **strike the Heavenly Drum twelve times**, and **draw in Earth’s yellow qi**, swallowing it **twelve times** to **replenish what hū has depleted**.\n\n相脾脏病法 脾热者，鼻色赤，黄而肉燸。\n**Diagnosing Spleen Organ Diseases**:\nWhen the **Spleen is hot**, the **nose is red**, **yellow**, and the **flesh is scorched**.\n\n脾病，体上游风肤肤之，遍体闷疼，身重，喜饥，肉痪，足不能行，喜声，脚下痛。\nWhen the **Spleen is diseased**, **wind evils roam the body**, causing **dull, pervasive pain**, **heaviness**, **excessive hunger**, **muscle atrophy**, **inability to walk**, **a fondness for loud sounds**, and **pain beneath the feet**.\n\n脾虚则腹肚胀呜，成塘痢，食多不化。\nWhen the **Spleen is vacuous**, the **abdomen distends with a rumbling sound**, leading to **chronic dysentery**, and **excessive food remains undigested**.\n\n脾风之状，多汗恶风，身体息惰，四肢不收，微黄，不嗜饮食，诊在鼻，其色黄。\nThe **state of Spleen Wind** is marked by **excessive sweating**, **aversion to wind**, **bodily lassitude**, **unretracted limbs**, **slight yellowing**, and **indifference to food**. **Diagnose it at the nose**, where its **color is yellow**.\n\nThe **Spleen** abhors dampness; **bitter foods** should be consumed to **dry it**. It is also said: When the **Spleen is diseased**, one should **moderate**—if **urgent**, eat **sweet to supplement**, or **bitter to drain**. **Avoid dampness**, for the **Spleen abhors dampness**.\n\nWhen the **Spleen is diseased**, there is **moving *qi* near the navel**; pressing reveals **tightness**, accompanied by **painful counterflow of *qi***, **acute small intestine pain**, **diarrhea**, and **heaviness in the feet from cold**. The **Spleen’s disease** manifests as **flanks distended with fullness**, **indigestion**, **frequent regurgitation**, **inability to swallow food**, **heaviness in the back and shoulders**, ***qi* distension surging to the heart**, and **limb vacuity-swelling**. **Ingest the Hèlìlè Pill**:\n- **Dried Rehmannia (Shu Di Huang)** – 10 parts\n- **Moutan Bark (Mu Dan Pi)** – 10 parts\n- **Tuckahoe (Fu Ling)** – 8 parts\n- **Alisma (Ze Xie)** – 8 parts\n- **Poria (Fu Shen)** – 8 parts\n- **White Peony (Bai Shao)** – 8 parts\n- **Chinese Wolfberry (Shan Zhu Yu)** – 9 parts\n- **Coptis (Huang Lian)** – 4 parts\n- **Dried Ginger (Gan Jiang)** – 5 parts\n- **Hélìlè Bark (He Li Lu Pi)** – 7 parts\n**Pulverize and sift**, mix with honey into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**, and take **20 pills on an empty stomach** with **Rehmannia decoction**.\n\n**Six *Qi* Method** – To treat the **Spleen**, use **exhalation**. Gradually draw *qi* through the **nose** and exhale through the **mouth**. For **Spleen disease**, perform **30 deep exhalations** and **10 shallow exhalations**; this dispels all **Spleen *lingqi*** and **robust heat**. For **cholera, undigested food, hemiplegia, and Spleen masses**, exhale repeatedly—**without pause** until symptoms abate. **Overuse harms**.\n\n**Taboos During Lunar Eclipses** – In the **sixth month**, do not eat **Chinese wolfberry**, lest one suffer **bloody or white dysentery**. In all seasons, avoid **Spleen and Liver meats, mutton, and lamb’s blood**.\n\nFor **Spleen disease**, consume **glutinous rice, dates, and hemp seeds**; **avoid sour flavors**.\n\n**Spleen-Guiding Method** (to be practiced in the **sixth month and all seasons**) – Extend one leg fully, then **pull backward with both hands**, repeating **3–5 times**. Alternatively, kneel and **push against the ground with both hands**, arching backward with **fierce gaze**, repeating **3–5 times**. This dispels **Spleen accumulations, wind evils, and toxic *qi***.\n\n---\n**Kidney Diagram** – To treat the **Kidney**, use **blowing** (to **drain**), **inhaling** (to **supplement**). The **Kidney** is the **Water Official**. The **left Kidney** aligns with the **right Mingmen**; it faces the **navel**, resting against the **lumbar spine**, its hue **pale yellow tinged with violet**. By **sixty**, a man’s **Kidney *qi* wanes**, his hair thins with his teeth; by **seventy**, his form fully decays; by **ninety**, his **Kidney *qi* withers**, his **meridians empty**.\n\nThe **Kidney** is to the body as **roots to a tree**. Weighing **1.2 liang**, it governs the **north**, the **black**, and **opens at the two orifices**. Prolonged standing **injures bones and Kidneys**. Its **pulse emerges at the Spring Fountain (Yong Quan)**.\n\nThe **Kidney** is the **foundation of the sealed organs**, the **abode of essence**. Its **meridian ascends to the upper *zang***, **nourishes the middle *zang***, and **defends the lower *zang***. The **Kidney’s ailment** causes **groaning** or **yawns**; both stem from **Kidney evils**. Its **fluid manifests as saliva**; **Kidney pathology** increases spitting.\n\nThe **six bowels**—the **bladder**—are the **Kidney’s repository**, storing **essence and fluids**. The **ear**, its **sense organ**, hears **five tones** when **Kidney *qi* flows**; **Kidney disease** brings **deafness and bone atrophy**. The **Kidney merges with bones**, its **honor in the beard**; **bone atrophy** rendering one **unable to rise** signals **Kidney death**.\n\nThe **Kidney governs the north**, **winter**, **Ren-Yi days**, **the hours of *hai* and *zi***, **water**, the **羽 (yǔ) tone**, **black**, **salt**, and **rotten odors**. **Heart evils invading the Kidney** cause **aversion to decay**.\n\nThe **Kidney’s external correspondence** is **North Mountain**; it **communicates with the *Chén* star’s essence**. In **winter’s third month**, store **black *qi*** from the *Chén* star within the **Kidney**.\n\nThe **Kidney merges with bones**, governing **teeth above**. **Toothache** signals **Kidney injury**. It also governs the **ear**; **deafness** betrays **Kidney depletion**. **Bone pain** stems from **Kidney vacuity**; **multiple decayed teeth** from **Kidney weakness**; **loose teeth** from **Kidney Wind**; **ear pain** from **Kidney *qi* stagnation**; **frequent yawning** from **Kidney evils**; **rigid waist** from **Kidney deficiency**; **black complexion** from **Kidney decay**; **purplish luster** from **Kidney’s lack of suffering**. **Bone groaning** marks **Kidney exhaustion**. **Lung evils invading the Kidney** induce **excessive groaning**.\n\nThe **Kidney governs the *yǔ* (羽) tone**; thus, its **ailments require blowing**. **Blowing** harnesses the **Kidney’s *qi***—**clever and penetrating**—to **extract Kidney disease**. When **accumulated *qi* surges to the diaphragm**, **forceful blowing** dispels it. For **stagnant Kidney *qi***, **repeated blowing** gradually **unblocks it**.\n\n**Cultivation Method** – In **winter’s third month**, face **north** and sit upright. **Groan the Golden Beam (Jin Liang) seven times**, **drink from the Jade Spring (Yu Quan) three times**, **inhale the black *qi* of the Mysterious Official (Xuan Guan)**, and **swallow it five times** to **supplement the loss from blowing**.\n\n**Diagnosing Kidney Disease** – When the **Kidney is hot**, the **chin reddens**. **Kidney disease** presents as **blackened complexion and brittle teeth**, **distended abdomen and heaviness**, **wheezing and coughing**, **sweating and wind aversion**. When the **Kidney is vacuous**, the **lumbar region aches**. **Kidney Wind** manifests as **neck stiffness**, **excessive sweating**, **wind aversion**, **desire for downward food but esophageal blockage**, **preference for fullness**, **abdominal distension upon undressing**, and **diarrhea from cold foods**. **Diagnose by its form**: **black, emaciated, with a distended abdomen**.\n\nThe **Kidney abhors dryness**; in **urgency**, consume **pungent to moisten it**. It is also said: When the **Kidney is diseased**, to **firm**, eat **salty**; to **drain**, use **bitter**; to **supplement**, use **salty**. **Avoid hot foods and warm clothing**, for the **Kidney abhors dryness**.\n\nWhen the **Kidney is diseased**, there is **moving *qi* below the navel**; pressing reveals **tightness**, accompanied by **painful fullness**, **indigestion**, **heaviness**, **joint pain**, and **desire for external stimuli**. **Kidney disease** causes **lumbar, hip, and bladder *lingqi* pain**, **leg pain or paralysis**, **dribbling urine**, **hernia**, and **testicular torsion**. **Ingest the Kidney *Qi* Pill**:\n- **Dried Rehmannia (Shu Di Huang)** – 10 parts\n- **Tuckahoe (Fu Ling)** – 10 parts\n- **Moutan Bark (Mu Dan Pi)** – 7 parts\n- **Alisma (Ze Xie)** – 8 parts\n- **Chinese Wolfberry (Shan Zhu Yu)** – 9 parts\n- **Poria (Fu Shen)** – 6 parts\n- **Cinnamon Twig (Gui Zhi)** – 6 parts\n- **Prepared Aconite (Fu Zi)** – 4 parts\n\n---\n\n**Preparation and Dosage:**\nPound and sift [the ingredients], form into honey-coated pills the size of *wutong* seeds (Paulownia seeds). Take thirty pills on an empty stomach with wine, twice daily.\n\n**Six Qi Method (for Kidney):**\nTo treat the **Kidney**, use the **blowing method** for exhalation and inhalation. Gradually draw in *qi* through the nose, then exhale forcefully through the mouth.\n\nFor **Kidney disease**, perform **large blowing** thirty times and **fine blowing** ten times. This can eliminate all **Kidney *lingqi* afflictions**.\n\nWhen there is **lumbar pain and knee *lingqi***, **heaviness in the waist and legs** preventing prolonged standing, **weakened yang channel**, **ear buzzing like insects**, and **mouth ulcers**, these are all **Kidney disorders**. All **heat-related distress** will be dispelled. Practice blowing frequently, sequentially without interruption. Cease only when the ailment improves; overuse will cause harm.\n\n**Monthly Dietary Taboos:**\nIn the **tenth month**, avoid pepper—it causes dry mouth and **bloody or white dysentery**.\nIn the **eleventh and twelfth months**, avoid **scaly or armored foods**, as well as **Kidney- and Spleen-strengthening foods**.\n\nFor **Kidney disease**, consume **yellow soybeans and *chú* (a type of millet)**.\nAvoid **sweet foods**.\n\n**Kidney Organ-Guiding Method (to be practiced in the winter months):**\nSit upright, place both hands on the hips, and stretch the ribs three to five times. Alternatively, place hands on knees and twist the elbows left and right, three to five times each. Stretch the body three to five times, or alternately stamp the feet forward and backward, left and right, tens of times each. This dispels **wind pathogens accumulated in the Kidney, Bladder, and lumbar region**.\n\n---\n\n**Gallbladder (Bile Vessel) Diagram:**\nThe **Gallbladder** is treated with **xū (a sharp exhalation)**—**xū** for drainage, **absorption** for supplementation.\n\nThe **Gallbladder** is adjacent to the **Liver**, its color like **white silk tinged with green**, weighing **three *liang* and three *chǐn*** (≈13.5g).\n\nThe **Gallbladder** connects to the **Bladder**, governing **hair and nails**.\nThus, if a person’s hair is **withered**, their **Gallbladder is depleted**.\nIf their **nails are brittle**, their **Gallbladder is deficient**.\nIf their **hair is dry and brittle**, their **Gallbladder has wind**.\nIf a person **cravs bitter flavors**, their **Gallbladder is insufficient**.\nIf a person’s **complexion is greenish or ashen**, their **Gallbladder is healthy**.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nIn the **winter months**, sit quietly and meditate, inhaling the **black *qi* of the Northern Celestial Palace (Xuangong)** through the nose, swallowing it three times to **supplement the deficiency of *xū*** and **nourish Gallbladder fluids**.\n\n**Diagnosing Gallbladder Disorders:**\nWhen the **Gallbladder is diseased**, there is **bitter breath, vomiting of old bile**, and **fearfulness in the heart**—these signs warrant supplementation.\n\nIf the **Gallbladder is full**, the **spirit becomes ungrounded**, manifesting as **restlessness and aimlessness**. If **empty**, it leads to **fear of cold**, **dizziness**, and **terror**.\n\nWhen **deficient**, the **nails and hair wither**, **eyes protrude**, and **pain radiates from the Bladder to the lumbar and lower abdomen**.\n\nSince the **Gallbladder shares a channel with the Liver**, its disorders are treated alongside **Liver ailments**.\n\n**Gallbladder Organ-Guiding Method:**\nSit upright, press the soles together, lift the head, and grasp the ankles with both hands, shaking them three to five times. Alternatively, sit wide-legged, place hands on the ground, lift the torso, and arch the back three to five times. This dispels **wind toxins and pathogenic *qi* from the Gallbladder**.\n\n**Gallbladder Breathwork (Using *Xū*):**\nGradually draw in *qi* through the nose, then exhale sharply through the mouth to **treat Gallbladder disorders** and **eliminate all *lingqi* afflictions of the Yin organs**.\n\nFor **night sweats, spontaneous sweating, pale complexion, distended small intestine, umbilical *lingqi* pain, dry mouth, and a stiff tongue**, practice **repeated *xū***—the ailment will then resolve.\n\n---\n**Summary of the Five Organs and Six Vessels:**\nThe essentials of the **Five Organs and Six Vessels** are condensed here. Where the text is incomplete, it is supplemented.\n\n**Phonetic Key for Breathwork:**\n- **Lung:** *Hè* (as in \"heh\")\n- **Throat (Throat Center):** *Hān* (as in \"hah\")\n- **Heart:** *Hē* (as in \"heh\")\n- **Liver:** *Xū* (sharp exhalation)\n- **Spleen:** *Hū* (as in \"hoo\")\n- **Kidney:** *Chuī* (blowing)\n- **Gallbladder:** *Xū* (sharp exhalation)\n\n---\n**These six characters** correspond to the **breathwork of the Six Vessels**—not mystical names, but practical techniques for **disease removal**, not **embryonic breathing (*táixī*)**.\n\n---\n**Glossary of Pronunciations:**\n- *Nàodàodé* (懦奴到切): \"Zhéchìjié\" (折脊胁也) – \"Twisting the spine and ribs.\"\n- *Ké* (咳): \"Háixiào\" (孩笑也) – \"Childish laughter.\"\n- *Hén* (痕): \"Jiā\" (加) – \"Disease.\"\n- *Jiè* (龃): \"Cáiyǔ\" (才与切).\n\n---\n**Conclusion of the *Huángtíng Nèijǐng* (Yellow Court Inner Vision) Diagram for Supplementing and Draining the Five Organs and Six Vessels.**\n\n---\n**Annotations:**\n#1 *Xū* (嘘): Originally \"duò\" (夺), corrected according to *Xiūzhēn Shíshū* (修真十书).\n#2 \"Signs of relaxed tendons and *mài* unable to self-stabilize\" (*筋缓脉而不能自持*): *Xiūzhēn Shíshū* reads \"筋缓而不能自修持\" (relaxed tendons unable to self-cultivate).\n#3 *Dǎn* (胆): Originally \"shèng\" (胜J), corrected based on context and usage.\n#4 *Tǔ* (土): Originally \"zhǔ\" (主J), corrected according to *Xiūzhēn Shíshū*.\n#5 *Bó* (博): *Xiūzhēn Shíshū* reads \"bó\" (膊) – \"shoulder/upper arm.\"\n#6 *Jǐng* (颈): *Xiūzhēn Shíshū* reads \"tóu\" (头) – \"head.\"",

Diagram of the Inner Yellow Court: The Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs, and Methods of Tonification and Drainage**\n*Preface by Master Hu Jiāshù of the Pure Essence Sect, seen at Mount Tàibái*\n\nThe Celestial is dominated by **Yáng**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Qi** (五氣);\nThe Terrestrial is dominated by **Yīn**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Flavors** (五味).\nWhen **Qi** and flavors interact, they coalesce into the **Five Zàng-Organs** (五臟).\nThe **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs disperses into the four limbs, sixteen segments (十六部),\nand the three hundred and sixty joints (三百六十關節),\nwhile forming the sinews and vessels (筋脈),\nthe **jīn-yè** (津液) and blood marrow (血髓),\nand nurturing the Six Fǔ-Organs (六腑),\nthe Three Burners (三焦),\nand the Twelve Channels (十二經),\nall converging to permeate the nine orifices (九竅).\n\nThus, the Five Zàng-Organs are the foundation of human form.\nIf one organ is damaged, illness arises;\nIf all five are impaired, the spirit perishes.\nHence, the Five Zàng-Organs are the dwelling of **shén** (神), **míng** (明), **hún** (魂), **pò** (魄), **zhì** (志), and **jīng** (精),\neach organ presiding over its own aspect.\nTherefore:\nThe **Heart** (心) governs **shén**,\nThe **Lungs** (肺) govern **pò**,\nThe **Liver** (肝) governs **hún**,\nThe **Spleen** (脾) governs **yì** (意),\nThe **Kidneys** (腎) govern **zhì**.\n\nWhen these energies manifest externally,\nthey correspond above to the **Five Stars** (五星),\nand below to the **Five Sacred Mountains** (五嶽).\nAll are patterned after the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth,\nembodying the **symbols** of the Sun and Moon,\ntouching upon categories and drawing analogies—\ntoo vast to fully articulate.\n\nIf one can cultivate the spirit (存神),\nnourish the **Qi** (修養),\nrestrain oneself (克己),\nand strengthen resolve (勵志),\nthen the **Dao** is achieved.\n\nWhen the Five Zàng-Organs are firm and robust,\nthey resist the intrusion of **xīng-fǔ** (腥腐) toxins within,\nand external diseases and **Qi** cannot harm them.\nClarity and insight are pure,\naging is reversed and life prolonged,\nambition soars toward the **Immortal Way** (神仙),\nthe body knows no fatigue or constraint,\nwhile the **luminous essences** of the Sun and Moon (日月精光) come to adhere to my form,\nand the **Six Qi** (六氣) of the four seasons merge harmoniously with my body.\nEntering the **path of transformation** (變化之道),\npenetrating the **principles of the spirit** (神明之理),\ngrasp the interplay of **Yīn** and **Yáng** (把握陰陽),\nand breathe in the **refined spirit** (呼吸精神).\nThe **Creator** (造物者) will be turned to my own dominion.\n\nAt this stage,\nno need for **elixirs of gold and jade** (金丹玉液),\nor the **Great Return** (琅牙大還).\nNaturally, the spirit ascends to **emptiness** (神化沖虚),\n**Qi** harmonizes with **Tàihé** (氣合太和),\nand one ascends to the **Celestial River** (升雲漢).\nThe **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs coalesces into **Five Clouds** (五雲) and enters the heavens,\nleft calling forth the **Yáng-spirit** (陽神) of the **Six Jiǎ** (六甲),\nright invoking the **Yīn-spirit** (陰神) of the **Six Dīng** (六丁),\nthrough myriad transformations,\nriding the **flying clouds and winds** (驭飛輸) at will.\n\nThus, those who fail to awaken\ntoil and seek externally,\ntruly unaware of the **Dao of Life** (知生之道).\n\nTherefore, the **Tàishàng** (太上) says:\n*\"Essence is my spirit, Qi is my Dao.\nNurture the essence to preserve the Qi,\nmaintain firm and steadfast integrity,\nand let Yīn and Yáng converge\nto establish my form.\"*\n\nAlas, my innate nature is dull,\nyet from youth I have aspired to the **Mystic Gate** (玄門),\nrefining my resolve to **non-action** (無為),\ndwelling my heart in **tranquility** (澹泊).\nStudying the profound **Dao** of the *Yellow Court*,\nexhausting the remnants of the *Blue Scroll*,\nwith burning focus and meticulous effort,\nI have spent many years.\nWhen I encountered the old diagram’s hidden depths,\nits **passages** (津路) were profound and obscure,\nits words and principles esoteric—\nfew dared to follow its traces.\n\nSome merely pointed to its **colors and symbols** (色象)\nor vaguely noted the names of the spirits (神名),\nleading later generations astray,\nwhile sectarian compilers introduced erroneous doctrines.\nThus, disciples of later years rarely found its true path,\nand even slight deviations led to vast errors.\n\nNow, I dare to compile what I have observed,\nto exhaust all I have heard,\ncross-referencing the **scriptures** (經),\nand creating new diagrams.\n\nFirst, I clarify the Zàng and Fǔ-organs,\nthen expound upon cultivation methods,\nand further trace the origins of diseases,\nexpelling and absorbing **Qi** to dispel afflictions.\nAdditionally, I gather **pharmacological principles** (藥理),\n**guided movements** (導引) and **flexible extensions** (屈伸),\n**diagnostic coloration** (察色) and **evidence-seeking** (尋證),\nas well as **monthly dietary restrictions and prohibitions** (月禁食忌),\nso that future scholars,\nupon unfolding the diagram, may discern the **Six Emotions** (六情),\nand opening the **scriptures**, may reveal all **myriad truths** (萬品).\n\nWritten in the **year Wùchén of the Dàzhōng era** (大中二年戊辰).\n\n**Master Sūn Sīmiào’s Commentary** states:\n*\"Mortals receive their life from Heaven and Earth,\nthus within they possess the Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,\n**jīng** and **Qi** (精氣),\nbones and marrow (骨髓),\nsinews and vessels (筋脈),\nand externally, the four limbs and nine orifices (四肢九竅),\nskin, fur, claws, and teeth (皮毛爪齿),\nthroat, esophagus, lips, and tongue (喉咽唇舌),\nanus, and the **pāngnáng** (胖囊)—\nall these combine to form the body.\n\nThus, when **rest and activity** (將息) are regulated properly,\nthe hundred limbs are in perfect harmony,\nbut when **labor and exertion** (役用) are misapplied,\nthey lead to the **Five Strains, Seven Injuries, and Six Extremities** (五勞七傷六極).\nIf there is a method to heal, even illness has no other cause;\nif no method can be relied upon, one’s fate is sealed.\n\nTherefore, this diagram comprehensively describes\nthe Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,\nthe **roots and sources of blood and vessels** (血脈根源),\ntheir **circulation and interconnection** (循環連注),\nand the **convergence with the nine orifices** (九竅應會處所).\nIf one can **retain the mind** (留心),\nexamine and practice accordingly,\nthen all internal and external maladies have no refuge.\n\nAs for cultivation:\nThe hair should be **frequently combed** (發宜多栉),\nthe teeth **often struck** (齿宜數叩),\nthe **jīn-yè** (津液) **must be swallowed** (液宜常咽),\nthe **Qi** **must be refined** (氣宜清煉),\nand the hands **should rest upon the face** (手宜在面).\nThese five principles are what is meant by:\n*'A son who wishes not to die must cultivate Mount Kūnlún.'*\n\nFrom this arises the **refinement of elixirs** (煉丹) to fortify the body,\n**rejecting grains** (卻粒) to lighten it,\ndiscarding **earthly talismans** (土符),\nand inscribing **golden patterns** (金格).\nOne **faces Heaven and absorbs the Sun’s essence** (朝天吸日),\n**commands the Qi** (驭氣) to attain **emptiness** (沖虚)—\nthese are the arts of the **adept** (術士).\n\nThe *Yuānshǐ Tàixuān Jīng* (元始太玄經) states:\n*\"Excessive joy and anger harm one’s nature,\nand even slight indulgence in pleasure harms the spirit.\nIf the nature is impaired, life is endangered;\nIf the spirit is harmed, the body is threatened.\nThus, one must **nourish the nature** (養性) to preserve the **Qi**,\nand **protect the spirit** (保神) to calm the heart.\nWhen the **Qi** is complete, the body is balanced;\nWhen the heart is tranquil, the spirit is free—\nthis is the **mystic key** (妙訣) to preserving life.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Lung-Zàng (肺臟圖)**\n*\"To treat the Lungs, one must **swallow** (咽).\n**Swallowing** (咽) is **drainage** (泻),\n**absorbing** (吸) is **tonification** (補).\nThe Lungs are the **Metal** (金) **Lung-Zàng** (商肺),\nthe **canopy** (華蓋) of the Five Zàng-Organs,\nrooted above in the chest.\nThey have six lobes, their color like **unbleached silk** (色如缟) tinged with red.\n\nIn general, when a man reaches eighty,\nhis **Lung-Qi** (肺氣) weakens,\nand his **pò** (魄) scatters and dissipates.\nTheir weight is **three cātyīn, three liǎng** (重三斤三兩).\nThe **West** (西方) is associated with **white** (白色),\nwhich permeates the Lungs,\nopens the orifices at the **nose** (鼻),\nand manifests externally as **skin and fur** (皮毛).\nThe Lung vessels emerge at the **Lesser Commercial** point (少商).\nThe Lungs are the **source of the hundred breaths** (長氣),\nthe **foundation of all Qi** (本氣),\nand thus all **Qi** belongs to them.\nProlonged **lying down** (久臥) harms the **Qi**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Qi** (天氣) circulates through the Lungs,\nfor they are the **precise origin** (精源) of **breathing** (呼吸),\nthe **office of transmission and delivery** (傳送之官).\nThey are also the **Gate of the pò** (魄門),\nthe **Upper Jade Hall** (上玉堂).\"",

Gradually draw in *qi* through the nose, then exhale forcefully through the mouth.\n\nFor **Kidney disease**, perform **large blowing** thirty times and **fine blowing** ten times. This can eliminate all **Kidney *lingqi* afflictions**.\n\nWhen there is **lumbar pain and knee *lingqi***, **heaviness in the waist and legs** preventing prolonged standing, **weakened yang channel**, **ear buzzing like insects**, and **mouth ulcers**, these are all **Kidney disorders**. All **heat-related distress** will be dispelled. Practice blowing frequently, sequentially without interruption. Cease only when the ailment improves; overuse will cause harm.\n\n**Monthly Dietary Taboos:**\nIn the **tenth month**, avoid pepper—it causes dry mouth and **bloody or white dysentery**.\nIn the **eleventh and twelfth months**, avoid **scaly or armored foods**, as well as **Kidney- and Spleen-strengthening foods**.\n\nFor **Kidney disease**, consume **yellow soybeans and *chú* (a type of millet)**.\nAvoid **sweet foods**.\n\n**Kidney Organ-Guiding Method (to be practiced in the winter months):**\nSit upright, place both hands on the hips, and stretch the ribs three to five times.
