Source text: The *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), Dunxuan (Mysterious Treasure) Section, *Weiyi* (Rites and Etiquette) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Golden Talisman Great Fast and Alliance Rites**\n*High Functionary Ascends the Seat*\n*Opening the Hall and Rite Matters*\n\n*Taking Incense and Praying:*\nThis incense drifts through the *Lihuang* [1] realm within,\nIn the *Yujing* [2] mountains, where eons of condensed *qi* form its smoke—\nA hundred thousand sincere hearts unite in faith.\nRoots entwined like *qian* vines, filling the *zhan* sandalwood groves.\n\nA single incense stick burns in the treasure censer—\nTo the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the Ten Extremes, the Ten Glories,\nTo the Supreme Daoist Scripture Teachers of the Ten Directions and Three Worlds,\nTo the myriad true ones and spirits of the Golden Talisman Great Fast altar,\nThe responsive Sovereign of the Rite.\n\nMay the Dragon-Chariot and Phoenix-Carriage descend,\nFlying through the void, stepping upon the empty—\nDescending to this Daoist hall,\nManifesting the merit of the Alliance.\n\n*Silence Descends*\n\nThe Dao’s path is high, not easily ascended—\nYet now we approach the middle vehicle.\n\nIf one knows the *Yuan Shi* [3] suspended the pearl of origin,\nThen from *Biluo* [4] and *Lihuang*, ascent begins anew.\n\nFor the essence of the Supreme Dao is profound and obscure;\nIts utmost reaches are dim and silent.\nIt exists before the *Taiji* [5], beyond *Xiyi* [6].\nIt cannot be sought through form, appearance, sound, or color,\nNor measured by shape, name, or numerology.\nWithout knowing, yet knowing all;\nWithout action, yet accomplishing all.\n\nThus, the ancient *zhi ren* [7] who embodied this Dao\nCould not be found through form, appearance, sound, or color,\nNor measured by shape, name, or numerology.\nIn the profound obscurity, they alone saw and knew;\nIn the dim silence, they alone heard and understood.\nAs their true essence accumulated over time,\nTheir harmony spread, their responses resonated—\nWhen moving heaven and earth, the upper and lower realms responded in trust;\nWhen influencing spirits and gods, the *chōngliè* [8] answered in kind.\nFor blessings, auspiciousness, banishing calamities, rescuing the submerged,\nDriving away evil and pestilence—\nNo request was unfulfilled.\n\nThen, how did these *zhi ren* attain such power?\nThere must be a method to achieve this.\n\nThe method is none other than the **Fast (Zhai)**.\nThe Fast has inner and outer forms—let us expound upon both.\n\n**Inner Fast** is tranquility and stillness, soaring with the Dao.\nLong ago, Confucius taught *xin zhai* [9] to Yan Hui—\nThis is of the same kind.\n\n**Outer Fast** involves ascending the altar, stepping upon the void,\nBurning incense and confessing—\nA remnant of the ancient rites of prayer, sacrifice, and worship.\n\nThe Fast, as recorded in Daoist texts, comprises **twenty-seven grades**,\nAll originating from the *Lingbao* [10] tradition.\n\n1. *Tai Zhen Fast* (Great True Fast),\n2. *Shang Qing Fast* (Upper Clarity Fast),\n3. *Da Dong Fast* (Great Cavern Fast),\n4. *Jin Fang Fast* (Golden Chamber Fast)—\nThese four Fasts require no human intervention;\nThey align with Heaven—**the Inner Fast**.\n\n5. *Tai Yi Fast* (Great Unity Fast),\n6. *Jiu Tian Fast* (Nine Heavens Fast),\n7. *Jin Lu Fast* (Golden Talisman Fast),\n8. *Yu Lu Fast* (Jade Talisman Fast),\n9. *Meng Zhen Fast* (Alliance of the True)—\nThese five Fasts may only be practiced by the Son of Heaven;\nCommoners may not partake.\n\n10. *Huang Lu Fast* (Yellow Talisman Fast),\n11. *Dong Shen Fast* (Cavern Spirit Fast),\n12. *Ziran Fast* (Natural Fast),\n13. *San Yuan Fast* (Three Primordials Fast),\n14. *Tu Tan Fast* (Coating and Refining Fast),\n15. *Ba Du Fast* (Rescue and Degree Fast),\n16. *Dong Yuan Fast* (Cavern Abyss Fast),\n17. *Tian Bao Fast* (Heavenly Treasure Fast),\n18. *Jiu You Fast* (Nine Shadows Fast),\n19. *Wu Lian Fast* (Five Refining Fast),\n20. *Zheng Yi Fast* (Upright Unity Fast),\n21. *Tai Ping Fast* (Great Peace Fast),\n22. *San Huang Fast* (Three Sovereigns Fast),\n23. *Ba Di Fast* (Eight Emperors Fast),\n24. *Bei Di Fast* (Northern Sovereign Fast),\n25. *Zhi Jiao Fast* (Edict Teaching Fast),\n26. *Jie Kao Fast* (Examination and Punishment Fast),\n27. *Hua Hu Fast* (Transformation of the Barbarians Fast)—\nThese eighteen Fasts each have their proper use;\nCommoners may practice them without restriction.\n\nFrom the *Tai Yi Fast* downward, the twenty-two are **Outer Fasts**,\nAll with prescribed rites and regulations, recorded in the Canon.\nThough their arrangements differ, their essence remains within the *Lingbao* framework.\n\nThus, the Highest Venerable Laozi said:\n*\"Of all Daoist priorities, none surpass the Fast.\"*\nThough many Fasts exist, great in similarity and small in difference,\nTheir merit is profound—\nTruly able to connect the upper and lower,\nReturning to the Supreme Vehicle.\n\nTheir rites and disciplines total **two hundred forty conditions**,\nSecreted within the *San Yuan Gong* [11].\nNow, the essentials are outlined for later generations.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nTo move heaven and earth, influence spirits and gods,\nBring blessings to the realm, rescue the hidden and manifest—\nWhat other means suffice?\n\nThe essence of the Fast lies in **sincerity, reverence, single-minded devotion, and meticulous preparation**.\nThose who ascend the Fast must cultivate **serene emptiness, unity of purpose, adherence to tradition, and perfect observance of rites**.\nShould any be lacking, the *Xuan Du* [12] Register of Offenses awaits—\nThe Master’s intent is plain to see.\n\nOnly when outward and inward align,\nWhen all is in harmony, can the High True Ones be moved,\nBearing auspicious omens and blessings.\nYet these trifles are insufficient for our Daoist path.\n\nConsider the greater truth:\n*\"It is the person who expands the Dao, not the Dao that expands the person.\"*\n\nThe Fast originated with the *Xuan Yi San Zhenren* [13],\nTransmitted to *Ge Xian Gong* [14] of the *Tai Ji*,\nAnd through successive transmissions, branches and schools emerged.\nPractice it, and one ascends in broad daylight to the Three Realms of the Morning Guests.\nRecorded in scriptures beyond count—\nIs this not the effect of the person expanding the Dao?\n\nNow, with reverence for imperial edicts,\nWe establish the Great Fast,\nPraying for eternal celestial mandate,\nGathering auspiciousness and longevity.\nOur duty is to propagate this rite—\nHow dare we neglect our efforts?\n\nEspecially for the altar assembly:\nLet the heart be one with the Dao.\nIn harmony and reverence, steadfast from beginning to end,\nAscending and descending as though in the Sovereign’s presence—\nThen the interaction of heaven and humanity remains unblemished.\nIs this not sublime?\n\n---\n---\n[1] *Lihuang* (黎黃): The \"Yellow Mists\" or \"Yellow
