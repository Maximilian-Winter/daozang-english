  "full_translation": "**Jade Chamber Scripture**\n\n**Title:** *Jade Chamber Scripture*. A single scroll. Attributed to Li Chengzhi, likely composed during the Song dynasty. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Jade Chamber Scripture**\nComposed by Li Chengzhi of Dezhou Caohun\n\n**Chapter One: Prohibitions and Precepts**\nLustful desires harm essence-qi, deplete fluids, and damage lung-qi. Anger injures liver-qi, while excessive thought harms heart-qi. The Azure Dragon races left but must not cross its bounds; the White Tiger moves right, acting with propriety. The Six Dings, Six Jias, Twelve Palace Spirits, Year Spirits, and Monthly Generals serve at the altar’s base, following the Nine-Five Palace to circulate the celestial fire-timing—this is expounded in great detail.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Division of Furnace and Cauldron**\nThe furnace is five inches long, corresponding to the Five Phases. It is four inches wide, corresponding to the four seasons. The Wind Earl and Rain Master encircle and guard it, while the Eight Trigram Spirit-Generals attend in harmony. Within it lies the cauldron, three inches long, corresponding to the Three Powers—this is the Yin Cauldron. Yang resides without, hence it is called the Yang Furnace. Yang is employed through Yin, Yang is completed by Yin, and Yang dwells within the center. As the *Book of Changes* states: *\"Firmness centered and upright occupies the imperial position\"*—for Yang abides within. The Emperor, being pure Yang of Yang, thus conceals itself, fully employing the Yin number.\n\nNow, what exists between the furnace and cauldron? The Four Symbols rely on Earth to take form, hence it is said: *\"The Four Symbols, when spoken of with Earth, are called the Five Phases; when the sun and moon align, they are called the Seven Governors.\"* Their revolutions encompass the celestial sphere, their rotations govern Heaven and Earth—yet they never depart from this. To prevent disorder among the Five Phases, one must stabilize the furnace and preserve the cauldron; only thus can the transformation of things be achieved.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Sun and Moon**\nThe number of Yang is eighty-one, and Yin’s number follows. The number of Yin is sixty-four, and Yang transforms to unite with it. The conjunction of sun and moon moves, illuminates, and brightens, nurturing and completing all things. The Yellow Court intertwines in ten intervals, valuing the absence of singularity. The Crimson Palace transmits within and without, prizing the unknowing of fire. The liver is where the Dragon resides; the lungs are where the Tiger conceals itself. The sun follows its course, the moon revolves in its cycle—there is no doubt of this.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Four Symbols**\n*Kan* (Water) comprises fifteen, *Li* (Fire) comprises fifteen, *Zhen* (Thunder) comprises fifteen, *Dui* (Lake) comprises fifteen. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* assist the Four Symbols; the central Five revolves through the heavens, shaping the Eight Trigrams. The *Great Expansion* of forty-nine returns and abides, while the fire-qi of seventy-two sustains the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The hub relies on the spokes, the spokes rest upon the wheel—revolving endlessly, worn yet ever renewed. The two talismans enter and exit, never departing from *Zhun* and *Meng*.\n\n**Chapter Five: Clarifying Kan and Li**\n*Kan* pertains to Water and is called the Eldest Son; *Li* pertains to Fire and is called the Eldest Daughter. Before Yin and Yang manifest, they are called male and female; once manifested, they are called husband and wife. Lead and mercury are what husband and wife use to generate wind and rain. The key to their union lies solely in aligning *Qian* and *Xun*.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Yellow Sprout**\nThe Yellow Sprout gives birth to the Three Fields; the Three Fields are the Three Chambers. The distinction between chamber and field lies in their inner and outer aspects. The growth of the sprout discerns the nature of hardness and softness. From the Great Beginning, Great Initial, Great Mystery, Great Simplicity, Great Harmony, Great Subtlety, and Great Ultimate to the Primordial Chaos—even unto the Two Modes—none do not arise from the Yellow Sprout, by which Heaven and Earth endure long and lastingly.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three. In terms of things, the Three are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity; in terms of principle, they are also called the Three Fields. The Central Field moves and generates—this is the Human; the Upper Field is clear and firm—this is Heaven; the Lower Field is deep and bears all things—this is Earth. The sage draws broadly from the depth of Earth, gazes up to the height of Heaven, and attends below to governing humanity—thus the Three Fields are complete. Yet they cannot be separated from the nurturing of the Yellow Sprout.\n\n**Chapter Seven: On the Sun and Moon**\nThe conjunction of sun and moon comprises thirty spokes. The pairing of Yin and Yang achieves the completion of the Six Children. The Yellow Axis revolves, ascending and descending to circulate essence. The Nine Palaces enter and exit, with *Wu* and *Ji* taking precedence. The work of three hundred sixty-five degrees is established, uniting the wondrous function of ninefold revolutions. *Bing*, *Ding*, *Ren*, *Gui*, *Jia*, *Yi*, *Geng*, and *Xin* further harmonize through their numerical correspondences.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Wind and Rain**\nWind arises from *Xun*, rain descends from *Qian*. The twelve breaths revolve with direction; the twenty-four nodes align with measure. If movement lacks propriety, wind becomes perverse to things. If descent lacks moderation, rain becomes harmful to things. The power of wind and rain is greatest when they act for the good of humanity.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Wu and Ji**\n*Wu* is the image of Earth; *Ji* is the root of Earth. With *Wu* and *Ji* as the masters, the sun and moon reside within. The changes of the four seasons follow them, and the sixth-month solstice marks the Emperor’s flourishing. Thus, the fine grain grows here, and the Yellow Axis is employed here. To abandon this Way is unheard of.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Fortune and Misfortune**\nMisfortune leans upon fortune; fortune conceals misfortune. Fortune and misfortune arise from one’s conduct; creation is accomplished through movement. Following this are the thirteen disciples, succeeded by another thirteen. Laozi said: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth\"*—this refers precisely to this.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Qian and Kun**\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Book of Changes*, from which the sixty-two hexagrams emerge through transformation. *Kan* and *Li* are the elders of Yin and Yang, upon whom the Six Children depend.\n\nSun as odd and moon as even—I do not take this as separation. The sun’s departure and the moon’s return—I do not take this as loss. The essence of waxing and waning crescents, the arrival of times of closure and openness, are but the radiance of crow and hare. This is all.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Entering the Chamber**\nThe virtue of early return lies in the accumulation of power within oneself. The value of acting without confusion lies in the clarity that discerns things. When things are discerned, self and other become distinct; when power is accumulated, fullness attains perfection. Perfection is not mere beauty—it is the discernment and cherishing of things. Revering the father with filial piety enables one to serve the lord. Conducting oneself with compliance enables one to serve one’s elders. Which comes first? At home, it is the beginning of filial piety; in serving the lord, it is the beginning of loyalty. Conducting oneself with compliance is the beginning of serving one’s elders. When these are complete, one then knows the root of nature and destiny, and sincerity is held in greatest esteem.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Penetrating the Mysterious**\nNature is as fathomless as the sea—I know not the depth of its waters. The abyss is so beneficial to the myriad things—I know not the depth of its bounty. Vast and silent, I know not its origin. To use darkness to harm light—I know not what it defiles. The Dao that is not the Dao, the Mysterious that is not the Mysterious: when the noble person attains this, they do not lose it in movement or in stillness. *The Jade Chamber Scripture* concludes.",
