Also found in *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll 49.\n\n---\n\n**The Oral Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Golden Watchtower Lord’s Five Dipper Three Ones Diagram**\n\nAt midnight on the Spring Equinox, rise and sit facing east. Close your eyes and visualize the Three Ones of my body’s Three Palaces, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in total, with me at the center—all riding the smoke of purple *qi*, ascending together to the Yang Brightness Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yang Brightness Star is the eastern spirit of the Northern Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there. Swallow the purple *qi* thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally see the Supreme Eastern Palace of the Yang Brightness Star, where a Green Mystery Youth resides, bestowing upon you the True Light.\n\nFirst, visualize the purple *qi* beneath the Northern Dipper’s stars, vast as a bowstring, descending straight before you, and only then visualize the Three Ones. Master Zhou’s oral instructions: Visualize the seven figures, all wearing the Dipper’s seven stars as headscarves, ascending together to the Yang Brightness Star in a wild-goose formation, with me at the center. \"Wearing the stars\" means the Dipper’s bowl covers the head, its handle pointing forward. Swallow the purple *qi* thirty times—visualize the purple *qi* and swallow it. Then visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers swallowing simultaneously. Afterward, visualize the seven figures descending along the purple *qi* back into the Three Palaces of your body. After a long while, recite the prayer with sincerity:\n\n*\"Three Venerable Perfected Ones, Supreme Mystery Lofty Spirits,*\n*Yang Brightness governs spring, ten thousand youths open the gates;*\n*Cinnabar Prime governs summer, vermilion *qi* merges with smoke;*\n*Yin Essence governs autumn, celestial might arrays six formations;*\n*North Culmen governs winter, myriad evils block treachery.*\n*Five Earths, Geng and Ren, Wu and Ji as celestial barriers—*\n*All they shatter perish, all they face cannot trespass.*\n*Refine my seven *po*, harmonize my three *hun*,*\n*Nurture my five viscera, let me attain the True.*\n*Ascend and fly to Supreme Clarity, drift through the Seven Origins,*\n*Attain long life and proceed in accord, command a thousand spirits with a whistle.\"*\n\nWhen finished, you may also sleep while maintaining the visualization.\n\nThis prayer is used for all four solar terms.\n\nAt midnight on the Summer Solstice, rise and sit facing south. Close your eyes and visualize the Three Ones of my body’s Three Palaces, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in total, with me at the center—all riding the smoke of purple *qi*, ascending together to the Cinnabar Prime Star of the Northern Dipper. The Cinnabar Prime is the southern spirit of the Northern Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there. Swallow the purple *qi* thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally see the Supreme Southern Palace of the Cinnabar Prime Star, where the Vermilion Yang Spirit Consort resides, bestowing upon you the Scarlet Script and Treasure Texts.\n\nAt midnight on the Autumn Equinox, rise and sit facing west. Close your eyes and visualize the Three Ones of my body’s Three Palaces, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in total, with me at the center—all riding the smoke of purple *qi*, ascending together to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence Star is the western spirit of the Northern Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there. Swallow the purple *qi* thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally see the Supreme Western Palace of the Yin Essence Star, where a White-Silk Maiden resides, bestowing upon you the Jade Chapters and Tiger Scripts.\n\nAt midnight on the Winter Solstice, rise and sit facing north. Close your eyes and visualize the Three Ones of my body’s Three Palaces, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in total, with me at the center—all riding the smoke of purple *qi*, ascending together to the North Culmen Star of the Northern Dipper. The North Culmen Star is the mysterious spirit of the Northern Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there. Each swallows the purple *qi* thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally see the Supreme Northern Palace of the North Culmen Star, where the Dark Essence Perfected One resides, bestowing upon you the Golden Script and Secret Characters of the Three-Five Sequential Movement.\n\nOn the first or fifteenth day of the sixth month, avoiding the Autumn Equinox and Summer Solstice, at midnight, sit facing southwest. Close your eyes and visualize the Three Ones of my body’s Three Palaces, the Three Ministers, and myself—seven in total, with me at the center—all riding the smoke of crimson, purple, azure, and yellow *qi*, ascending together to the Celestial Barrier Star of the Northern Dipper. The Celestial Barrier Star is the central spirit of the Northern Dipper. Then visualize entering the star’s center and sitting there. With eyes closed, swallow the four-colored *qi* ten times each, beginning with the crimson *qi*, then proceeding in order. With prolonged practice, you will naturally see the Supreme Central Palace of the Celestial Barrier Star, where the Supreme Might Perfected Great King resides, bestowing upon you the Demon-Quelling Talisman, the Evil-Seizing Axe, and the Yellow-Robed Soldier Register.\n\nFor each of the eight solar terms, guard for eight days, beginning at midnight on the solar term day. On other days, simply visualize the Three Palaces and sit in tranquility. Focus your visualization with utmost precision, so that it becomes as if real.\n\n**Above are the oral instructions for guarding the Five Dipper’s True One.**\n\nFor Daoists devoted to study, dwelling in secluded mountains and forests, retreating into rocky chambers, and distancing themselves from the human world, the benefits of this practice will be profound, and the spirits will swiftly arrive. Those who must do so often lack the ability to calculate calendrical degrees and divisions or to compose almanacs. Without knowledge of the calendar, the days of the twenty-four solar terms and eight nodes can never be known. Moreover, being unable to frequently enter the human world to inquire and copy almanacs is another dilemma for scholars. Now, according to the *Scripture of the Northern Thearch’s Spontaneous Method*, the following should be observed: The third day of the first month corresponds to the Beginning of Spring; the fifteenth day of the second month to the Spring Equinox; the first day of the fourth month to the Beginning of Summer; the sixteenth day of the fifth month to the Summer Solstice; the seventh day of the seventh month to the Beginning of Autumn; the twelfth day of the eighth month to the Autumn Equinox; the fifth day of the tenth month to the Beginning of Winter; and the eleventh day of the eleventh month to the Winter Solstice.\n\nFor scholars dwelling in mountains and forests, this method should be employed. If one understands the eight nodes of external almanacs, they ought to follow this accordingly. The eight nodes of the almanac represent the utmost degrees of the celestial pivot, the days when all true immortals, numinous transcendents, and divine luminaries assemble in audience. In the *Spontaneous Method of the Northern Thearch*, the days when the two luminaries align within the lunar cycle are also times of great auspiciousness. These should be used to cultivate and discourse upon the Dao and virtue, uniting them as one.\n\nForeign lands take the first day of the month as *jian* (establishment), the second as *chu* (removal), and so on in sequence. For those in remote places without almanacs, this may be employed. The Xiongnu realm reckons the first day of the first month as *jiayin*, following the cycle of the six *jia* stems, repeating in perpetuity. Their months alternate as follows: the first month long, the second long, the third short, the fourth long, the fifth short, the sixth long, the seventh short, the eighth long, the ninth short, the tenth long, the eleventh short, and the twelfth long. For those secluded in deep forests or cut off from external traces, this too should be followed.\n\nOn each *jian* day, or at dawn on the first day of the month, visualize the Three Ones emerging from the three palaces within oneself and sitting before you. Then, with sincere reverence, bow twice. If their forms appear faintly, recite in your heart:\n\n\"Celestial Honored Ones, Three Emperors, guardians of my Gate of Life, roaming within the Void, the six qi divide in mystery, nurturing my five spirits, rectifying my three hun-souls, so my five viscera spontaneously flourish, and I attain long life and ascend as a flying immortal.\"\n\nWhen finished, again visualize them returning from the Void into the three palaces. After a long while, swallow saliva thirty times.\n\nBy practicing this, at night you will dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers. Or you may dream of white crows, white cranes, white tigers, or objects of gold and jade—all are transformed manifestations and revealed images of the Three Ones. If you maintain this practice without negligence, the visualized images will gradually become clear, appearing as if before your very eyes.\n\nOn each *chu* day at midnight, rise in secret and face north. Gaze upon the inner image of the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, and see the Three Ones descending from the Auxiliary Star, entering your three palaces. When finished, return to rest in stillness. With focused contemplation, visualize them until they appear faintly, then softly recite:\n\n\"Supreme Celestial Auxiliary,\nRealm where the Three Emperors roam,\nThree Ministers in mutual support,\nJoined with the Perfected in unity,\nDescend into my body,\nAbide in tranquil repose,\nExhale essence to bathe my form,\nHun and po harmoniously moistened,\nThat I may ascend as a flying immortal,\nRiding cloud chariots through the floating realms.\"\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva fourteen times. This is to be done once each month on the *chu* day.\n\nOn each *kai* day at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your cap—you may also let your hair down—then comb and tie it again. When finished, softly recite:\n\n\"Three Perfected of the Upper Prime,\nDivine Infant within the Real,\nHair unbound to part the mist,\nAscending to the Terrace of Heaven,\nMarrow’s Gate firm and congealed,\nIn time with the celestial spheres,\nThat I may fly as an immortal,\nTraversing the Terrace of Exchange.\"\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nineteen times, then replace your cap and lie down. With focused contemplation, visualize the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, each settled in their palaces, the Emperor and his ministers seated in mutual regard. Call forth the *qi* within their palaces thirty times each. As you do so, also call forth your own *qi* thirty times. To \"call forth *qi*\" means to open the mouth and exhale. At this time, you should feel your body grow warm—this is the sign of harmonized spirit and congealed *hun*-soul.\n\nVisualize the One descending before your eyes, gazing inward into the divine palace. The Dao of visualizing the One is to see the Three Primal *qi* of the Supreme appear within the three palaces. The Three Primal are the three misty hues of purple, azure, and crimson—purple above. Then, while maintaining the visualization of the Three Ones within, imagine the Purple Chamber Jade Palace of the Northern Culmen, where the celestial officials are arrayed in order. Envision yourself seated before the Emperor, petitioning with reverent heart. The Supreme is the Shangqing; the Emperor of Shangqing is the most exalted. The Purple Chamber of the Northern Culmen is the Emperor’s own chamber. Also visualize your Three Ones engaging the Emperor in discourse on the Dao of flying transcendents and the vitality of life.\n\nWhenever partaking of a sumptuous feast, compose your mind and visualize the Three Ones. Imagine the One partaking first, then you may eat. By doing so consistently, perverse *qi* will retreat and true *qi* will draw near. After eating, recite in your heart:\n\n\"Grains enter the stomach,\nUniting with spirit in *qi*,\nFilling and replenishing blood and fluids,\nThe corpse-demons fall away,\nAscending beyond the Golden Pass,\nTo endure with heaven and earth,\nCommanding the Six Dings,\nWith divine youths in attendance.\"\n\nThe method of guarding the One: on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight, sweep and purify a quiet chamber’s courtyard, laying out a mat one *zhang* square. Burn incense, face north, and bow twice—this may also be done in the heart alone. Then gaze upon the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, visualizing purple *qi* emerging from the Dipper and entering the three palaces within your body. Face north, clasp your hands over your thighs, and envision the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself together riding the purple *qi* to ascend the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is the Northern Dipper. Let your body and form fade away, as if in a trance of ascending to heaven—thus is the Dao of immortality near. The immortals call this the Great Stillness.\n\nOn rainy days, you may practice this on your bed or prepare an altar in a clean space, one *zhang* square, enclosed by a fence several *chi* high on all sides. Perform this regularly on the appointed days—this is the Dao of the Great Stillness.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One: at the time of the moon’s first appearance, face it and bow twice. When finished, recite in your heart:\n\n\"Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nNewborn streaming light,\nIlluminating my three palaces,\nThat I may fly as an immortal,\nRoaming the eight directions,\nWherever I turn, wherever I wish,\nAll shall be within fortune’s embrace.\"\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One: constantly visualize the Seven Stars of the Dipper inverted above your head, its handle pointing forward. Thus, no hundred evils will dare approach, and baleful *qi* will naturally perish—this is the essential secret.\n\nThose who guard the One must abstain from the five pungent foods and all meat, and avoid entering the homes of women who have recently given birth. On *jia-zi* days, avoid the sight of the severely intoxicated and all that is foul or malodorous—keep your distance and be vigilant, without doubt. Also, do not hold infants or approach birds, beasts, or insects. Do not share clothing or shoes with others, nor the same bed while practicing the One.\n\nTo concentrate on the Real and still the spirit, to invoke the Dao and summon the numinous—all such practices require seclusion, not merely this one method alone.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Golden Portal later received *The Scripture of the Three Primes and the True One*, *The True Talisman of the Emperor of the Great Ultimate*, *The Scripture of the Five Dippers and the True One*, and *The Treasured Chapters of the Emperor of the Great Ultimate*—four essential texts in all. These he transmitted to the immortal Juanzi. Juanzi, while fishing on the river, caught a carp and, upon cutting it open, found a green jade casket. Opening it, he discovered these two talismans and the methods of the two scriptures. This is the esoteric inner method of the Supreme, the supreme Dao of Earthly Perfection. Through it, one may attend the banquets of Shangqing, gaze upon the Great Ultimate, soar through the empty void, and repose in the mysteries of Kunxuan.\n\nAccording to the *Illuminating Statutes of the Four Poles*, the method of the *Luminous Talisman for Nurturing the Spirits of Life* stipulates that all who possess the supreme scriptures of Earthly Perfection must observe transmission deadlines, swearing oaths before the Three Officials, offering silk and blood upon the altar, and sealing the covenant with a divided tally. Only then may the texts be transmitted. The recipient must observe a retreat of a hundred days, or fifty, thirty, ten, or seven days. Only those whose hearts are devoted to the teachings, whose minds are sincere and faithful to the Real, shall be deemed worthy of transmission.\n\nTo guard the Three Primes of the Real, employ the talismans of the Two Emperors, and ascend the Dao of the Five Dippers—this is the supreme Dao of Earthly Perfection. The method allows for the transmission of one person every forty years, and no more than ten in four hundred years. If no suitable recipient is found, transcribe a copy on white silk, seal it, and deposit it in a secluded cave within the Five Marchmounts. Every forty years, another copy must be transcribed and sealed within the Five Marchmounts. The Five Marchmounts need not be all five—only the nearest one will suffice. If no marchmount is near, any renowned mountain will do, such as Mount Baodu in the north, Mount Difu in the west, Mount Luofu or Mount Dahe in the south, or Mount Tiantai or Mount Kuohuo in the east—all are renowned mountains.\n\nIf within forty years ten suitable recipients are found, transmit the texts to them. Beyond the allotted time, no further copies may be released. Those who violate the statutes, breach secrecy, or fail to uphold the precepts will be delivered to the Water Officials, subjected to the torments of the Wind Blade, and their descendants will suffer calamity and annihilation. The covenant sealed with blood oaths was transmitted by the Green Lad to guide later students, serving as an enduring standard.\n\nShould one receive the Scripture of the Three Primordial Perfected Ones, one must perform the covenant rites of oath-swearing and blood-sealing. The covenant safeguards the spirits, the blood-seal steels the heart—thus, no creature may transgress it, nor heaven and earth contravene it.\n\nFor the transmission of the Upper Oneness method, employ forty feet of purple silk and one bright mirror. For the Middle Oneness method, forty feet of crimson silk and two pairs of bracelets. For the Lower Oneness method, white silk in a length matching the recipient’s years—one foot per year—along with two pairs of golden bracelets. The precept-master shall receive these covenant offerings to succor those stranded in forests, marshes, or mountains, or to relieve travelers stricken by sudden illness; they may not be misused for personal gain. Those who violate and fail to uphold these rites shall become lowly ghosts after death, subjected to the torments of the Wind Blade.\n\nFather-to-son transmission likewise requires the same covenant rites. Those who transmit this scripture shall regard one another as master and friend—such is the Dao of heaven and humanity. Whoever receives the Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Guarding Unity shall be deemed the master; the recipient of this scripture shall be the disciple. Thus is the root foundation firmly established, the bitter sincerity of heaven’s truth made manifest, the veneration of spirits and numina upheld, and the hierarchical bonds of master and friend honored.\n\nThe master and friend govern the external, the Three Ones mirror the internal, the Imperial Lord delights in his palace, and the Red Child rejoices in his dwelling. Thereupon, the Purple Chamber shines in the empyrean, the Cinnabar Field radiates brilliance, the Three Elders descend to one’s chamber, and the Three Flowers repose in one’s bedchamber. Those who truly ascend shall mount the Great Auroral Clouds, cross the boundless void, unite their bodies with the wondrous numen, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThose who violate this Way shall be incomplete; those who divulge its prohibitions shall be maimed. Those who hear of this Way shall prolong their years; those who practice it shall become divine immortals. How can one not be vigilant?\n\nYet unless one bears the innate bone of immortality, the mysterious register, or a name inscribed in gold or jade, one shall not even hear of the wondrous Dao of the True One. Some, through past lives of virtuous deeds, have fulfilled three hundred merits; others, through boundless kindness and virtue, have extended benevolence even to birds and beasts; still others, by fate’s conjunction, have met with the spirits—all such as these may attain the Three Ones.\n\nOf old, Prince Jin attained it and rode the crane upon the clouds; Anqi Sheng attained it and traversed the five celestial bodies; Juanzi attained it and ascended to the Great Clarity; the Pillar Historian attained it and soared on the whirlwind to the Northern Darkness. Wondrous indeed is this Dao—it bestows everlasting life.\n\n*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Golden Watchtower Lord’s Five Bushels and Three Ones Illustrated Instructions* #1 (The character *jūn* 君 in the original was written as *jū* 居.)",

If one understands the eight nodes of external almanacs, they ought to follow this accordingly. The eight nodes of the almanac represent the utmost degrees of the celestial pivot, the days when all true immortals, numinous transcendents, and divine luminaries assemble in audience. In the *Spontaneous Method of the Northern Thearch*, the days when the two luminaries align within the lunar cycle are also times of great auspiciousness. These should be used to cultivate and discourse upon the Dao and virtue, uniting them as one.\n\nForeign lands take the first day of the month as *jian* (establishment), the second as *chu* (removal), and so on in sequence. For those in remote places without almanacs, this may be employed. The Xiongnu realm reckons the first day of the first month as *jiayin*, following the cycle of the six *jia* stems, repeating in perpetuity. Their months alternate as follows: the first month long, the second long, the third short, the fourth long, the fifth short, the sixth long, the seventh short, the eighth long, the ninth short, the tenth long, the eleventh short, and the twelfth long. For those secluded in deep forests or cut off from external traces, this too should be followed.\n\nOn each *jian* day, or at dawn on the first day of the month, visualize the Three Ones emerging from the three palaces within oneself and sitting before you.

      "translated_text": "On each *kai* day at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your cap—you may also let your hair down—then comb and tie it again. When finished, softly recite:\n\n\"Three Perfected of the Upper Prime,\nDivine Infant within the Real,\nHair unbound to part the mist,\nAscending to the Terrace of Heaven,\nMarrow’s Gate firm and congealed,\nIn time with the celestial spheres,\nThat I may fly as an immortal,\nTraversing the Terrace of Exchange.\"\n\nWhen finished, swallow saliva nineteen times, then replace your cap and lie down. With focused contemplation, visualize the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, each settled in their palaces, the Emperor and his ministers seated in mutual regard. Call forth the *qi* within their palaces thirty times each. As you do so, also call forth your own *qi* thirty times. To \"call forth *qi*\" means to open the mouth and exhale. At this time, you should feel your body grow warm—this is the sign of harmonized spirit and congealed *hun*-soul.\n\nVisualize the One descending before your eyes, gazing inward into the divine palace. The Dao of visualizing the One is to see the Three Primal *qi* of the Supreme appear within the three palaces. The Three Primal are the three misty hues of purple, azure, and crimson—purple above. Then, while maintaining the visualization of the Three Ones within, imagine the Purple Chamber Jade Palace of the Northern Culmen, where the celestial officials are arrayed in order. Envision yourself seated before the Emperor, petitioning with reverent heart. The Supreme is the Shangqing; the Emperor of Shangqing is the most exalted. The Purple Chamber of the Northern Culmen is the Emperor’s own chamber. Also visualize your Three Ones engaging the Emperor in discourse on the Dao of flying transcendents and the vitality of life.\n\nWhenever partaking of a sumptuous feast, compose your mind and visualize the Three Ones. Imagine the One partaking first, then you may eat. By doing so consistently, perverse *qi* will retreat and true *qi* will draw near. After eating, recite in your heart:\n\n\"Grains enter the stomach,\nUniting with spirit in *qi*,\nFilling and replenishing blood and fluids,\nThe corpse-demons fall away,\nAscending beyond the Golden Pass,\nTo endure with heaven and earth,\nCommanding the Six Dings,\nWith divine youths in attendance.\"\n\nThe method of guarding the One: on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight, sweep and purify a quiet chamber’s courtyard, laying out a mat one *zhang* square. Burn incense, face north, and bow twice—this may also be done in the heart alone. Then gaze upon the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, visualizing purple *qi* emerging from the Dipper and entering the three palaces within your body. Face north, clasp your hands over your thighs, and envision the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself together riding the purple *qi* to ascend the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is the Northern Dipper. Let your body and form fade away, as if in a trance of ascending to heaven—thus is the Dao of immortality near. The immortals call this the Great Stillness.\n\nOn rainy days, you may practice this on your bed or prepare an altar in a clean space, one *zhang* square, enclosed by a fence several *chi* high on all sides. Perform this regularly on the appointed days—this is the Dao of the Great Stillness.\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One: at the time of the moon’s first appearance, face it and bow twice. When finished, recite in your heart:\n\n\"Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin,\nLady of the Radiant Moon,\nNewborn streaming light,\nIlluminating my three palaces,\nThat I may fly as an immortal,\nRoaming the eight directions,\nWherever I turn, wherever I wish,\nAll shall be within fortune’s embrace.\"\n\nThe Dao of guarding the One: constantly visualize the Seven Stars of the Dipper inverted above your head, its handle pointing forward. Thus, no hundred evils will dare approach, and baleful *qi* will naturally perish—this is the essential secret.\n\nThose who guard the One must abstain from the five pungent foods and all meat, and avoid entering the homes of women who have recently given birth. On *jia-zi* days, avoid the sight of the severely intoxicated and all that is foul or malodorous—keep your distance and be vigilant, without doubt. Also, do not hold infants or approach birds, beasts, or insects. Do not share clothing or shoes with others, nor the same bed while practicing the One.\n\nTo concentrate on the Real and still the spirit, to invoke the Dao and summon the numinous—all such practices require seclusion, not merely this one method alone.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Golden Portal later received *The Scripture of the Three Primes and the True One*, *The True Talisman of the Emperor of the Great Ultimate*, *The Scripture of the Five Dippers and the True One*, and *The Treasured Chapters of the Emperor of the Great Ultimate*—four essential texts in all. These he transmitted to the immortal Juanzi. Juanzi, while fishing on the river, caught a carp and, upon cutting it open, found a green jade casket. Opening it, he discovered these two talismans and the methods of the two scriptures. This is the esoteric inner method of the Supreme, the supreme Dao of Earthly Perfection. Through it, one may attend the banquets of Shangqing, gaze upon the Great Ultimate, soar through the empty void, and repose in the mysteries of Kunxuan.\n\nAccording to the *Illuminating Statutes of the Four Poles*, the method of the *Luminous Talisman for Nurturing the Spirits of Life* stipulates that all who possess the supreme scriptures of Earthly Perfection must observe transmission deadlines, swearing oaths before the Three Officials, offering silk and blood upon the altar, and sealing the covenant with a divided tally. Only then may the texts be transmitted. The recipient must observe a retreat of a hundred days, or fifty, thirty, ten, or seven days. Only those whose hearts are devoted to the teachings, whose minds are sincere and faithful to the Real, shall be deemed worthy of transmission.\n\nTo guard the Three Primes of the Real, employ the talismans of the Two Emperors, and ascend the Dao of the Five Dippers—this is the supreme Dao of Earthly Perfection. The method allows for the transmission of one person every forty years, and no more than ten in four hundred years. If no suitable recipient is found, transcribe a copy on white silk, seal it, and deposit it in a secluded cave within the Five Marchmounts. Every forty years, another copy must be transcribed and sealed within the Five Marchmounts. The Five Marchmounts need not be all five—only the nearest one will suffice. If no marchmount is near, any renowned mountain will do, such as Mount Baodu in the north, Mount Difu in the west, Mount Luofu or Mount Dahe in the south, or Mount Tiantai or Mount Kuohuo in the east—all are renowned mountains.\n\nIf within forty years ten suitable recipients are found, transmit the texts to them. Beyond the allotted time, no further copies may be released. Those who violate the statutes, breach secrecy, or fail to uphold the precepts will be delivered to the Water Officials, subjected to the torments of the Wind Blade, and their descendants will suffer calamity and annihilation. The covenant sealed with blood oaths was transmitted by the Green Lad to guide later students, serving as an enduring standard.",

The covenant safeguards the spirits, the blood-seal steels the heart—thus, no creature may transgress it, nor heaven and earth contravene it.\n\nFor the transmission of the Upper Oneness method, employ forty feet of purple silk and one bright mirror. For the Middle Oneness method, forty feet of crimson silk and two pairs of bracelets. For the Lower Oneness method, white silk in a length matching the recipient’s years—one foot per year—along with two pairs of golden bracelets. The precept-master shall receive these covenant offerings to succor those stranded in forests, marshes, or mountains, or to relieve travelers stricken by sudden illness; they may not be misused for personal gain. Those who violate and fail to uphold these rites shall become lowly ghosts after death, subjected to the torments of the Wind Blade.\n\nFather-to-son transmission likewise requires the same covenant rites. Those who transmit this scripture shall regard one another as master and friend—such is the Dao of heaven and humanity. Whoever receives the Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Guarding Unity shall be deemed the master; the recipient of this scripture shall be the disciple. Thus is the root foundation firmly established, the bitter sincerity of heaven’s truth made manifest, the veneration of spirits and numina upheld, and the hierarchical bonds of master and friend honored.\n\nThe master and friend govern the external, the Three Ones mirror the internal, the Imperial Lord delights in his palace, and the Red Child rejoices in his dwelling. Thereupon, the Purple Chamber shines in the empyrean, the Cinnabar Field radiates brilliance, the Three Elders descend to one’s chamber, and the Three Flowers repose in one’s bedchamber. Those who truly ascend shall mount the Great Auroral Clouds, cross the boundless void, unite their bodies with the wondrous numen, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThose who violate this Way shall be incomplete; those who divulge its prohibitions shall be maimed. Those who hear of this Way shall prolong their years; those who practice it shall become divine immortals. How can one not be vigilant?\n\nYet unless one bears the innate bone of immortality, the mysterious register, or a name inscribed in gold or jade, one shall not even hear of the wondrous Dao of the True One. Some, through past lives of virtuous deeds, have fulfilled three hundred merits; others, through boundless kindness and virtue, have extended benevolence even to birds and beasts; still others, by fate’s conjunction, have met with the spirits—all such as these may attain the Three Ones.\n\nOf old, Prince Jin attained it and rode the crane upon the clouds; Anqi Sheng attained it and traversed the five celestial bodies; Juanzi attained it and ascended to the Great Clarity; the Pillar Historian attained it and soared on the whirlwind to the Northern Darkness.
