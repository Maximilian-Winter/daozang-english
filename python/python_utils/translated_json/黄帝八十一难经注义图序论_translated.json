The *Records of the Historian* (*Shǐjì Lièzhuàn*) states: *\"Biānqué, surname Qín, given name Yuèrén.\"* This is the same as **Yáng Xióng’s** reference to \"Biānqué of Lǔ.\" Through hypothetical question-and-answer exchanges resolving doubts, it comprises **eighty-one treatises**, hence its name.\n\nThe rise of medical classics began with **Huangdi**, so it is attributed to him to clarify its authority—all teachings derive from transmission, not private speculation. Though extant commentaries by **Lǚ Guǎng** and **Yáng Xuāncāo** exist, they are superficial and distorted by heterodox interpretations. Later annotators compounded confusion with verbose, unworthy additions. Thus, the *Difficulties Classic’s* profound meanings remain obscured, and physicians cannot rely on its teachings for practical application.\n\nUpon reading this text, I ventured to interpret the ancients’ intent, providing elucidations and, at the conclusion, summarizing its core principles while integrating discussions from the *Suwen* (*Plain Questions*) and illustrating them. Where **Yáng Xuāncāo’s** commentary harmed the original meaning, I critically annotated and refuted his errors. Only then does the essence of pulse diagnosis become clear—physicians may examine it to discern truth from falsehood and reject erroneous doctrines.\n\n---\n\n**Illustrations (Continued):**\n\n**Diagram of the Three Burners’ *Rongwei* (Nourishing-Defensive) Circulation and Yin-Yang**\n\n**Five *Zang* Organs and Three *Fu* Viscera with Yin-Yang Differentiation**\n**Three-Part Pulse Diagram**\n**Nine-Position Pulse (*Jiǔhòu*) Diagram**\n\n**Diagram of Yin-Yang Excess-Deficiency in Cold Damage (*Shānghán*) Pulse Pathologies**\n- *Floating* pulses indicate **Yang excess** (overabundance) or **Yin deficiency** (insufficiency).\n  - *Floating in the Yin region* signifies **Yang transforming into Yin**.\n- *Cun* (inch) pulse: **Yang**—should be slightly floating.\n  *Chi* (foot) pulse: **Yin**—should be slightly sunken.\n- *Sunken* pulses indicate **Yang deficiency** (insufficiency) or **Yin excess** (overabundance).\n  - *Sunken in the Yang region* signifies **Yin usurping Yang**.\n- **Yang excess** manifests as external heat, headache, restlessness, fullness, and sweating—**death ensues**.\n  **Yin excess** causes external heat with **fire blocked**—**ten cases perish**.\n- **Yang disease (heat)**: Yang predominance → **no sweating**.\n  **Yin disease (cold)**: Yin predominance → **excessive sweating, cold body**.\n- **Yang deficiency**: External cold, **limbs cold backward**, sweating → **recovery**.\n  **Yin excess**: Internal cold, **lower abdomen urgent pain** → **death**.\n\n**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency in the *Zang-Fu* Organs and Yin-Yang Pulse Manifestations**\n- **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera (excess).\n- **Floating (浮)** = Yang (e.g., **heart and lungs both floating**).\n  - *Suwen*: \"Precision *qi* depleted\" → *Difficulties Classic*: \"Needle pulse\" = **deficiency**.\n  - *Suwen*: \"Pathogenic *qi* lodged\" → *Difficulties Classic*: \"Stable pulse\" = **excess**.\n- **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs (deficiency).\n- **Sunken (沉)** = Yin (e.g., **kidneys and liver both sunken**).\n- **Clear (清)** = **Lung** (Yin within Yang) → pulse **floating and clear**; excessively clear = **lung pulse**; slightly clear = **large intestine pulse**.\n- **Large (大)** = **Heart** (Yang within Yang) → pulse **floating and large**; excessively large = **heart pulse**; slightly large = **small intestine pulse**.\n- **Moderate-Slack (中缓)** = **Spleen** (Yin-Yang balance, body of deficiency) → pulse **moderate and slack**; excessively slack = **spleen pulse**; slightly slack = **stomach pulse**.\n- **Taut (弦)** = **Liver** (Yang within Yin) → pulse **sunken and taut**; excessively taut = **liver pulse**; slightly taut = **gallbladder pulse**.\n- **Small (小)** = **Kidney** (Yin within Yin) → pulse **sunken and small**; excessively small = **kidney pulse**; slightly small = **bladder pulse**.\n\n**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency Pulse and Life-and-Death Prognosis**\n- **Deficient pulse**: Weak arrival → **insufficiency**, disease **internal**.\n- **Excess pulse**: Strong arrival → **overabundance**, disease **external**.\n  - **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera.\n  - **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs.\n\n**Liver Pulse (弦长)**\n- **One breath, two arrivals** = **normal**.\n- **Three arrivals** = **deviates from classic**.\n- **Four arrivals** = **depletes essence**.\n- **Five arrivals** = **death**.\n- **Six arrivals** = **life extinct**.\n\n**Deficient Pulse (损脉)**\n- **One breath, one arrival** = **deviates from classic**.\n- **Two breaths, one arrival** = **depletes essence**.\n- **Three breaths, one arrival** = **death**.\n- **Four breaths, one arrival** = **life extinct**.\n\n**Heart Pulse (心脉浮大)**\n- **Floating and large**, one breath two arrivals, one inhalation two arrivals—**not too large nor too small** = **normal**.\n- **Spleen Pulse (脾脉中缓)**\n  - **Moderately slack** = **normal**.\n    - One breath three arrivals, one inhalation three arrivals = **harmonious adaptation**.\n- **Lung Pulse (肺脉短墙)**\n  - **Short and tight** = **illness onset**.\n    - One breath four arrivals, one inhalation four arrivals = **disease progression**.\n- **Kidney Pulse (肾脉沉小)**\n  - **Deep and small** = **disease worsening**.\n    - One breath five arrivals, one inhalation five arrivals = **critical illness**.\n  - **The patient shall be distressed**.\n    - One breath six arrivals, one inhalation six arrivals = **pulse of death**.\n\n**Diagram of the Inner Front (Left Side) Pulse Locations**\nYang Xuan’s annotation of the *Nan Jing* states:\n- The **left wrist’s *cun* (寸) position**—where the **Heart** and **Small Intestine** pulses emerge. #1\n- The **left wrist’s *chi* (尺) middle**—where the **Kidney** and **Bladder** pulses emerge.\n- The **right wrist’s *cun* (寸) position**—where the **Lung** and **Large Intestine** pulses emerge.\n- The **upper *guan* (关) position**—where the **Spleen** and **Stomach** pulses emerge.\n- The **right wrist’s *chi* (尺) middle**—where the **Gate of Life** and **Triple Burner** pulses emerge.\n\n**Hypothetical Scenario:**\nIf the **left wrist’s *cun* pulse** is **floating**, it is the **Small Intestine** pulse;\nIf it is **deep**, it is the **Heart** pulse.\n\nThis teaching originates in *Pulse Law Praise* (脉法赞), but its detailed exposition appears in *The Pulse Classic* (脉经). The error lies in conflating *cun* (寸) with *cun-kou* (寸口), so the **upper *guan* (关)** and **middle *chi* (尺)** positions were later added. Though *Zhong Jing* (仲景) also mentions *cun-kou*, *guan-shang* (关上), and *chi-zhong* (尺中), he dared not alter the pulse law without proper verification. Later generations, even eminent physicians, failed to distinguish these correctly due to their ingrained habits, thus unable to discern the **pulses of the Five *Zang* Organs**. This diagram of **Excess-Deficiency *Zang*-*Fu* Pulses** was refined in the Jin Dynasty (晋).\n\n**Diagram of the Inner Rear (Back) Pulse Locations (正面图 / 背面图)**\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of the Heaven-Earth Yin-Yang Ascend-Descend Beginning-and-End (天地阴阳升降始终之图)**\nTwo Difficulties in Pulse Diagrams (二难画图)\nThese two difficulties and all diagrams that follow are **subsidiary diagrams** (下注图).\nIn all the diagrams below, **Yin and Yang channels** (黑白道) are marked internally to distinguish the **Yin-Yang beginning-and-end** (升降终始).\nThe **Heaven Gate** (天门) and **Earth Gate** (地户), **Human Gate** (人门) and **Ghost Gate** (鬼门), are the **Yin-Yang ascend-descend critical junctions and gateways** (阴阳升降关格门户).\nThe **Qi Mouth** (气口) and **Ren Ying** (人迎), as well as the **left and right Spirit Gates** (左右神门), are the **gateways for inhalation-exhalation and pulse depth measurements** (呼吸上下尺寸关格门户).\n\nYin-qi begins at **Establishment of Autumn** (立秋) and Yang-qi ends at **Establishment of Winter** (立冬).\nYin-qi ends at **Establishment of Summer** (立夏) and Yang-qi begins at **Establishment of Spring** (立春).\n\n**Diagram of the Yin-Yang Flow of Hands and Feet, Beginning-and-End (手足阴阳流注始终之图)**\nPulse depth measurements of **Yin and Yang** (尺寸阴阳) follow the rhythm of inhalation-exhalation, tracing the **beginning-and-end diagram** (上引始终图) above.\nYin is **enveloped** (裹), reaching inward to the *cun* (寸内) as one inhales.\nYang is **superficial** (表), extending outward to the *chi* (尺外) as one exhales.\n\n**Three Difficulties in Pulse Diagrams (三难画图)**\nWhen diagnosing pulses at the **wrist’s posterior** (掌后), the markings should be **tightly arranged** (约文), with the three fingers pressed closely (密排三指头).\nThe region **half-finger before** (半指之前) is the **inner *cun*** (寸内), the **Yang-within-Yang** (阳中之阳).\nThe region **half-finger after** (半指之后) is the **outer *cun*** (寸外), the **Yang-within-Yin** (阳中之阴).\nThe **upper *guan* (关上)**—half-finger before the second finger—is **Yang** (阳), while the **lower *guan* (关下)**—half-finger after—is **Yin** (阴).\nThe **outer *chi* (尺外)**—half-finger before the third finger—is **Yang** (阳), while the **inner *chi* (尺内)**—half-finger after—is **Yin** (阴).\n\nWhen the **outer *cun* pulse is Yang, it is floating and dispersed** (寸外阳浮散);\nWhen the **inner *cun* pulse is Yin, it is floating and large** (寸内阴浮大).\nWhen the **upper *guan* pulse is Yang, it is taut and long** (关上阳弦长);\nWhen the **lower *guan* pulse is Yin, it is dense and frequent** (关下阴弥繁).\nWhen the **outer *chi* pulse is Yang, it is deep and slippery** (尺外阳沉滑);\nWhen the **inner *chi* pulse is Yin, it is deep and moist** (尺内阴沉濡).\n\nThis outlines the **Yin-Yang pulses of the left hand** (此左手脉之阴阳).\nBy observing the **pulse’s condition** (脉状), one may clarify its **covering and constriction** (覆缢).\nThis diagram also reveals the **Ren Ying and Qi Mouth** (人迎气口), the **left and right Spirit Gates** (左右神门), and the **single division of the *cun*, *chi*, and *guan* regions** (寸尺关前关后一分接).\n\nAccording to *The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine* (《素问》):\nThe **Ren Ying and Qi Mouth** (人迎气口) are located at the **neck**, modeling **Heaven and Earth** (天地), and marking the **beginning-and-end gateways** (始终之门户).\n\n**Diagram of the Eighteen Difficulties in Pulse Diagnosis (十八难画图)**\nThe **old commentary** (旧经注) states:\nThe **left hand’s Heart pulse** (手心) governs the **Heart’s Pericardial Pulse** (主心包络脉).\nThe **left hand’s Minor Yang pulse** (手少阳) governs the **San Jiao pulse** (三焦脉).\nThus, they are **combined as the left hand’s central region** (故合为左手中部).\nThe **right foot’s Major Yin pulse** (足太阴) governs the **Spleen pulse** (脾脉).\nThe **right foot’s Yang Brightness pulse** (足阳明) governs the **Stomach pulse** (胃脉).\nThus, they are **combined as the right hand’s central region** (故合为右手中部).\nThis text makes such distinctions.\n\nHowever, if one follows *Pulse Classic’s Canonical Pairings* (脉《经配》三部), the divisions differ again.\n\nThe **old commentary** (旧经) holds this view, but the **earlier annotation** (前注) was in error. This diagram is fully presented to correct its text.\n\nYang Shi said: The **left hand’s Heart pulse** (手心) governs the **Heart’s Pericardial Pulse** (心包络脉), the **left hand’s Minor Yang pulse** (手少阳) governs the **San Jiao pulse** (三焦脉), thus they are **combined as the left hand’s upper region** (故合为左手上部).\nThe **right foot’s Major Yin pulse** (足太阴) governs the **Spleen pulse** (脾脉), the **right foot’s Yang Brightness pulse** (足阳明) governs the **Stomach pulse** (胃脉), thus they are **combined as the left hand’s middle region** (故合为左手中部).\nThis text makes such distinctions.\nIf one follows *Pulse Classic’s Canonical Pairings* (《脉经》配三部), the divisions differ again.\nThis method Yang Shi could not clarify its principle, hence his differing statement.\n\nThe teacher then reverses the three regions to correspond with the **Five Phases** (五行) and **Six Qi** (六气), stating:\nThis **Cun** (寸) and **Chi** (尺) [pulse positions], when reversed, again follow the three regions, asking: Which pulse does each region govern?\nHe explained:\nThe **upper region** (上部) follows **Heaven** (天), governing **illnesses above the chest to the head** (胸以上至头有疾);\nThe **middle region** (中部) follows **Man** (人), governing **illnesses below the diaphragm to above the navel** (鬲下至脐上有疾);\nThe **lower region** (下部) follows **Earth** (地), governing **illnesses below the navel to the feet** (脐以下至足有疾).\nHence the saying: *\"Examine and then determine the sequence\"* (故言审而次之者也).\n\nAgain, Wang Shuhu reversed his own sequence, starting from the **left Cun** (左寸) and proceeding inversely:\n**Left hand**: **Heart** (心), **Small Intestine** (小肠), **Liver** (肝), **Gallbladder** (胆), **Kidney** (肾);\n**Right hand**: **Lung** (肺), **Large Intestine** (大肠), **Spleen** (脾), **Stomach** (胃), **Command** (命);\nFor women, this sequence is reversed.\nExamining from the back, the **Chi pulse** (尺脉) aligns with the third region for diagnosing **interrupted illnesses** (断病).\nIndeed, both **Chi pulses** (两尺), when reversed, govern **illnesses below the navel to the feet** (脐以下至足有疾), hence the saying: *\"Examine and then determine the sequence\"* (扁鹊云审而次之), and Wang Shuhu said: *\"One must carefully seek and follow the pulse of the Heart’s Child\"* (王叔和云用心子细须寻趁).\n\n**Right hand diagnosis**:\n- **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Fire** (火) ascends in flames (炎上) and cannot descend to **generate** (生) the **Hand Heart** (手心), which governs **Minor Yang Fire** (少阳火).\n- **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (足厥阴): **Wood** (木) generates (生) the **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴), where the **Lord Fire** (君火) resides.\n- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下) and cannot ascend to **generate** (生) the **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴), where **Minor Yang Wood** (少阳木) resides.\n\n**Left hand diagnosis**:\n- **Hand Heart** (手心): **Minor Yang Relative Fire** (少阳相火) generates (生).\n- **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) and **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).\n- **Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) and **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).\n- **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).\n- **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).\n- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下).\n\n**Diagram of the Sixty-Seventh Difficulty: The Canonical Pairings of Jing-Well, Ying-Spring, and Shu-Stream Points (井荣俞经合图)**\nThis diagram clarifies the **beginning-and-end gateways** (始终) of the **canals and collaterals** (经络) and the **origins** (原) of the **Five Zang** (五藏) and **Six Fu** (六府).\n\n**Hand Jueyin** (手厥阴) **Heart’s Pericardial Canal** (心包络之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Zhong Chong** (中冲) point, located at the tip of the middle finger (手中指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tian Di** (天地) point, located one **cun** below the armpit and behind the nipple (腋下乳后一寸), at the junction of the ribs (胁肋问).\n\n**Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) **Lung Canal** (肺之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao-Shang** (少商) point, located on the inner side of the thumb (手大指内侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhong Fu** (中府) point, located one **cun** below the **Yun Men** (云门) point, three ribs above the nipple (乳上三肋问).\n\n**Hand Yangming** (手阳明) **Large Intestine Canal** (大肠之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shang Yang** (商阳) point, located on the side of the thumb’s adjacent finger (手大指次指之侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ying Xiang** (迎香) point, located above the **He Jiao** (禾胶) point beside the nostrils (鼻孔旁).\n\n**Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) **Small Intestine Canal** (小肠之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Ze** (少泽) point, located at the tip of the little finger (手小指之端), one **fen** below the fingernail (去爪甲下一分).\n\n**Hand Shaoyang** (手少阳) **San Jiao Canal** (三焦之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Guan Wei** (关卫) point, located on the side of the little finger’s adjacent

*Ling Shu* (《灵枢经》) states: *\"Shaoyin has no Shu point—does it not treat illness?\"*\nThis refers to **external** (外) canal illness, meaning it **treats external but not internal** (故治外不治内), hence the **Shaoyin True Heart** (少阴真心) aligns with the **Lord Fire** (君火) position, treating **external but not internal** (故不治内而治外).\n\n**Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴) **True Heart Canal** (真心之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Chong** (少冲) point, located on the inner side of the little finger (手小指内侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ji Quan** (极泉) point, located in the armpit beneath the **Sheng Nei** (声内) point, between the tendons at the **dynamic pulse** (动脉).\n\n**Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) **Liver Canal** (肝之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Da Dun** (大敦) point, located at the tip of the big toe (足大指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Qi Men** (期门) point, located one **cun** and five **fen** beside the **Bu Rong** (不容) point, at the end of the second rib (二肋端).\n\n**Foot Yangming** (足阳明) **Stomach Canal** (胃之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Li Duo** (厉兑) point, located at the tip of the big toe’s adjacent toe (足大指次指之端), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tou Wei** (头维) point, located one **cun** and five **fen** beside the **Ben Shen** (本神) point at the hairline on the forehead (中额角发际).\n\n**Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) **Bladder Canal** (膀胱之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Jing Ming** (睛明) point, located beside the **Pi Li** (毗泪) point at the inner corner of the eye (目内).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhi Yin** (至阴) point, located on the outer side of the little toe (足小指外侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n\n**Foot Shaoyin** (足少阴) **Kidney Canal** (肾之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Yong Quan** (涌泉) point, located in the depression of the sole (足心陷中), found by curling the toes inward (屈足卷指宛宛中).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Yu Fu** (俞府) point, located two **cun** beside the **Nan Xing** (难玑) point, at the **Ju Gu** (巨骨) point.\n\n**Foot Shaoyang** (足少阳) **Gallbladder

Ti** (瞳子体) point, located five **fen** beside the outer corner of the eye (目外毗).\n\n**Foot Taiyin** (足太阴) **Spleen Canal** (脾之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Yin Bai** (隐白) point, located between the big toe’s inner side (足大指内侧之间), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Da Bao** (大包) point, located three **cun** below the **Yuan Ye** (渊腋) point, at the junction of the ninth rib (九肋问).\n\n---\n**Annotations for technical terms**:\n- **Jing-Well, Ying-Spring, Shu-Stream** (井荣俞): Pulse diagnosis points categorized as Jing (Well), Ying (Spring), and Shu (Stream) points.\n- **Zang** (藏): The **Five Zang** (五藏) are the solid organs—Heart (心), Lung (肺), Liver (肝), Spleen (脾), Kidney (肾).\n- **Fu** (府): The **Six Fu** (六府) are the

The *Records of the Historian* (*Shǐjì Lièzhuàn*) states: *\"Biānqué, surname Qín, given name Yuèrén.\"* This is the same as **Yáng Xióng’s** reference to \"Biānqué of Lǔ.\" Through hypothetical question-and-answer exchanges resolving doubts, it comprises **eighty-one treatises**, hence its name.\n\nThe rise of medical classics began with **Huangdi**, so it is attributed to him to clarify its authority—all teachings derive from transmission, not private speculation. Though extant commentaries by **Lǚ Guǎng** and **Yáng Xuāncāo** exist, they are superficial and distorted by heterodox interpretations. Later annotators compounded confusion with verbose, unworthy additions. Thus, the *Difficulties Classic’s* profound meanings remain obscured, and physicians cannot rely on its teachings for practical application.\n\nUpon reading this text, I ventured to interpret the ancients’ intent, providing elucidations and, at the conclusion, summarizing its core principles while integrating discussions from the *Suwen* (*Plain Questions*) and illustrating them. Where **Yáng Xuāncāo’s** commentary harmed the original meaning, I critically annotated and refuted his errors. Only then does the essence of pulse diagnosis become clear—physicians may examine it to discern truth from falsehood and reject erroneous doctrines.\n\n---\n\n**Illustrations (Continued):**\n\n**Diagram of the Three Burners’ *Rongwei* (Nourishing-Defensive) Circulation and Yin-Yang**\n\n**Five *Zang* Organs and Three *Fu* Viscera with Yin-Yang Differentiation**\n**Three-Part Pulse Diagram**\n**Nine-Position Pulse (*Jiǔhòu*) Diagram**\n\n**Diagram of Yin-Yang Excess-Deficiency in Cold Damage (*Shānghán*) Pulse Pathologies**\n- *Floating* pulses indicate **Yang excess** (overabundance) or **Yin deficiency** (insufficiency).\n  - *Floating in the Yin region* signifies **Yang transforming into Yin**.\n- *Cun* (inch) pulse: **Yang**—should be slightly floating.\n  *Chi* (foot) pulse: **Yin**—should be slightly sunken.\n- *Sunken* pulses indicate **Yang deficiency** (insufficiency) or **Yin excess** (overabundance).\n  - *Sunken in the Yang region* signifies **Yin usurping Yang**.\n- **Yang excess** manifests as external heat, headache, restlessness, fullness, and sweating—**death ensues**.\n  **Yin excess** causes external heat with **fire blocked**—**ten cases perish**.\n- **Yang disease (heat)**: Yang predominance → **no sweating**.\n  **Yin disease (cold)**: Yin predominance → **excessive sweating, cold body**.\n- **Yang deficiency**: External cold, **limbs cold backward**, sweating → **recovery**.\n  **Yin excess**: Internal cold, **lower abdomen urgent pain** → **death**.\n\n**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency in the *Zang-Fu* Organs and Yin-Yang Pulse Manifestations**\n- **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera (excess).\n- **Floating (浮)** = Yang (e.g., **heart and lungs both floating**).\n  - *Suwen*: \"Precision *qi* depleted\" → *Difficulties Classic*: \"Needle pulse\" = **deficiency**.\n  - *Suwen*: \"Pathogenic *qi* lodged\" → *Difficulties Classic*: \"Stable pulse\" = **excess**.\n- **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs (deficiency).\n- **Sunken (沉)** = Yin (e.g., **kidneys and liver both sunken**).\n- **Clear (清)** = **Lung** (Yin within Yang) → pulse **floating and clear**; excessively clear = **lung pulse**; slightly clear = **large intestine pulse**.\n- **Large (大)** = **Heart** (Yang within Yang) → pulse **floating and large**; excessively large = **heart pulse**; slightly large = **small intestine pulse**.\n- **Moderate-Slack (中缓)** = **Spleen** (Yin-Yang balance, body of deficiency) → pulse **moderate and slack**; excessively slack = **spleen pulse**; slightly slack = **stomach pulse**.\n- **Taut (弦)** = **Liver** (Yang within Yin) → pulse **sunken and taut**; excessively taut = **liver pulse**; slightly taut = **gallbladder pulse**.\n- **Small (小)** = **Kidney** (Yin within Yin) → pulse **sunken and small**; excessively small = **kidney pulse**; slightly small = **bladder pulse**.\n\n**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency Pulse and Life-and-Death Prognosis**\n- **Deficient pulse**: Weak arrival → **insufficiency**, disease **internal**.\n- **Excess pulse**: Strong arrival → **overabundance**, disease **external**.\n  - **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera.\n  - **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs.\n\n**Liver Pulse (弦长)**\n- **One breath, two arrivals** = **normal**.\n- **Three arrivals** = **deviates from classic**.\n- **Four arrivals** = **depletes essence**.\n- **Five arrivals** = **death**.\n- **Six arrivals** = **life extinct**.\n\n**Deficient Pulse (损脉)**\n- **One breath, one arrival** = **deviates from classic**.\n- **Two breaths, one arrival** = **depletes essence**.\n- **Three breaths, one arrival** = **death**.\n- **Four breaths, one arrival** = **life extinct**.",

(脐以下至足有疾).\nHence the saying: *\"Examine and then determine the sequence\"* (故言审而次之者也).\n\nAgain, Wang Shuhu reversed his own sequence, starting from the **left Cun** (左寸) and proceeding inversely:\n**Left hand**: **Heart** (心), **Small Intestine** (小肠), **Liver** (肝), **Gallbladder** (胆), **Kidney** (肾);\n**Right hand**: **Lung** (肺), **Large Intestine** (大肠), **Spleen** (脾), **Stomach** (胃), **Command** (命);\nFor women, this sequence is reversed.\nExamining from the back, the **Chi pulse** (尺脉) aligns with the third region for diagnosing **interrupted illnesses** (断病).\nIndeed, both **Chi pulses** (两尺), when reversed, govern **illnesses below the navel to the feet** (脐以下至足有疾), hence the saying: *\"Examine and then determine the sequence\"* (扁鹊云审而次之), and Wang Shuhu said: *\"One must carefully seek and follow the pulse of the Heart’s Child\"* (王叔和云用心子细须寻趁).\n\n**Right hand diagnosis**:\n- **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Fire** (火) ascends in flames (炎上) and cannot descend to **generate** (生) the **Hand Heart** (手心), which governs **Minor Yang Fire** (少阳火).\n- **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (足厥阴): **Wood** (木) generates (生) the **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴), where the **Lord Fire** (君火) resides.\n- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下) and cannot ascend to **generate** (生) the **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴), where **Minor Yang Wood** (少阳木) resides.\n\n**Left hand diagnosis**:\n- **Hand Heart** (手心): **Minor Yang Relative Fire** (少阳相火) generates (生).\n- **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) and **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).\n- **Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) and **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).\n- **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).\n- **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).\n- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下).\n\n**Diagram of the Sixty-Seventh Difficulty: The Canonical Pairings of Jing-Well, Ying-Spring, and Shu-Stream Points (井荣俞经合图)**\nThis diagram clarifies the **beginning-and-end gateways** (始终) of the **canals and collaterals** (经络) and the **origins** (原) of the **Five Zang** (五藏) and **Six Fu** (六府).\n\n**Hand Jueyin** (手厥阴) **Heart’s Pericardial Canal** (心包络之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Zhong Chong** (中冲) point, located at the tip of the middle finger (手中指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tian Di** (天地) point, located one **cun** below the armpit and behind the nipple (腋下乳后一寸), at the junction of the ribs (胁肋问).\n\n**Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) **Lung Canal** (肺之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao-Shang** (少商) point, located on the inner side of the thumb (手大指内侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhong Fu** (中府) point, located one **cun** below the **Yun Men** (云门) point, three ribs above the nipple (乳上三肋问).\n\n**Hand Yangming** (手阳明) **Large Intestine Canal** (大肠之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shang Yang** (商阳) point, located on the side of the thumb’s adjacent finger (手大指次指之侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ying Xiang** (迎香) point, located above the **He Jiao** (禾胶) point beside the nostrils (鼻孔旁).\n\n**Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) **Small Intestine Canal** (小肠之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Ze** (少泽) point, located at the tip of the little finger (手小指之端), one **fen** below the fingernail (去爪甲下一分).\n\n**Hand Shaoyang** (手少阳) **San Jiao Canal** (三焦之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Guan Wei** (关卫) point, located on the side of the little finger’s adjacent

*Ling Shu* (《灵枢经》) states: *\"Shaoyin has no Shu point—does it not treat illness?\"*\nThis refers to **external** (外) canal illness, meaning it **treats external but not internal** (故治外不治内), hence the **Shaoyin True Heart** (少阴真心) aligns with the **Lord Fire** (君火) position, treating **external but not internal** (故不治内而治外).\n\n**Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴) **True Heart Canal** (真心之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Chong** (少冲) point, located on the inner side of the little finger (手小指内侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ji Quan** (极泉) point, located in the armpit beneath the **Sheng Nei** (声内) point, between the tendons at the **dynamic pulse** (动脉).\n\n**Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) **Liver Canal** (肝之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Da Dun** (大敦) point, located at the tip of the big toe (足大指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Qi Men** (期门) point, located one **cun** and five **fen** beside the **Bu Rong** (不容) point, at the end of the second rib (二肋端).\n\n**Foot Yangming** (足阳明) **Stomach Canal** (胃之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Li Duo** (厉兑) point, located at the tip of the big toe’s adjacent toe (足大指次指之端), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tou Wei** (头维) point, located one **cun** and five **fen** beside the **Ben Shen** (本神) point at the hairline on the forehead (中额角发际).\n\n**Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) **Bladder Canal** (膀胱之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Jing Ming** (睛明) point, located beside the **Pi Li** (毗泪) point at the inner corner of the eye (目内).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhi Yin** (至阴) point, located on the outer side of the little toe (足小指外侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n\n**Foot Shaoyin** (足少阴) **Kidney Canal** (肾之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Yong Quan** (涌泉) point, located in the depression of the sole (足心陷中), found by curling the toes inward (屈足卷指宛宛中).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Yu Fu** (俞府) point, located two **cun** beside the **Nan Xing** (难玑) point, at the **Ju Gu** (巨骨) point.\n\n**Foot Shaoyang** (足少阳) **Gallbladder Canal** (胆之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Qiao Yin** (窍阴) point, located at the tip of the little toe’s adjacent toe (足小指次指之端), like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tong Zi Ti** (瞳子体) point, located five **fen** beside the outer corner of the eye (目外毗).\n\n**Foot Taiyin** (足太阴) **Spleen Canal** (脾之经):\n- **Originates** (起) at the **Yin Bai** (隐白) point, located between the big toe’s inner side (足大指内侧之间), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).\n- **Terminates** (终) at the **Da Bao** (大包) point, located three **cun** below the **Yuan Ye** (渊腋) point, at the junction of the ninth rib (九肋问).\n\n---\n**Annotations for technical terms**:\n- **Jing-Well, Ying-Spring, Shu-Stream** (井荣俞): Pulse diagnosis points categorized as Jing (Well),
