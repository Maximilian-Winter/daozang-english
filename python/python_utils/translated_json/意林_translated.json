  "full_translation": "**Preface to *Yilin* by Dai Shulun, Prefect of Fuzhou**\n\nThe Three Sages transmitted their teachings in succession, and the *Great Change* shone forth in brilliance. Thus, the work of Heaven and Earth was established, and the labor of classics and commentaries arose, assisting in the perfection of singular virtue—this is called the Six Arts.\n\nWhen the Han inherited the legacy of Qin, the Dao was just beginning to flourish. Offices for lecture, study, instruction, and transmission were established to clarify the proper relations between ruler and minister, father and son. Though rites and music were incomplete, this was sufficient to renew the great principles of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness.\n\nAs for the writings of Zengzi, Confucius, Xunzi, and Mencius, they number in the hundreds and thousands, all unfolding subtleties, aiding the cultivation of customs, venerating the Dao of the Ru, upholding the law and rectifying names, deploying strategies and establishing authority, adapting to essentials, exalting frugality while maintaining distinctions, aligning with agriculture to achieve order, and proceeding laterally without straying. Yet minor works, though freed from rigidity, vary greatly in length, and few are complete in the collections of scholar-officials.\n\nDuring the Liang Dynasty, Yu Zhongrong of Yingchuan abridged their essentials into a compendium of thirty juan, intending to broaden the search for diverse teachings. However, the foundation of their doctrines was not always pursued in full.\n\nMa Zong of Fufeng, a Judicial Reviewer of the Court of Judicial Review, possessed a family collection of histories and philosophers from his youth. He gathered and recorded them, delving into their purport, certain that their meaning must have a destination. Thus, he expanded and refined Yu’s work, carefully selecting from earlier models, and distilled it into three scrolls, entitled *Yilin*. Its purpose is threefold: above, to guard against the loss of teaching; in the middle, to supplement omissions in comparative matters; and below, to aid in the composition of writings. It embodies the essentials of clarity, breadth, purity, and reliability, while avoiding the pitfalls of obscurity, waywardness, rigidity, pedantry, entanglement, obstruction, perversity, and dissipation.\n\nA gentleman has said: *\"That which is valued for its brevity—does this not describe it?\"*\n\nI, a longtime friend of Yuanhui, have thus composed this preface to record these matters. The twenty-first day of the fifth month in the second year of the Zhenyuan era.\n\nThe tradition of *zishu* (philosophical texts) began with Lü’s *Six Strategies* and flourished during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. At that time, the Daoist teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi arose, their achievements encompassing heaven and earth, their illumination rivaling the sun and moon. They loftily regarded the Six Classics as models for the world, and thus their words were beyond mere praise. Mo Di, a sage of great virtue, expounded doctrines of refined frugality, his teachings enduring for later generations, his renown second only to that of Confucius. The discourses of Guan [Zhong], Yan [Ying], Wen [Zhongzi], and Xun [Kuang] were grand and unbridled; the *Honglie* of Huainan was resplendent in its literary elegance—all these works, numbering tens of thousands of words, may be called abundant indeed. Yet their divisions and volumes were vast and sprawling, making them difficult to peruse.\n\nDuring the Liang dynasty, Yu Zhongrong compiled an abridgment in three scrolls, sifting away the sand and winnowing the chaff, yet still, orchids and irises were mingled with mugwort and wormwood, and jade ornaments lay concealed within uncut stones. Ma Zong of Fufeng, with his refined devotion to earlier records and pursuit of concision, further distilled Yu Zhongrong’s abridgment, preserving its essence in six scrolls, which he titled *Yilin*. In it, the dregs of the sages and worthies are entirely discarded, while the essential brilliance of the broader tradition is wholly preserved—truly a masterful work.\n\nDuring the Sui dynasty, Li Wenbo of Boling compiled the *Lidao Collection* in ten scrolls, gathering excerpts from the various philosophers. Yu Shinan, Duke of Yongxing, also drew from earlier histories to compose the *Imperial Survey* in five scrolls. During the reign of Empress Wu, the minister Zhu Yizu further wrote the *Treatise on the Rise and Fall of Ten Dynasties* in one scroll. Together with the *Yilin* of Fufeng, those who have exhaustively explored the broad outlines of *zishu* and histories number four in all.\n\nWhile adrift in a small boat on the Tu River, detained in Luling, I heard from Fufeng [Ma Zong] of his fundamental aims. He said that in his compilation, he first prioritized matters of statecraft and governance, then preserved the intentions of the original authors, ensuring no chapter or title was lost, as though meeting the ancients face to face. I admired Ma’s work—its brevity of language and depth of meaning—truly one might carry the wisdom of a hundred schools in one’s sleeve or grasp a thousand scrolls in the palm of one’s hand. How far-reaching was his intent!\n\nTo commend his admirable achievement, I have set this account at the beginning, that it may be transmitted to those who cherish such endeavors. On the last day of summer in the *dingmao* year of the Zhenyuan era, Wen Fei of Yinghe, styled Boliu, Bosun, has recorded this anew.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n**Scroll One**\n\n**Scroll One**\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Discourses of the Fasting Master*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\nThe *Golden Casket of the Grand Duke*\n\n*Six Scrolls:*\nThe *Six Strategies of the Grand Duke*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Zeng*\n\n*Eight Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Yan*\n\n*Seven Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Zisi*\n\n*Fourteen Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Meng*\n\n*Eighteen Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Guan*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\nThe *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n\n*Twelve Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Xun*\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Lu*\n\n*Twelve Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Wen*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Deng Xi*\n\n*Twelve Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Fan*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Hu Fei*\n\n*Sixteen Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Mo*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Chan*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Sui Chao*\n\n*Twenty Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Shi*\n\n*Twenty Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Han*\n\n**Scroll Two**\n\n*Eight Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Lie*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Zhuang*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Wangsun*\n\n*Three Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Shen*\n\n*Twelve Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Shen*\n\n*Three Scrolls:*\nThe *Biography of Prince Dan of Yan*\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Guigu*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\nThe *Book of Master Yin Wen*\n\n*One Scroll:*\nThe *Book of Master Gongsun Wen*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\nThe *New Writings of Lu Jia*\n\n*Three Scrolls:*\nThe *New Writings of Chao Cuo*\n\n*Eight Scrolls:*\nThe *New Writings of Jia Yi*\n\n*Twenty-Six Scrolls:*\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lü*\n\n*Twenty-Two Scrolls:*\nThe *Master of Huainan*\n\n**Scroll Three**\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Discourses on Salt and Iron*\n\n*Twenty Scrolls:*\n*The Garden of Persuasions*\n\n*Fifteen Scrolls:*\n*The Model Sayings*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Supreme Mystery Canon*\n\n*Seventeen Scrolls:*\n*The New Treatises*\n\n*Twenty-Seven Scrolls:*\n*The Discourses on Wei*\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\n*The Correct Discourses*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Essays of the Recluse*\n\n**Scroll Four**\n\n*Thirty-One Scrolls:*\n*The Comprehensive Records of Customs*\n\n*Four Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Lord Shang*\n\n*Four Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Ruan*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Orthodox Section*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Weft of the Scholar-Officials*\n\n*Eight Scrolls:*\n*The Comprehensive Discourses*\n\n*Forty Scrolls:*\n*The Master Embracing Simplicity*\n\n**Scroll Five**\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Zhou Shenglie*\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\n*Shenjian by Xun Yue*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Discourses of Zhongchang*\n\n*Five Scrolls:*\n*The Canonical Discourses*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Wei*\n\n*The Three Records of the Discourse on Personalities*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Ren*\n\n*Four Scrolls:*\n*The Profound Discourses*\n\n*Four Scrolls:*\n*The Discourses on the Body*\n\n*One Hundred Twenty Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Fu*\n\n*Fourteen Scrolls:*\n*The Canon of the Supreme Prime*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Canon of Transformative Clarity*\n\n*One Scroll:*\n*The Book of Master Zou*\n\n*Three Scrolls:*\n*The Records of Success and Failure*\n\n*Three Scrolls:*\n*The Comprehensive Discourses on Past and Present*\n\n*Six Scrolls:*\n*The Central Discourses*\n\n*Ten Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Tang*\n\n*Two Scrolls:*\n*The Book of Master Qin*\n\n*One Scroll:*\n*The Book of Master Mei*\n\n*Sixteen Scrolls:*\n*The Discourse on the Patterns of Things*\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Forest of Ideas***\nCompiled by Ma Zong of Fufeng during the Yuanhui era\n\n*The Book of Master Yu* – *One Scroll*\n\n**The *Records of Arts and Letters*** states: Master Xiong composed twenty-two *pian*, but today only one *juan* containing six *pian* remains.\n\nTo issue policies and decrees that bring blessings to all under heaven is called the Dao. When superiors and subordinates are harmoniously affectionate, it is called harmony. To obtain without seeking is called trust. To eliminate harm from the world is called benevolence. One who is trustworthy and harmonious possesses the capacity of an emperor or king.\n\nWhen a sagely king holds the throne, even if there is one scholar within a hundred *li*, it is as if there were none. When the kingly Way declines, one scholar within a thousand *li* is like standing shoulder to shoulder.\n\nTo know the good yet not trust it is called madness. To know evil yet not correct it is called delusion.\n\n○ Formerly, King Wen saw Master Zhai, who was ninety years old. King Wen exclaimed: \"Alas! You are aged!\" Master Zhai replied: \"If you sent me to hunt tigers or chase deer, I would indeed be old. But if I were to sit and plan state affairs, my years would still be few.\"\n\n**The Golden Casket of Tai Gong** – *Two Scrolls*\n\nKing Wu asked Tai Gong: \"The Yin dynasty has already lost three of its men. May we now attack it?\" Tai Gong replied: \"I have heard that one who understands Heaven does not resent it, and one who understands himself does not resent others. Those who plan before acting prosper; those who act before planning perish. To refuse what Heaven offers is to invite blame; to fail to act when the time is right is to invite disaster. To achieve success at the wrong time is to attain it recklessly. Thus, summer branches may be tied in knots, and winter ice may be melted—opportunity is hard to gain but easy to lose.\"\n\n○ After King Wu pacified Yin and returned, he asked Tai Gong: \"Now the people and officials are unsettled, and the worthy are not yet secure. What should be done?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Do not alter the old without cause, nor introduce the new rashly—be like Heaven and Earth. Share the wealth of Yin with its people, so that merchants gain their profits and farmers their fields. To see with one eye is not clarity; to hear with one ear is not acuity; to walk with one foot is not mobility. Select the worthy to replace yourself, so that superiors and subordinates each find their proper place.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked: \"May I hear the admonitions of the Five Emperors?\" Tai Gong replied: \"The Yellow Emperor said: 'I stand above the people, trembling, fearing I may not last from evening to morning.' Thus, the golden man seals his mouth thrice—be cautious in speech. Yao stood above the people, quaking as if on the edge of an abyss. Shun stood above the people, vigilant as if treading thin ice. Yu stood above the people, trembling as if fearing insufficiency. Tang stood above the people, reverent and fearful, daring not to rest. The Dao arises from the subtle, and calamity forms from the subtle. Be prudent from beginning to end, and your integrity will be like a fortress of metal.\"\n\n○ \"Act only after considering rectitude; do not harbor hopes of luck in your sandals. Endure but a moment, and you preserve your body from the blade. Though the knife gleams coldly, do not let it open for you. Though the spring flows smoothly, it will dry up in prolonged drought. Govern affairs with constancy; levy taxes with moderation, like drawing water from a well.\"\n\n**The Six Strategies of Tai Gong** – *Six Scrolls*\n\nTo have the reputation of seeking the worthy but no reality of employing them...\n\n○ King Wen said: \"A ruler strives to employ the worthy but fails to achieve success. Why?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Employing the worthy is not easy.\" King Wen asked: \"How should one employ the worthy?\" Tai Gong said: \"Examine their virtue, scrutinize their reputation, select their talents, and test their abilities—thus matching name with reality. A trickle unchecked becomes a river; two leaves unremoved will require an axe. A spark unquenched will grow into a raging fire—what then can be done?\"\n\nKing Wen asked: \"Why do rulers lose the people?\" Tai Gong replied: \"They are not cautious in their associations. A ruler has six virtues to uphold and three treasures to preserve. The six virtues are benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, courage, and strategy. The three treasures are agriculture, craftsmanship, and commerce. When the six virtues are cultivated, the ruler is secure; when the three treasures are intact, the state prospers. If the ruler’s authority is lent to others, he loses his majesty. Deep and boundless, who knows its source? The world is not the possession of one man—it is the world’s world. To seize the world is like chasing a wild deer, and all under heaven share in dividing its flesh.\"\n\n○ Tai Gong said: \"Fu Xi and Shen Nong taught but did not punish; the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun punished but did not pardon.\"\n\n○ The sage reveres Heaven, calms Earth, harmonizes people, and respects spirits.\n\n○ When King Wen was in Qi, he summoned Tai Gong and said: \"My land is small. What should I do?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Where there is grain in the world, the worthy eat it; where there are people in the world, the worthy govern them. To humble one man is to exalt ten thousand—only the sage can do this.\"\n\n○ \"Though a hat be worn-out, it is still placed on the head; though shoes be new, they are still trodden upon the ground.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked Tai Gong: \"Are there distinctions in the ranks of officers?\" Tai Gong replied: \"There are nine grades of men. One who speaks ill and is hated by all, yet rises early and retires late, is a leader of wives and children. One who understands hunger and thirst, and adapts to hardship and ease, is a leader of ten thousand. One who trembles with caution, saying, 'Be prudent for a day,' is a leader of a hundred thousand. One who knows the heavens, comprehends the earth, and governs the four seas as if they were his family is the lord of all under heaven. In military affairs, he does not await the ruler’s command.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked Tai Gong: \"I wish my three armies to love their general as parents, to vie in scaling walls when attacking cities, to vie in advancing when fighting in the field, to rage at the sound of gongs, and to rejoice at the sound of drums. Is this possible?\" Tai Gong replied: \"A general in winter does not wear furs, in summer does not hold a fan, and in rain does not raise a canopy. When the roads are muddy and cold, he dismounts first to walk. Before the army lights its fires, he does not eat. Soldiers do not delight in death or injury—their general knows their hunger, cold, and toil. The harm of warfare is extreme. To raise an army is like startling a beast; to employ it is like madness. Those who face it are broken; those who approach it perish. Make it swift as thunder, leaving no time to cover the ears.\"\n\n○ \"Those who are poor, resentful, and eager to vent their will are called 'men of certain death.' Those who are eloquent, clever in speech, and skilled in slander and praise are called 'men of cunning and slanderous words.'\"\n\n**The Book of Master Zeng** – *Two Scrolls*\n\nThe noble person cherishes learning as if in love, seizing the moment to achieve success. He does not shun difficulty nor follow the easy path.\n\n\"The Master said: 'At dawn one applies oneself to one's work, and at dusk one examines oneself—this may be called guarding one’s vocation. At thirty or forty, if one has no skill, then one truly has no skill. By fifty, if one has not become known for goodness, then one will have no renown.'\n\nWhen a coarse man and a coarse woman meet in the shadow of a wall, it may seem secret, but by the next day, someone may know of it. Thus it is said: in holding to benevolence and righteousness, none remain unaware.\n\n○ The bluegreen leek grows amid hemp and stands straight without support; white sand mixed with black dye becomes black with it. When the noble person wanders, it is as if entering a chamber of orchids and angelica—though long within, one no longer perceives their fragrance, for one has been transformed by them. When the petty person wanders, it is as if entering a chamber of salted fish—though long within, one no longer perceives the stench, for one has been transformed by it. Thus the noble person is cautious in his associations.\n\n○ To associate with the noble person is like lengthening the day—one gains without realizing it. To associate with the petty person is like treading on thin ice—how long before one falls through?\n\n○ If heaven were round and earth square, their four corners would not align. I have heard the Master say: the Way of Heaven is called round; the Way of Earth is called square.\n\n**The Book of Master Yan – Eight Scrolls**\n\nDuke Jing built a terrace, and upon its completion wished to cast a bell. Yanzi remonstrated: 'To levy taxes on the people to make a bell will bring them sorrow. To levy sorrow for amusement is inauspicious.'\n\n○ When Duke Jing’s favorite concubine, named Yingzi, died, the Duke mourned her for three days without eating, his flesh clinging to the mat and refusing to leave. Yanzi said: 'There are skilled physicians outside who can perform rites for the spirits.' The Duke believed him and withdrew to bathe. Yanzi then ordered a coffin brought in to enshroud the dead. The Duke grew furious, but Yanzi said: 'The dead do not return to life.' The Duke ceased his mourning.\n\nConfucius heard of this and said: 'The brightness of stars cannot compare to the radiance of the sun and moon.'\n\n○ During Duke Jing’s reign, snow fell for three days. Wearing a white fox-fur robe, he sat by the hall’s side and asked Yanzi: 'Though it has snowed for three days, why is the world not cold?' Yanzi replied: 'A worthy ruler, when sated, knows the people’s hunger; when warm, knows their cold.' The Duke then removed his robe and crown, sufficient to show reverence. Without adornment, his clothes were enough to cover his form. Without embellishment, earthworks were left uncarved, and woodwork unengraved—enough to instruct the people.\n\n○ Duke Jing said: 'I wish to become hegemon over the feudal lords. How may this be done?' Yanzi replied: 'The officials are not yet complete. I have heard that when Confucius dwelt in a humble lane, if his integrity faltered, Yuan Xian attended him; if his will was obstructed, Zilu attended him; if his virtue was not humbled, Yan Hui attended him. Now Your Lordship has no such attendants—thus the officials are not yet complete.'\n\n○ The ruler selects his ministers and employs them; though a minister may be lowly, he too selects his ruler to serve.\n\n○ One mind can serve a hundred rulers, but a hundred minds cannot serve one ruler. In serving the mighty, one cannot exceed them; in ritual, the mighty despise excess.\n\n○ After Yanzi governed the district of A for three years, slanderous reports spread throughout the state. Duke Jing summoned him and questioned him. Yanzi replied: 'I promoted frugality and punished indolence, and the lazy resented me; I did not fear the powerful in settling lawsuits, and the powerful resented me. These two evils slandered me within, while two flatterers drove me out. I beg to change my course and govern for three more years—then I shall surely earn praise.'\n\nDuke Jing suffered from edema for several days. He dreamed of struggling with two suns and failing to prevail. He summoned a dream-interpreter to divine it. When the interpreter arrived at the gate, Yanzi instructed him to say: 'Your Lordship’s illness is yin. The two suns are yang. Not prevailing means the illness will soon recede.' Three days later, the Duke recovered and rewarded the dream-interpreter. The interpreter declined, saying: 'It was Yanzi’s doing.' The Duke questioned Yanzi, who replied: 'Had I spoken myself, you would not have believed me.'\n\n○ Duke Jing suffered from an abscess on his back and could not see it. He asked Guozi, who said: 'It burns like fire, its color like the sun, and its size like an unripe plum.' The Duke then asked Yanzi, who said: 'Its color is like dark jade, and its size like a disc.' The Duke said: 'Without seeing a gentleman, one does not know the clumsiness of a rustic.'\n\n○ When Yanzi was sent as an envoy to Chu, the Chu king ordered his attendants to bind a man and pass him off as a thief. The king asked: 'Where is he from?' The man replied: 'From Qi.' The king looked at Yanzi and said: 'Are the people of Qi skilled at thievery?' Yanzi replied: 'Oranges grown south of the Jiang become trifoliate oranges when planted north of it—this is the work of the soil. Now, people born and raised in Qi do not steal, but upon entering Chu, they do. I do not know why.' The Chu king had only brought disgrace upon himself.\n\n○ When Yanzi was sent to Chu, the Chu king, considering him short, had a small gate made beside the main gate. Yanzi said: 'When one goes to a land of dogs, one enters through the dog gate. Now, as an envoy to Chu, I cannot enter through the dog gate.' He then entered through the main gate.\n\n○ The Chu king asked: 'Is the capital of Linzi in Qi truly devoid of people?' Yanzi replied: 'Linzi has three hundred wards. When sleeves are raised, they form a canopy; when sweat is wiped away, it becomes rain. Shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel—how could there be no people?'\n\n○ As Master Zeng was about to depart, Yanzi saw him off and said: 'To give a man wealth is not as good as giving him words.'\n\n○ The jade of He Shi was but uncut stone from a wellside—when a skilled craftsman refined it, it became a national treasure. Habits and customs transform one’s nature—can one not be cautious?\n\nSeventeen years after Yanzi’s death, Duke Jing enfeoffed the feudal lords, and all the ministers praised him. The Duke said: 'Since Yanzi’s death, I have not heard of any wrongdoing.' Xian Zhang replied: 'When the ruler favors something, his ministers follow it; when the ruler craves something, his ministers consume it.'\"\n\nThe silkworm that eats yellow mulberry leaves turns yellow; the one that eats green leaves turns green—such is the case.\n\nThe Duke said: \"Well said. I shall not consume the words of flatterers.\"\n\nHe bestowed fifty cartloads of fish as a gift, but Xian Zhang firmly refused to accept them—this was the legacy of Yanzi’s conduct that Xian Zhang upheld.\n\n*Seven Chapters by Zisi*\nA kind father may feed his child, but he cannot make him know the taste of food. A sage may please others, but he cannot make them necessarily pleased.\n\n○ When the state follows the Dao, one leads with righteousness; when it does not, one leads righteousness with oneself—such was Xun Xi.\n\n○ Words are trustworthy when trust precedes speech. Commands transform when transformation lies beyond the command. When a sage is above, his influence subtly shifts the world.\n\n○ Crafting a cart all year long without a single person to transport it renders it unrideable.\n\n○ A hundred minds cannot secure even one person; a single mind can secure a hundred.\n\n○ The ruler is the root; ministers are the branches and leaves. When the root flourishes, the leaves thrive; when the root withers, the leaves fall.\n\nA noble person does not fault others for what they can do, nor shame them for what they cannot. The petty man drowns in water; the noble man drowns in his own words.\n\n○ One overly devoted to pleasure is weighed down by sorrow; one deeply committed to righteousness is light in conduct.\n\nWhen encountering one’s elders and failing to humble one’s demeanor, or facing the esteemed and failing to refine one’s words—even in wind and rain, I would not enter such a person’s gate.\n\nThe noble person guides ears and eyes with the heart; the petty man guides the heart with ears and eyes.\n\n*Fourteen Chapters of Mencius*\nZhao Taiqing of Shu Commandery composed the *Chapter and Verse*, stating that *chapter and verse* refers to pointing out matters. ○\n\nMencius said to King Hui: \"Oppressive governance kills people—how is it different from a blade?\"\n\nWhen the kitchen has fat meat and the stables fat horses, yet the people bear hungry faces and the wilds starving corpses—this is leading beasts to devour men. People detest it, so how much worse is oppressive governance?\n\nRespect the elderly, cherish the young, and extend your heart to the people—then the world will turn in the palm of your hand.\n\nThus, extending kindness suffices to protect the four seas; failing to extend kindness cannot even protect one’s wife and children.\n\nThough one may possess wisdom, it is not as good as seizing the moment; though one may have an iron plowshare, it is not as good as awaiting the proper season.\n\nMencius said: \"The people of Qi mocked Guan Zhong and Yanzi, saying, 'The hungry are easily fed; the thirsty are easily quenched.' If one has long suffered in hardship, then reforming governance is like the parched who drink without choosing.\"\n\n○ A man of Song, distressed that his seedlings were not growing, pulled them up to make them taller. His son hurried to see them, only to find the seedlings withered. Not only was this of no benefit—it caused harm.\n\n○ Seeing a child fall into a well, even those who are not the child’s parents feel a heart of compassion. Without a heart of compassion, one is not human; without a sense of shame and aversion, one is not human; without a heart of deference, one is not human; without a sense of right and wrong, one is not human.\n\n○ Mencius said: \"Zilu, when informed of his faults, rejoiced. Yu, upon hearing good words, bowed. Using the Xia to transform the Yi is heard of; using the Yi to transform the Xia is not.\"\n\n○ One who bends oneself cannot straighten others. One must use uprightness to correct crookedness—how can one who is bent oneself set others right?\n\nJing Chun said: \"Are Gongsun Yan and Zhang Yi not true great men? When they rage, the feudal lords tremble; when they rest, the world is at peace.\"\n\nMencius replied: \"How can they be called great men? To be unmoved by wealth and honor, unshaken by poverty and lowliness, and unbending before power and force—this is what makes a great man.\"\n\n○ If the Son of Heaven lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve the four seas; if a feudal lord lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve his altars of soil and grain; if a scholar lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve his four limbs.\n\nNow, to detest death yet delight in lacking benevolence is like detesting drunkenness yet forcing oneself to drink. The people’s turn to benevolence is like water flowing downward.\n\nNothing in a person is better than the pupils of the eyes. The pupils cannot conceal one’s evil. When the heart is upright, the pupils are clear; when the heart is not upright, the pupils are dull.\n\n○ Chunyu Kun said: \"Men and women do not hand things to each other directly—what if a sister-in-law is drowning and one must grasp her hand?\"\n\nMencius replied: \"If one does not grasp her hand, one is a wolf. When the world is drowning, one rescues it with the Dao; when a sister-in-law is drowning, one must grasp her hand.\"\n\n○ When Zichan used his carriage to ferry people across the Feng and Wei rivers, Mencius heard of it and said: \"He does not understand governance—it would be better to repair bridges and roads in due time.\"\n\nA good man went out and left wine and meat. A man of Qi had one wife and one concubine. When their husband went out, he would eat his fill, then return and deceive his wife, saying, \"I dined with the rich and noble.\" Later, the wife spied on him and saw him begging for leftover food from sacrifices. The wife then told the concubine, and they wept together in the courtyard. When the husband returned, unaware of what had transpired, he still boasted to his wife and concubine—just like a noble person who bends the Dao to gain wealth and honor and then boasts to others. (The \"good man\" here refers to the husband.)\n\n○ Yi Yin would not give even a mustard seed to others, nor would he take even a mustard seed from them.\n\n○ One who does not follow the Dao is called a \"wilderness minister\" when in the wilds and a \"marketplace minister\" when in the state. Human nature is like rushing water—channel it east, and it flows east; channel it west, and it flows west.\n\n○ A white feather is white and light by nature; white snow is white and melting by nature; white jade is white and steadfast by nature. Though all are white, their natures differ.\n\n○ In winter, one drinks hot water; in summer, one drinks cold water—those who inquire about cold and heat do so from the heart.\n\n○ Benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust; delighting in goodness without weariness—these are the heavenly nobility. Dukes, ministers, and great officials are the human nobility.\n\nThe ancients cultivated heavenly nobility, and human nobility followed. Today, people cultivate heavenly nobility to seek human nobility; once they obtain human nobility, they abandon heavenly nobility—ultimately, they will lose everything.\n\n○ Mencius said: \"Benevolence triumphs over lack of benevolence as water extinguishes fire. Yet those who act today are like using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood—when it does not go out, they say water cannot extinguish fire. This is even more extreme in its lack of benevolence and will ultimately lead to ruin.\"\n\n○ The noble person has three joys: first, that both parents are alive; second, that looking up, one feels no shame before Heaven, and looking down, one feels no disgrace before others; third, to obtain the world’s finest talents and educate them.\n\n○ Those who rise at cock’s crow and diligently pursue goodness are followers of Shun. Those who rise at cock’s crow and diligently pursue profit are followers of Robber Zhi.\n\n○ A well dug ninety feet without reaching water is as good as abandoned.\n\n○ In ancient times, passes were set up to guard against violence; today, passes are set up to perpetrate violence and levy taxes on comings and goings.\n\n○ What is detestable are things that resemble the true but are false: detestable is the darnel that confuses the seedlings, the flatterer who confuses righteousness, the glib tongue that confuses trust, the Zheng music that confuses refined melodies, the purple that confuses vermilion, the village worthies who confuse virtue.\n\nFrom Yao to Tang, from Tang to King Wen, from King Wen to Confucius, from Confucius to Mencius—each span was over five hundred years.\n\n*Guanzi*, Eighteen Scrolls:\nWhen granaries are full, people know ritual and propriety.\nWhen the state abounds in wealth, distant peoples come.\nWhen clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame.\n\nWhen the wilds hold no piled grass, the treasury no hoarded goods, the market no permanent stalls, the court no assembled crowds—this is the height of good governance.\n\n○ Observe one’s associates, and worthiness or unworthiness becomes clear.\n\n○ For a one-year plan, nothing surpasses planting grain;\nFor a ten-year plan, nothing surpasses planting trees;\nFor a lifelong plan, nothing surpasses cultivating people.\n\n○ When ranks and emoluments overflow, loyalty wanes; when households grow rich, conduct declines. When a cauldron is full, men will overturn it; when a man is full of himself, Heaven will overturn him. Thus the former kings did not seek fullness.\n\n○ Generally, pardons bring small benefits but great harm; over time, their calamities prove insurmountable. Without pardons, there is small harm but great benefit; over time, their blessings prove boundless. Kindness is the people’s enemy; law and decree are the people’s parents. Kindness multiplies pardons, first making things easy, then difficult; law allows no pardons, first making things difficult, then easy.\n\n○ The hall’s upper floor is as distant as a hundred *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for ten days. The hall’s lower floor is as distant as a thousand *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for a month. The palace gate is as distant as ten thousand *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for a year.\n\n○ Duke Huan said to Guan Zhong: “I have three great faults. I love the hunt—sometimes I chase game into the night and do not return: this is my first fault. I love wine—day and night I drink without cease, and my conduct grows debased: this is my second fault. I love women—even my unmarried sisters and aunts: this is my third fault.”\nGuan Zhong replied: “These are indeed faults, but they are not urgent. For a ruler, only lack of love and lack of acuity are impermissible. Without love, he loses the people; without acuity, he cannot attend to affairs.”\n\n○ The waters of Qi are swift and then recede, so its people are greedy yet brave. The waters of Chu are deep and clear, so its people are light-minded yet resolute and fond of levies. The waters of Yue are turbid and heavy, so its people are hasty and unyielding. The waters of Qin are rushing and stagnant, so its people are avaricious and cruel. The waters of Jin are sluggish and mixed, so its people are fond of deceit. The waters of Song are strong and clear, so its people are simple and easygoing.\n\n○ Where there are regulations of law and measure, craft and deceit cannot prevail. Where there are scales and balances, cheating with weight and lightness cannot succeed. When the former kings governed the state, might was not applied in two directions, and governance did not issue from two sources. Even in matters of a hand’s span, discrepancies in length could not be tolerated.\n\n○ Duke Huan asked his stablemaster what task was most difficult. Before the master could answer, Guan Zhong said: “I once worked as a groom, and the hardest part was fitting the horses to the stable racks. If you first bend the crooked wood, the straight has no place; if you first bend the straight wood, the crooked has no place.”\n\n○ In winter, one says, \"Do not wash,\" not out of love for water; in summer, one says, \"Do not warm by the fire,\" not out of love for fire—it is for the sake of what suits the body. The enlightened king does not adorn his palaces, not out of stinginess with small things, but for the sake of fundamentals.\n\nThe King of Chu favored slender waists, and his beauties reduced their food; King Wu of Zhou favored swords, and his warriors held life lightly. Thus, if the ruler delights in grand palaces, craftsmen grow cunning; if the ruler delights in fine embroidery, weavers grow extravagant. Where profit lies, even a mountain of a thousand *ren* will be scaled without hesitation, and the depths of a deep spring will be plumbed without restraint.\n\nMerchants travel far, doubling their pace and pressing on through night and day, counting a thousand *li* as nothing—profit lies ahead. Fishermen enter the sea, braving waves of a hundred *ren* and battling the current, never leaving day or night—profit lies in the waters.\n\n○ The flood dragon gains its divine power from water; the ruler gains his majesty from the people. The sea does not refuse water, and so becomes vast; the mountain does not refuse earth, and so becomes high; the ruler does not reject people, and so his following grows; the scholar does not reject learning, and so attains sagehood.\n\nA mob gathered in haste may at first show fear, but later they will turn on one another—even if good, they do not remain close.\n\n○ The power over life and death does not rest with the ruler but lies with those beneath the grass.\n\n○ The five grains are the people’s lifeline; yellow gold and sharp blades are the people’s means of exchange. Farmers have their constant work, and women have their constant tasks. If one farmer does not plow, there will be those who go hungry; if one woman does not weave, there will be those who suffer cold.\n\n○ Duke Huan said to Guan Zhong: \"I wish to attack Chu. Chu is strong and cannot be subdued—what is to be done?\"\n\nDuke Huan said: \"Simply cast coins at Mount Zhuang, then go to Chu to purchase live deer at a high price.\" When the King of Chu heard this, he rejoiced and would surely abandon farming to hunt deer. Store five times the usual grain, and when Chu has ample coin but no grain, close the passes—then four out of ten in Chu will surrender.\n\n○ Land vast yet untilled is not one’s true land; ministers noble yet unbenevolent are not one’s true ministers; people numerous yet estranged are not one’s true people.\n\nWhat flies without wings is sound; what endures without roots is caution. Simply guard your reputation.\n\n*Dao and Virtue, Two Scrolls*\n\nTo give birth yet not possess, to act yet not rely. The primordial qi generates the myriad things yet does not possess them; the Dao bestows yet seeks no recompense.\n\nBlunt its sharpness, untangle its knots.\nSharpness is advancement. When human desire turns keen, advance with caution. Fame and achievement should be tempered by restraint—this is the Dao’s way of remaining unseen.\nKnots are entangled resentments. One must contemplate the supreme Dao to dissolve them.\n\nHarmonize its light. Though possessing unique insight, one should appear dim and not dazzle others.\nBlend with its dust. One should share in the common grime and not set oneself apart.\n\nMuch speech leads to frequent trouble; opening the mouth and raising the tongue invites disaster. Better to guard the center—nurture the spirit within, cherish qi, and speak sparingly.\n\nThe sage places himself last yet finds himself first; putting others before oneself, he becomes foremost in the world, for he holds office and leads.\nHe sets himself aside yet his person endures. By humbling himself and exalting others, he is cherished like parents, protected by spirits like an infant—thus his person long abides.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Cravings harm the spirit; wealth burdens the body.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall. The wealthy should relieve the poor; the noble should pity the lowly. If instead they grow haughty and indulgent, calamity will surely follow.\n\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness—this is the transformation of virtue, the return to purity.\nAbandon craftiness, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will vanish. When those above govern with impartiality, those below will harbor no private malice.\n\nTo bend is to be whole. To yield is to follow the multitude; not asserting oneself is to remain whole.\nTo twist is to straighten. By humbling oneself to exalt others, one will eventually find true straightness.\nTo have little is to gain, for the Way of Heaven aids the humble—those who humble themselves receive much.\nTo have much is to be deluded. Excessive wealth deludes one in guarding the self; excessive learning deludes one in what one hears.\n\nThe good deed leaves no track. One who practices the Dao seeks it within, not stepping beyond the hall or crossing the gate—thus no tracks remain.\nThe good word bears no flaw. By choosing words carefully, one avoids fault.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich. Knowing contentment ensures the long preservation of rank and emolument—thus one is rich.\nOne who dies yet does not perish enjoys longevity. By not gazing recklessly, not listening recklessly, not speaking recklessly, one incurs no resentment under Heaven—thus one attains long life.\n\nTo contract it, first expand it—open it wide to let excess and indulgence reach their peak.\nTo weaken it, first strengthen it—fortify it first to invite harm.\nTo abolish it, first exalt it—raise it first to invite arrogance and peril.\nTo seize it, first give it—bestow it first to satiate its greed.\nThis is called subtle illumination. These four principles reveal the Dao’s subtle yet manifest efficacy.\n\nWhen people act without goodness, how can they be cast aside? One should subdue them with the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue’s transformation was profound.\nThus the Son of Heaven was established, and the Three Dukes were appointed to transform those who lacked goodness.\n\nRepay resentment with virtue. Cultivate the Dao and practice goodness to sever misfortune before it arises.\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy. Address difficult matters early, seeking resolution in their time.\n\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue arises; when the Dao declines, virtue emerges.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises; when virtue declines, benevolent love appears.\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises. When righteousness declines, ritual is enacted—exchanges of jade and silk.\nYet ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the abandonment of roots for branches, the daily erosion of loyalty and trust.\nAnd it is the harbinger of chaos. Ritual values ornament over substance, so rectitude wanes daily while perversity and disorder grow.\n\nThe noble must take the humble as its foundation. To attain true honor, one must take the lowly as one’s root—Yu and Ji tilled the fields themselves, Shun made pottery by the riverbank, and the Duke of Zhou descended to thatched cottages.\nThe high must take the low as its base. To stand tall, one must first lay a low foundation. Like building a wall, one rises from the humble to the lofty; if the base is not firm, the height will surely topple.\n\nThe superior scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it; the middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt; the inferior scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs heartily at it. If it is not laughed at, it is not the Dao. It is not worthy of being called the Dao unless it is ridiculed by the inferior scholar.\n\nThe Dao’s illumination appears dim. One who embodies the Dao seems obscure, as if seeing nothing.\nAdvancing the Dao appears as retreat. One who pursues the Dao seems to lag behind.\nThe level Dao appears uneven. The great Dao’s person does not set himself apart but blends like the multitude.\n\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley—like a deep gorge, untainted by disgrace.\nVast virtue appears insufficient. One of great virtue seems dull and lacking.\nGreat rectitude has no corners. One of perfect integrity shows no sharp edges.\nGreat vessels are late in completion. A masterwork, like fine jade, cannot be hastily finished.\nGreat sound is scarcely heard—like thunder and lightning, waiting for the right moment to strike, thus one should cherish qi and speak sparingly.\nThe great image has no form. The great exemplar of the Dao is unadorned and without pretense.\n\nSome things, when diminished, are increased—taking nothing, yielding generously, one gains distance.\nOthers, when increased, are diminished. Excessive accumulation leads to collapse; greed for emolument invites disaster.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or the self? When fame is achieved, one should withdraw.\nWhich is greater, the self or wealth? Excessive wealth harms the self.\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss? Fondness for profit brings affliction to one’s conduct.\n\nExcessive attachment必 incurs great cost—deep love for beauty drains the spirit, deep love for wealth invites calamity and harm. What is cherished is little, yet what is expended is much; thus it is said,必 great cost.\n\nHoarding必 leads to heavy loss. In life, one amasses in storehouses; in death, one amasses in barrows and tombs. In life, there is the peril of assault and plunder; in death, the peril of grave-robbing and coffin-raiding.\n\nGreat perfection appears flawed—those who wield the axe erase their names and conceal their renown, as though incomplete.\nGreat skill appears clumsy—its workings are unseen.\nGreat eloquence appears halting—without knowledge, doubt arises; without speech, no debate.\n\nWithout stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven—through one’s own person, one knows others; through one’s own household, one knows others’ households.\nWithout gazing through the window, one perceives the Way of heaven—for the Way of heaven and the way of man are one.\n\nThe farther one ventures forth, the less one knows—for one departs from one’s home to observe others’ homes, leaves one’s own person to observe others’ persons; though the gaze extends far, what is seen is least.\n\nPursuing learning daily increases—this refers to the study of rites and music, where the embellishments of emotion and desire grow ever more.\nPursuing the Dao daily diminishes—this refers to the natural Dao, where the embellishments of emotion and desire fade day by day.\n\nDiminish and diminish again, until one reaches non-action—through non-action, nothing is left undone. When emotions and desires are severed, virtue merges with the Dao, and there is nothing that is not enacted, nothing that is not achieved.\n\nThe good, I treat with goodness; the not-good, I also treat with goodness—for the not-good, I guide and instruct toward goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—this, too, is for guidance and instruction.\n\nThose adept at nurturing life:\nOn land, they do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers—naturally, they keep their distance.\nIn battle, they are not struck by armor or weapons—for they do not delight in war and killing.\n\nBlock their apertures—apertures refer to the eyes, which must not gaze recklessly.\nSeal their gates—gates refer to the mouth, which must not speak recklessly.\nThus, one avoids lifelong toil—lifelong toil is suffering.\n\nOpen their apertures, and they see through the lens of emotion and desire.\nPursue their affairs—pursuing affairs that amplify emotion and desire.\nThus, one remains beyond salvation—calamity and chaos take form.\n\nThe great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer shortcuts—shortcuts are crooked and not upright.\nThose who build well cannot be uprooted—those who establish body and state through the Dao cannot be pulled away.\nThe wise do not speak—they value action.\nThose who speak are not wise—words outrace the chariot, and many words bring many troubles.\n\nTheir governance is dim and obscure—governance and teaching are broad and generous, appearing dull and unclear.\nTheir people are pure and sincere—pure and sincere, deeply affectionate.\nTheir governance is sharp and exacting—governance is hasty in speech, pressing upon the ears and deciding by force.\nTheir people are deficient—harsh governance leaves the people with no means to live, and their bonds grow daily more distant and thin.\n\nStraight yet not overbearing—overbearing means to extend oneself.\nThough the sage is upright, they bend to follow others and do not assert themselves.\nRadiant yet not dazzling—though possessing unique insight, they remain as if obscure, never flaunting their brilliance.\n\nDeep roots and firm stems—this is the way of long life and enduring vision.\nHumans take qi as their root and essence as their stem—just as a tree with shallow roots is uprooted, and a stem that is not firm will fall.\nTo speak of it: one who deeply stores qi and firmly guards essence, leaking nothing, attains the way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nThose who govern the world through the Dao—even their ghosts do not act as spirits, for ghosts dare not encroach upon their spirit.\nIt is not that their ghosts lack spirit, but that their spirit does no harm.\nThe sage in office does not harm others, so ghosts do not disturb them.\nWhen neither side inflicts harm, virtue converges upon them—humans govern the yang, preserving their nature and life; ghosts govern the yin, safeguarding their spirit. Thus, virtue converges.\n\nOne who makes promises lightly will surely lack trust; one who treats matters lightly will surely face many difficulties—this is the peril of carelessness.\nWhat is secure is easily maintained—governing state and self in tranquility is easy to uphold.\nWhat shows no sign is easily planned—act before it arises, govern before it descends into chaos.\n\nTo govern a state with cleverness is the state’s ruin—for those who govern with cleverness will surely betray the Dao, wielding power recklessly, becoming the state’s ruin.\nNot to govern a state with cleverness is the state’s blessing—the people uphold integrity, do not engage in deceit, and superiors and subordinates unite in harmony.\n\nA good scholar is not martial—they value the Dao and virtue, not military force.\nA good warrior does not rage—one who wages war through the Dao restrains evil in the heart, severs it at the bud, and harbors no resentment.\n\nHe who takes the carpenter’s place to hew wood will seldom avoid injuring his hands—so it is said.\n\nThe way of Heaven reduces excess to supplement deficiency—Heaven’s Dao favors humility, ever upholding harmony as supreme.\nThe way of humans is not so—it reduces the deficient to serve the excess.\nThe people of the world diminish the poor to enrich the wealthy, seize from the weak to strengthen the mighty.\n\nNeighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their roosters and dogs carry between them, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting—this is the absence of emotion and desire.\n\nThe wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise—one who knows the Dao and guards unity need not be broadly learned.\nExcessive knowledge and experience lose the essential truth, thus they do not know.\n\nXunzi, in his twelve scrolls and twenty-two chapters, says:\nIndigo comes from blue yet is bluer than blue; ice forms from water yet is colder than water.\nThe noble person dwells only in chosen lands and travels only with chosen companions—to guard against depravity.\n\nRotten flesh breeds worms; withered wood harbors borers. Arrogance and sloth in the self invite disaster.\nThe learning of the noble person enters the ear, lodges in the heart, spreads through the four limbs, and in movement and stillness becomes a model.\nThe learning of the petty person enters the ear and exits the mouth—between ear and mouth lie but four inches. How can this adorn a seven-foot frame?\n\nThe swift steed gallops a thousand *li* in a day, yet the plodding horse, by ten days’ journey, will also reach it—perseverance in the boundless, persistence in the limitless.\nHalf-steps unceasingly taken carry the lame toad a thousand *li*; earth piled without pause forms a towering mountain.\n\nThree omens of misfortune:\nThe young refuse to serve their elders;\nThe lowly refuse to serve the noble;\nThe unworthy refuse to serve the worthy.\n\nHeaven does not speak, yet people infer its intent;\nEarth does not speak, yet people rely on its depth;\nThe four seasons do not speak, yet the hundred clans await them.\n\nKind words to others warm like brocade;\nHarsh words to others pierce deeper than spear or halberd.\n\nTo seek the straight shadow of a crooked object is like striving to see the obscure while neglecting the clear.\n\nBo Le cannot be deceived about horses; the noble person cannot be deceived about people.\n\nDeep rivers and springs draw fish and turtles; lush forests draw birds and beasts.\nJust governance draws the hundred clans; rites and justice draw the noble person.\n\nThe way of Heaven is constant—it does not persist for Yao nor vanish for Jie.\n\nThe shallow cannot fathom the deep; the foolish cannot counsel the wise.\nTo speak to the frog at the bottom of the well of the joys of the Eastern Sea...\n\nThe sage has no divided heart; the world has no second Dao.\n\nWhen birds and beasts lose their mates, after months and seasons they inevitably return to their old haunts, circling and crying, lingering and hesitating before departing—how much more so for humans?\n\nWithout the cold of winter, one cannot know the pine and cypress; without adversity, one cannot know the noble person.\n\nWhen wife and children are complete, love for kin wanes; when rank and emolument are full, loyalty to the lord declines.\n\nOnly Shun and the worthy are not so.\n\nXun Qing, styled Kuang, was a man of Qi during the reign of King Xuan. Lord Chunshen twice invited him to serve as magistrate of Lanling, where he eventually settled. He was the teacher of Li Si and later died in Lanling.\n\n*The Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* in five scrolls:\nBlades cross before one, yet one does not dodge stray arrows—\nurgency allows no delay.\n\nWealth is what the lord holds lightly; death is what the knight holds dear.\nIf the lord cannot give what he holds lightly to the knight, yet seeks what the knight holds dear, is this not difficult?\n\nThe centipede, though severed, does not stumble—\nits support is many.\n\nThe human heart is harder to know than Heaven.\nHeaven has spring, summer, autumn, and winter to mark the seasons,\nwhile men conceal deep feelings beneath thick façades.\n\nNot knowing what is fitting and what is not,\none offers brocade as a mat.\nNot knowing what is timely and what is not,\none plows in winter.\nNot knowing what is practicable and what is not,\none carves a square into a wheel.\n\n*The Book of Master Wen* in twelve scrolls, a disciple of the Old Master in the time of King Ping of Zhou:\nThe first to raise a cry treads the path to exhaustion;\nthe last to act finds the source of success.\nTeeth are harder than the tongue, yet teeth wear out first.\nThe rigid and strong are companions of death;\nthe yielding and weak are the trunk of life.\n\nOne digs a well to drink, tills fields to eat,\nwithout bestowing gifts to seek virtue,\nwithout exalting or debasing to vie with others—\nthis was the virtue of the ancients.\n\nThe Yellow River does not overflow; the sea does not surge in waves.\nAuspicious clouds appear and the yellow dragon descends;\npropitious winds arrive and sweet springs flow—\nthis is the sage following the Dao of Heaven.\nDay darkens, night brightens;\nmountains collapse, rivers rupture;\nwinter thunders, summer frosts—\nthese are signs a state is about to perish.\n\nWhen water is muddy, fish gasp;\nwhen governance is harsh, the people rebel.\nWhen superiors are covetous, inferiors grow deceitful.\n\nThe shade of winter’s sun—\nall things turn to it, yet none are compelled.\n\nGao Yao was mute yet a great judge;\nunder him, the world knew no cruel punishments—\nwhat need was there for words?\n\nThe noble person is like an archer’s error:\na hairsbreadth here, a fathom there.\n\nThe spirit is the abyss of wisdom;\nwhen the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright.\nWisdom is the storehouse of the heart;\nwhen wisdom is impartial, the heart is level.\n\nThe spirit is hard to keep clear and easy to muddy,\nlike water in a basin.\nIf one clears it all day, only then can one see their brows and lashes.\nBut a single disturbance—\nand one can no longer discern square from round.\n\nEat according to the belly’s measure,\nclothe according to the body’s form.\nWhen one tempers oneself,\ngreed does not arise.\n\nMountains yield metal, yet metal carves itself;\ntrees breed borers, yet borers consume themselves;\nmen create affairs, yet affairs harm themselves.\n\nLet trustworthy men divide wealth—\nit is no better than drawing lots.\nLet incorruptible men guard wealth—\nit is no better than shutting the door.\nA full seal with intent to level\nis not as good as thoughtless unevenness.\n\nThe skilled swimmer will surely drown;\nthe skilled rider will surely fall.\n\nIn higher learning, one listens with the spirit—\nlearning resides in the marrow.\nIn middling learning, one listens with the heart—\nlearning resides in the flesh.\nIn lower learning, one listens with the ears—\nlearning resides in the skin.\n\nThe bell tolls itself to ruin with its sound;\nthe lamp burns itself out with its light.\nA single abyss holds no two dragons—\nwhere there are two, there must be strife.\nTo catch a bird, one sets a net—\nbut a net with one mesh cannot catch a bird.\n\nTo attract fish, first clear the valley;\nto lure birds, first plant the tree.\nWater pools and fish gather;\ntrees flourish and birds alight.\n\nThe eye sees a hundred paces away,\nyet cannot see its own blemish.\n\nWater’s power overcomes fire—\na ladle cannot save a cartload of kindling.\nMetal’s power overcomes wood—\na single blade cannot fell a forest.\nEarth’s power overcomes water—\na clod cannot dam a river.\n\nA hungry horse in the stable stands silent;\ntoss fodder beside it, and the urge to fight arises.\n\nThe farmer toils, and the noble person eats;\nthe fool speaks, and the wise person selects.\n\nThe sun and moon wish to shine,\nbut floating clouds veil them.\nThe river wishes to run clear,\nbut sand and soil defile it.\nThe thicket of orchids wishes to flourish,\nbut autumn winds ruin it.\nThe human nature wishes to be level,\nbut desires harm it.\n\nTo rescue the drowning with gold and stone\nis not as good as a foot of rope.\n\nFlowers that bloom too early\nwither without frost.\n\nEntering water yet hating to get wet,\nor holding stench yet seeking fragrance—\nthis cannot be.\n\nThe nursing pup bites the tiger;\nthe brooding hen attacks the fox.\n\nCold cannot melt wood;\nthe carpenter cannot cut ice.\n\nMetal and stone have voices,\nyet they do not sound without a strike.\nFlutes and pipes have music,\nyet they do not play without a blow.\n\nAffairs are hard to accomplish yet easy to ruin;\nreputations are hard to establish yet easy to destroy.\n\nPast and present are called *zhou*;\nthe four directions and above and below are called *yu*.\n\nConfucius’ hearth was never blackened;\nMozi’s mat was never warm—\nnot because they coveted emolument or sought rank,\nbut because they wished to rid the world of harm.\n\nBeasts at bay will gore;\nbirds at bay will peck;\nmen at bay will deceive.\n\nThe lord’s possession of the people\nis like a city’s possession of its foundation,\nor a tree’s possession of its roots.\nWhen roots run deep, the trunk is firm;\nwhen foundations are thick, the heights are secure.\n\nYield an inch to gain a foot;\nbend slightly to stand straight—\nthis is what the sage does.\nNow, men of rank\ndo not permit great deeds yet demand small virtues—\nthis is to lose the worthy.\n\nObserve whom the noble appoints;\nobserve what the wealthy desire;\nobserve what the poor cherish.\n\nThe way of the hegemon and king:\nuphold righteousness and act,\nhonor the outstanding,\ndisplay the worthy and good.\nThe hundred clans open their doors to await them,\nsoak their grain and store it.\nWhen unrighteous troops arrive,\nthey will not submit even to piles of corpses and rivers of blood.\n\nA fan in winter, a fur in summer—\nuseless to oneself, they gather dust.\n\n*The Writings of Deng Xi* in one scroll and two chapters:\nLiu Xiang says: It was not Zichan who killed Deng Xi—\nthis is verified by the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nTo cultivate reputation and demand substance—\nthis is the lord’s task.\nTo uphold the law and proclaim orders—\nthis is the minister’s duty.\n\nThe lord has three burdens:\ntrusting those close to him,\nselecting men by name,\nand favoring the familiar while estranging kin.\n\nThe minister has four faults:\nreceiving great rewards yet having no merit,\nholding high office yet failing to govern,\nserving as judge yet being unjust,\nand fleeing in battle.\n\n---\n\nPower is the lord’s chariot; authority is his whip; ministers are his horses; the people are his wheels. When power is firm, the chariot is steady; when authority is settled, the whip is strong; when ministers are obedient, the horses are tame; when the people are harmonious, the wheels turn smoothly. Those who govern a state and lose these will surely overturn their chariot and run wild with their horses, break their whip and shatter their wheels. Once the whip is broken, the wheels shattered, the horses bolt, and the chariot overturns, the passenger will also be thrown.\n\n---\n\nWithout forethought, one cannot respond to sudden events; without prepared troops, one cannot face the enemy. The Yellow Emperor’s army, with its thousand-mile temple councils and tented strategies, won every battle. In years of famine and disaster, when a father dies in the house and a son at the door, yet they bear no grudge—it is because they have nothing to cling to. When crossing the sea in the same boat and caught in a storm midstream, all work together to save the vessel, for their peril is shared. In a hunt with spread nets, the calls and responses never falter, for their gain is the same. Thus, when the body is sick, the mouth cannot help but spit; when the heart is joyful, the face cannot help but smile.\n\n---\n\nSeeing for oneself brings clarity; relying on others’ sight brings darkness. Hearing for oneself brings sharpness; relying on others’ hearing brings deafness. A single careless word cannot be retrieved even by a team of four horses; a single urgent word cannot be caught even by a team of four horses.\n\n---\n\nThe enlightened lord governs the people as one drives a carriage—racing without reins, treading on ice with a burden.\n\n---\n\nRewarding in delight without regard for merit; punishing in anger without regard for guilt.\n\n---\n\nLoyalty wanes with official success; filial piety fades with wife and children.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Fan Li* in twelve scrolls, all concerning yin-yang and calendrical calculations.\n\nJi Ran was a man of Caiqiu, a servant of the upper class, surnamed Xin and named Wenzi. His ancestors were princes of the state of Jin. In appearance, he seemed unremarkable, yet from youth he was perceptive, studying yin-yang and discerning the subtle to know the manifest. His conduct was vast, his aspirations boundless. Unwilling to reveal himself to the feudal lords, he secretly assessed what would benefit the seven states, yet none in the world knew of him. Thus, he was called Ji Ran. At times, he roamed the seas and marshes, styling himself the Fisherman.\n\nFan Li sought an audience with the King of Yue. Ji Ran said: “The King of Yue has the beak of a crow—he cannot share profit.”\n\n---\n\nTo cover one’s eyes and distinguish black from white, though one may occasionally guess correctly, is still to be ignorant of the Way of Heaven. Discussing yin and yang, one may sometimes err yet still be right.\n\nFan Li asked: “What use is the Nine Palaces?”\nJi Ran replied: “The Way of yin and yang is not confined to a single thing.”\n\n---\n\nThe sage’s adaptability is like water following form—when the form is level, it is level; when the form is perilous, it is perilous.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Hu Feizi* in one scroll.\n\nBearing a long sword and charging into thickets, cleaving rhinoceroses and leopards, wrestling bears—this is the bravery of the common hunter. Bearing a long sword and plunging into deep springs, slaying jiao-dragons and grappling lightning-dragons—this is the bravery of the fisherman. Standing perilously atop a high mound, gazing in all four directions without a change in countenance—this is the bravery of the potter’s urn. Striking without fail, gazing with intent to kill—this is the bravery of the five punishments.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi regarded Lu as his southern border. The Duke of Lu, distressed, went three days without eating. Cao Mo offered to slit his throat and spatter the duke with blood. The duke, terrified, knew not what to do. Guan Zhong then urged him to make an alliance. Cao Mo, a commoner in plain cloth shoes, in a single outburst repelled the army of a ten-thousand-chariot state and preserved a thousand-chariot state—this is the bravery of the noble man.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Mozi* in sixteen scrolls.\n\nThe noble man makes things difficult for himself and easy for others; the common man makes things easy for himself and difficult for others.\n\n---\n\nThe divine tortoise is scorched first; the sacred serpent is exposed first.\n\n---\n\nThough the noble man has learning, conduct is the foundation. Though battle has formations, courage is the foundation. Though mourning has rites, grief is the foundation.\n\n---\n\nMozi, seeing dyed silk, sighed and said: “Dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow. It is not only silk that is thus—people are also subject to influence. Shun was influenced by Xu You; Jie by Zixin; Zhou by Chong Hou.”\n\n---\n\nThe sage makes boats and carts sturdy and light, so they can bear heavy loads and travel far.\n\n---\n\nA son who loves only himself and not his father seeks to harm his father for his own gain; a younger brother who loves only himself and not his elder brother seeks to harm his elder brother for his own gain—this is not universal love. A thief loves his own house and not another’s, so he steals from another’s house to benefit his own—yet he too can practice universal love.\n\n---\n\nThe method of moderated burials: three layers of clothing are enough to rot the flesh; a three-inch coffin is enough to rot the bones. Depth reaches the springs.\n\n---\n\nFeudal lords must not govern arbitrarily—they are governed by the Three Dukes. The Three Dukes must not govern arbitrarily—they are governed by the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven must not govern arbitrarily—he is governed by the world.\n\n---\n\nSevering a finger to preserve the arm benefits the body.\n\n---\n\nThe noble man is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it remains silent. A beautiful woman who stays hidden is sought after; one who parades herself in the streets is left unmarriageable.\n\n---\n\nMozi urged his disciples to study, saying: “Study quickly, and I will recommend you for office.” After a year of study, a disciple approached Mozi. Mozi asked: “Have you heard of the man of Lu? He had five brothers. When their father died, the eldest son, fond of wine, refused to take part in the burial. The four younger brothers said: ‘If you attend the burial, we will buy you wine.’ After the burial, he went to the four brothers to ask for wine. The four brothers replied: ‘You buried your father—was he yours alone? We feared others would laugh at us, so we deceived you with the promise of wine. Now, if you do not study, people will naturally laugh at you—this is why I urge you.’” Thereafter, Mozi no longer sought office for him.\n\nMozi asked his disciples: “Why do you not study?”\nOne replied: “There are no scholars in my family.”\nMozi said: “Not so. Would one who desires beauty say, ‘There is none in my family,’ and thus abandon the pursuit? Would one who desires wealth and honor say, ‘There is none in my family,’ and thus not strive? Exert yourself!”\n\nThe sweet melon has a bitter stem—nothing in the world is wholly perfect.\n\nThe scholars of old, upon gaining a single worthy saying, would attach it to themselves; the scholars of today, upon gaining a single worthy saying, strive only to persuade others. Their words exceed their deeds.\n\nThe gentleman, when clad in finery, grows more reverent; the petty man, when clad in finery, grows more arrogant.\n\n*Chánzǐ*, one scroll\nChánzǐ carried on the teachings of the Mò school and taught them to the world.\n\nAmong the Confucians was one named Dǒng Wúxīn. His words were refined yet fallacious, his conduct earnest yet mediocre. Fallacious words are hard to comprehend; mediocre conduct lacks principle. Wishing to study under Chánzǐ, he was told: “Ornate rhetoric that dazzles the world yet fails to benefit the people—such convoluted and entangling words were not cultivated by Mòzǐ. Exhorting goodness and universal love, however, Mòzǐ held in high regard.”\n\nDǒngzǐ said: “You believe in ghosts and spirits—how is this different from using your heel to untie a knot? It will never succeed.” Chánzǐ could not respond.\n\n*Suícháozǐ*, one scroll\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts asked: Yuè Lán questioned Suícháo, saying: “How does the wisdom of ghosts and spirits compare to that of the sage?”\nSuícháo replied: “It is sagely.”\nYuè Lán said: “Order and chaos arise from man—what then are ghosts and spirits?”\nSuícháozǐ replied: “The sage is born into a world with nothing to rely upon, yet ghosts and spirits regulate the four seasons and eight solar terms to nurture growth. Man rides the clouds and rain, receiving their moisture to flourish—all this is within the power of ghosts and spirits. How can one not call them wiser than the sage?”\n\nTo be distant yet not cut off, to have descendants yet not abandon—this is the conduct of the great sage who universally loves all people. Distant yet not cut off, the worthy rejoice in it, while the unworthy are pitied. If the worthy do not rejoice, it is a rejection of virtue; if the unworthy are not pitied, it is cruelty.\n\n*Shīzǐ*, twenty scrolls\nThe deer runs without looking back; even six horses cannot catch its dust. Yet it is caught because it looks back. Water, when accumulated, gives rise to fish that can swallow boats; earth, when accumulated, gives rise to trees like the yúzhāng. Learning, when accumulated, also bears fruit.\n\nFarmers compare their grain, merchants compare their wealth, and the resolute compare their righteousness. Low walls invite thieves; honor and disgrace arise from within, while respect and insult come from without. One who plants scallions and leeks selects them to ensure abundance—so too must one select benevolence and righteousness. Only goodness has no foundation, yet righteousness flourishes and reverence grows, while disasters and misfortunes do not multiply.\n\nThe owl keeps watch at night, the leopard cat seizes mice, and the firefly illuminates—none of these creatures are commanded, yet they preserve themselves.\n\nOne who says, “I am in a well,” cannot illuminate even ten paces; one whose gaze is fixed at his feet cannot see far—what use is brightness then?\n\nYáo was emaciated and Shùn was dark—both served the people.\n\nWhen a plumb line is set, crooked wood is found guilty; when a level is applied, uneven ground is found guilty; when names and duties are clarified, ministers who act improperly are found guilty. The farmer’s weeding removes what harms the seedlings; the worthy ruler’s governance removes what harms righteousness.\n\nThe young of tigers and leopards, though their patterns are not yet formed, possess the dark markings of creatures that devour oxen; the fledglings of swans and cranes, though their wings are not yet fully grown, harbor the ambition to traverse the four seas.\n\nTo see another’s goodness as one’s own, to see another’s faults as one’s own—this was the great virtue of the Yú clan.\n\nTo buy a horse without considering its strength but judging only by its black or white color ensures one will never obtain a swift steed. To buy jade without considering its quality ensures one will never obtain a fine treasure. To appoint scholars without considering their worthiness ensures one will have no true scholars.\n\nConfucius said: “Reciting the *Odes* and reading the *Documents* is to dwell with the ancients; studying the *Odes* and reciting the *Documents* is to consult with the ancients.” Jade’s color is not as white as snow, its moisture not as rich as rain, its smoothness not as fine as ointment, its luster not as bright as a torch. Yet obtaining jade is exceedingly difficult—crossing the Three Rivers and Five Lakes to reach the Kunlun Mountains, of a thousand who set out, a hundred return; of a hundred who set out, ten arrive. In the Central States, an army of a hundred thousand may be routed, and a siege of three thousand may be broken.\n\nWhen the carriage is light and the road is near, the whip is not needed. The whip is used when the road is long and the burden is heavy.\n\nTo see a single hair of a fine steed is not to know its form; to see a single color in a painting is not to know its beauty.\n\nThe butcher cutting meat knows the age of the ox; the bowmaker binding sinew knows the age of the ox; the carver shaping bone knows the age of the ox—each discerns it in his own way.\n\nGrass and trees, great or small, must await spring before they grow; man must await righteousness before he is complete.\n\n*Hánzǐ*, twenty scrolls\nLiú Xiàng said: The First Emperor of Qín esteemed Hán Fēi, saying in his book: “If I could wander with this man, I would have no regrets in death.” Lǐ Sī and Yáo Jiǎ harmed him, giving him poison to force his suicide. The First Emperor regretted it and sent to save him, but it was too late.\n\nDo not dwell near misfortune, and misfortune will not abide.\n\nThe difficulty of a minister’s speech lies in this: when it is smooth and flowing, observers deem it flowery yet insubstantial; when it is sincere and respectful, observers deem it hollow and useless; when it is concise and unadorned, observers deem it inarticulate and unpersuasive; when it is sharp and probing, delving into others’ intentions, observers deem it presumptuous and unyielding; when it is vast and profound, unfathomable in depth, observers deem it boastful and useless. This is why ministers find speech difficult and their concerns weighty.\n\nThe two handles are punishments and rewards. The tiger can subdue the dog because of its claws and teeth. If the tiger were to shed its claws and teeth, it would instead be subdued by the dog.\n\nThus, Tián Cháng requested that ranks and emoluments be granted generously to the people, and in the state of Qí, when Duke Jiǎn lost virtue, Tián Cháng seized power.\n\nDuke Zhāo of Hán, deeply drunk, went outside. The keeper of the cap, seeing the ruler was cold, placed a robe over him. When the duke awoke, he punished the robe-keeper and executed the cap-keeper. The robe-keeper had failed in his duty; the cap-keeper had overstepped his office. Overstepping one’s office is worse than cold. Thus, the enlightened king ensures his ministers do not overstep their offices to claim merit, nor make proposals that are inappropriate. To overstep one’s office is death; to propose inappropriately is punishment.\n\nExcessive fragrance and beauty harm the body; gleaming teeth deplete one’s essence.\n\nTo eliminate extremes and excess is to keep the body from harm.\n\nAppoint the owl to guard the night, command the wildcat to catch mice—each thing has its proper use, each talent its proper application, each placed where it belongs. Thus, those above and below practice non-action.\n\nIf the ruler errs by a hand’s breadth, the subject errs by eight feet—this the ruler cannot but guard against. To entrust one’s desires to the ease of banquets, to seek them in the hour of drunkenness and satiety, is to ensure they will be granted.\n\nA neighboring state with a sage is a threat to the rival state.\n\nMí Zǐxiá enjoyed the favor of the Lord of Wèi. Once, he secretly took the lord’s carriage. The lord, hearing of it, said: “Zǐxiá, feigning command of the carriage to hasten to his ailing mother—what a filial son!” Later, when Mí Zǐxiá strolled with the lord in the orchard and, having eaten a peach, found it too sweet to finish, gave the remainder to the lord, the lord said: “How he loves me!” But when his looks faded and he fell from favor, the lord said: “This is the man who once commandeered my carriage and fed me his leftover peach.” What was once deemed worthy now brought punishment—the shift from love to hate.\n\nOne cannot bestow advantage on the beloved alone; one must wait for praise before granting it. One cannot inflict harm on the hated alone; one must wait for blame before acting. The carriage-maker wishes all men wealth and rank; the coffin-maker wishes all men death and mourning. If men are not noble, carriages go unused; if men do not die, coffins fetch no price. Not that they are kind or cruel—profit lies therein.\n\nThose who love one another form cliques and sing each other’s praises; those who hate one another band together and slander each other. When slander and praise contend, confusion arises.\n\nA household with a steady trade will not starve, even in famine; a state with a steady vocation will not perish, even in peril. If one abandons law to follow private whim, ministers will adorn their cleverness and skill. When they adorn their cleverness and skill, laws and prohibitions will not stand.\n\nThe ruler employs ministers with strategy; ministers serve the ruler with strategy. A minister will not harm himself to benefit the state; a ruler will not harm the state to benefit himself.\n\nIt is like water: the drowning man who drinks it dies; the thirsty man who drinks it lives.\n\nWhen Duke Huán lost his way attacking Gūzhú, Guǎn Zhòng said: “The wisdom of old horses may be put to use.” They released a horse, followed it, and found their way home.\n\nWhen Duke Huán attacked Gūzhú and, marching forth, found no water in the mountains, Yáng Péng said: “Ants winter on the southern slopes, summer on the northern slopes, and where their mounds rise an inch, water lies beneath.” They dug and indeed found water.\n\nHe who takes another’s words of praise to heart must also take another’s words of blame.\n\nCage a gibbon, and it shares the same plight as the tame monkey—it cannot display its abilities.\n\nIn carving and cutting, for the nose, nothing surpasses making it large; for the eyes, nothing surpasses making them small. A large nose can be made smaller, but a small one cannot be made larger; small eyes can be made larger, but large ones cannot be made smaller. All undertakings are thus.\n\nThe ancients knew their eyes were too short to see themselves, so they used a mirror to observe their faces. They knew their persons were too short to know themselves, so they used the Dao to correct themselves. Without a mirror, one cannot set right beard and brows; without the Dao, one cannot recognize delusion.\n\nXīmén Bào, quick-tempered, wore soft leather to restrain himself; Dǒng Ānyú, slow by nature, wore a bowstring to spur himself on.\n\nTo sever a hand and replace it with jade—thus the world suffers the affliction of exchanging bodies.\n\nShùn, as a commoner, could not set right three households. Though talented, he lacked power; though worthy, he could not prevail. Thus, set a log upon a high mountain, and it overlooks a ravine of a thousand fathoms. The timber is not long—its position is high.\n\nDo not spoil another’s beauty; do not speak of another’s faults.\n\nDuke Zhāo of Hán dug up melons and pretended to lose them, then searched for them with great urgency. His attendants, seeking to prepare for his needs, retrieved them. Thus the duke discerned the truth or falsity of his attendants.\n\nLord Sì of Wèi sent a man through the customs barrier. The customs officer reprimanded him, so the man gave the officer gold, and the officer let him pass. The lord said to the officer: “How did you come to accept the traveler’s gold?”—thus demonstrating his vigilance.\n\nIn the time of Duke Xī, the royal cook served a dish in which a piece of raw liver was found. When asked about it, the cook said: “Someone must have placed it there.” He sought to shift blame from himself. Later, when Duke Xī was about to bathe, he found gravel in the hot water. The duke said: “Someone wishes to take my place in heating the water.” When Duke Wén’s cook served meat with a hair wound around it, Duke Wén summoned the cook and said: “Do you mean to make me choke?” The cook kowtowed and said: “Your servant has three crimes: my blade is sharp as Gàn Jiāng, yet it did not sever the hair—this is my first crime; I threaded the skewer through the meat and did not see the hair—this is my second crime; the fire blazed, the meat roasted until red, yet the hair still clung—this is my third crime. Someone must wish to take my place.”\n\nDuke Jǐng of Qí despised Confucius for governing Lǔ. Lí Jǔ said: “To be rid of Confucius is as easy as blowing away a hair.” The duke then sent word to Duke Āi of Lǔ to rest from governance. Confucius remonstrated but was not heeded, so he went to Qí.\n\nMen of Zhèng argued over age. One said: “I am the same age as Yáo.” Another said: “I am the same age as the Yellow Emperor’s brother.” Their dispute over this never ceased, and the one who yielded last was deemed the winner.\n\nA guest painting for the King of Qí, when asked what was most difficult, replied: “Painting dogs and horses is most difficult; ghosts and goblins, easiest. Dogs and horses are what all men know; ghosts and goblins have no form or image.”\n\nThough a cap be threadbare and torn, it must be worn atop the head; though shoes be embroidered in five colors, they must tread the earth.\n\nKing Xuān of Qí asked Kuāng Qiàn, “Do the Ru play the zither?”\nHe replied, “No. On the zither, the small strings produce a loud sound, while the large strings produce a soft sound. When high and low reverse their positions and noble and base reverse their order, the Ru do not engage in it.”\n\nTo drive away ants with a bone only makes them multiply.\n\nDuke Huán asked Guǎn Zhòng, “There are few offices but many applicants—what is to be done?”\nGuǎn Zhòng said, “Do not heed men’s requests. When someone petitions, grant emolument according to ability and confer office according to merit.”\n\nIn Sòng there was a man who brewed fine wine. His measures were precise, his manners toward guests most respectful, his brew excellent, and his banner hung high—yet his wine did not sell and turned sour. He asked Wén Chángqiàn about it, who said, “Your dog is vicious.”\nA boy carrying coins and a jug went to drink, but the dog bit him—just as great ministers bite men of the Dao.\nThus Duke Huán asked Guǎn Zhòng, “What is the greatest concern in governing a state?”\n“If you burn the sacred rat, the wood burns with it.”\n\nTaxes should be neither too light nor too heavy. If too heavy, profit goes to the ruler; if too light, profit returns to the people.\n\nDuke Wén of Jìn fought with Chǔ. He asked his uncle Fàn, “The Chǔ forces are many, ours few—what is to be done?”\nFàn replied, “Deceive them.”\nHe then asked Yōng Jì, who said, “To govern the people by deception is a momentary advantage.”\nWhen Jìn won a great victory and returned, rewards were given first to Yōng Jì and then to Fàn. The duke said, “Fàn’s words were expedient; Yōng Jì’s words were for ten thousand generations.”\n\nDuke Huán of Qí drank to excess and lost his cap. Ashamed, he did not hold court for three days. Guǎn Zhòng said, “This is a national disgrace. Why not erase it with governance?”\nHe then opened the granaries and bestowed grain upon the poor for three days. The people sang, “Why not lose your cap again?”\n\nAn ancient proverb says: “Governance is like washing the hair. Though one loses some strands, the benefit is long hair.”\n\nIn a famine year, even younger brothers are not deferred to; in a year of plenty, even distant guests are surely fed—not because one is distant from kin, but because the mind differs in times of scarcity and abundance.\n\nAfter Mòzǐ’s death, there were the Mò of Xiānglǐ, the Mò of Xiāngfēn, and the Mò of Dènglíng. After Kǒng and Mò, the Ru split into eight, and the Mò into three.\n\nIf one waits for arrows to straighten themselves, there will be no arrows for a hundred generations; if one waits for wood to round itself, there will be no wheels for a thousand years.\n\nLaws and rewards, punishments and penalties are the state’s rouge and powder.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot be filled.\n\n*Yìlín, Scroll One, concludes.*\n\nHeaven has its shortcomings, Earth its strengths; the sage has his limitations, things their interconnections. A lovesick man remains unwed yet stirs emotion; a lovesick woman remains husbandless yet conceives. Ghosts are those who return—return to their true dwelling. The true dwelling is the Great Void.\n\nPoverty is the scholar’s constant, death the people’s end. A drunkard falls from a carriage, yet though injured, does not die. The terrors of life and death do not enter his breast.\n\nThe wisdom of birds and beasts shares much with man: male and female pair, mother and child bond, they shun the level and cling to the perilous, flee the cold and seek the warm. At rest, they have their grasses; in motion, their ranks; when drinking, they lead one another; when eating, they call in chorus.\n\nA man of Song kept apes and called them *ju*. Wishing to give them taro, he first deceived them, saying, “Three in the morning, four at dusk.” The apes were all enraged. Then he promised, “Four in the morning, three at dusk,” and the apes were all pleased. Thus the sage, in using wisdom to ensnare the foolish, is no different from the ape-keeper using cunning to ensnare his apes.\n\nAwareness has eight signs; dreams have six conditions. When yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through water in fear; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of treading through fire in scorching heat. The sated dream of giving; the hungry dream of taking. Sleeping with a sash beneath one’s head brings dreams of snakes and crows; holding hair in the mouth brings dreams of flight. When the sky is about to turn overcast, one dreams of fire; when the body is about to fall ill, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grow sorrowful; those who sing and dance weep. Daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—where spirit and form meet.\n\nA minister of Chen said: “In my state there is a man named Kàng Cāngzǐ, who can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.” The Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and summoned him with the rites of a senior minister. Kàng Cāngzǐ said: “My body harmonizes with spirit, my heart unites with the void.”\n\nYán Huí could be humane but not return to simplicity; Zǐgòng could be eloquent but not reticent; Zǐlù could be brave but not timid; Zēngzǐ could be solemn but not companionable. Even if one combined the strengths of these four, to exchange them for Confucius, Confucius would not consent.\n\nWhen the eyes are about to go blind, they first see autumn down; when the nose is about to block, it first smells mildew. Thus, if things do not reach their limit, they do not turn. The *Mínglíng* takes five hundred years as its spring, five hundred years as its autumn. In ancient times, south of Jing, there was a great *zhuāng* that took eight thousand years as its spring, eight thousand years as its autumn. Fungi and mushrooms are born at dawn and die at dusk. Oysters and clams come to life with rain and perish in sunlight. In the state of Yuèshù, when a family’s eldest son is born, they eat him, calling it “auspicious for younger brothers.”\n\nIn the state of Zhéxiū, when a man’s grandfather dies, they carry his grandmother away and abandon her, calling her “ghost’s leavings.”\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. Asking the reason, one said: “I believe that when the sun first rises, it is closer to people, and at noon, farther away.” The other said: “When the sun first rises, it is far, and at noon, near.” One child said: “When the sun first rises, it is as large as a carriage wheel, but by noon, only as big as a plate or bowl—is this not because when near it is large, and when far, small?” The other said: “When the sun first rises, it is dim and cold, but by noon, it is as if one were dipping into boiling water—is this not because when near it is hot, and when far, cold?” Confucius could not decide. The child said: “Who says you are so wise?”\n\nYáng Zhū said: “Among a thousand people, not one attains a lifespan of a hundred years, and half of that is spent in illness, sorrow, and suffering. To guard the sights and sounds of the ears and eyes, to plan for the aftermath of death, to forgo the joys of one’s prime—if one does not indulge in the moment, how is this different from being bound in fetters? Diligence can bring ease; cold can bring warmth.”\n\nYànzǐ said: “After I die, what does it matter to me? Burn me, sink me, bury me, expose me, cast me into a ditch, or seal me in a stone coffin—whatever comes to pass.”\n\nWithout marriage or office, half of human desires fade; without clothing or food, the Way of ruler and minister ceases.\n\nYáng Zhū said: “The people’s inability to rest arises from four things: longevity, fame, rank, and wealth. With these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, fears punishment. This is what it means to be a fugitive from life.”\n\nTo leave not by the gate, to walk not by the path—seeking profit thus, is it not difficult?\n\nDuke Wén of Jìn wished to attack Wèi. Gōngzǐ Chú laughed at him. Asked why, he replied: “I laugh at my neighbor. A man was escorting his wife home when he saw a woman picking mulberries by the road. Enamored, he spoke to her, and when he turned to look at his wife, someone had already beckoned her away.” The duke then withdrew his troops, but before they returned, someone had already raided his northern border.\n\nConfucius said: “One may have the strength to lift the bolt of a state’s gate, yet refuse to use force to open a door.”\n\nThe grandee of Húqiū said to Sūnshū Áo: “There are three things people resent—do you know them? Those of high rank are envied; those in great office are hated by their lord; those with ample emolument are resented.” Sūnshū Áo replied: “The higher my rank, the lower my ambitions; the greater my office, the smaller my aims; the richer my emolument, the broader my generosity. Can I thus avoid resentment?”\n\nA neighbor of Master Yang lost a sheep, and many joined in the pursuit. Yet at the forked roads, there were further forks. He said: “The great Way, with its many forks, loses the sheep; the scholar, with his many paths, wastes his life. Their root is one, their branches many.”\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son of stealing it. He observed the son’s gait and countenance—all seemed like a thief. Then, while searching his own valley, he found the axe. When he saw the neighbor’s son again, nothing about him resembled a thief.\n\nA man of Qí desired gold. At dawn, he went to the market and, seeing a gold-seller, seized the gold and fled. When the authorities arrested and questioned him, he replied: “When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.”\n\n---\n\nIn *The Ten Scrolls of Zhuangzi*:\n\nWhen water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat.\n\nThe Perfect Man has no self;\nThe Spirit Man has no merit;\nThe Sage has no name.\n\nThe sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—how feeble its light!\nThe timely rain has fallen, yet one still irrigates—how laborious its benefit!\n\nThe nesting pheasant in the deep forest needs but a single branch;\nThe drinking field-mouse drinks from the river but fills only its belly.\n\nThe blind have no part in the spectacle of patterns;\nThe deaf have no part in the sound of bells and drums.\nYet is it only the body that can be deaf and blind? The mind, too, has its deafness and blindness.\nNot knowing the ultimate subtlety of the perfect word, one dismisses it as madness and does not believe—this is the mind’s deafness and blindness.\n\nThe body may be made still as withered wood;\nThe heart may be made quiescent as dead ashes.\nIt is their silence and formlessness that is sought.\n\nGreat wisdom is at ease;\nSmall wisdom is restless.\nIn sleep, the spirits intermingle;\nIn waking, the body opens.\n\nWhere does the Dao hide that it has truth and falsehood?\nWhere do words hide that they have right and wrong?\nThis one deems right and that one wrong;\nThat one deems right and this one wrong—\nEach holds its own negation within.\n\nWhat is permissible is permissible to oneself;\nWhat is impermissible is impermissible to oneself.\n\nBeyond the Six Directions, the Sage acknowledges but does not discourse;\nWithin the Six Directions, the Sage discourses but does not debate.\nThe *Spring and Autumn* chronicles the world’s affairs, preserving the intent of the former kings—the Sage debates but does not contend, neither pursuing gain nor avoiding harm.\n\nOne who dreams of drinking wine may weep upon waking;\nOne who dreams of weeping may go hunting upon waking.\nIn the dream itself, one does not know it is a dream.\nFrom this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it is death but follows one’s will.\nWithin the dream, one may even interpret the dream—yet this differs not from waking.\nOnly upon waking does one know it was a dream.\nWhen all one encounters is sufficient, why fret over life and fear death?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering contentedly as a butterfly, self-so and at ease, unaware he was Zhou.\nSuddenly he awoke, and there he was, unmistakably Zhou.\nDid Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou?\n\nMy life has bounds, but knowledge has none.\nTo follow the boundless with the bounded is perilous.\nTo seek limitless wisdom with finite nature—how can one not be exhausted?\n\nTo flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature is to forget what one has received.\nWhat Heaven bestows as nature, each has its proper measure—neither to be escaped nor exceeded.\n\nTo come is to follow the time;\nTime arises of itself.\nTo go is to follow the natural course—\nThe principle of death is fitting.\nAbiding in the timely and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter.\nSorrow and joy arise from gain and loss.\nIf one follows what one has received, sorrow and joy have no place to intervene.\n\n---\n\nYan Hui said: “My family is poor; for months, I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. Can this be called the fasting of the mind?”\nConfucius replied: “That is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.”\nYan Hui asked: “May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?”\nZhongni said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with the *qi*. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at the tally. *Qi* is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind. Empty the mind, and the Dao will gather within.”\n\n---\n\nThere are two great precepts under Heaven:\nThe first is fate;\nThe second is duty.\nA child’s love for a parent is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart.\nA minister’s service to a lord is duty—there is no place without a lord, nowhere to escape within Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\nYan He was to become tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wèi. He asked Lián Bóyù: “If I teach him without method, I endanger the state; if I teach him with method, I endanger myself. How should I proceed?”\n“The nature of petty men is such that if you guide them with rules, they resent you; if you indulge their excesses, they bring chaos to the state.”\nBóyù replied: “Excellent question! First, rectify yourself.\nIn form, do not oppose;\nIn mind, do not resist.\nIn form, do not force compliance—compliance means complete conformity.\nIn mind, do not force agreement—agreement means self-promotion.”\n\n---\n\nMountain trees invite their own felling;\nFat invites its own burning.\nCinnamon is edible, so it is cut down;\nLacquer is useful, so it is slashed.\nAll know the usefulness of the useful,\nBut none know the usefulness of the useless.\nThe useful serves others’ purposes;\nThe useless preserves its own life.\n\n---\n\nOne forgets what should be forgotten yet clings to what should not—this is called true forgetting.\nTo cherish life and discard death—thus the virtuous are not forgotten by the world.\nProfit is what principle does not abide—thus to forget form is not true forgetting.\nTo forget virtue while clinging to form—that is true forgetting.\n\n---\n\nThe True Man of old slept without dreaming—without intent or thought.\n\nTheir waking knows no care.\nThey rest content in whatever they encounter.\n\nUnknowing of delight in life,\nUnknowing of aversion to death,\nThey embody transformation.\nTheir minds, wherever they dwell, are at peace—this is called daily resolve.\nTheir countenance is serene; though they move, nothing disturbs their stillness.\nCool as autumn, warm as spring.\nTo kill is not for righteousness;\nTo give life is not for benevolence.\n\nTo serve others’ servitude,\nTo conform to others’ conformity—\nAbandoning the self to imitate others\nIs to sacrifice oneself and harm principle.\n\nWhen the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land,\nWetting each other with their breath,\nMoistening each other with their foam.\nBetter to forget one another in rivers and lakes.\nRather than love each other in scarcity,\nHow much finer to forget each other in abundance.\nBetter to forget both Yao’s praise and Jie’s blame\nThan to extol one and condemn the other.\nForget good and evil,\nLeave behind life and death,\nMerge with transformation—\nHow then could one know where Yao or Jie reside?\n\nThe Great Clod burdens me with form,\nWearies me with life,\nEases me with age,\nRests me in death.\n\nTo gain is but the season’s doing;\nTo lose is but compliance.\nWhat one encounters in time is called gain.\nTime does not pause for an instant—\nTo follow its flow is called loss.\nAt peace with the season, in accord with its course,\nNot even joy can enter.\n\nParents command their children—\nEast, west, south, or north—\nAnd they obey without question.\nYet yin and yang are no less than parents to humankind.\nSince ancient times, some have defied their parents’ commands,\nBut none have defied the changes of yin and yang\nOr resisted the rhythm of day and night.\n\nFish forget one another in rivers and lakes;\nPeople forget one another in the Dao and its arts.\nEach self-sufficient, they forget one another—\nNone in the world fails to do so.\nThe Perfected Person is ever sufficient,\nThus ever constant.\n\nThough they have lived since high antiquity,\nThey are not old—\nEach day they are new.\n\nTo still the limbs, dim the senses, detach from form, and cast off wisdom—merging with the Great Flow—this is called \"sitting in forgetfulness.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person’s mind is like a mirror: it neither invites nor resists, responds yet does not retain. Thus it masters things without harm. Things come, and it reflects them. Reflection does not engage the mind, so though the whole world be mirrored, the heart remains unwearied.\n\nA classic text may be brief, yet to extend it brings sorrow; a crane’s legs may be long, yet to shorten them brings grief. Since the Three Dynasties, the world has bartered its nature for things. The petty person sacrifices himself for profit, the scholar for fame, the grandee for his house, the sage for the world. Though their pursuits differ, their self-sacrifice is one.\n\nZang and Gu herded sheep together and both lost them. Asked what Zang was doing, he held a book and read; asked what Gu was doing, he played at dice. Though their tasks differed, their lost sheep were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang, Robber Zhi died for gain upon Dongling. Though their deaths differed, their ruin of life and harm to nature were one. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? Then the whole world is self-sacrificing. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men. Their sacrifice is the same. As for ruining life and harming nature, how can one distinguish gentleman from petty man between them?\n\nTo see others without seeing oneself, to gain from others without gaining for oneself—this is to gain others’ gains while not gaining one’s own. To suit others’ suits without suiting one’s own—though Robber Zhi and Boyi differ, both are excessive and perverse.\n\nIf uncarved wood is not marred, who would make sacrificial vessels? If white jade is not shattered, who would fashion scepters? If the Dao and its power are not abandoned, why would one need benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, why would one need rites and music?\n\nTo carve uncarved wood into vessels is the craftsman’s fault; to ruin the Dao and its power to create benevolence and righteousness is the sage’s error.\n\nRobber Zhi’s followers asked him, “Does theft also have a Dao?” Zhi replied, “How could one presume what lies hidden in a room without sagacity? To enter first is courage; to exit last is righteousness; to know what is possible is wisdom; to divide equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief. What prohibits these five makes thieves not thieves—it is their resource. From this we see: the good person cannot stand without the sage’s Dao, and Robber Zhi cannot act without it. Since good people in the world are few and the ungood many, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great.”\n\nCut off sagacity, cast aside wisdom, and great thieves will cease. Smash jade, shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise. Burn tallies, break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; split bushels, snap scales, and they will not contend.\n\nWhen joy and anger suspect one another, the foolish and wise deceive one another, the good and bad condemn one another, the truthful and false mock one another—the world declines.\n\nThe essence of the supreme Dao is dim and obscure; its utmost is murky and silent.\n\nGuard your inner self to preserve your true nature. Close yourself to the outer to keep to your allotted part. Excessive cunning brings ruin. Wisdom has no bounds, hence its ruin.\n\nThe common people all delight in those who agree with them and detest those who differ. The teaching of the great person is like a form giving rise to a shadow, a sound to an echo—questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their hearts.\n\nWhen Zigong taught the gardener of Hanyin to make a well-sweep, the gardener flushed with anger and laughed, saying, “Those who have machinery have mechanical affairs; those who have mechanical affairs have mechanical hearts. A mechanical heart in the breast leaves no room for purity; without purity, the spirit is unsettled; with an unsettled spirit, the Dao cannot be borne. I do not claim ignorance—I am ashamed to do this.” What seeks feasibility, what seeks completion, what uses little effort to achieve much—this is the sage’s Dao.\n\nWhen three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for the confused are few. If two are confused, the effort is laborious and the goal unattained, for the confused are many.\n\nWhat can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas, the world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the truth of things. Yet forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp that truth.\n\nScatter chaff before the eyes, and heaven, earth, and the four directions seem to shift. Mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, and one cannot sleep all night. Though external things may be small, their harm to nature is great. The swan does not bathe daily yet remains white; the crow does not blacken daily yet remains black. Nature suffices for each. Serene and at ease, cares cannot enter, and noxious qi cannot invade. Thus their virtue is whole and their spirit unharmed.\n\nDo not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Respond only when moved, without leading. Move only when pressed, act only when the moment arrives. Rise only when unavoidable—thus there is no heavenly disaster, no burden from things, no human blame, no ghostly reproach. In life, one floats; in death, one rests. Joy and anger are excesses of the Dao; likes and dislikes are losses of virtue. Unchanging unity is the height of stillness. Still and unified, one cannot be altered. Not engaging with things is the height of indifference. Things come of themselves—there is no impulse to engage them. If the body labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts.\n\nA rustic saying goes: “The crowd values profit, the incorruptible value fame, the worthy esteem aspiration, the sage treasures essence.” Adorn it with ornament, enrich it with breadth—ornament destroys substance, breadth drowns the heart. What the ancients called “attaining one’s aim” did not refer to carriages and caps.\n\nWhat is now called \"attaining one’s aim\" refers to carriages and caps. Carriages and caps upon the body are not one’s nature or destiny—they are but transient things that come by chance, a temporary lodging. Their coming cannot be warded off, their going cannot be halted. Thus, one should not indulge the will for carriages and caps, nor should one follow the crowd in poverty and constraint.\n\nThe well-frog cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its pit. The summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. The narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. One who views the great from the small cannot see the whole; one who views the small from the great cannot see clearly.\n\nThe thoroughbred and the fine steed gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they are no match for the wildcat in catching mice—this speaks of differing skills. The crow and the magpie pluck fleas at night and discern the finest hairs, yet by day they stare blindly and cannot see the hills and mountains—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThe Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing at Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying: \"I wish to trouble you with the affairs of the realm.\" Zhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying: \"I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise that has been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in the ancestral temple. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones honored, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?\" The ministers said: \"It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then go. I too will drag my tail through the mud.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?\" Zhuangzi said: \"You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?\" Huizi said: \"I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so it is clear you do not know the joy of fish.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. You asked how I know the joy of fish—you already knew I knew it when you asked. I know it by the Pu River.\"\n\nWhat to choose, what to rely on, what to avoid, what to dwell in, what to pursue, what to abandon, what to delight in, what to detest—choosing among these eight does not suffice to preserve life. Only by making no choice and following what one encounters can one rest.\n\nThe skull said: \"In death, there is no lord above, no minister below, nor the affairs of time. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn—even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.\" Zhuangzi did not believe it, saying: \"If I had the Controller of Fate restore your flesh and skin, return you to your parents, wife, children, and village acquaintances, would you desire it?\" The skull said: \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toil of the human world?\"\n\nThose who fear the perilous road—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another and set out only with a full escort. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly fear lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals, and those who do not guard against it err. If one in ten is killed, people greatly fear it, yet when it comes to the harm of sensual desire, none are willing to fear it—such are the foolish masses.\n\nZhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told: \"It is of no use.\" Zhuangzi said: \"This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan.\" Leaving the mountains, he lodged at an old friend’s house. The friend ordered his servant to kill a goose, and the servant asked: \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\" The host said: \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\" The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi: \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its lifespan, while the master’s goose, by being useless, died. Where will you, Master, take your stand?\" Zhuangzi said: \"I will stand between usefulness and uselessness—though it seems so, it is not, and thus I have not escaped strangeness. Straight trees are felled first; sweet springs are drained first.\"\n\nNo bird is wiser than the quail. Fearing humans, it nests among them. No one who distances themselves from others is preserved by them. Fearing humans and entering their midst—this is why the quail is called wise.\n\n*Wangsunzi, Scroll One*\n\nShun offered the world to Zizhou Zhibo, who said: \"I happen to suffer from a hidden sorrow and am just now treating it. I have no leisure to govern the world.\" Spring plowing and sowing are enough to labor the body; autumn harvest and gathering are enough to rest. Thus, those who honor life, though rich and noble, do not harm themselves with indulgence; though poor and lowly, do not burden their bodies with profit.\n\nThe achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover affairs of sages, not what preserves the body or nurtures life. Yet today’s worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable? If someone used the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand *ren* high, the world would surely laugh at them. Why? Because what they value is heavy, and what they seek is light. Is life not far weightier than the Marquis of Sui’s pearl?\n\nLie Yukou refused the gift of grain from Zheng Ziyang, saying: \"You do not truly know me. You give me grain based on others’ words, and when you punish me, you will also fear others’ words. That is why I do not accept it.\"\n\nZigong asked: \"Master Yuanxian, what ails you?\" Yuanxian replied: \"I have heard that lacking wealth is called poverty, and learning without practice is called ailment. Now I am poor, not ailing.\" Zigong withdrew with a look of shame.\n\nThose content with what they have are not burdened by profit; those who know themselves deeply are not dismayed by loss; those whose conduct is cultivated within do not act without position. To be poor in the Dao is true poverty; to hold to the Way of benevolence and righteousness yet suffer the calamities of a chaotic age—what poverty is there in that? The wise plan it, the martial carry it out, the benevolent dwell in it—this is the ancient Way.\n\nTo abolish superiors is not righteousness. To kill the people is not benevolence. Others face difficulty while I enjoy the benefit—this is not integrity.\n\nThose who chatter and wag their tongues, stirring up right and wrong, and those who flatter others to their faces—such people also slander behind their backs.\n\nTang exiled his lord; King Wu killed Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been the followers of disorder.\n\nHuman nature craves: the eye to see beauty, the ear to hear sound, the mouth to savor taste, and the will and qi to be fulfilled.\n\nThe longest lifespan is a hundred years, the middle eighty, the shortest sixty—excluding illness, infirmity, and untimely death.\n\n*Shenzi* in three scrolls. Liu Xiang states: Shenzi, named Buhai, was a native of Hedong and a lowly official in Zheng. He studied techniques to serve Marquis Zhao of Han, and the Qin armies dared not approach. His learning was rooted in the Huang-Lao tradition, yet he was harsh and unyielding, lacking mercy—unfit for the affairs of hegemons or kings.\n\nA three-inch basket, when set in motion, can settle the world; a six-inch plumb line, when aligned, can govern it.\n\nA domineering wife can easily destroy a household; a treacherous minister can easily ruin a state. If one wife monopolizes her husband, all wives fall into chaos. If one minister usurps the ruler, all ministers become obscured.\n\nWhen wisdom is equal, none can employ another; when strength is equal, none can overcome another.\n\nThe drum does not belong to the five notes yet presides over them.\n\nFor a hundred generations, sages may follow one after another, yet they trail a thousand li behind; only the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\n*Shenzi* in twelve scrolls, named Dao, studied the Huang-Lao tradition. Peng Zu was his disciple.\n\nThe petty man eats by his labor; the noble man eats by the Dao.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* records aspirations; the *Book of Documents*, harmonious governance; the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, past events.\n\nOne does not neglect the nurse of an infant; one does not slight the driver on perilous roads.\n\nIf you place a hook or stone before Yu, he could not discern it; but suspend it from a balance, and even a hair’s weight becomes clear.\n\nTwo nobles do not serve each other; two inferiors do not employ each other.\n\nWhen a family is wealthy, distant kin gather; when poor, even brothers part—not from lack of love, but because profit cannot accommodate them.\n\nOne who is neither sharp nor bright cannot rule as king; one who is neither blind nor deaf cannot govern as a duke.\n\nThe sea and the mountain contend for water, but the sea always prevails.\n\nWhere there are scales, one cannot be deceived by weight; where there are measures, one cannot be misled by length; where there are laws, one cannot be duped by craft or falsehood.\n\nIf one rabbit runs, a hundred men chase it. But when rabbits pile up in the market, passersby do not glance—though they desire the rabbit, its portion is fixed and cannot be contested.\n\nA filial son is not born in the house of a kind father; a loyal minister does not arise under a sagely ruler.\n\nWhen the six relations are not harmonious, filial piety and kindness are nurtured; when the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.\n\nA carpenter who makes coffins does not resent the dead—for where profit lies, shame is forgotten.\n\nThe timber for a grand hall does not come from a single tree’s branch; the white fox fur robe is not made from one fox’s armpit; a state that hoards armor will surely see soldiers flee.\n\nOne who acts with intent must first prepare the tools.\n\nMarket rabble can be driven to war, but the army of a secure state does not arise from anger.\n\n*Yandanzi* in three scrolls. Dan was the son of King Xi of Yan, held hostage in the time of Qin Shi Huang.\n\nA true man feels shame at receiving humiliation; a chaste woman feels disgrace at the loss of her virtue.\n\nIs blood-bravery anger that reddens the face? Is sinew-bravery anger that turns it pale? Is bone-bravery anger that whitens it?\n\nTian Guang said: I know Jing Ke’s courage—it is spirit-bravery. When enraged, his countenance does not change; his lofty conduct pierces the heavens, his fine reputation fills the ears. Such was Jing Ke in Yan.\n\nHe said to the crown prince: Guang praises the prince, whose lofty conduct pierces the heavens, whose fair name fills the ears.\n\nKe left the capital of Wei, gazing at no path, undeterred by peril, unmoved by distance.\n\nNow the prince honors him with the kindness of old friendship and receives him with the respect due a new guest. That he no longer declines is because he trusts in the prince’s recognition.\n\nThe wind howls, the Yi River runs cold;\nA stalwart departs, never to return.\n\nKe said: If the prince relies on Yan to resist Qin, it is like using a sheep to hunt a wolf.\n\nKe then entreated Fan Wuqi: The general has offended Qin, and your parents, wife, and children have all been burned. Ke grieves for you. Now I wish to present the general’s head and the map of Yan’s Dukang region to the King of Qin. He will surely rejoice and receive me. Then I will seize his sleeve with my left hand and stab his chest with my right, enumerating Yan’s grievances and reproaching him with the general’s terms.\n\nFan Wuqi grasped his blade and slit his throat; his head fell behind him, his eyes still open.\n\nWhen the crown prince heard this, he prostrated himself over the body and wept. He placed Wuqi’s head and the map of Dukang in a casket to offer to Qin, with Wu Yang as deputy.\n\nKe did not choose an auspicious day but set out at once.\n\nThe prince’s retainers, all in plain white robes and caps, saw him off at the Yi River. Ke rose to offer a toast and sang; Gao Jianli struck the zither, Song Yi joined in harmony, their voices swelling with valor, stirring fury and bristling hair. When they turned to a mournful tune, the warriors all wept. The two then mounted their chariot and drove away without looking back.\n\nWhen Jing Ke reached Xianyang, the King of Qin rejoiced greatly and received him with halberds arrayed. Ke presented Fan Wuqi’s head in a box alongside the map, advancing in order. The assembled ministers all cried “Long live the king!” Qin Wu Yang trembled with fear, but Jing Ke glanced at him and smiled, stepping forward to apologize: This rustic from the northern frontier has never seen the Son of Heaven. I beg Your Majesty to pardon him, that he may complete his task before you.\n\nThe King of Qin said: Ke, rise and present the Dukang map.\n\nJing Ke unrolled the map, and as it reached its end, the dagger appeared. He seized the king’s sleeve with his left hand and stabbed his chest with his right, saying: Follow my plan and live; refuse, and die.\n\nThe King of Qin said: Let me hear the sound of the zither before I die.\n\nHe summoned a concubine to play. The zither’s tune said: The single-layered robe of Luo Valley can be torn asunder; the eight-foot screen can be leapt over; the sword at the chariot’s shaft can be drawn by the back.\n\nKe did not understand the music, but the King of Qin followed its cue, drew the sword from behind, and severed Ke’s hands. Ke leaned against a pillar and laughed, squatting down to curse: I have been tricked by this wretch! My task has failed!\n\n*Guiguzi* in five scrolls, annotated by Yue Shi. A general overview of the text states: In the Zhou era, there was a bold hermit who dwelt in Guigu, calling himself Master Guigu. He had no recorded hometown, clan, or given name.\n\nThis was recorded by Su Qin.\n\nThe term \"Guigu\" suggests remoteness, much like Sima Xiangru’s feigned \"Lord Wu Shi.\" From ancient times to the present, the Dao remains one, yet its transformations are boundless, each finding its own return—now yin, now yang; now soft, now hard; now opening, now closing; now slack, now taut. Thus, the sage guards and oversees its gates and thresholds, scrutinizing what comes before and after.\n\nThe mouth is the gateway of the heart, from which all wisdom and strategies emerge.\n\nSome long for one another from afar; some advance yet remain unchecked.\n\nThe world holds no constant duties, nor do affairs have fixed masters.\n\nCarrying firewood into flames, the driest kindles first; pouring water on level ground, the damp is soaked first—such are the resonances of kindred things.\n\nThe wise do not employ their own shortcomings but instead utilize what the foolish excel in; they do not rely on their own clumsiness but instead apply what the foolish have mastered.\n\nWalls collapse where cracks appear; wood decays where knots reside.\n\nWhen others move, I remain still; when others speak, I listen. The power to hold fast or let go lies within me, awaiting inquiry.\n\nTo know one’s nature is to be free from entanglements; to know one’s fate is to be free from sorrow. When sorrows and burdens depart, the heart becomes tranquil, and virtue and righteousness manifest.\n\nNurturing the people with virtue is like plants and trees flourishing in season; transforming others with benevolence is like heaven nourishing grasses and trees with rain.\n\n*Yinwenzi* in two scrolls, annotated by Liu Yin.\n\nThe preface states: Wenzi hailed from Yin of Zhou and resided at Jixia during the reign of King Xuan of Qi. In the late Huangchu era, I first arrived in the capital, where Miao Xibo showed me this text, and I took the liberty of editing it.\n\nNames fall into three categories: first, names that designate things, such as square, round, white, and black; second, names of praise or blame, such as good, evil, noble, and base; third, names of analogy and reference, such as worthy, foolish, love, and resentment.\n\nLaws manifest in four forms: first, unchanging laws, such as the order between ruler and subject; second, laws of equality, such as the assessment of ability and mediocrity; third, laws governing the masses, such as rewards, punishments, and penalties; fourth, laws of standardization, such as measures, weights, and balances.\n\nThe noble person does not speak of principles that, though sound, bring no benefit to governance; nor does he act on abilities that, though competent, serve no purpose in affairs.\n\nThe hammer values not solitary skill, but skill shared with the many.\n\nPeople of this age wish their conduct to stand alone in worthiness, their affairs to stand alone in ability, their eloquence to surpass all, and their courage to outstrip the crowd. Tian Pian said: \"There is no scholar in the world who does not dwell at his gate, submit his wife and children, and travel to serve in the courts of the feudal lords—drawn by fame and profit.\"\n\nPeng Meng said: \"When pheasants and hares are in the wild, all pursue them, for their division is not yet settled. When quails and swine fill the market, none covet them, for their division is fixed.\"\n\nTwo of equal wisdom cannot employ each other; two of equal rank cannot overawe each other; two of equal eloquence cannot subdue each other—for their strength and position are matched.\n\nRelying solely on cleverness, no achievement is completed; relying solely on obscurity, affairs must go awry. Only with both clarity and obscurity does the multitude bear its burden.\n\nThose with meager stipends cannot be entrusted with quelling disorder; those with paltry rewards cannot be sent into peril. Those in high position must not be careless.\n\nYin Wenzi met King Xuan, who sighed without speaking. Yin Wenzi asked, \"Why do you sigh?\" The king replied, \"I sigh that there are so few worthy men in the state.\" Yin Wenzi said, \"If all in the state were worthy, who would remain beneath the king? Who would serve the king?\"\n\nA man named his eldest son *Thief* and his youngest *Strike*. When *Thief* went out, his father chased after him, calling, \"*Thief!*\" A constable heard and bound him. The father called *Strike* to explain to the officer, but in his haste, his words failed him, and he could only cry, \"*Strike! Strike!*\" The officer then struck him, nearly to death.\n\n**Gongsun Wenzi – Chapter on the Mind**\nThe mind is the essence of collective wisdom; all things seek the mind. Cultivating the mind without understanding fate is like returning home without a house.\n\nThe noble person’s good deeds must have recompense; the petty person’s misdeeds must have recompense.\n\nMusic is how the early kings adorned joy; military might is how they adorned wrath.\n\nA boat drifting on the river without mooring or oar cannot find stability.\n\nHumans have three hundred and sixty joints, corresponding to the number of celestial bodies. Their forms have bones and flesh, thick as the earth; their orifices and blood vessels are like rivers and valleys.\n\nEating too much sweetness benefits the flesh but harms the bones; eating too much bitterness benefits the bones but harms the sinews; eating too much pungency benefits the sinews but harms the qi.\n\n**New Writings of Lu Jia – Two Scrolls**\n*By Lu Jia, Grand Master of the Palace*\n\nYang gives rise to thunder and lightning; yin forms snow and frost.\n\nThose who speak well of the past align it with the present; those who recount the distant examine it in the near.\n\nThe Dao is established for the wise; horses are fine for the charioteer; worthies are employed by the sage; eloquence is the conduit of the wise.\n\nQin made punishment its nest, and so suffered the calamity of a nest overturned and eggs broken.\n\nDuke Wen planted grain; Zengzi herded sheep. The shortcomings of the wise do not match the strengths of the foolish.\n\nLand near rivers is damp; trees near mountains grow tall. Mountains emit clouds, and hills generate qi; the Four Great Rivers channel their flow eastward, so no streams flow west.\n\nWith many mouths come slander and praise, floating stones and sinking wood, crooked grass suppressing the straight—what is upright is made crooked.\n\nDogs do not bark at night; quails do not cry at night. If households are silent, government offices tranquil, villages deserted, neighborhoods free of litigation, and elders without sorrow—that is the governance of the noble person.\n\nJade ladles pour wine; gold cups are carved—these are to impress the petty man, not to enrich oneself.\n\n**New Writings of Chao Cuo – Three Scrolls**\nEmperor Gao did not rely on kinsmen for kinship, and so could punish tyranny and disorder. Where his commands reached, none disobeyed; where his troops struck, none resisted.\n\nWhen Empress Lü held power, the altars of state did not topple—*as if by a hair* (the *Hanshu* says \"like a belt\"; the *Gongyang* says \"like a coin\").\n\nThose who govern well fill the court and countryside with scholars, the land with cattle and horses, and the forests with birds and beasts. Above, even to flying birds, and below, even to insects and fish—they bear them as the earth bears all, encompass them as the sea encompasses all.\n\nYour Majesty’s lands stretch east and west to the limits of cap-and-robe-wearing people, and south and north to the extremes of cold and warmth. The Xiongnu cannot equal a single county.\n\nDecrees issued untimely are called \"injuring Heaven\"; burning forests and felling trees untimely are called \"injuring Earth\"; unjust trials and punishments are called \"injuring Man.\"\n\n**New Writings of Jia Yi – Eight Scrolls**\nThe cold find coarse cloth warm; the hungry find husks and chaff sweet.\n\nWhen the Second Emperor of Qin ascended, all under heaven craned their necks to observe his governance. Thus, governing a weary people is easy.\n\nThe ruler and his ministers are like the sun and stars; the noble and the base are like white and black. The ruler employs his ministers as the body employs the arm, the arm the fingers.\n\nThe Son of Heaven is like the hall; his ministers like the steps; the common people like the ground. If the system of governance is not settled, it is like crossing a river without mooring or oar—midstream, when wind and waves arise, the boat must capsize.\n\nThose who mine copper abandon their fields; those who cast metal neglect their farming.\n\nThe three passes—Jianwu, Hangu, and Linjin—were built to guard against the feudal lords of the mountains and east. Better to fix the terrain so no defense is needed, and all under heaven flows as one.\n\nDwelling with upright people, one cannot but become upright—just as growing up in Chu, one cannot but speak the Chu dialect.\n\nThere are four awakenings of intent: in court, the intent is purity and solemnity; in sacrifices, reverence and harmony; in military campaigns, focus and intensity; in mourning rites, sorrow and grief.\n\nThere are four methods of speech: in court, speech is respectful and proper; in sacrifices, harmonious and ordered; in military matters, voices united in vigor; in mourning rites, sorrowful and insufficient.\n\nThe King of Zhai sent an envoy to Chu. The King of Chu boasted of the Terrace of Zhanghua, so high one must rest three times to reach it. The king asked, \"Does Zhai have such a terrace?\" The envoy replied, \"The King of Zhai’s thatch is untrimmed, his painted rafters uncarved—yet he deems the builders laborious and the dwellers idle.\"\n\nThe King of Chu was greatly pleased.\n\n*Master Lü’s Annals*, Scroll Twenty-Six\n\nLithe waists and gleaming teeth, the music of Zheng and Wei—these are axes that hew at destiny. Rich meats and thick wine—these are foods that rot the bowels.\n\nAt thunder, men cover their ears; at lightning, they shield their eyes. To hear what one loathes is worse than not hearing; to see what one loathes is worse than not seeing. A forced laugh brings no joy; forced tears bring no sorrow. For these do not arise from the heart.\n\nFlowing water does not stagnate; a door’s pivot does not rot—because they move. So too with the body’s qi. A spring’s waters bound forth, day and night unceasing, never exhausting above nor filling below.\n\nEars that hear yet do not learn are no better than deafness; eyes that see yet do not learn are no better than blindness.\n\nWere a man of Rong born in Chu, or a man of Chu born in Rong, the Chu man would speak the Rong tongue, and the Rong man the Chu tongue. Thus even a ruler who has lost his state may be transformed into a worthy sovereign.\n\nThe cherry is so called because crows pluck it—hence \"plucked cherry.\"\n\nCourage is a perilous virtue; weapons are perilous tools.\n\nA fine sword that fails to strike is no different from a poor one. Water flows from mountains to the sea—one may despise the mountains and desire the sea, yet high and low determine the course. Men say dodder has no roots, yet its roots do exist, only unconnected—such is the case with *fuling*.\n\nThe lodestone draws the needle; all things attract. So too when a sage faces south and stands, none under heaven do not crane their necks. King Wen of Zhou had men inspect the land, where they found dry bones. He ordered officials in robes and caps to bury them. When the world heard of this, they said: \"King Wen is worthy—his virtue extends even to dry bones.\"\n\nAmong the brave men of Qi, one lived in the eastern outskirts, another in the west. By chance they met and drank together. \"Does wine need meat?\" they asked. Each drew his blade and cut his own flesh, feeding it to the other until both died.\n\nStone may be shattered but never robbed of its hardness; cinnabar may be ground but never robbed of its redness—for these qualities are received from Heaven.\n\nIn Lu there was an ugly man. His father, seeing the handsome Shang Duo, returned and told his neighbor: \"Shang Duo is not as fine as my son.\" This is the height of beauty falling short of the depth of ugliness—for a father’s love blinds him to his child’s flaws.\n\nThere was a man who stank. None among his kin, brothers, wives, concubines, or acquaintances could bear to be near him. He exiled himself to the sea, where a man delighted in his stench and followed him day and night without parting.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao conquered the Di and took two cities, he drank with a troubled countenance. He said: \"The great rivers do not rise beyond three days—yet in a single morning I have taken two cities of the Di. Ruin will soon reach me.\" Confucius heard this and said: \"Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin.\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong was bound by Lu and sent to Qi in a caged cart, the laborers pulling it sang as they went. Fearing Lu might regret and halt the transfer, yet wishing to reach Qi quickly, Guan Zhong said to the laborers: \"Let me sing, and you join in.\" The laborers did not tire, and the journey was swift. Guan Zhong knew how to make use of things—he harnessed the laborers’ eagerness to flee, singing to urge them onward.\n\nThe man of the Dao values drawing the distant from the near, the ancient from the present, the unseen from what is seen. Thus by examining the shade beneath the hall, one knows the movements of sun and moon; seeing ice in a jar’s water, one knows the world’s cold; tasting a single bite of meat, one knows the flavor of the whole pot.\n\nA man was about to cross a river, carrying an infant he meant to cast into the water. When asked why, he replied: \"His father is a good swimmer.\" Though the father swims well, does that mean the child must too? The governance of Chu is much like this.\n\nI do not associate with those inferior to me, nor with those my equal—for they bring me no benefit.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou said: \"The noble man is constrained by those who do not know him, yet expands in the presence of those who do.\"\n\nA pit one *xun* deep is beyond the reach of a man’s arm—so too is there knowledge beyond human grasp.\n\nWhen Yue Yang returned from conquering Zhongshan, his face bore the look of one demanding reward. Marquis Wen of Wei showed him two baskets of slanderous letters. Yue Yang faced north, bowed twice, and said: \"Even a single slip of paper would suffice—why two baskets?\"\n\nWhen man and steed race together, the man cannot outrun the steed. But seated in a chariot, the steed cannot outrun the man. So too when a ruler competes for office—it is no different from racing alongside a steed.\n\nThe eye’s vision depends on light; the mind’s wisdom depends on principle.\n\nA boneless creature cannot be made to know ice—born in spring, dead by autumn, it knows nothing of winter’s frost. A question ten *li* away cannot be heard; what lies beyond curtains and walls cannot be seen; what occurs within three *mu* the heart cannot know—yet one desires to awaken the east, pacify the southern tribes, subdue the western lands, and embrace the northern peoples. How can this be achieved? These are the names of the four distant states.\n\nGuan Yiwu and Baili Xi were steeds for hegemons and kings. Those who cross rivers rely on boats; those who reach far rely on steeds.\n\nThe King of Chu asked Zhan He about the way to govern the state. Zhan He replied: \"I have heard of governing the self, not of governing the state—for the state’s root lies in the self.\" Zhan He was a recluse.\n\nGuan Zhong said: \"The noble man has three countenances: the joyful mien of bells and drums, the solemn and pure mien of mourning garments, and the surging and brimming mien of weapons and armor.\"\n\nWhen the Wei River flooded, a rich man drowned. Someone recovered his corpse and demanded a great sum for its ransom. The rich man’s kin consulted Deng Xi, who said: \"Be at ease—there will be no buyer.\" The finder, worried the corpse would not be ransomed, again consulted Deng Xi. Deng Xi said: \"Be at ease—no one else will sell it, and it will surely be ransomed.\" Words that do not deceive the heart are words that illuminate the heart. Words that divide kin bring misfortune.\n\nTo hew wood by the inked line is to build a palace that will not stand.\n\nTalented individuals are rare.\n\nPull its guiding cord, and ten thousand eyes arise; pull its main rope, and ten thousand eyes align. Governing the people is like this. A reservoir gathers water in a thousand-fathom gorge—who can withstand it?\n\nWhen the Rong Yi tribesman left Qi for Lu, the weather turned bitterly cold. He and one disciple lodged outside the city walls. As the cold grew more severe, he said to his disciple: \"You may save my life with your clothes. I am a man of the realm, one the world would grieve to lose. You are unworthy—your loss would not be mourned.\" The disciple replied: \"How could an unworthy man give his clothes to a man of the realm?\" Rong Yi sighed, then removed his garments and gave them to the disciple. By midnight, Rong Yi had died, but the disciple survived.\n\nWhen Yanzi faced danger from Cui Zhu, he grasped the carriage strap and mounted. His driver urged the horses to speed, but Yanzi said: \"Be at ease. Haste does not ensure survival, nor does slowness ensure death. A deer born in the mountains may yet hang in the kitchen. Now my fate hangs somewhere as well.\"\n\nTo summon rain with a dragon, to chase a shadow with its form—like calls to like, qi aligns with qi, and sound responds to sound. Thus, when the gong note is struck, the shang note answers. If the ruler’s virtue does not flow, the people’s desires cannot reach him—this is the stagnation of the state. A stagnant tree rots, stagnant water festers, and a stagnant state gathers every disaster. Though heaven is high, the sun, moon, stars, clouds, rain, and dew never rest. Though earth is vast, its springs, grasses, trees, and creatures never cease.\n\nA cap adorns the head, and robes adorn the body. Yet if one severs the head for a cap or slays the body for robes, one knows not what one does. The world’s pursuit of profit is likewise senseless.\n\nThe noble Yellow Emperor died, the worthy Yao and Shun died, the valiant Meng Ben died. Those who appraise jade fear stones that resemble jade; those who appraise swords fear blades like Wu and Gan Jiang; a worthy ruler fears eloquent men who seem wise. A doomed ruler may seem wise, and a doomed minister may seem loyal.\n\nWhen Zixia passed through Wei, he heard someone reading from the historical records: \"The Jin army’s three pigs crossed the river.\" Zixia said: \"That is incorrect—it was the day *ji-hai*.\"\n\nTo gain ten fine horses is not as good as gaining one Bo Le; to gain ten fine swords is not as good as gaining one Ou Leng; to gain a thousand *li* of land is not as good as gaining one worthy man.\n\nIn summer, one does not wear furs—not from lack of love for furs, but because warmth is already sufficient. In winter, one does not use a fan—not from lack of love for the fan, but because coolness is already sufficient. A torch illuminates one corner, leaving half the room in darkness. If the bones harden early, the body and mind will not grow.\n\nLü Buwei, Chancellor under the First Emperor, assembled scholars to compile the *Twelve Records*, *Eight Surveys*, and *Six Discourses*. Displayed in the Xianyang marketplace, it was said that anyone who could add or remove a single word would be rewarded with a thousand gold—yet none dared alter it. The rituals of the *Twelve Records* are not transcribed here.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* in twenty-two scrolls states: Pouring boiling water on boiling water only makes the chaos worse, just as whipping the sky or striking a horse will not teach it—even Yi Yin or Zao Fu could not transform it. Those who rely on schemes labor in vain.\n\nWhite stands alone, yet the five colors arise from it; the Dao stands alone, yet the ten thousand things arise from it. A deaf man learns songs but cannot enjoy them. One whose heart is closed yet forces himself to mimic the deaf emits songs from his mouth, only for them to scatter like mist.\n\nIce meets spring and melts into water; water faces winter and freezes into ice.\n\nUse the Dao as the fishing rod, virtue as the line, ritual and music as the hook, benevolence and righteousness as the bait. Cast it into the river, float it in the sea, and the ten thousand things will be caught.\n\nThe city of Liyang became a lake in a single night. Liyang was a county in Huainan. Someone warned the magistrate of Liyang: \"If you see blood on the city gate, flee without looking back.\" Later, a gatekeeper reported blood on the threshold. The magistrate fled to the northern mountains, and the city sank beneath the waters—he himself turned to stone.\n\nA Yue canoe or Shu raft cannot float without water; the Wu Hao bow or Xizi crossbow cannot shoot without a string.\n\nWhen the ruler punishes the violent, many whirlwinds arise; when laws are harsh, many pests appear; when the innocent are killed, the land turns red; when decrees are untimely, excessive rains fall.\n\nIn the south grows the herb of immortality; in the north lies ice that never melts.\n\nThose who drink water are skilled at floating and endure the cold—they are fish. Those who eat earth have no hearts yet are kind—they are earthworms. Those who eat wood are strong yet foolish—they are deer. Those who eat mulberry leaves produce silk—they are silkworms. Those who eat meat are brave and fierce—they are tigers and leopards. Those who consume qi are spiritually enlightened and long-lived—they are turtles, snakes, Wang Qiao, and Chi Song. Those who eat grain are wise yet short-lived—they are humans.\n\nThose born by day resemble their fathers; those born at night resemble their mothers.\n\nA single brave warrior is the hero of three armies.\n\nThe sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding yet not storing.\n\nBegging for fire is not as good as taking flint; borrowing water is not as good as digging a well. Like Yi, who sought the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, Chang’e stole and consumed it—yet she did not know from whence the elixir of immortality came.\n\nIn life, one has a seven-foot form; in death, one becomes a clod of earth in a coffin. How can one know the joys and sorrows, the gains and losses? Though heaven and earth are vast, their dimensions can be measured; the movements of the stars and moon can be known through calendars and calculations.\n\nWhen Cang Jie created writing, grain rained from the sky, and ghosts wept at night. Cang Jie was the historian of the Yellow Emperor. Once writing was invented, deceit and falsehood arose—hence the ghosts wept.\n\nToday’s rulers, with meager virtue, increase punishments, like holding a sling to lure birds or carrying a staff to tame dogs. A caged dog, though restrained, is not truly tamed.\n\nThose who ride carriages and horses travel a thousand *li* without wearying their feet; those who board boats and oars cross rivers and seas without swimming.\n\nJust as intelligence fails to match one’s own abilities—wood strikes and the axle snaps, water rages and the boat shatters—one does not blame the wood or stone but faults the skill or clumsiness. Why? Because intelligence has its limits.\n\nA small debt is easily repaid; a light duty is easily kept. A swift wind stirs waves; lush trees draw flocks of birds—such is the momentum of mutual generation.\n\nKing Wen was wise yet fond of inquiry, hence his sagacity; King Wu was brave yet fond of inquiry, hence his victory.\n\nWhen strength exceeds the task, the bearer feels no weight; when ability matches the work, the doer finds no difficulty.\n\nOf all things under heaven, none is more perilous than *xidu*; yet a skilled physician stores it, for it has its use. *Xidu* is *fuzi*. Even worthless weeds must not be discarded—how much less a person?\n\nA tree ten spans in girth can support a house of a thousand *jun*; a bolt five inches long can secure a gate’s opening and closing. Not that the material differs in size, but that its position is crucial.\n\nWere Confucius and Mozi to govern the world, the world would become wholly Confucian or Mohist—such is the power of grasping the essential.\n\nThe Dao of the sage is like setting up an altar at a crossroads—passersby draw from it as they will, each taking what suits them, though the amounts differ.\n\nA crossroads is where six roads meet; *dūn* means \"to squat,\" *jiǔfù* refers to a wine vessel.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows nothing of profit or harm, yet a loving mother cherishes it—such is the nature of affection.\n\nA kind father loves his child, a sage king nurtures his people, as fire is naturally hot, as ice is naturally cold—this is the way of their nature. But when it comes to exerting effort, one relies on its results, like fighting a fire aboard a boat. All hearts unite to save it.\n\nA chariot without a three-inch linchpin cannot be driven; a door without a five-inch bolt cannot be secured. Thus, the noble person values what is essential.\n\nGoverning a state is like tuning a zither or lute: if the thick strings are slack, the thin strings will snap.\n\nGoverning a state is like setting a net: pull the main rope, and all the meshes open.\n\nExcessive desires harm righteousness; excessive worries impair wisdom; excessive fear undermines courage.\n\nTigers and leopards are hunted for their patterned hides; the *Xuāndí* are lured by their agility to be stabbed. Thus, Zilu died for his bravery, while the wise and foolish alike may be trapped by their own cunning. One who blows away dust yet wishes not to be speckled, or wades through water yet wishes not to get wet—this cannot be.\n\nGrand mansions with connected halls and chambers are where people find comfort, yet birds entering them grow anxious. Dense forests and thickets are where people feel fear, yet birds find safety there. Deep ravines and towering trees with sprawling branches are where the *Huándí* delight, yet people shudder at the sight.\n\nWhen a round pellet is rolled on the ground, the spherical one rolls into the marsh, while the square one rests on high ground.\n\nOne in mourning hears music and weeps; one in joy sees tears and laughs. Those who force themselves to weep may appear sorrowful yet feel no grief; those who force themselves to laugh may smile yet feel no joy.\n\nStraw dogs and clay dragons, when first made, are dressed in fine silks and brocades; once their use is done, they are discarded in the dirt. Straw dogs are used in rituals to atone for faults; clay dragons are used to pray for rain. Though their names differ, they share the same principle—just as a butchered ox may be cooked in countless ways, yet it remains one ox.\n\nWhen a *yúzhāng* tree is felled, some parts become coffins, others beams and pillars—yet it is the same wood.\n\nDesolation is the ruler of form; silence is the master of sound.\n\nA guest once visited Zijian, who said: \"You alone commit three faults: smiling when you see me is insolence; speaking intimately despite our shallow acquaintance is recklessness; and not addressing me by name is perversity.\" The same person may be a gentleman or a petty man—it depends on how one views them.\n\nIf one waits for a flying hare to harness and ride, no one in the world will ever mount a chariot. If one waits for Mao Qiang or Xi Shi to marry, one will remain single for life. If one waits for ancient worthies to employ, no one will ever be used. A swift steed covers a thousand *li* in a day, but a mediocre horse, driven ten times over ten days, will also arrive—thus, talent alone cannot be relied upon.\n\nWhen a bird is cornered, it pecks; when a beast is cornered, it gores; when a person is cornered, they deceive.\n\nHarsh punishments and strict laws cannot suppress treachery.\n\nDiscourse on the Dao and virtue is like the sun and moon: south of the Yangtze or north of the Yellow River, their course cannot be altered; racing a thousand *li* cannot change their place.\n\nPreferences and aversions within the bounds of propriety are like the dwellings of a house: the eastern neighbor calls it west, the western neighbor calls it east. Yet when one knocks at the door to borrow fire, none refuse—such is the abundance of generosity. Thus, in the forest, firewood is not sold; by the lake, fish are not hoarded—because there is enough.\n\nOne does not exploit another’s advantage nor press another’s peril.\n\nShu Xiang said to a Mohist: \"Jiu wished to see King Hui of Qin but was denied for three years. Once he reached Chu, the king of Chu delighted in him.\" Some things are naturally near yet seem far, while others are far yet feel near. Thus, one must be flexible.\n\nA true man’s conduct cannot be concealed.\n\nBefore catching the beast, one fears too few wounds; after catching it, one fears too many.\n\nIn ancient marriage rites, the host was never named—only the parents and brothers were mentioned. Shun did not inform Gusou before marrying, which was against ritual. King Wen established Boyi Ke, which was not the proper system. The rites prescribe marriage at thirty, yet King Wen fathered a child at sixteen—this was not the law.\n\nGoverning a state has its constants: benefiting the people is the essence of governance; teaching has its principles, with effective commands as the priority. If it benefits the people’s hearts, there is no need to follow antiquity; if it suits the matter at hand, there is no need to adhere to convention. Laws and decrees are made according to what is fitting. Changing the ancient is not necessarily wrong; following custom is not necessarily praiseworthy.\n\nA hundred rivers flow from different sources yet all return to the sea; a hundred schools pursue different paths yet all aim for order.\n\nA blind man walks along the road: if told to go left, he goes left; if told to go right, he goes right. If he meets a noble person, he finds level ground; if he meets a petty man, he falls into a ditch.\n\nOne who faces east cannot see the western wall; one who faces south cannot see the northern direction—only one without fixed direction sees all.\n\nIf a father is drowning, one grasps his hair to save him—not out of disrespect, but to rescue him from death.\n\nThe highest reward costs nothing; the most severe punishment is not excessive.\n\nWhen sailing and encountering wind, waves rise and one fears death, leaping into the water—not because life is not precious or death not feared, but because the fear of death drives one to forget life.\n\nThose who indulge in desires are the same.\n\nA trickle of water can fill a comb’s case; the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers cannot fill a leaking goblet.\n\nA drunkard stumbles into the Huai, mistaking it for a shallow ditch; a hunchback enters a city gate, thinking it a seven-foot doorway—wine has clouded their minds.\n\nWhen a horse or hare falls into danger, they die and are buried with a mat; when an ox has served people well, it is buried with a great cart.\n\nThe way of warfare is to appear soft yet strike with hardness; to appear weak yet strike with strength. If you wish to go west, show them east, so they know where you emerge but not where you enter—like a ghost leaving no trace, like water leaving no wound, like lightning’s flash, impossible to guard against.\n\nBehind high walls and deep moats, arrows and stones rain down; on broad marshes and open plains, blades clash—yet soldiers vie to advance because rewards are certain and punishments clear.\n\nIn scorching heat, they do not unfurl parasols; in bitter cold, they do not don furs—such were the great generals of old. Troops dig wells before they drink; commanders eat only after their men have been fed, thus sharing hunger and thirst. Where arrows and stones fall, they share peril and safety alike.\n\nNothing in the world clings as fiercely as glue and lacquer, yet glue and lacquer corrode each other; once entwined, they cannot return to their original state. Nothing in the world is as opposed as ice and charcoal, yet ice longs for charcoal. When ice meets charcoal, it melts—thus it returns to its original nature.\n\nOrchids bloom in secluded valleys, not ceasing their fragrance for lack of admirers; boats float on rivers and lakes, not refusing to sail for lack of passengers. A man marrying off his daughter instructs her: \"Beware of doing good.\" When she asks why, he replies: \"If even good is not to be done, how much less evil?\"\n\nPrisoners in fetters lament the length of days; those condemned to the execution ground lament their brevity.\n\nA girl married to a man with wasting thirst—when her husband dies, they say she brought misfortune. A robe of white fox fur is worn by the Son of Heaven. Yet to the fox, a marsh is better than a tally.\n\nFirst bind the threads, then weave the hemp, and you may make a curtain; first weave the hemp, then bind the threads, and you cannot make a garment. Marriages arranged through matchmakers may not succeed; friendships formed through personal regard endure. To don a sheepskin and hire oneself out as a laborer is excessive; to wear a raccoon-dog fur while carrying a basket is most strange.\n\nThe noble person admits no unworthy kind; the sun and moon respond only to proper qi.\n\nTo perform rites improperly is like chasing a madman while fleeing, or a thief asking a beggar to copy laws. To squat and recite the *Odes* and *Documents*—\n\nA horse resembling a deer is worth a thousand gold pieces; yet there is no deer worth a thousand gold. Paint Meng Ben’s eyes large, and one cannot help but fear him; paint Xi Shi’s face fair, and one cannot help but delight in her.\n\nFouled by the same filth, no mud differs. A lone straight line is not tolerated among many crooked ones; a lone upright is not tolerated among many bent. Thus, when people are many, they devour wolves; when wolves are many, they devour people.\n\nA man of Ying buys roof beams and trades a chariot hub with another—though the size is sufficient, the length falls short.\n\nA pregnant woman who sees a hare will bear a child with a cleft lip.\n\nDuke Wen discarded his sleeping mat; Jiu Fan resigned and left. When Duke Wen of Jin cast aside the blackened mat, he was casting off the old. Thus Jiu Fan departed, knowing Heaven would grant amnesty and many would be executed. Some knew Heaven’s amnesty would spare many lives, yet people’s hopes aligned while punishments differed.\n\nA dwarf asked a tall man: \"Is the sky higher for you than for me?\" The tall man replied: \"I do not know.\" The dwarf said: \"You are closer to the sky than I.\" To ask about matters, one should ask those nearest.\n\nA man selling his own mother tells the buyer: \"This mother is old.\" He hopes for kind treatment—this is great unrighteousness seeking to appear as small righteousness. A madman who harms others is resented by none, for his illness has robbed him of reason.\n\nBeautiful women do not share the same form, nor do lovely women share the same face, yet all please the eye. Pears, oranges, jujubes, and chestnuts do not share the same taste, yet all delight the palate.\n\nA single move in chess does not reveal wisdom; a single string does not convey sorrow. A posthumous child does not long for his father, for he has no love in his heart.\n\nWhen bathing tools are prepared, ants and lice commiserate; when a grand mansion is completed, swallows and sparrows congratulate.\n\nThe angler stills the water; the netter stirs it; the trapper presses down; the spearer lifts up—though their methods differ, they all catch fish.\n\nWater from the fields flows into the sea; whispers in the ear are heard a thousand *li* away.\n\nIn mid-summer, one wears garments fit for winter and does not remove them; crossing water, one lifts one’s robes, yet on land does not lower them—this is not knowing how to adapt.\n\nDried meat on the cheek is pleasing; on the forehead, it is ugly. Embroidery suits a quilt; on a hat, it is foul.\n\nMountain clouds rise, and pillars grow damp; dodder withers when *fuling* sprouts. Dodder grows without roots; snakes slither without feet; fish hear without ears; cicadas sing without mouths.\n\nA crane lives a thousand years and exhausts its joy; a mayfly lives but a day and exhausts its joy.\n\nA luminous pearl is the clam’s affliction, yet my gain. The brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; the opening of ten windows does not equal the brightness of one door.\n\nTo don a straw raincoat to fight a fire, or to dig a channel to stop water, only increases the trouble.\n\nWhen the swan goose is in the egg, a single finger can crush it; when its wings are fully grown, it soars on its back through the azure sky, its breast brushing the red clouds—even its parents cannot catch it.\n\nHalberds are for storming cities; mirrors are for reflecting forms. Yet an official who obtains a halberd uses it to cut greens, and a blind man who obtains a mirror uses it to cover his wine cup.\n\nYao had eight brows—his brows bore eight lines.\n\nA man cooked a macaque and invited his neighbor. The neighbor thought it dog stew and ate with great relish. Later, hearing it was macaque, he spat it out onto the ground, never having known its true taste.\n\nIn Na and Deng there was a flutist who falsely claimed to be Li Qi. People rushed to learn from him, but when they discovered the truth, they abandoned his melodies—never having known true music. Li Qi was a master of music from Zhao.\n\nSilkworms that produce cocoons twice a year are no less profitable, yet royal law forbids it, for they strip the leaves bare. When *li* rice ripens, farmers weed it, not letting small gains harm the greater harvest. *Li* rice grows from fallen grains.\n\nButchers eat leek stew; cartwrights walk much; potters use cracked basins; carpenters live in cramped huts. Only when a boat capsizes does one see the good swimmer; only when a horse bolts does one see the skilled driver.\n\nWhere forests grow lush, axes and hatchets enter; where targets are set up, arrows and bows gather.\n\n*Yi Lin*, Scroll Two, End.\n\n**Yi Lin, Scroll Three**\n*Compiled by Ma Zong of Fufeng during the Yuanhui era*\n\n*Salt and Iron Discourse* (Ten Scrolls)\nAll are literary works wherein scholars debate with ministers.\n\nThe consummate conqueror does not wage war; the consummate warrior does not muster troops; the consummate commander does not array forces.\n\nIf artisans do not emerge, tools and goods grow scarce; if merchants do not emerge, treasures and commodities vanish.\n\nRivers and plains cannot fill a leaking goblet; mountains and seas cannot sate boundless desire.\n\nA house near the market grows rich—wealth lies in strategy, not in toiling the soil.\n\nA master singer makes others prolong his voice; a master craftsman makes others complete his work.\n\nConfucius excelled in the square but not the round, and so starved in Liqiu.\n\nBeneath dense forests, no lush grass grows; between great clods, no fine seedlings sprout.\n\nThose who travel far rely on chariots; those who cross seas depend on boats; those who achieve renown depend on resources—Ou Ye could rely on the lord of the state to forge great bells from bronze and iron, yet could not craft a single pot, tripod, plate, or bowl himself.\n\nFragrant bait is no less fine, yet tortoises and dragons hear and retreat deep, while simurghs and phoenixes see and soar high.\n\nA basket filled with jade fragments is no treasure.\n\nAt the gates of Confucius, seventy disciples left parents and homes, shouldering their burdens to follow. Confucius did not plow but studied, yet disorder grew only worse—like a basket filled with jade fragments.\n\nIf one can bring peace to the state and benefit the people, what need is there for ornate words?\n\nGrain one possesses but cannot eat is no remedy for hunger; worthy men one observes but cannot employ bring no profit.\n\nSingers do not strive for resonant tones but value perfect rhythm; debaters do not strive for florid phrases but focus on factual truth.\n\nMinisters and nobles are the models for all under heaven, the cinnabar and ink of spiritual transformation. Above, they bear the duty of aiding an enlightened lord; below, they follow the governance of sagely transformation.\n\nScholars cling to withered bamboo and hollow words, unaware of the proper course or the changes of the age.\n\nIn dense forests, fierce winds arise; in wealth and nobility, flattering words abound.\n\nIn ancient times, the noble-minded pondered virtue; the petty-minded pursued profit. Today, men steel their brows and sharpen their tongues, competing to advance their careers.\n\nWhen a nine-tiered terrace collapses, even Lu Ban cannot set it right; when the great court turns corrupt, even Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou cannot restore it. The path of officials is muddled and unrefined.\n\nWealth and nobility buy office with money—donning green sashes, jade pendants, and silver tortoises, wielding the power of life and death, controlling the lives of the myriad people, riding in carriages with outriders, forming processions of mounted escorts—yet they know nothing of the toil of bearing burdens or walking on foot.\n\nThe Central States and the borderlands are like limbs to the torso, skin to the heart. When the skin chills without, the heart ails within. Block them with benevolence and righteousness, bar them with the Dao and virtue, guard them with worthy men, and none can breach them.\n\nQin’s laws were denser than autumn thistles, its nets tighter than congealed fat, yet superiors and inferiors deceived one another, and deceit and falsehood flourished together.\n\nWhen the stables burned, Confucius asked after the people, not the horses—valuing men over beasts.\n\nQin’s laws condemned to death those who stole horses, and to punishment those who stole oxen—excessive severity.\n\n*Garden of Persuasions* (Twenty Scrolls) by Liu Xiang\n\nAn east wind bends all to the west; a west wind bends all to the east.\n\nThe transformation of superiors shapes inferiors like wind bending grass.\n\nWhen Yu saw a condemned man, he alighted from his chariot and wept. His attendants said, \"This man was disrespectful and thus incurred guilt—why does the lord grieve so?\" Yu replied, \"The people of Yao took Yao as their heart; now the common folk each take their own heart as their heart—this is why I grieve.\"\n\nDuke Jing of Qi went hunting. Ascending a mountain, he saw a tiger; descending, he saw a snake. He asked Yanzi, \"Is this an ill omen?\" Yanzi replied, \"To have worthies yet not recognize them, to recognize them yet not employ them, to employ them yet not trust them—*that* is an ill omen. Mountains are the tiger’s den, marshes the snake’s lair—what ill omen is there?\"\n\nYanzi attended Duke Jing. The duke, feeling cold at court, requested, \"Bring warm food for me.\" Yanzi replied, \"I am not a kitchen servant but a minister of the altars of soil and grain.\"\n\nDuke Ping of Jin asked Shi Kuang, \"I am seventy and wish to study—is it too late?\" Shi Kuang said, \"When dusk falls, does one not light a candle? I have heard that to learn in youth is like the sunrise’s radiance; to learn in prime is like the midday’s brilliance; to learn in old age is like a candle’s glow—is this not better than darkness?\" The duke said, \"Well said!\"\n\nZengzi wore tattered clothes while plowing. The lord of Lu sent envoys to grant him a city, but he refused, saying, \"I have heard that those who receive from others fear them, and those who give to others grow arrogant. How do I know the lord will not grow arrogant toward me, or that I will not come to fear him?\" Thus he did not accept.\n\nThe official surrenders his person to his lord, his emoluments to his parents. The loyal minister does not serve two lords; the chaste woman does not remarry.\n\nTo dwell without walls yet suffer no harm, to walk without defense yet meet no violence—this is the conduct of the noble man.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu feasted his ministers. The candles went out, and someone tugged at a beauty’s robe. She tore off his cap tassel and told the king. The king said, \"To feast men and let them grow drunk, then expose a woman’s virtue—this I will not do.\" He commanded his attendants not to relight the candles, declaring, \"All who drink with me tonight must tear off their tassels to show they have reveled fully.\" The ministers all tore off their tassels, and only then were the candles relit. Later, in battle with Jin, the man who had tugged the beauty’s robe fought five times to repay King Zhuang.\n\nYang Hu offended the state of Wei and fled north to see Viscount Jian of Zhao, saying, \"From now on, I will no longer cultivate men.\" The men in the hall—more than half were those he had cultivated, yet now they endangered him. Viscount Jian said, \"Those who plant peach and plum trees rest in their shade in summer; those who plant thorns reap their prickles in autumn. The men you have planted are thorns. From now on, choose carefully whom you cultivate.\"\n\nIn governance, do not reject what comes uninvited, nor promise what is merely hoped for. Facing wealth, nothing surpasses integrity; facing abundance, nothing surpasses impartiality. No assault can breach the guard of integrity and impartiality.\n\nA state need not strive to be large, but to win the people’s hearts; an aide need not strive to be numerous, but to obtain the worthy and outstanding.\n\nKing Xuan of Qi asked Master Chunyu Kun, \"What, sir, does this lonely one favor?\" He replied, \"The ancients favored four things, and the king favors three. The ancients favored fine horses, and the king does too. The ancients favored jade, and the king does too. The ancients favored beauty, and the king does too. The ancients favored scholars, but the king does not.\" The king said, \"The state has no scholars—if there were, this lonely one would favor them too.\" He replied, \"The famed steeds *Lu* and *Qi Ji* were not born, yet the king sought them; the cubs of leopards and elephants were not born, yet the king sought them; Mao Qiang and Xi Shi were not born, yet the king sought them—why not seek scholars?\" Yang Hui sought an audience with Viscount Jian of Zhao, saying, \"I was banished from my village three times and left five lords’ service—I heard you favor scholars, so I have come.\" The attendants said, \"Banished three times from his village, he was not tolerated by the crowd; leaving five lords’ service, he was not loyal to his superiors.\" Viscount Jian said, \"A beautiful woman is the enemy of the ugly; a gentleman of great virtue is shunned in troubled times. Upright conduct is hated by the crooked and perverse.\" Thus he employed him as chief minister.\n\nA garment is made with a missing hem, a palace with a missing corner—this shows incompletion, for ghosts and spirits abhor fullness.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou admonished Bo Qin, \"Do not let Lu make you arrogant toward others.\"\n\nA state suffers five colds, and frost is not among them: first, misgovernance; second, epidemics; third, leaked schemes; fourth, disrespect that ruins the state; fifth, neglecting internal affairs while pursuing external ones.\n\nOffice does not seek power, yet power comes of itself; power does not seek wealth, yet wealth comes of itself; wealth does not seek nobility, yet nobility comes of itself; nobility does not seek arrogance, yet arrogance comes of itself; arrogance does not seek guilt, yet guilt comes of itself.\n\nIn Lu there was a reverent scholar who, though seventy, grew ever more reverent. The lord of Lu asked, \"At your advanced age, you may relax your reverence.\" He replied, \"The noble man is reverent to achieve renown; the petty man is reverent to avoid punishment. A single careless word may yet lead to stumbling; though a meal be fine, one may still choke.\"\n\nThe swan soars in the heavens, yet the archer brings it down; though tiger and leopard be fierce, men feast upon their flesh. Few praise a man, many revile him—how could one not be reverent?\n\nFamine and plague among the people are not to be feared; when high ministers, laden with emoluments, fail to remonstrate to the utmost, and close courtiers, fearing punishment, dare not speak—*this* is the great peril.\n\nZhao Xiangzi asked Zilu, “I once asked Confucius, ‘You have served seventy lords—was there not a single enlightened ruler among them?’ Confucius did not answer. What does it mean to be worthy?” Zilu replied, “If one sets up the world’s great bell but strikes it with a stick, how can it sound? One who sleeps soundly through the night cannot rise early; what flourishes in one place withers in another; what is long on the left is short on the right. When one is exalted and another debased, the depth of their bond is revealed; when one lives and another dies, the truth of their friendship is known.”\n\nThe mouth is a weapon: words spoken amiss rebound to wound oneself.\n\nWhat cinnabar stores turns red; what lacquer stores turns black—the noble man is cautious in what he treasures.\n\nBirds cherish their feathers, tigers and leopards their claws, for these sustain their bodies.\n\nAccumulated kindness becomes *love*; accumulated love becomes *ren*; accumulated *ren* becomes the *Spirit Terrace*. The Spirit Terrace is the accumulation of *ren*. The numinous spirit is the root of Heaven.\n\nWhen Yanzi served as chief minister, his concubines wore no silk, his horses ate no grain. “How then can you adorn the state?” he was asked. He replied, “Virtue adorns the state—I have never heard of doing so with concubines and horses.”\n\nZhao Jianzi rode a shabby carriage drawn by a lean horse, and wore a coat of lamb’s wool. His steward said, “A new carriage brings comfort, a fat horse speed, a fox-fur coat warmth—my lord ought to change them.” Jianzi replied, “When a noble man wears fine things, his reverence increases; when a petty man wears fine things, his arrogance grows.” Zigong said to Zishi, “Why not study the *Odes*?” Zishi replied, “My parents demand my filial piety, my brothers my fraternal duty, my friends my trustworthiness—when would I find time to study?” Zigong said, “Set aside my *Odes* and learn from the *Odes*.”\n\nIn the fourth year of the *He Ping* era, the Director of Waterways and Remonstrating Grand Master Liu Xiang memorialized: “The higher the melody, the fewer who can harmonize with it; water both bears the boat and overturns it.”\n\nThe Master of Chuqiu, at seventy, clad in furs, sought audience with Lord Mengchang. The lord said, “You are aged, Master—what instruction can you give me?” The Master replied, “If you wished me to chase chariots, spur horses, pursue deer, and grapple with tigers, I would die at once—what leisure have I for age? But if you would have me resolve doubts and settle hesitations, then I am still young—what age is there in that?” Lord Mengchang flushed with shame.\n\nThe King of Wei wished to build the Terrace of Central Heaven, declaring, “Whoever dares remonstrate shall die.” Xu Wan shouldered a basket and hoe and entered, saying, “I hear Your Majesty plans to build the Terrace of Central Heaven—I wish to offer my strength.” He continued, “I have heard that Heaven is fifteen thousand *li* from Earth; if Your Majesty halves this, the terrace should rise seven thousand five hundred *li*, with a base eight thousand *li* wide. Even if you seized all the land within your realm, it would not suffice for the foundation. You would need to raise troops to conquer the feudal lords and claim their lands—still it would not be enough. You would then have to attack the Western Barbarians to secure the rest. Then you must gather timber, laborers, and provisions. Only when all this is prepared can construction begin.” The King of Wei fell silent and later abandoned the project.\n\nA man sent fish to the Chancellor of Zheng, who refused them. “You are fond of fish—why not accept them?” he was asked. He replied, “It is *because* I am fond of fish that I do not accept them. If I took the fish, I would lose my salary and have no means to eat fish. By refusing the fish, I keep my salary and can eat fish all my life.”\n\nGovern with the wisdom of the old and the vigor of the young, and order is assured. When Azi Qi was sixteen, the Lord of Qi sent him to govern the city of A. Later, the lord regretted it and sent an envoy to recall him. The envoy returned, saying, “Azi Qi will surely govern A well—all those riding with him were white-haired.” When Azi Qi arrived in A, he melted down the armory’s weapons to forge farming tools. The state of Wei said, “We hear a child governs the city—its armories are empty, its granaries bare.” They raised troops to attack. The people of A, fathers leading sons, elder brothers leading younger brothers, fought with their private weapons and routed the Wei forces.\n\n*Fayan* in fifteen fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, annotated by Li Gui and Hong Fan.\n\nTo pursue learning is not as good as to seek a teacher. The teacher is the model for all people.\n\nThose who emulate Yan’s countenance are disciples of Yan; those who ride horses akin to Ji are steeds of Ji’s breed.\n\nThe *shi*-poet’s *fu* is resplendent yet measured; the mere rhetorician’s *fu* is resplendent yet frivolous. Had the disciples of Confucius employed *fu*, Jia Yi would have ascended the hall, and Sima Xiangru would have entered the inner chamber.\n\nWhat are the Four Weighty Matters? In speech, weightiness engenders method; in conduct, weightiness engenders virtue; in demeanor, weightiness engenders dignity; in preferences, weightiness engenders refinement.\n\nWhat are the Four Frivolous Matters? Frivolous speech invites sorrow; frivolous conduct invites guilt; frivolous demeanor invites disgrace; frivolous preferences invite calamity.\n\nIf a blade is dull, if a brush lacks sharpness, they must be honed and whetted.\n\nIf Heaven could be measured, its capacity to cover all things would be shallow. If Earth could be fathomed, its capacity to bear all things would be meager.\n\nOf those who discourse on Heaven, none is more eloquent than the *Book of Changes*; of those who discourse on Earth, none is more eloquent than the *Book of Documents*; of those who discourse on form, none is more eloquent than the *Book of Songs*; of those who discourse on principle, none is more eloquent than the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nConfucius was an exile from the state of Lu; Boyi and Shuqi were starving recluses of West Mountain. Yet they did not bend their wills, nor debase their persons—they were neither compliant like Yi nor yielding like Hui, but stood firm in their judgments.\n\nThe Dao of Confucius is like the four great rivers, flowing through the Central States and ultimately emptying into the vast sea.\n\n*The Canon of Supreme Mystery* in ten fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, annotated by Yu Fan.\n\nThe hawk gathers in the forest; the otter enters the spring.\n\nThe turtledove dwells in the woods, mocking the other birds.\n\nKing An of Huainan was rich in ornament but poor in substance.\n\nThe hegemony of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin followed one another like the sun and moon. Confucius was sufficient in culture; Laozi was sufficient in profundity. Mountains, rivers, marshes, and wetlands—all things return to them.\n\nWhen the noble man attains office, he prospers; when he loses it, he remains steadfast. When the petty man attains office, he becomes tyrannical; when he loses it, he is ruined.\n\n*New Discourses* in seventeen fascicles, by Huan Tan.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns governed through the Dao; the Five Emperors transformed through virtue; the Three Kings acted through benevolence and righteousness; the Five Hegemons employed cunning and strategy.\n\nThose without decrees or punishments are called Sovereigns; those with decrees but no punishments are called Emperors; those who reward the good and punish the wicked, with feudal lords paying court and serving, are called Kings; those who raise armies and forge alliances are called Hegemons.\n\nThe term *wang* (king) means \"to go forth\"—it signifies that his benevolent influence flows freely, and all under Heaven turn toward him. The kingly way is pure and unadulterated; its virtue is like that. The hegemonic way is mixed and uneven; its achievements are like this. Though both rule all under Heaven and govern the myriad people, passing down their legacies to their descendants, their essence is one.\n\nIf one fails to become a king, one may still become a hegemon.\n\nThe foundation of governing a state lies in its ministers; their appointments must all be men of great talent. Such great talent forms the limbs and wings of the ruler.\n\nA clear mirror is like divination by tortoise and milfoil; regulations and statutes are like measuring vessels; scales and steelyards are like rulers and foot-measures.\n\nThe outstanding scholars of former ages, who established merit and left behind names, had their portraits painted in palace halls and government chambers—these are the state’s greatest treasures, beyond any price. Though one were to amass He’s jades, pile up Xia’s huang-gems, fill a sack with the Marquis of Sui’s pearl, or a basket with night-shining jewels, it would not suffice as a comparison.\n\nMen like Yi Yin and Zhang Liang have existed in every age—yet if the ruler does not recognize them while the ministers do not exert themselves, they will not be employed.\n\nThere are five ranks of worthies: those who are diligent in family affairs and filial in their clans are scholars of the village; those who are vigorous, astute, and flawless in literature and history are scholars of the county court; those who are sincere and honest, whose conduct is upright and impartial, who manage subordinates and serve superiors, are scholars of the prefecture; those who are well-versed in the classics, whose reputations and conduct are lofty, who can govern with leniency and harmony while maintaining firm resolve, are scholars fit for the imperial court; those whose talents are surpassing and unique, who stand apart from the multitude, who devise grand strategies and can establish merit in the world, are scholars of all under Heaven.\n\nHad Jia Yi not been demoted and lost heart, his literary brilliance would not have flourished; had the Prince of Huainan not been wealthy and prosperous, he could not have widely recruited talented scholars to compose works; had the Grand Historian not been entrusted with records, he could not have systematically chronicled past and present; had Yang Xiong not been poor, he could not have written his profound discourses.\n\nThe Three Benevolent Ones of Yin were obscure in their time but illustrious afterward—what benefit did they bring to affairs? What aid did they give their lord?\n\nThe world has its twilight. Some speak of military strategy: the highest approach is to deploy forces in open terrain, securing victory through mobility; the middling approach is to block and intercept, contending for advantage; the lowest approach is to guard borders, fortifying strongholds, and arising from narrow lands. This is like Lord Xue’s counsel on Ying Bu’s rebellion: the superior plan was to seize the vast lands of Wu and Chu; the middling plan was to block the strategic passes and contend for advantage; the inferior plan was to rely on the Yangtze to face Yue, guarding borders and fortifying strongholds.\n\nWhen the generals and ministers of Gengshi failed to take precautions, they perished in the streets and were born in the tombs.\n\nKing Wen’s burial of dry bones brought no benefit to the common people, yet the people rejoiced—his benevolence and righteousness moved them. Wang Mang’s examination of the five viscera harmed no living person, yet the people loathed him—his cruelty was abhorrent.\n\nDongfang Shuo’s terse words and plain speech were taken as proof of his reliability, and all regarded him as a man of great wisdom, beyond the reach of later worthies. Huan Tan said: To mistake a fox for a wildcat, or a zither for a konghou, is already a false comparison. Yet if one not only fails to recognize the zither or the fox but also does not know the wildcat or the konghou, the error is compounded. To speak only of Shuo is also to fail to recognize later worthies.\n\nIf one accepts others’ praise, one must also accept their criticism. Wang Xi sent the commandant Mengsun to offer sacrifices at Mount Tai. On the way, he passed through Xuzhou, where the governor, Song Zhong, inquired about my talents and compared me to Chen Ping and the Marquis of Liu. Mengsun returned and joyfully told me, “Governor Zhong greatly praised your virtue—are you truly such a man?” I replied, “We have associated for four or five years, yet you never praised me. Now, upon hearing a single word from Governor Zhong, you find it strange. If someone were to slander me, would you also believe it? I fear you.”\n\nPreviously, when I served as Wang Xi’s instructor, a man killed his mother. There was an edict to burn his son’s corpse in the marketplace. I said this was not a matter that should be publicized.\n\nMy memorial stated: During Emperor Xuan’s reign, when the high ministers and grandees assembled in court, the Chancellor remarked in passing, “When a *xiao*-owl hatches its young, the fledglings, once grown, devour their mother before they can take flight.” At this, a worthy official responded, “I have only heard of crows whose young return to feed their mother.” The Chancellor was momentarily abashed and repented. People all belittled the Chancellor while esteeming that worthy man, for the worthy man’s words better served moral transformation. Even birds and beasts observe such taboos—how much more should humans? Such matters ought not to be publicized.\n\nA dragon without a foot of water cannot ascend to heaven; a sage without a foot of land cannot rule the world.\n\nProphecies emerge from the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, bearing only omens and portents that remain unknowable. Later generations recklessly embellished and falsely attributed them to Confucius—this is a grave error.\n\nZhang Zihou said, “Yang Ziyun is the Confucius of the Western Way, yet he lived in such poverty.” I replied, “Ziyun is also the Confucius of the Eastern Way. In ancient times, was the Master solely a sage of Lu? Confucius was also the sage of Qi and Chu.”\n\nCarving water or engraving ice melts away with time.\n\nConfucius taught his disciples through the Four Subjects, adapting to their inclinations, much like a marketplace displaying myriad goods—those who wish to purchase come from all directions. I once heard a saying from the streets: “When people hear of the joys of Chang’an, they turn westward at their gates and smile; when they crave the taste of meat, they whistle before the butcher’s stall.” Even ordinary folk, though they may not distinguish the sagely, still yearn and admire.\n\nYan Yuan’s life was cut short because he longed to match Confucius in years. It is like a mediocre horse following a fine steed, nose to tail, until dusk: the fine horse whinnies and eats as before, while the mediocre one hangs its head and refuses fodder—how different are Yan and Confucius from such a pair?\n\nIn my youth, I admired Yang Ziyun’s ornate prose and sought to emulate him. Once, I composed a short *fu*, straining my thoughts so intensely that I fell gravely ill. Ziyun himself said that when Emperor Cheng ordered him to write the *Ganquan Fu*, he collapsed suddenly. His five viscera seemed to burst from his body, and he had to gather them back with his hands. Upon waking, he suffered from qi depletion for a year. From this, it is clear that exhausting one’s thoughts harms the spirit.\n\nWhen Zhuang Zhou’s illness grew severe, his disciples wept before him. He replied, “If I die now, who will precede me? After a hundred years, who will follow? Since none can escape death, why cling to this fleeting moment?”\n\nZigong asked Lian Boyu, “How do you govern the state?” He answered, “I govern it by not governing.”\n\nThe ancient *Classic of Filial Piety* consisted of one scroll, twenty chapters, and 1,872 characters. Today, over four hundred characters differ.\n\nZuoshi said, “The Classics and their commentaries are like clothing: the lining and outer layer depend on each other to be complete.”\n\nYao’s ability to emulate Heaven lay in his esteem for his ability to employ the two sages, Shun and Yu.\n\nLiu Zizheng, Zizheng’s son Jun, and Jun’s nephew Boyu were all learned men, particularly revering the *Zuozhuan* and teaching it to their descendants, even down to the women of the household—this, too, is a form of blindness.\n\nLift a net by its main cord, and a thousand meshes open; grasp a fur coat by its collar, and ten thousand hairs align.\n\nTo govern a great state should be like this.\n\nTo replace the worthy with the worthy is called vexation; to replace them with the unworthy is called chaos.\n\nWang Pingzhong said: The *Zhou Genealogy* records that in the fifth year of King Ding, the Yellow River returned to its former course—yet the channel it flows through today is not the one Yu dredged.\n\nYang Ziyun was skilled in *fu* poetry, and Wang Junda was versed in weaponry; I wished to study under both. Ziyun said: “One who can read a thousand *fu* will excel in *fu*.” Junda said: “One who can observe a thousand swords will understand the sword.” The Master said: “Those who secretly practice to emulate divine skill do no more than enter the gate of those they imitate.”\n\nThe five blessings are longevity, wealth and honor, peace and joy, and many descendants.\n\nA centipede with a hundred legs, lifting its body as one—how could it not succeed?\n\nThe Marquis of Quyang summoned the fangshi Ximen Junhui to learn the art of reversing aging. Junhui said: “The tortoise is said to live three thousand years, the crane a thousand—why, with human talent, do we fall short of insects and birds?” I replied: “Who has ever lived long enough among tortoises and cranes to know their true age?”\n\nWhy do sages not study immortality and thus avoid death? Sages all attain liberation of form and ascend as immortals; they speak of death only to show the people that all things have an end.\n\nIn ancient times, when Shennong and Fuxi ruled the world, they made a zither of paulownia wood, three *chi* and six *cun* long with six *fen*, corresponding to the number of the twelve months. It was one *cun* and eight *fen* thick, corresponding to the three yang and six yin numbers. Its width was six *fen*, corresponding to the six pitch-pipes. The top was rounded and tapered, modeling Heaven; the bottom was square and level, modeling Earth. The top was broad and the bottom narrow, reflecting the rites of hierarchy.\n\nThe zither (*qin*) means “to restrain.” The sages of old played the zither to cultivate the mind. In adversity, they preserved their integrity alone, never losing their resolve—thus it was called *cao* (“resolve”). In success, they brought good to all under Heaven, with nothing left unharmonized—thus it was called *chang* (“harmony”).\n\nYao’s *Changjing* melody is lost; Shun’s *Cao* was clear and subtle; the Viscount of Wei’s *Cao* was clear and pure; Jizi’s *Cao* was pure and stirring.\n\n*Lunheng* by Wang Chong, twenty-seven scrolls:\nVirtue and conduct may be constant, but official position is not.\nWorthiness or unworthiness lies in talent; encounter or lack of it lies in timing.\nOne of high talent and pure conduct cannot be assured of noble rank; one of meager ability and impure conduct cannot be assured of lowly status.\nSome share the same conduct yet serve different lords—Yi Yin and Jizi are examples. Both were ministers for the ages: Yi Yin met Tang of Shang and became his chief minister, while Jizi met Zhou of Shang and became a slave. Thus we know the difference between encounter and lack of it.\n\nThe pure receives dust, the white receives grime. Where the green fly soils, it is always on fine white silk.\n\nVillage dogs bark in packs at what they find strange.\n\nThe zither player wishes Bo Ya’s fingers would break; the charioteer wishes Wang Liang’s hands would be severed—both resent those who surpass them.\n\nJade turns to stone, stone to gravel—slander brings this about. The jade-seeker breaks stone to obtain jade; the talent-selector discards the bad to choose the good. Fate does not strain.\n\nThe wise attribute it to Heaven. To seek wealth and honor is like digging a ditch or chopping firewood: dig without ceasing, and the ditch grows deep; swing the axe without pause, and the firewood piles high. Yet some dig a ditch only to meet a flood, or gather firewood only to meet a fire.\n\nEmbracing poverty averts disaster. Exert yourself in diligent work to attain wealth; hone your talent and refine your conduct to gain nobility.\n\nThe farmer who plows with strength reaps abundant grain; the merchant who travels far gains deep profit. Those destined for wealth naturally strengthen their sinews; those destined for nobility naturally heighten their talent—like the thousand-mile horse, whose vigor, keen eyes, head, hooves, and feet all match one another.\n\nThe wooden gate of Lu’s city wall had rotted and was about to collapse; Confucius hurried past it. His disciples said: “It has been like this for a long time.”\n\nConfucius said: “I detest its long decay—should it collapse, misfortune would follow.”\n\nA worm falls into a vessel, and the wine is cast out, undrunk; a rat gnaws through a basket, and the rice is discarded, uneaten.\n\nThe Mohists say that when a man dies, there is no fate; the Confucians say that when a man dies, there is fate. The commandery of Liyang transformed into a lake in a single night; Bai Qi buried four hundred thousand Zhao soldiers alive—were these, too, matters of fate?\n\nThose who speak of fate say: “They were fated to drown, so they gathered at Liyang; they were fated to be crushed, so they gathered on the plain.” When the Lord of Pei first rose in rebellion, men entered the markets of Feng and Pei, saying: “Many here will be enfeoffed as marquises.” A man’s fate is bound to his state; a creature’s fate is struck by man.\n\nThe people of Qi are leisurely, the people of Qin are careless, the people of Chu are hasty, the people of Yan are bold—each of the four states’ peoples intermingle and move among one another.\n\nZhang Cigong took a shamaness from the neighboring village as his wife. A diviner said: “This woman is destined for nobility.” Later, Cigong rose to the rank of Chancellor, and indeed, it was Cigong himself who was noble, thus matching the woman’s fate.\n\nThe world speaks of dwellings having fortune or misfortune, of moving house requiring auspicious months. I say the Dao of Heaven is hard to know—if there are those who offend it, it is because their fate is one of fortune or misfortune. Consider Jing Bu, who was to be executed before becoming a king; Wei Qing, who was to be enfeoffed like Zhou Yafu yet starved to death; Deng Tong, who was to suffer poverty and hunger—each had bones, joints, and skin unlike the others.\n\nKing Wen had four nipples while still in his mother’s womb; he was not born through later cultivation of virtue and power. Hou Ji, as a child, played at sowing seeds; Confucius, as a boy, arranged ritual vessels for amusement. Stone is born hard; orchids are born fragrant. Born with good qi, they grow and achieve fulfillment.\n\nThe mosquito is no match for the strength of oxen and horses, yet horses are tormented by mosquitoes—such is the power of circumstance. A bull ten spans in girth is driven by a lowly herdsman; an elephant several fathoms tall is hooked by a Yue boy—such is the lack of advantage.\n\nWhen Confucius blew the pitch pipes, he knew himself to be a descendant of the Yin; Xiang Yu had double pupils, a scion of Yu Shun. The sage has his own lineage—how could Yao and Gaozu truly be sons of dragons?\n\nDuke Jing of Song spoke three virtuous words and gained thirty-one years of reign; when Prince Dan of Yan was held captive in Qin, Heaven rained grain, horses grew horns, Qi Liang’s wife wept and the city walls collapsed; during Tang’s drought, he cut his hair and offered himself as a sacrifice to bring rain; Magistrate Zhuo of Nanyang, as Prefect of Weishi, kept locusts from entering his borders; Sunshu Ao buried a two-headed snake and accrued hidden virtue—all these are said to be false.\n\nIf the dragon had fled into the trees to escape Heaven’s punishment, it would not be divine. If it were truly divine, it would not have dragon’s liver or leopard’s fetus. Thus, it is known that when water and fire clash, they create thunder, and the dragon rises at the sound of thunder.\n\nKing Wu’s conquest of Zhou was said to be “without blood on the blades”—a false claim. At dawn, torches were lit, and blood flowed so thickly it floated the pestles—how could it be called “without blood on the blades”? When the Han forces executed Wang Mang and reached the Gradual Terrace, blood flowed over their ankles. No army in the world has ever fought without blood on its blades.\n\nZhou’s wine pools and grain mounds were said to host three thousand men drinking like oxen. They feasted through the long night, losing track of days, with chariots carrying wine and riders bearing roasted meat, counting one hundred and twenty days as a single month. In truth, Zhou may have spilled wine copiously upon the earth, thus naming it a “pool,” or piled fermented grain, thus naming it a “mound.” To say wine was made into pools, chariots carried wine, and meat was hung in forests, or that men and women stripped naked and chased one another through the woods—these were slanders of the attendants, who claimed three thousand men were involved, when in fact there were not.\n\nThe term *heding* refers to Jing Ke’s case: the Qin king executed Jing Ke’s entire clan, razing his village, so that every household was destroyed—hence the saying *tingting*. Yet even in Qin’s lawlessness, it is unlikely the entire village was exterminated. When the First Emperor visited Liangshan Palace and saw Li Si’s grand procession, he found it strange. His attendants secretly informed Li Si, who then reduced his retinue. The First Emperor, not knowing which of his attendants had spoken, executed all those nearby—Jing Ke’s village would not have been entirely wiped out.\n\nLu Ban carved a great goose that flew for three days without landing; he made a wooden cart and wooden figures to pull it for his mother, but once the mechanism was activated, it departed and never returned—this is likely untrue. Confucius traveled to over seventy states to offer counsel. Yet from his return to Lu from Wei, his starvation in Chen, his erasure of traces in Wei, and his felling of a tree in Song, he visited no more than ten states.\n\nZigao wept blood for three years without ever showing his teeth—how could he not show his teeth if he did not laugh or speak? When Qin Xi shattered his skull to recommend Baili Xi to Duke Mu of Qin, it was likely a case of kowtowing until his head bled, not truly shattering his skull.\n\nZu Yi admonished Zhou, saying: “There is no one in the world who does not wish for Your Majesty’s downfall.” This is an exaggeration—it was meant to frighten Zhou. If the entire world truly wished for Zhou’s fall, the realm would have dissolved at once, and there would have been no battle where blood flowed thick enough to float pestles.\n\nThe Master asked Zigong: “Between you and Yan Hui, who is the better?” Zigong replied: “Yan Hui—he hears one thing and understands ten.”\n\nConfucius knew full well that Yan Hui surpassed Zigong—why then did he ask? Had he asked, how could Zigong have dared claim superiority? The Master’s intent was likely to curb Zigong’s envy of Yan Hui by posing the question to humble him.\n\nWhen [Confucius’s son] Li died, he was buried in a coffin without an outer casket. At that time, grand officers rode in carriages drawn by three horses—why not sell one to purchase a casket? When he had been a knight, he rode in a carriage drawn by two horses, and selling one to aid an old acquaintance would not have disrupted the ritual order. Yet to bury one’s son without a casket was truly improper. How could he value the favor of an old friend over the rites due between father and son? If he did not sell his carriage to bury his son, was it not because he coveted his official position?\n\nBoyi and Shuqi, when their elder half-brother seized the throne, starved to death on Mount Shouyang—not because they yielded the state to their half-brother, so how could they be called worthy men?\n\nWhen Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the realm and failed, in his rage he struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Nüwa smelted stones of five colors to mend the azure sky and cut off the legs of the great turtle to prop up the four extremities. Yet if Gonggong had the strength to shatter mountains, why did he lose the battle? If Nüwa could mend the sky with stones, was the sky truly made of jade? Heaven’s pillars were originally mountains—how could turtle legs support them? The turtle must have been enormous, so how could Nüwa have killed it? She would have been slain herself—how then could she have mended the sky?\n\nThe Gate of Heaven lies in the north, the Portal of Earth in the east. The lowest regions of the earth are Yangzhou and Yanzhou, which suffered the worst flooding during the Great Deluge. Heaven’s adornments—sun, moon, and stars—are called its *patterns*; earth’s adornments—mountains, rivers, ridges, and valleys—are called its *principles*. Earth’s principles face upward, heaven’s patterns face downward, and when earth and heaven unite in qi, the myriad things are born. Heaven and earth are husband and wife. The south of heaven is high, the north low; thus the sun is visible when it rises high but vanishes when it sinks low. Heaven’s form resembles an inclined canopy. If the canopy rested on the earth, it could not revolve; only when suspended from a tree can it turn. The sun does not enter the earth—it is like a man carrying a torch at night on level ground: ten *li* away, the light disappears, though it has not been extinguished. The sun is the same. Clouds, mist, rain, and snow all arise from the earth; they do not descend from heaven. In summer, mist forms; in winter, frost; in warmth, rain; in cold, snow.\n\nMen of talent follow the world’s currents, while men of principle guard narrow passes and flee into obscurity. Those who follow the currents grow daily more cunning; those who retreat grow daily more inept. It is not that their talents or wisdom are unequal, but that their habits differ. In Qi Prefecture, every girl learns embroidery; in Xiangyi, every girl masters brocade-weaving—because their eyes see it and their hands grow accustomed to it.\n\nIn the court, those who are young and called capable officials treat the court like farmland, their brushes and documents like plows and hoes, and their paperwork like farming and sericulture. Like the children of a household, they grow up accustomed to its ways, knowing every twist and turn better than any guest. Even a man of Confucius’s or Mozi’s talent could not discern the difference. A man with no money in hand who wishes to buy goods will find no merchant willing to sell to him; a man with no learning in his breast who seeks office is like a man with no money trying to buy goods—it cannot be done. To know the past but not the present is called *submerged on land*; to know the present but not the past is called *blindness*. One may not see how the hooves of a swift steed differ from those of an ordinary horse until it gallops a thousand *li* across level ground. Here is a man whose wisdom is like a spring and whose virtue is like a mountain, yet his strength cannot lift himself—he must rely on others to raise him, but no one does. Exiled to a secluded alley, he has no way to emerge. An empty vessel holds no food, so the hungry pay it no heed; an empty breast holds no learning, so the court does not employ it. The officials of the Orchid Terrace—Ban Gu, Jia Kui, Yang Xiong, and Fu Yi—were renowned for their elegant writings, yet they were of no great use. A man who can expound one classic is a scholar; one who has read widely in past and present is a man of broad learning; one who culls and compiles books and records to present memorials is a man of letters; one who can ponder deeply and compose connected chapters is a great scholar. Men like Liu Xin and his son, Yang Xiong, and Huan Junshan were like King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, all appearing in the same age. Ban Shupi continued *The Records of the Grand Historian* for over a hundred chapters, recording events in meticulous detail, so that readers mistook it for the original work of Sima Qian. Ban Mengjian’s writings surpassed his uncle’s by far more than five hundred *li*.\n\nWhen a tortoise reaches three hundred years, it grows no larger than a coin; when a milfoil reaches seventy years, it sprouts but a single stem. These are numinous creatures, so they grow slowly and live long. The worthy scholars of the world are like the sacred tortoise and divine milfoil. The maple and paulownia grow swiftly, so their bark is thick but not sturdy. The sandalwood and jujube bloom late, yet their wood is strong enough to make axle-pins.\n\nIn swift rapids, the current swirls sand and rolls stones, yet great boulders remain unmoved—because the stones are heavy and the sand light. The great scholars and vulgar officials of the world are like this.\n\nThe heart of High Heaven resides in the breast of the sage, and its reproofs issue from the sage’s mouth. Without sages in the world, how could one know Heaven?\n\nMan dwells between heaven and earth like a flea or louse in clothing, or an ant in its nest.\n\nAt the morning audience, the winds from the four directions are observed: a wind from the south brings drought; from the north, floods; from the east, plague; from the west, war.\n\nWhen the Qin were about to fall, the gates of their capital collapsed. When Huo Guang met with ruin, the thatched wall of his house also collapsed. Why did the wife of Qi Liang cause the city to crumble?\n\nWhen a hunting dog is lost in the mountains, calling its name makes it howl in response. Though man and dog are different species, they respond to each other because the dog recognizes its master.\n\nWhen the east wind arrives, wine overflows. Wine’s flavor is sour, and the east is the direction of wood, whose flavor is also sour—hence the wine overflows.\n\nBefore a general amnesty is granted, the locks of the prison move in response.\n\nWhen silkworms spin their cocoons, the strings of a merchant’s zither break; when the new grain is harvested, the old grain is exhausted. When a child is born, the parents’ qi declines.\n\n---\n\nWhen the \"Disorderly Dragon\" appears, disorder will come to an end. Liu Zizheng and Dong Zhongshu did not fully explain the dragon, but the *Lunheng* completed their discourse—hence the term \"Disorderly Dragon.\"\n\nA fisherman carves wood into the shape of a fish, paints its body with red lacquer, and sets it afloat upon the water. As it rises and moves with the current, fish mistake it for a real one and gather around. If even a clay dragon can summon clouds and rain, why should a wooden fish fail to attract them?\n\nWhen Shaogong Mao was in Lu, he stood alongside Confucius. Confucius’s gate saw three waves of followers filling and emptying it—only Yan Yuan never left, for he recognized Confucius’s sageliness.\n\nThe \"Bending Elm\" grew in the courtyard, pointing at flatterers whenever they appeared. If this were truly so, why would Shun have needed Gaoyao to expound the art of discerning men?\n\nWhen Yao and Tang suffered floods and droughts, were these calamities caused by the governance of these two sages? They were merely the natural workings of heaven’s principle and the celestial reckoning—like a compassionate father managing his household, who cannot ensure all his descendants will be filial.\n\nThe nephew of the elder brother of Langya, Ming, once saw his brother about to be eaten by starving men. The younger brother bound himself, kowtowed, and offered to take his brother’s place. Moved by his righteousness, the starving men spared them both. Later, when the elder brother died, Ming raised his orphan. During a year of famine, he killed his own son to save his brother’s child. Xu Junsheng of Linhuai also starved, yet killed his own son to preserve his brother’s orphan.\n\nMen value magpies and despise parrots because magpies are distant while parrots are near. Painters favor depicting men of high antiquity and avoid portraying scholars of the Qin and Han because they revere the ancient. When Yang Xiong wrote the *Tai Xuan* and *Fa Yan*, Zhang Bosong refused even to glance at them, for he walked shoulder to shoulder with the man—thus he belittled his words. Had Yang Xiong lived in the Zhou, his works would have been stored in golden caskets.\n\nWhen King Wu attacked Zhou, the Grand Duke employed a secret scheme: he fed a child cinnabar to turn his body red and taught him to cry, \"Yin is doomed! Yin is doomed!\" When the people of Yin saw the child’s crimson body, they took him for a celestial spirit, and hearing his cries of doom, believed their kingdom would surely fall. The people of Zhou later concealed this affair.\n\nWhen ancient sage-kings established great virtue, they required ministers of great eloquence to eulogize and record their achievements. A dragon without clouds and rain cannot ascend to the heavens. Ministers of great eloquence are a state’s clouds and rain. Through their writings, men’s conduct is borne and their virtues transmitted—how could this be mere play with brush and ink, an empty display of ornate beauty?\n\nMan’s life is essence and qi. What produces essence and qi is the blood and vessels. When a man dies, his blood and vessels are exhausted, his essence and qi vanish, and his bones and flesh turn to ash and dust—how then could he become a ghost? If it is said the dead have no awareness, the sages feared opening the door to impiety, so they did not declare the dead devoid of knowledge—though in truth, they are without it.\n\nIt is taboo to raise a child born in the fifth month, for it is said such a child brings misfortune to its parents. Yet Tian Wen did no harm to Tian Ying. Sharpening a blade by the well stirs fear of falling in. Moreover, the character for \"punishment\" combines \"knife\" and \"well.\" Sharpening a blade by the well thus evokes the dread of punishment—such is the intent of men.\n\nDo not lie supine like a corpse. Do not pass objects hand to hand, for the exchange will not be secure.\n\nConfucius said: Washing one’s hair on a *zi* day makes one beloved; washing on a *mao* day makes one go gray. Love and hate, black and white—these do not depend on the day of washing. If a mother and child washed their hair on a *zi* day, could men truly love them? If fifteen youths washed their hair on a *mao* day, could they truly be made gray-haired?\n\nWhen Zilu saw Confucius, he observed that the shoulder blade of an ox could yield omens—why resort to turtle shells and milfoil stalks? Confucius replied: \"Milfoil\" (*shi*) means \"venerable,\" and \"turtle\" (*gui*) means \"ancient.\" In matters of doubt, one should consult the venerable and ancient. The turtle and milfoil are not divine—they are used merely for their names. When King Wu attacked Zhou, the first divination yielded great inauspiciousness. The Grand Duke overturned the stalks and trampled the turtle, saying, \"How can dead bones and withered grass know good or ill fortune?\"\n\nThe gates of a merchant’s household should not face south; the gates of a military household should not face north. Yet if a hall is built facing due south, why does no one choose otherwise?\n\nThe sage foresees a thousand years into the past and ten thousand into the future. As Confucius lay dying, he left behind a letter saying: \"A man will come claiming to be the First Emperor of Qin. He will turn my robes upside down and meet his end at Shāqiū.\" Later, the First Emperor of Qin indeed perished at Shāqiū. Confucius also said: \"Dong Zhongshu will disorder my books.\" Later, Zhongshu wrote commentaries on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. He further said: \"The one who will destroy Qin is Hu.\" Hu Hai later overthrew Qin—this was Confucius’s foresight of ten thousand generations. His ability to know the descendants of Yin by blowing pitch-pipes was his foresight of a thousand years.\n\nThe Tang was vast and boundless—none could name its virtue. The Yu was joyous; the Xia, great; the Yin, central; the Zhou, perfect. Where the will is fixed, one overlooks even Mount Tai. He who knows the leak in the roof stands beneath the eaves; he who knows the peace of governance dwells among the common folk; he who knows entanglement and error studies the various masters.\n\nThe *Lunheng* weighs light and heavy, establishes truth and falsehood—not to indulge in mere literary embellishment or ornate novelty, but to enlighten the customs of the age.\n\nWang Chong, styled Zhongren, was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. His writings were forthright and easy to examine, yet their language did not align with common usage. Jade is rare among stones, and rarity makes it precious; dragons are few among fish, and fewness makes them divine. When others found his books cumbersome, Chong replied: \"When words are many, they surpass the few; when wealth is abundant, poverty is all the more wretched. If the world has not a single citation, I have a hundred chapters; if others have not a single character, I have ten thousand words—who then is to be valued?\"\n\nIn the second year of Zhanghe, Chong moved his family to avoid disaster. Over the years, his work gradually fell into neglect. As he neared seventy, his time could have been spent in a suspended carriage, but his hair turned white, his teeth fell out, his peers dwindled, and poverty left him without means. His aspirations unfulfilled, he wrote the *Yangxing* in sixty chapters. In five volumes of *Zheng Lun*, Cui Yuanshi—seeing himself as a trusted minister—guarded his words like a sealed bag to preserve his salary. Those distant from power spoke only to be dismissed as base. Thus, the royal net slackened above, and wise scholars languished below.\n\nWhen a ruler’s governance declines, it is like riding a decrepit carriage. Yet if one seeks a skilled craftsman to mend it—splicing where it breaks, wedging where it loosens—it can be made new again.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nNo ruler fails to wish for a Ni Kua to assist him, yet upon obtaining one, they seldom treasure him.\n\nThe steadfast and unwavering scholar does not bend the Dao to flatter the times, nor feign conduct to seek fame. He scorns the praise of village sycophants, severs ties with cliquish factions, and must be branded on the face with the names \"Lu Zhongni\" or \"Zou Meng Ke\" before he can be found.\n\nMen of epochal talent are often suppressed in their own time, yet none fail to be longed for by later generations. Judging the past to gauge the future—how could this be easy?\n\nOne who schemes for kingship but fails may yet become a hegemon; one who schemes for hegemony but fails—what then remains?\n\nFarming and sericulture are laborious yet yield meager profit; craft and commerce are effortless yet yield great wealth. Thus, the plowman abandons his plow to carve and inlay, and the weaving woman casts aside her shuttle to embroider.\n\nThe inferior emulate the superior—this is called teaching.\n\nDeploying military strategies in an era of peace and stability is like administering medicine to one who is not yet ill.\n\nOf old, there was a man who coveted the reputation of yielding wealth. He ceded his fields to his younger brother, but soon after fell into poverty. Turning back, he used his authority to coerce his brother into lending him grain—this was not right.\n\nTo cast a net that spans the heavens to ensnare the realm’s scholars is to gather those of like kind in swarming flocks, like moths drawn to flame. Calculating men tread warily and follow under duress, factions form below, and the ruler stands isolated above.\n\nA horse untrained in its prime cannot gallop far when needed; a scholar not cultivated in advance cannot be summoned in haste.\n\nThe Duke of She’s fondness for dragons—though seizing a sheep may expose a villain, the noble man does not prize it.\n\nA state that does not trust the Dao, a craftsman who does not trust his measures—ruin awaits them.\n\nA ruler who wields neither reward nor punishment yet desires order in the world is like one who seeks well-groomed hair without comb or brush—it cannot be achieved.\n\nThe masters of esoteric arts say: \"That which flourishes in winter will surely perish in spring.\"\n\nA village saying goes: \"Records of prefectures and commanderies strike like thunderbolts, but when an imperial edict arrives, it is merely hung on the wall.\"\n\nTo cleanse the hearts of the people and purge the frivolities of custom...\n\n*The Hidden Man’s Discourse* in ten scrolls by Wang Fu, styled Jiexin\n\nVirtue and righteousness cannot be augmented month by month, yet wealth and silk are expected to increase daily—this is what I despise.\n\nOne dog barks at a shadow, a hundred dogs bark at the sound. The maladies of the age are indeed thus.\n\nInfants have common ailments, eminent ministers have common calamities, parents have common failings, and rulers have common faults.\n\nAn infant’s ailment is overfeeding; an eminent minister’s calamity is excessive favor; a parent’s failing is indulging a favored child; a ruler’s fault is pampering his ministers.\n\nWithin ten paces, there must be lush grass; in a hamlet of ten households, there must be outstanding scholars.\n\nJade is worked with stone, metal is refined with a crucible, brocade is washed with fish, and cloth is bleached with ash. Things inherently flawed are made fine through refinement.\n\nThe enlightened ruler listens widely; the benighted ruler trusts blindly.\n\nOf the great tasks facing one who sits upon the throne, none is more urgent than knowing the worthy.\n\nThe surest path to knowing the worthy is through examining their merits.\n\nA proverb says: \"Crooked wood hates the straight plumb line; heavy punishments hate enlightened governance.\"\n\nTo know when a man is about to fall ill, observe that he loses his appetite; to know when a state is about to perish, observe that it loses its taste for the worthy.\n\nIllness is not the absence of fine food, but the inability to eat—leading to death. A state is not devoid of worthy men, but the ruler’s inability to employ them—hastening its ruin.\n\nGoverning the world without true worthies is like treating an illness without true medicine.\n\nTo treat an illness, one should obtain true ginseng, but if one obtains radish instead and consumes it, the condition worsens—this is not the fault of the medicine.\n\nIn former times, when a general amnesty was desired, horses were first sent to patrol the markets and streets, listening at crossroads. When all proclaimed that an amnesty was imminent, it was called a \"heavenly amnesty,\" and thus it was carried out.\n\nEmperor Xiaoming once asked: \"Why have there been no memorials submitted today?\" His attendants replied: \"Because it is a *fanzhi* day.\" The emperor said: \"The common folk travel far to reach the palace gates; their day cannot be taken from them. Let those submitting memorials not avoid the *fanzhi* day.\" This was an enlightened ruler, who cherished the people’s time.\n\nThe governance of a sagely king is universally encompassing and impartial in love, neither favoring the near and intimate nor neglecting the distant and estranged. In fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing, he shares alike with the people.\n\nTo push aside a curtain to block the wind, or to scoop sand to dam a river—these are of no benefit to the matter and only exhaust oneself.\n\nIt is like failing to command a great general to sweep away the vile enemies, while instead, prefectures and counties ceaselessly raise troops.\n\nThe physician Bian Que treated illnesses by carefully examining blockages and obstructions, then unblocking stagnation—where there was deficiency, he supplemented; where there was excess, he purged. Just as the frontier’s flocks of sheep and dogs cannot be left untended for long, lest they embolden the enemy’s ambitions.\n\nWithin a single residence, when members of the same clan succeed one another, some meet with fortune, others with misfortune. When the same clan holds the same office in succession, some are promoted, others dismissed. The reigns of Cheng and Kang brought prosperity, while those of You and Li brought decline. Thus, fortune and misfortune, prosperity and decay, lie with the people—not with the dwelling.\n\nMaster Kuang said: “Those with ruddy complexions do not live long; great clans are easily extinguished.” Some surnames derive from office, titles, residences, or places. Sima, Situ, Zhonghang, and Xiajun originate from office. Shumen, Xidu, Nangong, and Beiguo stem from residences. Sanwu, Wulu, Qingniu, and Baima arise from places.\n\nJi Sheng and Zaofu, renowned for their charioteering, served King Mu of Zhou. When the king wandered to the Western Sea and forgot to return, Xu Yan rebelled. Zaofu, the royal charioteer, drove a thousand *li* a day to suppress the revolt. The king enfeoffed Zaofu at Zhao, whence the clan took its name. Brothers may drift apart over generations, while friends remain close—such is human nature. The wealthy and noble attract eager followers, while the poor and lowly are abandoned. Those who befriend the rich and powerful gain commendation from above and material benefit from below. Those who associate with the poor and lowly face great expenses in relief and loans, or lesser losses from lending.\n\nWhen an official of ill repute arrives in a four-horse carriage, scholars deem it an honor—how much more so if he is truly worthy? When a maiden of Yan and Min’s virtue appears in coarse hempen robes, her disciples consider it a disgrace—how much worse if she brings actual harm? Thus, the wealthy and noble find acceptance with ease, while the poor and lowly struggle to fit in. Fine garments are called extravagant and usurping; plain clothes, destitute and wretched. A slow pace is deemed starvation and deformity; a swift one, flight from debt. Not waiting to be summoned is called arrogance; frequent visits, begging for food. Arriving empty-handed is seen as indifference; bringing gifts, a plea for loans. Humility is taken for incompetence; forthrightness, for lack of virtue. Such are the bitter hardships of the poor and lowly.\n\nNowadays, people speak of squares as circles and claim uprightness while harboring deceit. When a ruler governs the world, he must first address the root before the branches, guard his heart, and cultivate his conduct—then treachery and villainy will not arise.\n\nThe ancient teachings record the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, most commonly naming Fuxi and Shennong as two of the Sovereigns, while the third is sometimes said to be Suiren or Nüwa. I have also heard of the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign in antiquity, though their truth remains uncertain.\n\n*—End of Scroll Three of *Yi Lin*—*\n\n#1 \"Extinct\" was originally missing; supplemented from the *Wenyuan Ge* edition.\n#2 \"Said\" was originally written as \"state\"; emended from the *Wenyuan Ge* edition.\n#3 \"Master\" was originally missing; supplemented from the *Wenyuan Ge* edition.\n#4 \"Langye’s elder nephew Ziming\" in the *Wenyuan Ge* edition reads \"Langye’s nephew Ziming.\"\n\n*—Scroll Four of *Yi Lin*—*\nCompiled by Ma Zong of Fufeng during the Yuanhui era\n\n*Fengsu Tong* in thirty-one scrolls by Ying Shao\n\nThe preface states: \"Feng\" refers to the qi of Heaven, which brings cold and warmth; the forms of Earth, which vary in peril and ease; the waters and springs, which differ in purity and foulness; and the grasses and trees, which range from hard to soft. \"Su\" refers to the blood-bearing kinds, born in imitation of these patterns. Within a hundred *li*, the winds differ; within a thousand *li*, the customs diverge.\n\nDuring the Zhou and Qin dynasties, envoys were dispatched in the eighth month in light carriages to gather the finest words of distant ages, storing them in the imperial archives. By the fall of the Ying house, these were nearly all lost or discarded. The Shu scholar Yan Junping left over a thousand words, while Lin Weng Ruicai’s *Gengzhu* and Yang Xiong’s commentary note: \"Continuing for twenty-seven years, totaling nine thousand characters.\"\n\nZhang Lian remarked: \"A work to hang alongside the sun and moon, an indelible book.\" Though I am unworthy, I dare to compare myself in esteem to such men.\n\nThe Divine Farmer is \"divine trust.\" \"Farmer\" means \"abundant\"—his virtue is as rich and profound as the divine. The Five Emperors are the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Yao, and Shun. \"Yellow\" signifies radiance; \"Zhuan\" means \"focused\"; \"Xu\" denotes \"trust\"; \"Ku\" implies \"examination\"; \"Yao\" stands for \"loftiness\"; \"Shun\" suggests \"advancement\" and \"cultivation,\" meaning he advanced virtue and carried forward Yao’s legacy.\n\nThe Three Kings, named by ritual, are Yu of the Xia under the cloud-wrapped sky, Tang of Yin, and King Wu of Zhou. \"Yu\" means \"assistance\"; \"Tang\" signifies \"prosperity\"; \"King\" denotes \"going forth,\" meaning all under heaven turn toward him. The Five Hegemons, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, are Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. \"Hegemon\" means \"bright\" and \"chief,\" indicating they all established themselves as leaders, their merits and achievements made manifest. \"Hegemon\" also means \"to grasp,\" signifying their grasp of the governance of all under heaven.\n\nAccording to the *Records of Qin*: When Queen Dowager Xuan of King Zhao first held court, regional governors and prefects should not be frequently replaced. According to the *Book of Documents*, there is the practice of evaluating merits.\n\nConfucius said: \"If one were to employ me, in a year’s time there would be results, and in three years, success would be complete.\" When Zichan of Zheng governed for three years, the people composed songs in his praise. Even the worthy and sagacious must proceed gradually—how much more so for those of middling talent? Frequent replacements only lead to confusion and missteps on the path.\n\nIn ancient times, there were originally no slaves or bondservants. Slaves and bondservants were all those who had committed offenses. \"Slave\" (*nu*) means \"inferior,\" while \"bondservant\" (*bi*) means \"base and lowly.\"\n\nA local saying goes: \"To take office is a boundless expanse—half of those who resent it die.\" Even in an era of clarity and peace, when enlightened and compassionate gentlemen adjudicated cases with pity and restraint, there were still resentful words—how much more so in the present age? Ying Shao was a man of the Three Kingdoms period; this was a saying of his time.\n\nWhen Emperor Guangwu of Han moved his capital to Luoyang, he transported plain bamboo slips and paper, with a total of two thousand cartloads of classics. When Dong Zhuo overturned the royal house and the Son of Heaven was forced west, in the haste and chaos, seventy carts of books were carried along the road. Caught in the rain, half were discarded, and Dong Zhuo later burned the Bright Hall and its pavilions, reducing all the classics to ashes. What little remained was sometimes used to make sacks and curtains. The Dao of the former kings nearly vanished entirely.\n\nPopular belief holds that those granted gold as a reward received yellow gold. According to *Sunzi’s Art of War*, \"daily expenses amount to a thousand gold.\" A thousand gold means a million coins. When Chen Ping advised the Chu, he sent a thousand gold to the two Shu brothers. Fifty *jin* of gold—all of it yellow gold. Some say \"one gold\" refers to ten thousand coins.\n\nIt is said that one should not raise three children born at the same time. The common belief is that it resembles the breeding of livestock and harms the parents. Yet according to the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the *Discourses of the States*, in the time of the King of Yue, the people were given surplus grain if they bore two children, and a wet nurse if they bore three. Thus Yue destroyed the mighty Wu—what harm was there in it?\n\nOne should not raise a child born in the same month as one’s father. The common belief is that it harms the father. Yet according to the *Zuozhuan*, Duke Huan of Lu had a son born in the same month as himself, and so named the child \"Born Together.\"\n\nEmperor Ming of Han was also born in the same month as Emperor Guangwu. It is improper to return a bride to her natal home after marriage. The common belief is that it brings misfortune. The reason is that a woman’s beauty might lead her to exchange her daughter for another man’s son, so such returns are forbidden.\n\nAs for the sealing of Mount Tai, popular belief holds that atop the Sacred Peak lies a golden basket and jade tally, which can reveal a person’s lifespan. Emperor Wu of Han retrieved one that read \"eighteen,\" but upon reading it backward, declared it \"eighty.\" In truth, when the Sacred Peak was sealed, a stone stele twelve feet high was erected, inscribed with the words: \"Serve Heaven with ritual, establish oneself with righteousness, serve one’s father with filial piety, and achieve renown with benevolence. Within the four seas, none do not take him as their teacher and submit.\" The stele was carved to record his reign title and make his achievements known.\n\nAt that time, Emperor Wu was already thirty-seven years old—how could he then obtain \"eighteen\"? If one claims it was read backward, the divine would be without blessing.\n\nI have humbly served at the Eastern Peak for six years, frequently performing prayers and sacrifices. Inquiring of the elders and those who have ascended Mount Tai, none have spoken of a golden basket or jade tally for divining lifespan.\n\nDongfang Shuo was said to be the essence of Venus, serving as Feng Hou in the time of the Yellow Emperor, as Wu Chengzi in the time of Yao, and later being reborn in Yue as Fan Li, then in Qi as Zhe Yi Zi—such tales speak of his ceaseless transformations. Yet, Shuo was merely a master of wit and humor; common folk ascribed strange words to him, but how could he be a deity?\n\nWhen the Governor of Pengcheng, Biao, came of age, his father, Bo Chu, was serving as Guanglu Qing. During the mourning period, Bo Chu fathered a child and, deeming it the greatest filial failing to leave no heir, raised the boy himself. A gentleman does not conceal his faults, so he named the child *Fu* (\"Mourning Garment\").\n\nNow, Biao’s courtesy name was *Yuanshu* (\"First Garment\"). His mother was from Runan, and his grandfather, named Jing, served as Palace Attendant. During Emperor An’s reign, Biao was born, and the hundred officials came to congratulate the elderly grandfather on the birth of his grandson. Delighted by this auspicious occasion, they named the child *He* (\"Congratulation\") and gave him the courtesy name *Yuanshu*. His father, Bo Chu, governed three commanderies and, after his wife’s early death, refused to remarry. On his deathbed, he instructed his son: \"Simply bury me here; do not retrieve your mother’s coffin. If the dead have awareness, coming and going will not be difficult; if they have none, it would only be a burden.\" Such was his lofty integrity—how could he have fathered a child during mourning and named him *He*?\n\nWang Shu of Runan and his son Fang once set out on a journey and did not return for over twenty years. Shu served as a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat. When someone reported that his son Fang had died in Runan, Shu immediately dispatched his elder brother, Bo San, to retrieve the coffin. He then donned mourning garments and issued an edict, sending twenty thousand coins in condolence. Later, Fang returned from Cangwu, and Shu petitioned the court to return the condolence money, accepting the charge of falsehood.\n\nEmperor Ling summoned the ministers and grandees to deliberate the matter. The Academician Ren Min argued: \"The average lifespan is seventy years; when a father sees his son as his peer, the son’s death may warrant mourning. But Fang was far away, and the report of his death could not be verified—no punishment should be imposed.\"\n\nThe imperial edict returned the money and restored Shu to his original office.\n\nIn Runan, Zhang Miao attended a gathering at Du Shi’s home. During the feast, in jest, Zhang Miao bound Du Shi and struck him twenty times, then suspended him by his toes until Du Shi died. Bao Yu ruled on the case, stating: \"They were jesting while drunk; his original intent held no malice. He should be absolved of the death penalty.\"\n\nIn Runan, Zhou Wengzhong’s wife gave birth to a daughter, while the wife of a butcher bore a son. Wengzhong’s wife secretly exchanged money to take the butcher’s son as her own. Later, Wengzhong became the governor of Beihai. He sent his clerk, Zhou Guang, to accompany the boy in offering sacrifices at the ancestral tomb. Upon returning, the clerk said to Wengzhong: \"At the sacrificial site, I saw only the butcher’s son, dressed in tattered clothes, wielding a knife to carve the meat. Another figure, wearing a green sash, stood in the eastern chamber, hesitant and unwilling to approach. Why was this?\" Wengzhong drew his sword and questioned his wife, who confessed the truth. Wengzhong declared: \"Those who have sons do so to continue their ancestors’ line. If the ancestors refuse to accept the offering, what use is it?\" He then sent the boy back to the butcher’s family by carriage and horse, and retrieved his daughter. The daughter had already been married to a pastry seller, but he brought her home and betrothed her to Li Wensi of Anping. Wensi later rose to the position of governor of Nanyang. The spirits do not partake of offerings from those not of their kind—how could one raise another’s child?\n\nIn Chenliu, a wealthy elder of ninety had no sons. He married a peasant girl, but died after a single night. Later, she bore a son. When the child grew older, the elder’s eldest daughter said: \"Our father married her and died after one night—this child is not his.\" They contested the inheritance for years without resolution. The Chancellor, You Ji, ruled: \"An old man’s child casts no shadow and cannot endure the cold.\" It was the eighth month, so he gathered children of the same age and had them all undress for testing. The elder’s child alone cried from the cold, and at midday, indeed cast no shadow. The inheritance was thus awarded to the daughter.\n\nIn Yingchuan, two brothers lived together, and both their wives were pregnant. The elder wife’s fetus was injured in the third month, but she did not speak of it. When the time came for the younger wife to give birth, both women lay in the birthing chamber. The younger wife bore a son, but the elder wife stole him in the night. They disputed the matter for three years without resolution. The Chancellor, Huang Ba, ordered the child placed ten paces from each mother and commanded them to retrieve him. The elder wife clutched the child tightly, and he wailed loudly. The younger wife, fearing harm, released him, while the elder wife’s face lit with joy. The younger wife wept in sorrow. Huang Ba declared: \"This is the younger wife’s son.\" He then indicted the elder wife, who confessed her guilt.\n\nIn Linhuai, a man took a bolt of silk to the market to sell it. Caught in the rain, he draped it over himself. Another man sought shelter beneath it, claiming space for his head. When the rain ceased, they quarreled over the silk. The Chancellor, Xue Xuan, intervened: \"The silk is worth only a few hundred coins—why this dispute?\" He cut it in half and gave each a portion. Upon closer inspection, the silk’s owner cried out in injustice, while the other man showed satisfaction. Xue Xuan discerned the truth and, upon interrogation, forced a confession.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou’s music was called *Shao*, meaning \"to pour and deliberate the Way of the ancestors.\" King Wu’s music was called *Wu*, signifying the pacification of the realm. Shun’s music was called *Shao*, meaning \"to continue,\" as he continued Yao’s legacy. Yao’s music was called *Dazhang*, meaning \"to manifest.\" Emperor Yu’s music was called *Wuying*, meaning \"flourishing.\" Liu Xiang said: \"The *shang* note represents completion, for things reach fulfillment and can be measured. The *jiao* note represents sprouting, for things break through the earth with sharp points. The *gong* note represents the center; the *zhi* note represents prosperity, for things flourish and abound. The *yu* note represents shelter, for things gather and are covered.\"\n\nHearing the *gong* note makes one warm and expansive; hearing the *shang* note makes one upright and fond of righteousness; hearing the *jiao* note makes one orderly and fond of ritual; hearing the *zhi* note makes one compassionate and broadly loving; hearing the *yu* note makes one nurturing and fond of learning.\n\nThe pipa was created by musicians of recent generations, though its maker is unknown. Its name derives from the motion of the hands (*pi* and *pa*). It is three feet and five inches long, corresponding to Heaven, Earth, Man, and the Five Phases. Its four strings represent the four seasons.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"It is beneficial to see the great person.\" The great person and the sage share the same meaning.\n\nThe *Analects* states: \"The noble person ascends.\" Zang Sunhe said: \"The next one to ascend will surely be Kong Qiu.\" The term *ru* (Confucian) means \"to distinguish,\" separating the worthy from the foolish across past and present. The Zhang family of the time called Jia Kui a \"comprehensive Confucian,\" and people would say: \"Ask Jia Longtou about anything, and he will never tire.\"\n\nThe *Rites* state: \"When five people live in a thatched hut, the eldest must have a separate mat.\" Today, calling the powerful \"elders\" is incorrect.\n\nGuanzi said: \"The teacher imparts instruction, and the disciple follows—this is not knowledge of the ancient Way, but the title of the teacher.\" The term *disciples* refers to many students. Thus it is said: \"Among the teachers, one must be sober; among the students, all are drunk. When all are drunk, only the sober one presides over the libation.\" The *Rites* state: \"When drinking wine, one must offer a libation to honor one’s ancestors.\" When Xun Qing was in Qi, he was the most senior teacher, hence he was thrice called the \"libation officer.\" The *Book of Songs* states: \"The men of Yin are keen and swift; the eminent scholars are outstanding; the refined scholars are broadly learned; the ranked scholars have unchanging duties; the reclusive scholars speak freely.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"In leading the army, steadfastness in the elder brings good fortune.\" This does not merely honor age, but requires virtue and conduct surpassing others. The *Commentary* states: \"To rely on virtue, nothing is better than trustworthiness—such virtue can be trusted and relied upon.\"\n\nThe *Rites* state: \"Ten feet is called a *zhang*, the height of a grown man.\" The term *fu* (husband) means \"skin,\" signifying that his wisdom is keen and his teaching expansive. Thus, he is called a *zhangfu* (husband).\n\nThe *Analects* states: \"The common man and common woman.\" The *Commentary* states: \"One day and one night make a day; one man and one woman make a household.\" According to the ancients, two bolts of cloth were used to make clothes for a man and woman. Today, people wear single-layer garments, hence the term *pi* (bolt).\n\nWhen a man undergoes the dragon transformation and rises, he does not strike at his village. If he merely conforms to customs and, upon seeing goodness, does not emulate it, he is called a \"common person.\"\n\nThe *Rites* states: \"To dismiss the unworthy.\" According to the annotation: If a child is coarse and unrefined, bearing no resemblance to his parents, he is called *buxiao* (unworthy). Today, people also use *buxiao* as a humble term.\n\nFang states: One who neglects affairs and behaves dissolutely is called *wulai* (shiftless). It means one cannot be relied upon. This is akin to the High Ancestor’s words to the Supreme Emperor: \"Father, I am shiftless.\"\n\nThe Minister of Education, Zhongshan Zhu Tian, styled Boren, was summoned by imperial carriage. En route, he contracted a fever. Passing by his friend Xie Zhuo’s home, Zhuo refused him entry. When he reached Ji Commandery, he lodged at an inn. After six or seven days, his disciples saw his condition worsening and wished to inform the magistrate of Ji. Tian said: \"Even a friend would not take me in—why trouble the magistrate, who does not know me? What good would it do? Life and death are fated; no medicine is needed.\" The disciples secretly informed the magistrate of Ji, who was none other than Ying Rong of Runan. Upon hearing this, Rong was greatly alarmed. He rushed to Tian’s sickbed and wept, saying: \"Boren is a once-in-an-era talent, destined to be the state’s pillar and support. How could he silently perish in an inn without sending word?\" Rong then personally drove him home and attended to his illness himself. Gradually, Tian’s condition improved. Rong said to Boren:\n\nThe inauspicious and the auspicious were spoken without taboo; sorrow and fear intertwined in the heart. Funeral preparations were already made, yet joy and grief faced one another. Boren remained in the post station for several tens of days before departing. He was appointed Palace Attendant and President of the Imperial Secretariat, then promoted to Inspector of the Capital Region. He recommended Ying Rong to succeed him, and Rong subsequently governed five commanderies. Xie Zhuo was not deemed worthy of recruitment by the imperial court.\n\nIn high antiquity, people dwelt among the grasses and lodged beneath the frost. In winter, they resided on the southern slopes of mountains; in summer, on the northern slopes.\n\nThe Filial and Incorrupt Candidate from Pengcheng, Zhang Zijiao, argued: \"If rulers and ministers could not share the same given names, then King Mu of Zhou, whose name was Man, would not have had a descendant named Sun Man in the time of King Ding.\"\n\nKing Li’s name was Hu, and King Zhuang’s son was also named Hu.\n\nA common saying goes: \"Those who take office in the fifth month will be dismissed without promotion.\" This year, a candidate of exceptional talent was appointed magistrate of Xiao. He took office in the fifth month, and on an inauspicious day, he entered his residence. After five months in office, he was recommended by the Four Ministries and promoted to magistrate of Wuling. When I served as magistrate of Yingling, I directly opposed the Grand Year Star. My chief clerk urged me to proceed northeast, but I refused. After five months in office, I was promoted to governor of Taishan.\n\nThe *Chu Ci* states: \"The Wind Earl is Feilian.\" According to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Wind Master is the star *Ji* (Winnowing Basket), which governs winnowing and can summon the winds. The spirit of the *wuxu* day governs the Wind Earl, hence on the *bingxu* day, sacrifices are made in the northwest.\n\nAccording to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Rain Master is the star *Bi* (Net). Among the masses of the central land, none surpass water, hence rain is called a \"master.\" The spirit of the *chou* day governs the Rain Master, hence on the *jichou* day, sacrifices are made to it.\n\nDuring the *Yuankang* era of Emperor Huan, the women of the capital fashioned \"sorrowful brows,\" \"weeping grains,\" \"falling-horse chignons,\" \"broken-waist gaits,\" and \"rotten-tooth smiles.\" \"Sorrowful brows\" were thin and sharply angled; \"weeping grains\" involved lightly wiping beneath the eyes to resemble tear stains; \"falling-horse chignons\" were tilted to one side; \"broken-waist gaits\" made the feet appear detached from the body; and \"rotten-tooth smiles\" mimicked the grimace of a toothache. These fashions all originated with Liang Ji.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: \"When the King of Zhao favored broad eyebrows, the people all drew them halfway up their foreheads. When the King of Chu favored wide collars, the people of his state all bared their necks. When the King of Qi favored slender waists, there were those in his harem who starved to death.\" In the capital, there were Hu-style robes, Hu-style tents, Hu-style forests, Hu-style harps, Hu-style flutes, and Hu-style dances. This was due to the influx of troops during Dong Zhuo’s time.\n\nEmperor Ling roamed the Western Park, driving a chariot pulled by four white camels and personally holding the reins. The court officials imitated him, and the price of camels rose to equal that of horses.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Huan, a popular rhyme went: \"Straight as a bowstring, dead by the roadside; crooked as a hook, enfeoffed as a lord.\" Liang Ji wished to enthrone a young ruler, while Li Gu sought to establish the Prince of Qinghe. Liang Ji then memorialized the throne, and Li Gu died in prison, his corpse exposed by the roadside. Liang Ji was \"crooked as a hook,\" and Li Gu \"straight as a bowstring.\"\n\nThe song went: \"The thousand-league grass, how lush and green! In the tenth month, the divination yields not a single day of life.\" This referred to Dong Zhuo. \"Lush and green\" described his violent and flourishing power.\n\nSince the Qin and Han dynasties, the exalted have named their palaces and halls, whereas previously, the noble and base made no such distinctions.\n\nAccording to the *Genealogical Origins*, Xian invented city walls. *Cheng* (city) means \"to contain,\" and *guo* (outer wall) means \"great.\"\n\nAccording to the rites, the Son of Heaven has an outer screen to make his ministers hold their breath in reverence.\n\n*Sousou* means \"accumulated.\" It refers to the gathering of firewood and kindling.\n\nSunzi said: \"A city with walls of metal and moats of boiling water, yet lacking grain, cannot be defended even by Taigong or Mo Di.\" *Jun* (commandery) means \"extensive.\" The *Zuozhuan* states: \"Senior ministers receive counties, while junior ministers receive commanderies.\" Only under the First Emperor of Qin were commanderies established to oversee counties. *Xian* (county) means \"level.\"\n\nA *post station* is where envoys, having transmitted their messages, are permitted to lodge.\n\nNorth-south roads are called *qian*; east-west roads are called *mo*.\n\nAccording to the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, in high antiquity there was a man named Yang You who was skilled at bringing misfortune upon others. Hence, when people inquire after one another in ordinary times, they ask, \"Are you well?\"\n\nWhen a city gate catches fire, disaster befalls the fish in the moat. The common explanation is that the moat and the fish are the names of a man who lived near the city gate. In truth, when a city gate burns, water is drawn from the moat, and thus the fish all die.\n\nPrisons originated with the Three Kings. After the establishment of corporal punishments, prisons were created. In the Xia dynasty, they were called *xiatai*; in the Zhou, *tuyu*. They serve to make people reflect and reform their evil ways. The character for \"prison\" (*yu*) consists of two dogs guarding it, implying that even dogs would imprison those without human sentiment. Criminals are placed in round enclosures, hence the character for \"prisoner\" (*qiu*) is a person within a mouth. The character for \"crime\" (*zui*) originally consisted of \"self\" (*zi*) and \"bitterness\" (*xin*), signifying suffering and sorrow. The First Emperor of Qin believed the character *gao* (a component of *zui*) resembled *huang* (emperor), so he altered it to *zui*.\n\nIn Kuaiji, there were many licentious sacrifices. Poor families unable to sacrifice an ox would, after death, transform into bellowing oxen. The governor, Diwu Lun, enforced strict prohibitions to eradicate this practice.\n\nWhen Li Shujian of Guiyang was young and served as an attendant in the provincial administration, a dog in his household stood on its hind legs. Shujian said: \"This dog is mimicking a human—what harm is there in a person’s conduct?\" Later, when Shujian was a county magistrate and removed his cap to rest on his couch, the dog took it and ran off. Shujian said: \"This dog has mistakenly caught its collar on its ears.\" The dog then gathered fire in front of a turtle-shaped censer, and the neighbors reported it. Shujian said: \"If a dog can gather fire, it is fortunate that no humans are needed.\" The dog soon died violently, and Shujian rose to high office.\n\n*The Book of Lord Shang* in four scrolls:\nThose with conduct surpassing others are condemned by the world; those with unique insight are resented by the people. The mole cricket and the locust are born in spring and die in autumn, yet a single emergence causes the people to suffer food shortages for years. Now, if one person farms while a hundred consume, it is worse than the mole cricket and the locust.\n\nWhen those who wander and consume outnumber the farmers, agriculture languishes, and when agriculture languishes, governance decays. The weak who remove the strong become strong; the strong who remove the weak become weak.\n\nThe scholars of antiquity wore clothes that did not warm their skin and ate food that did not fill their bellies. They tormented their minds and labored their limbs.\n\nIn ancient times, the people thrived in the wilds, and chaos led to the establishment of rulers.\n\nWhen woodworms multiply, the wood breaks; when cracks widen, the wall collapses. To perish without defeat or survive without victory—from antiquity to the present, such a thing has never existed.\n\n---\n\nWhen soldiers view battle as starving wolves view meat, they may be put to use.\n\nThe sage governs the people as high and low govern water, as dry and damp govern fire.\n\n*Ruanzi, Four Scrolls*\nThe fisherman casts his net in the deep to catch the whale-swallowing fish;\nThe enlightened ruler enacts law throughout the land to restrain the violent and overbearing.\n\nEstablishing laws is to dam the people—then the common folk cannot breach them;\nErecting barriers is to dam the waters—then the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers cannot overrun them.\nIf barriers can be overrun, the rivers become disasters;\nIf laws can be breached, the common folk become harms.\n\nThose who do not plant trees die without coffins;\nThose who do not raise silkworms have no silk for their bodies;\nThose who do not spin meet misfortune without hempen cloth.\nThe nobleman, at leisure, ponders righteousness;\nThe petty man, at leisure, schemes wickedness.\n\nHigh birds gather on towering trees;\nThe wise choose their ground and soar.\n\nIf even one thief is left unpursued, harm spreads to burglars and robbers;\nIf flatterers are left unpunished, harm reaches those who sway the ruler.\n\n*Zhengbu, Scroll Ten*\nAll people begin in ignorance and darkness.\nThrough study, they awaken their aspirations;\nThrough conduct, they order their lives.\nAdvancing in the Dao, they become noblemen;\nDeviating from ritual, they are called petty men.\nThe nobleman’s every act treads the path of virtue and radiates glory;\nThe petty man’s every move plunges into evil and invites punishment.\n\nBright and pure,\nWith indigo, it becomes blue;\nWith cinnabar, it becomes red;\nWith the bark of the cork tree, it becomes yellow;\nWith black dye, it becomes black.\n\nUncarved jade remains but a round stone from Nanshan.\n\nThieves who break through windows do not shrink from severing waists and necks;\nSoldiers who flee battle do not fear axes and blades.\n\nThe Han realm spans the ends of the earth, exhausts the limits of the land:\nTo the left, the Tang Valley;\nTo the right, the Yu Abyss;\nBefore, the scorching lands of Chu;\nBehind, the frontier gates.\nNorth of Qilian, south of Yellow Mountain,\nEast of Jieshi, west of Heli—\nNone fail to bear tribute and submit.\n\nConfucius and Shu Guang:\nAbove, they spoke the discourse of heaven;\nBelow, the language of the people.\nThey encompassed both men and women,\nProbing the outer and inner.\n\n*The Huainanzi* is frivolous and overly expansive;\n*The Great Mystery* is abstruse and yields little effect;\n*The Model Sayings* is jumbled and lacks a guiding principle;\n*The New Book* is verbose and of scant use.\n\nThe Jade Token states:\nRed as a parrot’s crest,\nYellow as steamed chestnut,\nWhite as fat,\nBlack as pure lacquer—\nSuch are the signs of jade.\nRefined speech and elegant instruction,\nWords that become classics and counsels—\nThese are the signs of a person.\n\nMountain spirits are called *li*;\nThe essence of creatures is called *mei*;\nThe essence of earth is called *jiyang*;\nThe essence of water is called *wangshe*;\nThe essence of wood is called *bifang*;\nThe essence of fire is called *youguang*;\nThe essence of metal is called *qingming*.\nWhen the world follows the Dao, all such essences withdraw and hide.\n\nHeaven calls the immortal *Child*;\nThe masses, *straw dogs*.\nIt cherishes its Child, favoring long life;\nIt scorns straw dogs, leaving them to early death.\nWithout study, it is as though one tries to see without eyes,\nTo run without legs,\nTo fly without wings,\nTo speak without a mouth—\nIt cannot be done.\n\nJie and Zhou, though they held the throne of the Son of Heaven, had not a single man’s praise.\nThey were like rotten stumps and withered trees—when the wind came, they toppled.\n\nEnforce punishments with clarity, administer laws with care,\nShow compassion for the people, bestow kindness upon those below.\nThen the living will bear no grudge,\nAnd the dead will hold no resentment.\nAs the saying goes:\n“Governance like frost and ice—\nDeceit and excess vanish.\nAuthority like thunder and lightning—\nBandits and thieves do not arise.”\n\n*Shiwei, Scroll Ten* by Yao Xin\nKong Wenju’s metal nature was too strong, his wood nature insufficient.\nTurning from shade toward sunlight, he stood alone and mourned his solitude.\n\nSilk all comes from silkworms;\nBronze equally from stone.\nWoven into plain cloth, it is cheap;\nWoven into brocade, it is precious.\nCast as a bell, it is small;\nCast as a bell, it is large.\n\nThe *Classic* is like water flowing beneath a carriage;\nThe *Calendar* is like sand clinging to a wheel.\nThe tracks of feet, high and low, cannot be reckoned.\nWater, when warm, becomes hot liquid;\nWhen cold, it becomes ice.\nThough ice and hot liquid differ in *qi*, the nature of water remains the same.\nSilkworms can spin thread, but without boiling water, it does not become silk.\nHuman nature shifts and changes—\nThis is the comparison.\n\nWhen zithers and lutes are strung, the music of Zheng and Wei arises;\nWhen the five colors are combined, embroidered silks are born.\n\nMengzi drove worldly affairs into the realm of benevolence and righteousness;\nThose who followed walked the path of uprightness.\nIf the South Seas had no pearl-gatherers,\nIf Kunlun had no jade-cutters,\nThen bright pearls would not adorn the pepper chambers,\nAnd fine jade would not hang in the cassia palaces.\n\n*Tongyu, Scroll Eight*\nThe wheel’s track is the carriage’s path;\nThe oar is the boat’s wing.\nThe body’s need for the Dao is like these two things.\nThose who slander others clamor in unison like thunder;\nThose who praise them spread like wildfire and stir waves.\nSomeone asked: Was Chen Fan loyal?\nThe reply: Riding alone to wield the axe against rebels,\nAscending the steps straight and unyielding—\nThis was no resource for a disordered age.\nTo know his loyalty is not as good as knowing his wisdom.\nTalent values precision;\nLearning values discourse.\nSubstance over form—like Shi Jian;\nForm over substance—like Cai Yong.\nWhen form and substance are in perfect balance,\nXu Gan comes close.\n\n*The Master Embracing Simplicity*, Forty Scrolls\nOuter Chapters, Twenty Scrolls;\nInner Chapters, Twenty Scrolls.\nBy Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan.\n\nFine wine and fragrant liqueurs confuse the nature;\nRed blossoms and plain silk cut short the lifespan.\n\nBan Di could not carve stone into a needle’s point;\nOu Leng could not cast lead and tin into a *Ganjiang* sword.\n\nThe *Han Court Daily Records* state:\nLi Shaojun wished to depart.\nEmperor Wu dreamed of ascending Songgao Mountain with him.\nHalfway, a messenger riding a dragon arrived from the clouds, bearing a tally, and said:\n“The Great One summons Shaojun.”\nThe Emperor said: “Shaojun will leave me.”\nA few days later, Shaojun died.\nAfter some time, his coffin was opened—\nOnly his clothes and cap remained.\n\nTo discard a flaw the size of an ant’s nose\nAnd lose a priceless piece of pure jade;\nTo cast aside a speck of imperfection the width of a hook\nAnd abandon a foot-long night-shining pearl—\nThis is why Zhuangzi grieved,\nWhy Xue Zhuo sighed endlessly—\nLike those who do not study immortality.\n\nThe Daoist arts enable one to change form and alter appearance,\nTo swallow swords and spit fire,\nTo sit and vanish, to stand and disappear,\nTo summon clouds and raise mists,\nTo call forth snakes and insects,\nTo gather fish and turtles,\nTo enter the depths without drowning,\nTo tread blades without injury.\n\nThe *Records of Strange Tales* by Chen Zhonggong states: A man of the same commandery, Zhang Guang, met with chaos and abandoned his four-year-old daughter, who could not walk, in a tomb, leaving her with several months’ worth of provisions. Three years later, he returned to retrieve her for burial, yet the girl still sat in the tomb. When asked why, she said: “After the food ran out, I saw something at the corner of the tomb stretching its neck to swallow qi, so I imitated it and was no longer hungry.” Upon closer inspection, it was a large tortoise. When the girl was brought home and fed, her stomach ached at first, but in time she grew accustomed to it.\n\nThe spider taught by the Tang Master weaves its web; Jintian relied on the Nine Crows to set the seasons; Tang Yao observed the mojia plant to know the months.\n\nThe Dao enables one to ascend the void, tread upon shadows, and drink jade nectar, to feast on azure mushrooms.\n\nPeng Zu said: “In heaven there are many exalted offices; newly ascended immortals hold lowly ranks and serve in many capacities. Like a farmer who obtains a vermilion bow only to scare crows, or a man of Nancheng who receives a tattered robe only to gather firewood—so too do worldly men obtain the elixir of immortality yet fail to value it.”\n\nYuanjun was the teacher of Lord Lao.\n\nWorldly people vie only for fleeting glory, chasing after the gray hawk and the yellow hare, clinging to honor and pursuing profit.\n\nThe superior adept who attains the Dao becomes a celestial official; the middling adept dwells upon Kunlun; the lesser adept achieves longevity in the world.\n\nThe vermilion herb has stems like coral; when cut, its sap flows like blood. If jade is cast into the sap, it dissolves like mud, and over time turns to liquid. Gold cast into it becomes “golden nectar,” jade cast into it becomes “jade wine”—ingesting it grants longevity.\n\nMaster Shi’s cinnabar method: Take a fledgling crow before its feathers grow, feed it a mixture of true cinnabar and beef, and its plumage will turn crimson. Kill it, dry it in the shade, and consume it to live five hundred years.\n\nA face of unadorned fairness, skin of rosy hue, eyes that pierce the unseen—clear notes of shang and zhi mingling to confound the ear: such is the virtue of true principle.\n\nThe Dragon Abyss remains ever fresh through constant dredging; the axe and adze wear swiftly with daily use.\n\n---\n\nA span-long dragonfly skims the surface of a puddle and claims the world holds no seas so vast; a mite writhes within a fruit pit and declares the world holds no realms so boundless. Dried meat may stave off hunger for a moment, and poisoned wine may quench thirst for an instant—yet death follows swiftly after. One prizes luminous pearls but scorns the deep pools that yield them, cherishes flawless jade but despises the Jing Mountains that bear it, unaware that the pools are the source of pearls, the mountains the birthplace of jade.\n\nIn this age, scholars languish in waiting, while no office remains vacant even briefly. When the balmy breeze rises, fur robes and braziers are set aside; when the world’s path levels, extraordinary men retreat.\n\nThe fleshly zhi is the ten-thousand-year toad, its head inscribed with eight vermilion characters. Harvested at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, it can trace lines on the earth to summon flowing water or be worn on the left hand to repel weapons. Encountering in the mountains a child seven or eight inches tall, riding a carriage or horse—this is the fleshly zhi. Consuming it grants transcendence.\n\nThe thousand-year bat is white as snow, roosting upside down, its brain too heavy to hold upright. The thousand-year swallow’s nest faces north.\n\nCloud essence, cloud pearls, cloud liquid, cloud mother, and cloud sand are ingested with jade water.\n\nEmperor Cheng hunted on Mount Zhongnan when he saw a naked figure, its body covered in black fur. Surrounding and capturing it, they found it could leap chasms and scale cliffs like a bird. The captive was a woman who claimed to be a palace attendant from the Qin. When rebels from east of the pass approached, the Qin king surrendered, and she fled into the mountains, nearly starving until an old man taught her to eat pine nuts, which banished hunger. She was a palace woman of King Ziying of Qin, living over two hundred years by Emperor Cheng’s time. When people later fed her grains, her fur gradually shed, and she aged rapidly before dying.\n\nTo attain long life, consume mountain essence—mountain essence is a tree.\n\nMaster Lingyang Zhong took *far-reaching ambition* for twenty years, fathered thirty-seven sons, and never forgot what he read.\n\nThe true sages are the Yellow Emperor and Laozi; the worldly sages are Zhou and Confucius.\n\nThose skilled in the game of *mu* are called *mu* sages—thus Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming earned the name of *mu* sages.\n\nPeng Zu boasted of serving Yao, living through the Xia and into the Yin. The Yin king sent palace women to learn his bedchamber arts; when they proved effective, he sought to kill Peng Zu to suppress his teachings. Forewarned, Peng Zu fled, and seventy years later, someone saw him in the shifting sands.\n\nTo achieve long life, keep the belly free of desires; to attain deathlessness, keep the belly free of filth.\n\nA village saying goes: A person in the world loses a day with each passing day, like driving oxen or sheep to the butcher—each step forward brings death nearer.\n\nLord Lao’s surname was Li, given name Pin, courtesy name Boyang. He stood nine feet tall, with a yellow complexion, a beak-like mouth, a prominent nose, and eyebrows five inches long. He dwelled in the Hall of Golden Towers and Jade Chambers.\n\nClove tongue incense and the milk of coptis root cure all eye ailments.\n\nA proverb says: No fat immortals, no rich Daoists. Though Daoists can make gold and silver, they remain poor.\n\nAnother saying: \"Three copies turn fish into *lu*, emperor into tiger.\" Even divine talismans, now rarely effective, are like this. White stone resembles jade, and treacherous flatterers resemble the worthy. The *luan* bird does not tangle in nets; the *lin* beast does not fall into traps.\n\nAn inch of glue cannot clarify the Yellow River’s turbidity; a foot of water cannot cool the heat of Xiaoqiu. Plugging a leak with a bored boat or quenching a raging fire with fierce flames—such efforts are futile.\n\nIf a plain scholar plows by day to feed his mouth and gathers firewood by night to pursue learning, then even You and Xia would not be deemed exceptional.\n\nOnce a great mansion burns, drawing water from the vast sea is too late; when torrents surge through the skies, launching boats on long rivers is futile.\n\nMinisters are like hands and feet—they cannot refuse treading on ice or grasping fire.\n\nWhen a lofty ridge is about to collapse, fine threads cannot stitch it together. When the Dragon Gate’s waters boil, a handful of earth cannot dam them. Swords and halberds, though unsuited for sewing, can butcher oxen and horses; awls and drills, though useless for slaughter, excel at stitching. Materials have their great and small uses—none should be discarded.\n\nAn army may stand thick as a forest, yet not all its soldiers are brave.\n\n---\n\nVirtue is the rouge and powder of governance; punishment is the bridle and whip of the age. When one ought to kill but does not, great banditry arises.\n\nA spark from a drill’s tip may be quenched with a mouthful of water; a magpie’s egg, unhatched, may be crushed in the palm. Yet once it soars atop the clouds, scorching the vast wilds, beating six wings to pierce the dawn’s glow—even the wise and brave cannot restrain it. Releasing the reins and whip to ride a galloping steed on perilous paths, or casting aside the oar to drift a light boat on rivers and seas—how could this not be dangerous? A golden boat cannot dredge the waves of the Sun Marquis; a jade horse cannot gallop a thousand *li*.\n\nSome offer treasures to sell themselves; some peddle letters to influential men. Some, with fathers or elder brothers noble and eminent, are summoned merely by the sight of their gates; others, through long habit of bowing and scraping, are at last taken in.\n\nAs the saying goes: “They recommend ‘Outstanding Talent’ who know not books; they examine ‘Filial and Incorrupt’ whose fathers live apart.” The poor and pure, white as snow, are muddied like sludge; the high-ranking generals, fine as they seem, are timid as flies.\n\nThe proverb says: “The ancients sought advancement through diligent study of the classics; today’s men seek office by shunning worldly affairs.” I say: the bonds of friendship should not be shallow or insincere—outward smiles masking hollow hearts. As Yang Xiong mocked: “A bright mirror, when raised, reveals a crooked cap; the sun’s charioteer, when shining, exposes a warped shadow.”\n\nZhou Bo, a minister of the altars of soil and grain, could not answer questions on money and grain.\n\nThose who recognize treasures must gather the luminous pearls washed in clear waters; those who prize *qi* must seek the fragrant orchids amid foul marshes. Without a suspended mirror, who can sift jade from mud or retrieve sunken pearls from the river’s depths? The greatly wise stand firm as mountains; the petty drift like tumbleweeds and floating duckweed.\n\nThe straight plumb line is detested by crooked wood; purity and impartiality are loathed by the treacherous and wicked.\n\nWhen King Wen met Lü Wang, before the mulberry’s shade had shifted, he knew this was his teacher. When Xuande beheld Kongming, before the sun’s shadow had changed, he entrusted him with his heart and mind. Yet a grand appearance does not guarantee worthiness, nor does a feeble demeanor denote foolishness.\n\nBo Jie discerned a vessel of unmatched sound amid the ashes of a burnt-out hearth; Zhang Heng distinguished bamboo of rare resonance before it was ever used. Dignity moves like dragons and tigers, circling in perfect order.\n\nAfter wine, the body lightens and the ears grow hot; caps slip, belts loosen. The sluggish tumble like tumbleweeds in the wind; the composed leap like deer and fish. The tongue-tied wave their hands to keep rhythm; the unassertive grow bold and speak with vigor. They compare nine bends to an anthill, Lüliang’s rapids to an ox’s hoofprint—no matter how sternly forbidden, they cannot be stopped.\n\nIf a lord fears wine as he fears illness, loathes drunkenness as he loathes grave sickness, then he will avoid the fault of dissipation.\n\nWhen people dig cellars to brew wine and carry it in their sleeves, the law is light and profit heavy—how can one make them abstain? Guan Xiangru, with three *dou* of wine, grew eloquent and refined; Yang Xiong never parted from his cup, yet the *Tai Xuan* was completed.\n\nThose who love evil are like moths drawn to a bright flame; those who shun learning are like dust swept up by a whirlwind.\n\nWith an axe but no handle, what can be done?\n\nTo praise the supple and yielding as graceful while scorning the upright and solemn as rustic—is this not delusion?\n\nScholars in impoverished alleys chant by withered scrolls, cling to yellowed volumes, bow their heads and bend their knees, hastening to serve the powerful. Once their feathers grow and wings form, once they shed their earthen shells like cicadas, they strut with arrogance—these are the ones who shatter steles.\n\nLong ago, Xishi lay by the roadside clutching her chest in pain; her fragrance, like orchid and musk, made all who saw her admire her. A neighboring girl imitated her, and all who saw her loathed her—just as the world mimics Dai Shuluan and Ruan Sizong.\n\nWhen the age values something, even a lame donkey fetches the price of a dragon steed.\n\nFox-fur robes cannot ward off summer’s heat; dragon-prowed boats cannot traverse dry land.\n\nA fine general, when firm, is like heaven—visible but untouchable; when yielding, like an abyss—observable but impenetrable. Departing, he vanishes like lightning—seen but unreachable; standing, he is immovable as a mountain—gazed upon but unshaken.\n\nIn spring, long spears lead the way; in summer, great halberds; in autumn, bows and crossbows; in winter, blades and shields. This is the way of marching with the seasons, aligning with heaven’s law.\n\nTai Gong said: “Strike the solitary and weak, and ten thousand men will be no match; a single woman can withstand a hundred men.”\n\nWhen the wind rustles leaves, the enemy is ten *li* away; when it whistles through the branches, a hundred *li*; when it shakes the boughs, four hundred *li*. If metal vessels ring on their own, or scorched vessels sound, the army is exhausted. *Qi* like startled deer signals a defeated force.\n\nRain and dew soaking garments is called “moistening the army”; when they do not, it is called “weeping troops.” When the army’s *qi* resides in the Great One’s jade tent, it cannot be assailed.\n\nWhere crabs appear on the battlefield, the army should move swiftly.\n\nI once heard Ji Sheng say: “Can Zuo Taichong and Zhang Maoxian be called *tongren*?” The Way of the ruler replied: “*Tongren* stand next to the sages—there is no room between.”\n\nI asked Ban— Ban said: “Lü Wang saw clouds and knew where the High Ancestor was. Did heaven open only Lü’s eyes while blinding all others?” A eunuch without desire cannot be called chaste; a courtesan who does not drink cannot be called upright.\n\nKing Wen ate the soup of his son yet feigned ignorance—not because he savored it.\n\nDong Zhongshu’s learning was profound, but his natural talent dull. To mistake clams and wasps for divine dragons is not only to fail to recognize dragons, but also clams and wasps.\n\nWang Chong patted Ban Gu’s back and said: “This child will surely be known throughout the world.”\n\nThe Five Ridges know no trees that shed in winter; in the Southern Sea and Jin’an, rice ripens nine times a year.\n\nThe *Jade Register of Lord Lao* states: “Pine resin buried in the earth for a thousand years becomes *fuling*; *fuling* for a thousand years becomes amber; amber for a thousand years becomes chalcanthite; chalcanthite for a thousand years becomes *weixi*.”\n\nRoast the drum to make it sound; tighten the strings to make them mournful.\n\nShould the drum be scorched to hasten its rupture or the strings tightened until they snap, the proof lies in the swiftness of the blade that slays the horse. ○ When clams and wasps build their nests, they produce beeswax and water; their froth becomes pumice. ○ The Falling Star Hollow is said to be where a star descended in the time of King Wu. ○ The *Book of Ji Tomb* states: “After the Yellow Emperor ascended as an immortal, his minister Fu Che carved wood into an effigy of the Yellow Emperor and led the feudal lords in its veneration.” ○ Consuming magpie embryos enables one to write in the dark. ○ He Bo was a man of Huayin who drowned while crossing the river on the geng day of the eighth month; the Heavenly Emperor appointed him as the River Lord. ○ The Goose Ghost. Emperor Jing of Wu suffered an illness and summoned the shaman Xian. The emperor tested her by slaughtering a goose and burying it in the palace gardens, then erecting a small hut with a curtained bed and placing a woman’s shoes before it. The shaman declared, “I see only a white goose—no woman at all.” The emperor thus held her in high regard. ○ The Gibbon Ghost. My friend Jiao Yongshu once kept a large gibbon, chaining it by the ankle in the rafters. A dog gnawed it to death, and after a hundred days, its ghost appeared to onlookers, saying, “On the ceiling beam sits a gibbon, its wounds still dripping blood.” ○ My great-uncle attained the Dao and could divide his form at will. Once, as he sat in conversation with a certain Master Ge, another Master Ge arrived to see him off. ○ I have seen some hundred fascicles of the writings of the Two Lu brothers, though it seems their works are not yet complete.\n\nCompared to others, they are as the Yangtze and Han rivers to a stagnant puddle.\n\nJi Sheng remarked: “Whenever I read the works of the Two Lu brothers, I cannot help but lay down the scroll in admiration, fearing their writings may one day be exhausted.” The *Master Lu’s Ten Essays* are indeed masterful works—where their language is rich, even the most refined thought cannot subtract from it; where their principles are concise, even the most eloquent brush cannot add to it. Observing these two, how could they be mere scholars of refined elegance or men of letters?\n\n○ The *Baopuzi* states: In Qin times, people did not notice the ugliness of noseless faces; in Yangdi, they despised those without goiters. Master Lu possessed profound insight into the unbridled nature of literature, yet he never indulged in empty or exaggerated speech—not because he could not, but because he chose not to. The writings of Master Lu are like jade from the Dark Garden, every piece a luminous treasure. Even centuries later, if there should arise men of talent comparable to the Two Lu brothers, they would still stand shoulder to shoulder. To call them sparse would be a grave misjudgment.\n\n○ At the gates of Confucius and Zengzi, those who learned by ear and mouth alone have long since vanished; only those who entrusted their teachings to bamboo and silk may be called treasures of the age. Restraint is the saddle and bridle of benevolence and righteousness; bonds and locks are the trappings of ritual and music.\n\n○ My friend, Master Xuanbo, built his walls with Confucianism and Mohism, wielded his weapons with wit and spirit—truly a man of antiquity. ○ Ice forms yet does not chill; provisions run out yet hunger does not come. ○ Where otters multiply, fish are disturbed; where hawks gather, crows are thrown into chaos. ○ A tail spanning a full zhang cannot belong to a body of a mere foot; tusks reaching several ren cannot fit in a mouth of a few inches. Mi Heng once said: “Only Kong Rong and Xun Qiang are worth speaking to—the rest are but wine jars and rice sacks.”\n\nHong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. His ancestors traced back to the clan of Ge Tian. After his family’s library was repeatedly destroyed by fire, Hong carried his books on his back and traveled on foot, borrowing texts to copy by hand. He sold firewood to buy paper, and by lamplight, he pored over his writings—what he transcribed was often written in reverse, few could read it. His nature was unassuming; his hat cords were frayed and soiled. Sometimes he wore flowing robes with wide sashes, sometimes tight sleeves and a short jacket; at times his robes dragged on the ground, at others they barely covered his knees. The people of his time called him a “Baopu scholar,” and thus he came to be known by his writings.\n\nHong was too poor to keep servants, and his fences were left untended. He often pushed through brambles to leave his home and parted the weeds to enter. By nature, he avoided offending officials or troubling his relatives.\n\n○ When Ji Jun was appointed Governor of Guangzhou, he recommended Hong as his adjutant. Hong saw this not as a path to profit or pleasure, but as a means to retreat to the southern lands.\n\n○ Hong never gambled at dusk with dice or tiles; when he saw others playing, he paid no attention.\n\n○ At fifteen, Hong composed grand poems and rhapsodies, believing they would endure through the ages. By the time he reached twenty, he reviewed his earlier works and found them unsatisfactory, destroying them all at once.\n\n*Yilin*, Volume Four, concludes.\n\n*Yilin*, Volume Five\nCompiled by Ma Zong of Fufeng during the Yuanhui era.\n\n**Zhou Shengliezi, Five Scrolls**\nPreface states: Among the six deluded fools, there was Zhou Shenglie of Dunhuang, styled Wenyì. After the fall of Zhang Jiao, the realm descended into chaos. Within the span of a single sigh, he composed this work, taking Yao and Shun as its pillars and Confucius as its teacher and admonisher.\n\n○ A charioteer who loses control shatters his own carriage. One who loses control of the realm causes the Four Seas to collapse. Jie and Zhou served as the stepping stones for Tang and Wu; Qin and Xiang became the ladder for the Great Han. If the four rebellions do not arise, the four submissions will not ascend.\n\n○ The worthy and wise cannot be lured by appearances, just as one does not set snares for phoenixes or lay traps for qilin. Bo Le chose horses from the lean; the sage selects men from the unrefined. Settling disputes is not as good as preventing them; excelling at quelling chaos is not as good as preventing it.\n\n○ To govern the celestial net, wield the eight handles, move the primordial signs, and gather the multitudes—this is the role of the Son of Heaven. To nurture the people and align with the will of Heaven—this is the duty of the Three Dukes. To uphold public integrity and cultivate order—this is the way of the scholar. To cultivate goodness only at death is too late; to turn back when matters press is too feeble. Those with a foundation build easily; those without struggle to succeed.\n\n○ The turtledove lends its wings to the fledgling; the lamb dons leopard skin—outward semblance belies inner truth, the surface conceals the core. Man is the tongue of Heaven; things are the mouth of the spirits. Heaven is high, Earth is deep—retribution comes late. Words are the sovereign’s bow and crossbow; teachings are the ruler’s mechanism.\n\n○ Bestow rewards as generously as spring; mete out punishments as severely as autumn. Perform rites with the fervor of fire; disseminate teachings with the flow of water. Yield one, gain a hundred; contend for ten, lose nine.\n\n**Xun Yue’s *Shenjian*, Five Scrolls**\nPreface states: The Dao is rooted in benevolence and righteousness. The Five Classics serve as its warp; the myriad texts serve as its weft. With past mirrors now clear, this work further expounds them—hence the title *Shenjian* (*Extended Mirror*).\n\n○ When ruler and minister are close yet observe propriety, when the hundred officials harmonize without uniformity—this is the wind of a well-governed state.\n\n○ When customs and rites vary, when the common folk voice their opinions—this is the wind of a declining state. When ruler and minister vie in oaths, when great officers contend for fame—this is the wind of a fractured state. When the ruler is full of desires, when the people are full of schemes, when laws are unstable and governance is scattered—this is the wind of a chaotic state. When exploiting the people is called ability, when flattering superiors is called loyalty—this is the wind of a rebellious state. When petty officials vie for favor, when great ministers vie for power—this is the wind of a harmed state. When the ruler does not consult, when the ministers do not remonstrate, when a woman’s words are heeded and inner politics prevail—this is the wind of a doomed state.\n\n○ The skilled at prohibition first restrain themselves before others; the unskilled first restrain others before themselves. Third: to achieve martial affairs. Fourth: to forbid frequent pardons.\n\n○ When the Qin destroyed learning, books rotted in the walls, and righteousness vanished from court and countryside. To study sageliness without attaining it is still to fulfill one’s life; to study longevity without attaining it is still to fulfill one’s fate.\n\n○ The noble person has three mirrors: the mirror of the past, the mirror of others, and the mirror of reflection.\n\n○ If the subordinate does not seal his mouth, if the superior does not stop his ears, then there is something to be heard.\n\n○ Reflecting on Yao and Shun in high antiquity, gazing upon Confucius in the middle ages—one knows that petty ways are shameful. Thinking of Boyi on Shouyang, imagining the Four Elders on Mount Shang—one knows that filth and falsehood are disgraceful. Recalling Zhang Qian at the western frontier, remembering Su Wu in the northern wastes—one knows that clinging to comfort is contemptible.\n\n**Zhongchang Tong’s *Changyan*, Ten Scrolls**\nTeachings take ritual and righteousness as their foundation; ritual and righteousness take the classics as their root. The constant Dao endures for a hundred generations; expedient measures are used for a single moment. Before Gaoxin, we hear of the men but do not see their books. From the Tang, Yu, Xia, and Yin, we see their books but not their full affairs. From the Zhou onward, records are complete.\n\n○ When a foolish heir sees none in the realm dare oppose him, he indulges his private passions and pursues his perverse desires. Ruler and minister revel in debauchery, high and low share in wickedness. Their eyes feast on extravagant spectacles, their ears exhaust the sounds of Zheng and Wei. Indoors, they gallop among women without restraint; outdoors, they race through the hunt without return. They trust and favor their kin, cherish and exalt their empresses and consorts—yet when fate shifts and fortune departs, they do not perceive it.\n\n○ Raising banners and beating drums, lighting beacons and keeping watch—these are the fierce generals who guard the frontiers, not the good officials of the Central States. Jade-belled carriages, cleared roads, deferential courtesies—these are the majestic rites of the Xia, not the customs of the Yi and Di.\n\n○ Dong Xian shared no kinship with Emperor Ai, not even a thread of blood. Nor could he transmit his lineage or secure his succession. Yet through the fleeting pleasures of a man’s embrace, he became as inseparable as lacquer and glue.\n\n○ When Emperor Jing ascended the throne, the regional inspectors were all sons of eunuchs—like jackals guarding meat, like demons awaiting illness. They said: \"Within Heaven’s bounds, beyond man’s reach.\"\n\n○ If others love me, I love them; if others hate me, I hate them.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm have three vulgarities: selecting men by clan and pedigree is the first; flocking to the gates of the rich and powerful is the second; fearing and submitting to the noble and exalted is the third.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm have three despicable traits: craving fame without knowing truth is the first; not daring to judge right and wrong before the rich and powerful is the second; turning toward the prosperous and away from the declining is the third.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm harbor three deceptions: feigning ignorance when they truly do not know is the first; plagiarizing others’ records to craft their own theories is the second; accepting anonymity to claim another’s knowledge is the third.\n\n○ To know the words but not act upon them is called an affliction. This affliction, though treated by the physicians of Heaven, cannot be cured. Why must those who spy on me be lovable? Why must those who differ from me be hateful?\n\n○ Wisdom suffices to establish difficult undertakings; ability suffices to achieve arduous feats. Those near are not favored; those distant are not abandoned.\n\n○ A woman may weep for her good husband at dawn, yet by dusk wed another in a distant land, traversing a hundred courts without a blush of shame. Now, in the palaces of princes and marquises, hundreds of beauties reside; in the households of high ministers, dozens of concubines attend. By day, they drench their bones and marrow in fine wine; by night, they exhaust their blood and qi in the bedchamber.\n\n○ Human nature presents these tendencies: those steadfast as mountains or still as deep pools suffer from obstruction; those stern and unyielding risk alienating others; those vast and unbounded risk lack of restraint; those harmonious and cautious risk indecision; those upright and pure risk narrow-mindedness; those eloquent and persuasive risk garrulity; those composed and deliberate risk tardiness; those who cherish antiquity and uphold tradition risk inflexibility; those bold and resolute risk peril.\n\nScour the breast and cleanse the heart, making them fragrant and resplendently white, impervious to stain. Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are of Heavenly nature. Weave them to shape their substance, refine them to attain their essence, polish them to reveal their radiance. In obscurity, even the skilled reveal their shortcomings; in assembly, they recount others’ strengths.\n\nThose who oppose me, I treat with greater generosity; those who doubt me, I trust all the more. In adversity, we must aid one another; in gain, we must yield to others.\n\n○ To serve a lord without earning his recognition is to fall short of true loyalty. To befriend others without winning their trust is to fall short of true righteousness. If parents disdain learning, yet despise their descendants for neglecting study—how can one not defy them to pursue it? If parents scorn the virtuous, yet despise their descendants for befriending them—how can one not defy them to associate with them?\n\n○ Brilliant phrases gather like rain; sublime lines arrive like clouds. Affection and conflict are the nature of fate. Delight and satisfaction in one’s aspirations are what all desire.\n\n○ Drawing the spring from beneath the tongue and swallowing it is called *embryonic nourishment*. Those who attain the Dao grow six wings upon their arms and feathers upon their bellies, soaring through the boundless azure, traversing the endless world. The north is cold, and its people long-lived; the south is hot, and its people short-lived. Like silkworms, when cold and hungry, they draw out more thread; when warm and sated, they draw out less.\n\nAfter Tang’s Jie, Qin’s Yirang succeeded—Yirang being Gaoyao’s son. *Dian Lun* in five scrolls, by Emperor Wen of Wei.\n\nWhen Yao passed, Shun avoided Yao’s son south of the Southern River. When Shun passed, Yu avoided Shun’s son at Yangcheng. When Yu passed, Yi avoided Yu’s son on the northern slope of Mount Ji—these events are recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\nLike one ascending a mountain, they strive for greater heights; like one crossing a river, they strive for distant shores.\n\nShould the heart grow idle, even timely efforts may fail.\n○ *Ying Chang* states: \"Human life inherently possesses a human heart.\"\n   Reply: \"Toward kin, it is called filial piety; toward others, it is called benevolence.\"\n   Benevolence is the true name of engaged action, not the emptiness of inaction.\n   Praising goodness is the mother of the Dao, the master of one’s conduct.\n\n○ The *Preface* says: \"Flattery and corruption pollute governance; favoritism and hatred corrupt customs.\"\n   When a state harbors these two ills, its peril becomes inevitable.\n\n○ During the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling, eunuchs wielded power at court while commoners clamored in dissent below.\n   Those seeking office bribed the mighty with gifts; those chasing fame groveled before the influential.\n   Rank was secured through private patronage, reputation forged in alleyway factions.\n   Thus, households held divergent views, individuals espoused conflicting theories—debates lacked fixed standards, affairs had no set value.\n   Love and hatred grew unchecked, cliques flourished.\n\n○ Guan Yi was extravagant while Bao Shu was frugal—such were their differing aspirations.\n   Zhang Lian was pure while Chen Zun was depraved—such were their unequal conduct.\n\n○ Rulers and people share three desires:\n   To be deemed diligent, to be deemed loyal unto death, to be deemed life-giving.\n\n○ Law is the ruler’s handle, officials the people’s lifeline.\n   Laws should be simple and clear; officials should be impartial and just.\n\n○ The *Book of Songs* satirizes seductive wives; the *Book of Documents* warns against scheming concubines.\n   Feng Fang’s daughter, a woman of peerless beauty, fled chaos to Yangzhou.\n   Yuan Shu, gazing from the city walls, was smitten and took her as his own, showering her with favor.\n   His other wives instructed her: \"The general esteems those of noble resolve—you should often weep to feign sorrow.\"\n   Thereafter, whenever she met Yuan Shu, she would dissolve into tears, and he, believing her heartfelt, doted on her even more.\n   The wives then strangled her and hung her in the privy, claiming she had hanged herself in despair.\n   Yuan Shu, convinced she had died of unfulfilled longing, gave her a lavish burial.\n   Yuan Shao’s wife, Lady Liu, was fiercely jealous. Before his funeral rites were complete, she murdered five of his concubines, fearing that in death he might still favor them. She shaved their heads and blackened their faces to disfigure them.\n\n○ Wang Mei, the Prefect of Shangluo, was enfeoffed for his merits. His wife wept in their chambers, dreading that wealth and rank would lead him to take new wives.\n\n○ Liu Biao, Governor of Jingzhou, ruled the southern lands. His sons and nephews grew arrogant and decadent, crafting three ceremonial goblets named for their ranks:\n   The eldest, *Bo Ya*, held seven measures; the middle, *Zhong Ya*, six; the youngest, *Ji Ya*, five.\n   They also affixed a sharp blade to the end of a staff, using it to slash any guest who drank too deeply, testing their sobriety.\n   Yet human form and nature differ little from common creatures: toil hastens early death, ease delays it.\n\n○ I once delighted in playing the *tanbo* at dusk, exhausting all its artistry, and in my youth composed a rhapsody.\n   Long ago in the capital, there was a gentleman from the Eastern Lands, Master Zhang of the Fang family, who lamented never having faced those few masters in competition.\n\n○ The *Preface to \"The Crown Prince\"* states:\n   \"I have been graced with profound favor, unworthily named heir apparent. Overwhelmed by anxiety, I submitted a memorial to the throne.\n   To elaborate with florid prose would dishonor the father-son bond; to speak plainly and directly would fail to convey my joy and fear.\"\n   A village saying goes: *\"Do not praise yourself—let others read your family letters.\"* Such is the difficulty.\n\n*Wei Zi* in ten scrolls:\nWhen the source is still, the stream runs clear; when the root is upright, the branches flourish.\nInner cultivation brings outer order; a straight form casts a true shadow.\nHeaven births the noble to govern the base; Heaven births the base to serve the noble.\nWithout the noble, the base cannot be nurtured; without the base, the noble cannot be sustained.\nRecord one good deed in a person, and none are worthless; employ one talent in a material, and none are wasted.\nPeople all belittle Mount Hua as small, so they climb it and injure themselves; they revere Heaven as vast, so they never ascend and avoid harm.\n\n○ A tripod is prized for its rarity, while a cauldron is scorned for its common use.\n\n○ In ancient times, a disciple fell ill, and his master visited him repeatedly. Each time the master arrived, the disciple would rise, exhausting himself until he died.\n   The master was not unkind, nor was the disciple discourteous—the harm lay in excess.\n   Thin ice under a white sun, a tuft of fur in a raging fire: though one may wish to escape harm, the circumstances forbid it.\n   The silkworm thrives in the mulberry but perishes in the mustard—not because the mulberry is kind or the mustard cruel, but because it has lost its proper place.\n\n○ The proverb says:\n*\"If you are right and they are wrong, do not contend with the wrong.\nIf they are right and you are wrong, do not contend with the right.\"*\n\n○ The noble person’s outward conduct does not conceal their inner nature; their clarity and obscurity follow the same measure.\n\n○ Bitter toil is the ladder to wealth and honor.\n\n○ Confucius left no contracts with the world, yet his virtue shone forth.\n\nThe good and evil of past and present are clear. A mirror reflects ugliness and beauty without reproach; the law distinguishes good and evil without resentment.\n\n*Records of Human Abilities* in three fascicles by Liu Shao:\nThe finest essence of plants is called *ying*; the mightiest of beasts is called *xiong*.\nZhang Liang is *ying*; Han Xin is *xiong*.\n\n*Renzi* in ten fascicles by Ming Yi:\nLearning is for cultivating oneself; teaching is for cultivating others.\n\n○ Joy can inspire song and dance; anger can drive battle.\n\n○ The wisdom of one person does not surpass the folly of the many; the scrutiny of one eye does not surpass the clarity of many eyes.\n\n○ Born in order, raised in order, one who understands the causes of order—this is a noble person.\nBorn in chaos, raised in chaos, one who understands the causes of chaos—this is a noble person.\nOne who does not know the reasons for order and chaos is a common person.\n\n○ The embrace of the Dao and virtue among the people is like the spring sun softening the heavens’ roundness—though it does not fit the compass, or the earth’s squareness—though it does not match the carpenter’s square.\n\n○ Mountains must have foothills; rivers must have bends.\nThe Yangtze and Han rivers flow eastward, yet they must curve and return.\n\n○ A straight tree casts no shade; a forthright scholar has no followers. Thus, the worthy and the upright are seldom tolerated by the world.\n\n○ Ascending Mount Tai, one sees the vastness of the world—this is because those who do not examine the small can see the distant.\nOccupying high office, one knows the nobility of the ruler—this is because those who do not pity the lowly are full of self-satisfaction.\n\n○ If one governs oneself with care, one can govern others; if one governs others with care, one can govern the world.\n\nGenerations of sages follow one after another; a thousand *li* apart, the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\n○ Water may dry, but its wetness cannot be taken away; fire may be extinguished, but its heat cannot be taken away. Metal may be softened, but its weight cannot be taken away; stone may be shattered, but its hardness cannot be taken away.\n\n○ The proverb says:\nThe rich do not learn extravagance yet become extravagant; the poor do not learn frugality yet become frugal.\nHuman nature is capable of both, but only the sage can regulate it.\n\nWood-*qi* makes one brave; metal-*qi* makes one steadfast; fire-*qi* makes one strong yet restless; earth-*qi* makes one wise yet broad-minded; water-*qi* makes one swift yet treacherous.\n\n○ The divine dragon does not dwell in waters tangled with nets; the phoenix does not soar over lands trapped by snares.\nThe worthy do not enter perilous states; the wise do not assist chaotic rulers.\n\n○ Xiao He upheld the written law; Cao Shen avoided harshness. As successive chancellors, the world found peace.\nEmperor Wu轻视d human life, prized military merit, adorned palaces, and imposed heavy taxes. Though his territory expanded, his virtue and benevolence narrowed.\n\n○ Huan Tan said: A true king is easy to assist; a hegemon is difficult to aid.\n\n*Profound Discussions* in four fascicles by Du Shu:\nWater’s nature overcomes fire, yet when divided by a cooking pot, fire grows strong and water weak.\nHuman nature overcomes will, yet when divided by profit and desire, will grows strong and nature weak.\n\n○ To examine character and conduct, nothing surpasses local reputation; to assess talent and select ability, nothing is better than direct examination.\n\nThe Du clan originated with Emperor Yao. One branch became the Tang-Du clan in Zhou; in the Han dynasty, there were Du Zhou, Du Qin, and Du Du.\n\n○ Du Ji, styled Bohou, has a biography in the *Book of Wei*.\nHis eldest son, Li, styled Wuzhong, was perceptive from youth, hence his name *Li* (Understanding).\nHis youngest son, Shu, styled Wubai.\n\n○ Your Majesty says: \"In this age, there are no worthy talents; the court lacks sagely advisors. How can we hope to emulate the ancient ministers Hou Ji and Xie, or await the rise of future worthies, and still govern effectively?\"\n\nShu in Hedong would sit and lie down, always avoiding his father’s dwelling.\n\nShu’s son, Yu, styled Yuankai, has a biography in the *Book of Jin*.\n\n*On Substance* in four fascicles by Du Shu:\nImmovable as a mountain, inscrutable as shadow.\nOne of profound virtue is not questioned on minor faults; one of great deeds is not criticized for small errors.\nEven the Pearl of Marquis Sui cannot be without flaws.\n\n○ The minister is like the earth: it bears all things without shirking its burden, receives filth and defilement without rejecting its lowliness, and nurtures plants and trees without claiming their merit.\nConduct is the black and white of honor and disgrace.\n\n○ The noble person chooses their neighborhood when dwelling and selects their companions when traveling.\n\nThe governance of the perfected person:\nEstablishes the state in an unshakable place, accumulates policies in a flawless region, carries virtue in an unceasing chariot, issues decrees from an inexhaustible granary, guides the people along a path of no contention, and enacts laws in a manner that ensures success.\nThe common people are water; the noble person is the boat. Water both carries and overturns the boat.\n\n○ Shu was careless and indolent, content merely to eat his fill. Though his family had books and records, he barely engaged with them. During his father’s mourning, his conduct often strayed from ritual, and his reputation for filial piety was not heard.\nLater, he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace and then Gentleman of the Yellow Gate.\nA colleague asked about his aspirations, and he replied: \"When great ministers debate, some side with Party A to criticize Party B’s allies, or side with Party B to slander Party A’s allies.\nI stand between A and B, fortunate to avoid both praise and blame.\"\n\n*Master Fu’s Writings* in one hundred twenty fascicles:\nGreat trees flourish; small trees spread.\nEarth is humanity’s mother, so people cherish their homeland.\n\nOne may pay a high price for a neighbor, for the house can be bought, but the neighbor cannot.\n\n○ Wearing Yao’s cap while behaving like Jie—one is still Jie.\nWearing Jie’s clothes while behaving like Yao—one is still Yao.\nStanding in the marketplace’s shops, dressed in a noble person’s robes, performing the deeds of the wise among petty men—this is like walking at night adorned with pearls and jade, yet still shining brightly.\nThe spider weaves its web, the bee builds its hive—how exquisite their craft! How much more so for humans.\n\nA thousand taels of gold are not worth one worthy person.\nA person without integrity is like clothing without seams or food without flavor.\n\n○ Guo Linzong asked Qiu Zhiji: \"Have you ever made a mistake?\"\nZhiji replied: \"At dusk, I was feeding the ox, and when it would not eat, I struck it once.\"\n\nIt is said: \"A scholar is not a jade.\" Those who praise him speak only of his value, yet the mouths of those who praise are like hearts of love and hate.\n\n○ Excessive wisdom drains the blood and qi, like a lamp’s flame to its tallow—if the wick is large, the light is bright, but the tallow is consumed; if the wick is small, the light is dim, but the tallow endures, and thus may last long.\n\n○ One who speaks boldly but gazes timidly is a hypocrite. One whose breath is urgent and voice heavy is a steadfast person.\n\n○ When Meng Tian built the Great Wall, the people could not bear their suffering, and white bones piled like mountains. Then a song arose:\n*\"Bear a son—take care not to raise him;\nBear a daughter—swaddle her to serve.\nHave you not seen beneath the Great Wall,\nWhere white bones stand as pillars?\"*\nThose who forge gold are alchemists who take plant ash and smelt it with metal. Thus, as the plant ash burns, the gold falls away.\n\n*The Supreme Mystery Classic* in fourteen scrolls, by Yang Quan of Liang, styled Deyuan:\nAnger is like the fierce winter; joy, like the gentle spring.\n\n○ The luan, the crane, and the phoenix—noble birds of lofty lineage—conceal their brilliance in the forest and do not feed on filth.\n\n○ Inwardly pure yet outwardly tarnished, clad in tattered robes yet bearing jade within.\n\n○ For every ten *li*, nine are pits—oxen and horses rise and fall.\n\n○ Heaven’s qi turns left, the stars move right; yin and yang revolve in cycles, returning to meet one another.\n\n○ The overbearing perish; the obstinate break; the fiercely strong stumble; the greatly sharp dulls.\n\n○ Rushing qi becomes wind; surging qi becomes rain; turbid mist becomes snow; clear dew becomes frost.\n\n*The Scripture of Transformation and Purity* in ten scrolls:\nThe turbid do not trust the clarity born of the deep but willingly bathe in filth.\n\n○ In action, swift as a tiger’s pounce; in stillness, hidden as a scale-clad creature.\n\nLike that, resplendent; like this, vast and boundless.\n\n○ Those about to take flight fold their wings; those about to surge crouch low; those about to strike retract their claws; those about to speak close their mouths; those about to refine first return to simplicity.\n\n*Zouzi* in one scroll:\nTo know a person, observe their friends.\nLuxuriant weeds in the field leave no place for good seedlings to set their roots;\nFlatterers in the court leave no room for the loyal and upright to stand.\n\n○ Do not enter a house with few doors at night; do not brush dust from your meal—these are ways to avoid suspicion.\n\n*On Success and Failure* in three scrolls, by Sun Yu, styled Zhongshu:\nWater’s nature is to flow, yet without guidance, it does not course; human nature is to be wise, yet without teaching, it does not flourish.\nLearning is like planting—without it, one withers.\n\n○ Secrecy is the juncture of heaven and earth, the pivot of success and failure. Thus, if yin and yang are not kept secret, the summer cannot complete the year; if a house’s eaves are not sealed, even nine stories cannot shelter a body.\n\n*Comprehensive Discourse on Past and Present* in three scrolls, by Wang Ying:\nKunlun’s southeast spans five thousand *li*—this is called the Divine Continent, the dwelling of emperors and the birthplace of sages.\n\n○ Cang Jie created writing: when form is established, it is called *wen*; when sound is complete, it is called *zi*. *Zi* derives from the blossoming and breeding of forms, and when inscribed on bamboo and silk, it is called *shu*.\n\n*The Central Treatise* in six scrolls, by Xu Weichang, with annotations by Ren:\nTo stand and ponder the distant is not as good as hastening forward to reach it; to crane one’s neck after flying things is not as good as cultivating wings to surely seize them; to live alone and wish for wisdom is not as good as accumulating learning to surely attain it.\nThe noble person does not worry that his years are waning but that his resolve may falter.\nThe Dao in relation to humanity is most simple, yet when submerged, it is not spoken of—this is as different from Sima Qian as a leopard is from a horse.\n\n○ One’s passage through the world is like playing chess: if one does not exhaust the Dao, who is without a fatal move? It is merely a matter of misfortune.\n\n*Tangzi* in ten scrolls, by Tang Pang, styled Huijian, born in the second year of the Taiyuan era of Wu:\nA boat following the river travels swiftly; a person following the road does not lose their way.\n\n○ A great tree of a hundred *xun* has deep roots; the vast sea of ten thousand *ren* is formed by many streams; profound wisdom and penetrating insight are the work of accumulated learning.\n\nThe noble person crowns himself with the Dao and rides in a carriage of the Dao. Without the Dao as his crown, he does not dare to go forth; without the Dao as his carriage, he cannot take a step.\n\nOne who has a father yet cannot be filial, a brother yet cannot be respectful, yet lectures others on the duties of father and son, elder and younger—this is like bending a bow to shoot oneself.\n\n○ If human nature possesses even one act of filial piety, then nothing is left unembraced, just as when a tree’s root is planted, a hundred branches grow.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Between Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin, who was superior?\"\nTangzi replied: \"In terms of merit, Huan is the elder brother and Wen the younger; in terms of virtue, Wen is the elder brother and Huan the younger.\"\n\n○ The Great Jin, responding to the mandate of the times, swept all before it like thunder crushing the withered, a thousand *jun* pressing upon an egg—nothing remained.\n\n○ People often suffer from seeing a hundred paces ahead yet not knowing their own brows and cheeks; those who know their brows and cheeks cannot see a hundred paces.\n\nThe noble person guards authenticity and wields trust; when the times do not permit it, though he may endure the shame of slander and the filth of hidden defamation, it is but a scratch upon his body.\n\nEagles in their prime take flight; phoenixes roam afar. When petty men form ranks, the noble person retreats into seclusion.\n\nA saying goes: \"No matter how much rouge and powder, they cannot adorn an ugly face; no matter how radiant the ointment, it cannot moisten grass.\"\n\n○ The ancients were short-sighted in seeing themselves, so they used mirrors to observe their forms; the heart is short-sighted in governing itself, so it uses ritual to guard against transgression.\n\nThe noble person does not alter his conduct because of darkness, nor change his countenance because of night.\n\n○ One who possesses a name that towers above the world must bear the burden of defying convention; one who has integrity that transcends the ordinary must endure the calamity of slander and scorn.\n\nWhite bones resemble ivory; fish eyes resemble pearls—from afar, none can distinguish them.\n\n○ Fortune and misfortune turn into one another; benefit and harm give rise to each other, like a wheel rolling a ball—its signs are unseen, its beginnings unfelt.\n\n○ A good general is like a mountain, like an abyss—people do not know his sorrow, nor do they know his joy.\n\n○ A general must not leave the drums and banners, for they are the army’s ears and eyes.\n\n○ Sudden glory is not dwelled in by the wise.\n\nOne who hoards wealth and does not give is called a \"money slave.\"\n\n○ Those who assist in strife are harmed; those who meddle in affairs perish.\n\n*Qinzi* in two scrolls.\n\nSeeking to make white stand out against snow or to race light beneath the sun—this cannot be done.\n\n○ Yan Yanxian once asked: \"There is a flavor as rich as wine yet does not intoxicate; its taste resembles millet, yet drinking it brings drunkenness—why is this?\" Master Qin replied: \"Intoxication lies with the petty man, not with the noble one.\"\n\nI desire splendor within though plain without, not embroidery outside with hemp within—just as a speaker would sooner exhaust words than道理.\n\n○ What is distant and hard to know is Heaven; what is near and hard to know is man.\n\n○ By means of the axe one obtains the handle; by means of the handle one achieves its use.\n\nPlant a single grain, and a thousand myriad grains flourish; plant a single act of kindness, and the beauty of a hundred deeds is complete.\n\n○ A needle, though small, sinks in water; a feather, though large, floats in water—such is their inherent nature.\n\n*Meizi*, one scroll.\n\nYi Yin, Lü Wang, Fu Yue, Jizi, Boyi and Shuqi, Liu Hui, Yan Yuan, Zhuang Zhou, and Ruan Ji—had they exchanged places, they could have done what they could not do.\n\nRuan Ji fulfilled filial piety toward his parents, remained loyal without forgetting his lord, preserved clarity without neglecting himself, displayed wisdom without meddling in affairs, and feigned foolishness without disrupting governance.\n\nSince the time of Zhuang Zhou, among the great worthies of the age, none has been his equal—such was Master Ruan.\n\nAccording to his writings, he was a man of the Jin.\n\n*Wulilun*, sixteen scrolls.\n\nHe who seeks to stabilize the world yet employs petty men is like one who hunts elk while setting snares for rabbits—it cannot be done.\n\n○ Anger scorches like fire on clothing—its damage is great. When the rice in a pot of wrath boils over, one overturns and discards it—loss outweighs gain.\n\n○ As the saying goes: \"If those above are not upright, those below will be in disarray.\"\n\nIn ancient times, rulers did not deceive their people: they pared down the rich and powerful to nourish the poor and weak. How is this different from starving the plow-ox to ride the horse, or feeding the barking dog while whetting a lead blade instead of *Ganjiang*?\n\n○ The *Analects* is the ultimate teaching of the sage and the great transformation of the king. The \"Xiangdang\" chapter contains the rituals of court and the ceremonies of diplomatic reception. The \"Yaoyue\" chapter records the affairs of abdication and succession.\n\nThe literary brilliance in a person is like the flowering splendor of grass.\n\n○ The *Giving Court Gentleman* debated with Gao Tanglong and Qin Lang over the south-pointing carriage. The two claimed: \"Such a carriage never existed in antiquity—it is but an empty record.\" The Master replied: \"To dispute over empty words is not as good as testing their effect.\" He spoke of this to Emperor Ming. The emperor ordered the carriage made, and it was successfully completed.\n\n○ Master Fan Che resided within the capital city, where he possessed land for a garden but suffered from lack of water for irrigation. He thus devised the *fan che* (chain-pump), which a child could operate, increasing efficiency a hundredfold.\n\nHeaven and earth complete a year: spring precedes autumn. The governance of a ruler: ritual precedes punishment. To treat an infant’s illness yet refuse moxibustion, only to administer other remedies until death—this is no different than taking the wrong medicine. Today, those who abolish corporal punishment multiply, yet such abolition is like substituting one drug for another. Though corporal punishment severs a limb, the person may still live and bear children. When Zhang Cang abolished corporal punishment, tens of thousands were executed each year; when Zhong Xian restored it, two thousand lives were saved annually.\n\n○ The term \"corporal punishment\" is akin to birds and beasts being placed upon the cutting board as meat.\n\n○ If a beloved son were to face the death penalty, his compassionate father would surely beg to substitute it with corporal punishment—exchanging death for life if possible. Can a ruler of the Dao fail to extend this mercy to the people? When a snake bites one’s hand, a strong man severs his wrist, knowing that though the limb is lost, life remains.\n\n○ Cao Yi said: \"One tames a spirited colt with reins and binds a fierce horse with a frayed rope.\" Today, governing the people with lenient punishments is no different than killing them.\n\n○ All know that Guanzi borrowed the ears of the realm, yet none realize that Yao first borrowed the hearts of the people before employing their eyes and ears.\n\n○ Long ago, in the lands between Yan and Zhao, three brothers shared one wife, who bore four children. Later, they disputed in court. Minister Yan Shou memorialized: \"Beasts bear young and follow their mothers; the children should be returned to her, while the three men should be executed in the marketplace.\"\n\n○ Plugging an ant’s hole may stem the flow of a river; securing a chariot’s linchpin may prevent its overturning. Those who establish laws and decrees should likewise grasp the essentials.\n\n○ The *Rites* states: \"For a stepfather, one wears *qicui* mourning.\"\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"A mother who abandons her own father to remarry another man severs ties with her brother’s father more severely than if both had cut off all relations with Heaven.\"\n\n○ Moreover, the *Regulations on Mourning* were likely not composed by Zhou or Kong but fabricated by vulgar scholars after the Qin’s burning of the books.\n\n○ Those who recklessly advance are like eggs hurled at stone; those who flee punishment are like men rushing into a pit.\n\n○ Clamorous as spring blossoms bursting forth, fragrant as autumn orchids flourishing together.\n\n○ A gourd hanging from a tree is not the tree’s fruit; a fur coat worn on the back is not the skin’s own hair—these are resemblances, not realities.\n\n○ The ninth precept speaks of nourishing one’s parents, saying, \"Let them hunger.\" How can one claim they are well-fed if they are often starved? This is surely not filial. A horse fed grain for ten days and starved for one remains robust, with no harm to its well-being—yet one cannot equate this with starving a mother for a single day.\n\n○ At the end of the Han, a man named Guan Qiuyang fled with his younger brother and a companion. When snow fell and their provisions ran out, he said to his brother: \"If we do not eat now, the three of us will die together.\" They killed the companion, obtained food, and reached shelter. Later, an amnesty pardoned their crime.\n\nCould this man be called a virtuous scholar? Kong Wenju said: \"Guan Qiuyang cherished the body bequeathed by his ancestors; eating the companion incurred no blame.\" The Attendant-in-Ordinary Xun countered: \"Qiuyang coveted life—how could killing not be a crime?\" Wenju replied: \"This companion was no sworn friend. Had Guan Zhong eaten Bao Shu or Gong Yu consumed Wang Yang, that would have been impermissible. The one they killed was but a talking beast. Now, if a dog bites a wildcat and the wildcat bites a parrot, what is there to marvel at? In former times, Chong'er clung to the Qi woman and wished to devour Hu Yan; Shu Ao raged at the Chu army and wished to eat Wu Can. Even the wrath of worthies and sages would drive them to consume men—how much more those reduced to extremity?\"\n\n○ Seeing but a single stripe, one does not know the tiger’s full pattern. Daoists mock the Confucians’ restraint; Confucians sneer at the Daoists’ abandon—neither perceives the root. Chasing echoes by sound, pursuing shadows by form, contention and dissipation surge without cease.\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Had Meng Ke and Xun Qing been among Confucius’ disciples, they would not have been mere You and Xia, but rather the likes of Ran Min.\"\n\n○ A pile of firewood stacked like a mountain, set alight at its base—before the flames rise, a single cup of water may yet extinguish them. But when fire rages and wind howls, even pouring forth rivers and seas cannot save it.\n\n○ King Zhao of Qin was the stacked firewood; the First Emperor kindled the blaze; the Second Emperor fanned the gale. The people of Qin regarded the folk of Shandong as a tiger eyes a sheep in the grass—what barrier or fear could there be?\n\n○ Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a man of the Three Hu of Chu. After his role in the destruction of Wu, he boarded a light boat and roamed the Five Lakes. The king had his likeness painted and daily paid homage to it, ranking him among the immortals of Xuren.\n\n○ The ancestors of the Fu clan descended from Fu Yue, minister to Emperor Yao of the Tang.\n\n○ Xuan, styled Xiuyi, and his son Zai, styled Changyu, have biographies in *The History of the Jin*.\n\n○ During the transition from Chu to Han, an enthusiast compiled the *Generational Origins*, tracing from the Yellow Emperor to the end of the Han. Ban Gu’s *History of the Han* was completed thanks to his father’s work.\n\n○ The highest filial piety nourishes the will; the next nourishes the body. To nourish the will is to fulfill harmony; to nourish the body is not to lose reverence. Seizing land for oneself, the world stands in awe; extending one’s heart to others, the world returns to one. Treating others with sincerity, the world trusts one; without sincerity, even wife and children doubt. If wife and children doubt, how can one serve a lord? The noble person cultivates the self; holding office is not for profit or fame, but for benevolence and righteousness.\n\n○ All know to cleanse their vessels, but none think to wash their hearts. The noble person examines the root before studying, clarifies the Way before acting.\n\n○ Some say Xuan Heng rose to prime minister through fine poetry, and Zhang Yu became the emperor’s teacher through eloquent discourse—was this not the glory of Confucian learning?\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Learning brings honor through the Way, not through rank. I observe Ban Gu’s *History of the Han*: in discussing statecraft, he adorns the ruler’s flaws and suppresses loyal ministers; in expounding degenerate teachings, he values conformity and scorns integrity; in addressing current affairs, he refines rhetoric and neglects facts—he is no true historian.\"\n\n○ Mozi’s universal love is the abandonment of kinship; his doctrine of mourning is the forgetting of sorrow.\n\n○ Emperor Taizong of Han abolished mutilating punishments—this was the benevolence of a common man, not the benevolence of the world. To endure maiming another’s body yet endure killing them is what is called the benevolence of a common man.\n\n○ Yi Yin tilled the fields of Youxin—who knew he was not a rustic of Xia? Lü Shang did not treasure incense but fished by the Wei—who knew he was not a fisherman of Yin? Only upon meeting Tang, Wu, and King Wen did their true nature become known.\n\n○ One standing at a forked road fears losing the way; one gazing at a high mountain harbors the ambition to soar to the heavens. Some ride horses or chariots to reach Qin—this is what is meant by differing forms but identical substance.\n\n○ If one claims that boats and machines arose only after the Yellow Emperor, what did Fuxi use to cross the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers? Those who traverse vast seas may pass years without seeing their shores; those who plumb the depths of Yu Yuan may live lifetimes without knowing its bottom—thus the near cannot measure the far.\n\n○ In the Han, linchpin carts were despised; now they are prized.\n\n○ Blue and red are called *wen*; red and white, *zhang*; white and black, *ling*; black and blue, *bi*; the five colors together are called *embroidery*.\n\n○ The First Emperor ordered artisans to install crossbow mechanisms in his tomb—anyone who tunneled in would be shot. He used human fat and fish oil to make candles.\n\n○ A hound chasing a hare spends the whole day tracking it, never losing its scent; though it sees a deer, it has no time to glance.\n\n○ Emperor Gaozu of Han was broad-minded and his governance loose, so later generations valued sincerity and simplicity; Emperor Guangwu of Han was meticulous and his governance tight, so later generations upheld convention and propriety; Cao Cao of Wei valued severity amid chaos, so the world refined laws and prized order.\n\n○ When the body is upright, one does not seek the shadow’s straightness—yet the shadow is straight. When the sound is level, one does not seek the echo’s harmony—yet the echo is harmonious. When virtue is lofty, one does not seek fame’s reach—yet fame spreads far.\n\n○ In the western lands, the Hu say: \"Storax is an animal.\" In China, animal excrement stinks; suddenly hearing that western animal excrement is fragrant, one does not believe it.\n\n○ If one insists on Kunshan jade before carving, then uncut jade will never reveal its night-shining beauty. If one demands southern pearls before valuing them, then the Marquis of Sui’s pearl will never earn its \"bright moon\" renown. The First Emperor’s distant travels along the sea did not spare him the disaster at Pingtai; his burial at Mount Li was soon followed by grave robbers.\n\n○ Now, with lead and tin ore, even if Ou Ye smelts it a hundred times, it will not surpass a clay knife. With a horse of inferior stock, even if Zaofu drives it, it will never match the Flying Hare or the Swift Shadow—its nature is dull and slow. Earth cannot become iron but can become tile.\n\n○ The physiognomist says: \"The three pavilions and nine pulses are determined in a face of one foot; foolishness, wisdom, courage, and timidity are revealed in eyes of one inch.\"\n\nThe celestial granaries and golden treasuries distinguish poverty from wealth, lowliness from nobility.\n\n○ Emperor Guangwu soared like a phoenix over Nanyang, while swallows and sparrows transformed into quails. The ministers of the two Han dynasties shone resplendent as the Three Luminaries adorning the vast sky; the soldiers of Changping stood as numerous as autumn grasses beneath heavy frost—such was the force of circumstance.\n\n○ Some giants stand several *zhang* tall, their bodies spanning nine *mu*, two heads upon separate necks, four arms sharing the same bones. Old men growing horns, men and women transforming—what bearing do these have on wisdom or folly?\n\n○ How could the Supreme Unity’s sovereign sit upon a commoner’s seat, or the majestic deity of the Dipper dwell in a humble woman’s chamber?\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Zhuge Liang was truly a man of extraordinary talent in his time. In governing the state, he had his principles; in commanding the army, he had his methods. Through accumulating merit and advancing his cause, he seized the opportune moment. Entering enemy territory, no blade was left unused; departing, provisions remained in surplus. He knew Shu was inherently weak and precarious, thus he exercised restraint to stabilize it. Jiang Wei, however, sought to swiftly establish his achievements—bold yet reckless.\"\n\n○ Master Ma’s drawloom—Master Ma, named Jun, styled Heng—was the most ingenious craftsman under heaven. The drawloom originally had fifty heddles and fifty treadles, or sixty heddles and sixty treadles. Master Ma reduced it to two treadles, producing intricate patterns and extraordinary variations. Inspired, he created designs that could generate endless yin-yang transformations. The south-pointing chariot is recorded in the *Rites of Zhou* and also appears in the *Guiguzi*. Master Ma refined its mechanism.\n\n○ In governance, nothing corrects position like proper rank; nothing uplifts a state like its people; nothing unifies internal and external affairs like clear divisions; nothing clarifies moral instruction like learning. Grasp the warp, and the weft aligns itself; hold the root, and the branches naturally follow. A wise rewarder, by rewarding one good deed, encourages all good deeds under heaven; a wise punisher, by punishing one evil, eradicates all evil under heaven.\n\n○ In simpler times, officials were few; in refined eras, clerks multiplied. The Youyu dynasty had fifty offices, the Xia a hundred, the Yin two hundred, and the Zhou three hundred. The decline of state canons is like the loss of rank; without rank established, the principles of names and reason collapse.\n\n○ If one selects people by reputation, power shifts downward, and cliques thrive. If one promotes scholars by merit, the virtuous may go unappointed while the mediocre are entrusted with office.\n\n○ The noble person inwardly purifies their heart to receive others with emptiness, while outwardly establishing laws and unchanging principles. Today, people praise antiquity for its many worthies, lamenting the lack of talent in the present age. Yet they do not reflect thrice before speaking of the world—how can this not be delusion?\n\n○ Human nature is like water: placed in a round vessel, it becomes round; placed in a square vessel, it becomes square. When stilled, it clears; when stirred, it muddies. The former kings knew the midstream was easily disturbed, so they guided and instructed, setting fixed laws for those with partial preferences.\n\n○ A dragon boat with its oars aligned—even Wang Liang could not steer it. A team of swift horses moving in unison—even a Yue man dare not rein them. Each has its own ability.\n\n○ Those building a great hall first choose the craftsman, then select the materials; those governing a state first choose their aides, then settle the people.\n\n○ Learning is like thirst driving one to drink from rivers and seas: drinking deeply, one is deeply filled; drinking lightly, one is lightly filled. Observing broadly, one sees broadly; observing narrowly, one sees narrowly.\n\n○ Gold is used for its utility, coin for its light circulation—yet neither can be eaten in famine.\n\n○ Granting official positions in exchange for grain is selling office; allowing criminals to redeem their crimes is indulging evil.\n\n○ When wealth flows through the world, counterfeit coinage is forbidden; when poverty stagnates it, the destruction of coinage is forbidden.\n\n○ No harm befalls the Son of Heaven greater than the adornments of women. A single headpiece may cost a thousand gold, while the garments of maidservants rival the rarest treasures of the four seas.\n\n○ Dukes, ministers, and grandees carve stone into steles and engrave it into tigers. These steles and stone tigers, erected with false grandeur along the three thoroughfares, obstruct merit and corrupt virtue. Heterodoxies arise, the bells of Qin’s downfall are struck, and the licentious music of Zheng and Wei is played—how can governance possibly thrive?\n\n○ Rewards do not avoid the distant and lowly; punishments do not spare the close and noble. The noble have their constant names, which the lowly cannot usurp; the exalted have their fixed positions, which the humble dare not overstep. Weave governance with the warp of Dao and virtue, the weft of benevolence and righteousness, interlacing with ritual and law. Only after completion is it put to use—hence the tribute of Filial and Incorrupt, of Cultivated Talent, where from a thousand *li* away, people gaze in admiration and respond to its reputation. Thus, those who rely on substance gradually diminish, while those who accumulate emptiness grow daily.\n\n○ Hearing one good word or witnessing one good deed, one pursues it fearing they may fall short. Hearing one evil word or witnessing one evil deed, one distances themselves fearing they may not be far enough.\n\n○ A thousand gold hung in the marketplace—no one dares take it, for its portion is fixed. A single coin left on the road—children scramble for it, for its portion is undetermined.\n\n○ The Three Sovereigns valued the Dao and exalted virtue; the Five Emperors prioritized benevolence, then righteousness; the Three Kings prioritized righteousness, then order.\n\n○ A single goose feather sinks in water because it lacks force; a million *jun* of gold floats in a boat because it relies on the boat’s force.\n\n○ Inscribing the Golden Man’s admonition, one composes the *Mouth Inscription*:\nThe spirit communicates through resonance, the heart expresses through the mouth.\nFortune arises with omens, misfortune comes with signs.\nThe mind must not be deceitful, the mouth must not be loquacious.\nAn ant’s hole can breach a river; a trickle can topple a mountain.\nIllness enters through the mouth; calamity emerges from it.\nThe mechanism of survival and ruin, the art of opening and closing—mouth and heart conspire.\nThe source of safety and danger, the trigger of the pivot—honor and disgrace follow.\nWith a public heart, there must be a public Dao.\n\n○ Those who love themselves cannot help but love others; those who hate themselves cannot help but hate others.\n\n○ When the people are wealthy, they settle in their villages and value their homes, respect their superiors, and follow instruction. When impoverished, they endanger their villages and scorn their homes, gathering to defy their rulers. Few are those who, pressed by hunger and cold, do not commit wrongdoing.\n\n○ If I wish to fight but the enemy does not, when I drum and advance, it is like a mountain collapsing or a river flooding. Those in its path are crushed; those struck by its force are shattered. This is what is meant by \"thunder too swift to cover one’s ears\"—who then can resist it?\n\nThe Lord of Wu licked the pus from his soldiers’ wounds, accumulating kindness to move his subordinates. As the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The Lord of Wu sucked their sores; in daytime battles, they saw one another face to face, and in night battles, they heard one another’s voices. When victorious, they shared the spoils; when defeated, they rescued one another.\"\n\nDry-field farming depends on Heaven—though human effort is diligently applied, if floods or droughts come unseasonably, a year’s labor is lost. Wet-field farming is controlled by man; if human effort is properly applied, the land’s potential may be fully realized.\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"The Dao of the sage is like Heaven and Earth; the divergences of the various masters are like the four seasons. Though the four seasons oppose one another, Heaven and Earth harmonize and unite. Moreover, the *Changes* differ in approach—mining gold or carving jade requires enduring hardship. If a road is not perilous, one cannot know the excellence of a horse; if a task is not weighty, one cannot know a man’s talent.\"\n\nWhen gentlemen meet, they do not merely encourage goodness—they also attack evil. If evil is not abolished, goodness cannot arise. To cure heat, nothing compares to drawing near water; to relieve cold, nothing compares to donning thick furs; to silence slander, nothing compares to cultivating oneself. A skilled angler does not change his deep pool to fish; a gentleman does not shift his seat to pursue the Dao.\n\n○ The petty man feels shame if his face does not resemble Zidu’s; the gentleman feels shame if his conduct does not resemble Shun and Yu’s. Thus, the petty man values a clear mirror, while the gentleman esteems profound words.\n\n○ Archery serves to steady the will; charioteering, to harmonize the heart; writing, to record events; calculation, to order complexity.\n\n○ Profit arrives like a sudden gale or a violent downpour—indifferent to right or wrong, heedless of straight or crooked, it seeks only to avoid exhaustion, and in its impetuous release, victory is assured.\n\nTo be discerning is to distinguish—it means skillfully differentiating matters and categories, not merely outstripping others in glib speech.\n\n○ The sage treads upon the loom’s shuttle and grasps its mechanism, comprehending the completion of Heaven and Earth, causing the myriad things to follow their course and human relations to be rectified. Raising a banner upon high makes its signal widely visible; shaking a bell in the wind makes its sound carry far—not because the banner’s colors grow brighter or the bell’s tone lengthens, but because their position is well-chosen. How much more so with the rich and noble issuing decrees!\n\n○ A good farmer does not fret over an unkempt threshing ground but worries over untimely winds and rains; a gentleman does not fret over the failure to establish his virtue but worries over the untimeliness of his era.\n\n○ In the age of the sages, there was no socializing; the Way of Zhou declined, and socializing flourished. In ancient times, associations were close; today, they are distant. In ancient times, associations sought worthies; today, they seek reputation. Appointments bypass the village and clan; conduct is not examined at the inner gate. Those with many supporters are called worthy talents; those with few admirers are deemed unworthy.\n\n○ A horse must be ridden before it can travel far; a physician must be employed before he can cure illness; the worthy must be put to use before they can bring order. *Forest of Meanings*, Scroll Five, ends.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *Yilin* by Dai Shulun, Prefect of Fuzhou**\n\nThe Three Sages transmitted their teachings in succession, and the *Great Change* shone forth in brilliance. Thus, the work of Heaven and Earth was established, and the labor of classics and commentaries arose, assisting in the perfection of singular virtue—this is called the Six Arts.\n\nWhen the Han inherited the legacy of Qin, the Dao was just beginning to flourish. Offices for lecture, study, instruction, and transmission were established to clarify the proper relations between ruler and minister, father and son. Though rites and music were incomplete, this was sufficient to renew the great principles of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness.\n\nAs for the writings of Zengzi, Confucius, Xunzi, and Mencius, they number in the hundreds and thousands, all unfolding subtleties, aiding the cultivation of customs, venerating the Dao of the Ru, upholding the law and rectifying names, deploying strategies and establishing authority, adapting to essentials, exalting frugality while maintaining distinctions, aligning with agriculture to achieve order, and proceeding laterally without straying. Yet minor works, though freed from rigidity, vary greatly in length, and few are complete in the collections of scholar-officials.\n\nDuring the Liang Dynasty, Yu Zhongrong of Yingchuan abridged their essentials into a compendium of thirty juan, intending to broaden the search for diverse teachings. However, the foundation of their doctrines was not always pursued in full.\n\nMa Zong of Fufeng, a Judicial Reviewer of the Court of Judicial Review, possessed a family collection of histories and philosophers from his youth. He gathered and recorded them, delving into their purport, certain that their meaning must have a destination. Thus, he expanded and refined Yu’s work, carefully selecting from earlier models, and distilled it into three scrolls, entitled *Yilin*. Its purpose is threefold: above, to guard against the loss of teaching; in the middle, to supplement omissions in comparative matters; and below, to aid in the composition of writings. It embodies the essentials of clarity, breadth, purity, and reliability, while avoiding the pitfalls of obscurity, waywardness, rigidity, pedantry, entanglement, obstruction, perversity, and dissipation.\n\nA gentleman has said: *\"That which is valued for its brevity—does this not describe it?\"*",

      "translated_text": "I, a longtime friend of Yuanhui, have thus composed this preface to record these matters. The twenty-first day of the fifth month in the second year of the Zhenyuan era.\n\nThe tradition of *zishu* (philosophical texts) began with Lü’s *Six Strategies* and flourished during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. At that time, the Daoist teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi arose, their achievements encompassing heaven and earth, their illumination rivaling the sun and moon. They loftily regarded the Six Classics as models for the world, and thus their words were beyond mere praise. Mo Di, a sage of great virtue, expounded doctrines of refined frugality, his teachings enduring for later generations, his renown second only to that of Confucius. The discourses of Guan [Zhong], Yan [Ying], Wen [Zhongzi], and Xun [Kuang] were grand and unbridled; the *Honglie* of Huainan was resplendent in its literary elegance—all these works, numbering tens of thousands of words, may be called abundant indeed. Yet their divisions and volumes were vast and sprawling, making them difficult to peruse.\n\nDuring the Liang dynasty, Yu Zhongrong compiled an abridgment in three scrolls, sifting away the sand and winnowing the chaff, yet still, orchids and irises were mingled with mugwort and wormwood, and jade ornaments lay concealed within uncut stones. Ma Zong of Fufeng, with his refined devotion to earlier records and pursuit of concision, further distilled Yu Zhongrong’s abridgment, preserving its essence in six scrolls, which he titled *Yilin*. In it, the dregs of the sages and worthies are entirely discarded, while the essential brilliance of the broader tradition is wholly preserved—truly a masterful work.\n\nDuring the Sui dynasty, Li Wenbo of Boling compiled the *Lidao Collection* in ten scrolls, gathering excerpts from the various philosophers. Yu Shinan, Duke of Yongxing, also drew from earlier histories to compose the *Imperial Survey* in five scrolls. During the reign of Empress Wu, the minister Zhu Yizu further wrote the *Treatise on the Rise and Fall of Ten Dynasties* in one scroll. Together with the *Yilin* of Fufeng, those who have exhaustively explored the broad outlines of *zishu* and histories number four in all.\n\nWhile adrift in a small boat on the Tu River, detained in Luling, I heard from Fufeng [Ma Zong] of his fundamental aims. He said that in his compilation, he first prioritized matters of statecraft and governance, then preserved the intentions of the original authors, ensuring no chapter or title was lost, as though meeting the ancients face to face. I admired Ma’s work—its brevity of language and depth of meaning—truly one might carry the wisdom of a hundred schools in one’s sleeve or grasp a thousand scrolls in the palm of one’s hand. How far-reaching was his intent!\n\nTo commend his admirable achievement, I have set this account at the beginning, that it may be transmitted to those who cherish such endeavors. On the last day of summer in the *dingmao* year of the Zhenyuan era, Wen Fei of Yinghe, styled Boliu, Bosun, has recorded this anew.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n**Scroll One**",

      "translated_text": "**The *Records of Arts and Letters*** states: Master Xiong composed twenty-two *pian*, but today only one *juan* containing six *pian* remains.\n\nTo issue policies and decrees that bring blessings to all under heaven is called the Dao. When superiors and subordinates are harmoniously affectionate, it is called harmony. To obtain without seeking is called trust. To eliminate harm from the world is called benevolence. One who is trustworthy and harmonious possesses the capacity of an emperor or king.\n\nWhen a sagely king holds the throne, even if there is one scholar within a hundred *li*, it is as if there were none. When the kingly Way declines, one scholar within a thousand *li* is like standing shoulder to shoulder.\n\nTo know the good yet not trust it is called madness. To know evil yet not correct it is called delusion.\n\n○ Formerly, King Wen saw Master Zhai, who was ninety years old. King Wen exclaimed: \"Alas! You are aged!\" Master Zhai replied: \"If you sent me to hunt tigers or chase deer, I would indeed be old. But if I were to sit and plan state affairs, my years would still be few.\"\n\n**The Golden Casket of Tai Gong** – *Two Scrolls*\n\nKing Wu asked Tai Gong: \"The Yin dynasty has already lost three of its men. May we now attack it?\" Tai Gong replied: \"I have heard that one who understands Heaven does not resent it, and one who understands himself does not resent others. Those who plan before acting prosper; those who act before planning perish. To refuse what Heaven offers is to invite blame; to fail to act when the time is right is to invite disaster. To achieve success at the wrong time is to attain it recklessly. Thus, summer branches may be tied in knots, and winter ice may be melted—opportunity is hard to gain but easy to lose.\"\n\n○ After King Wu pacified Yin and returned, he asked Tai Gong: \"Now the people and officials are unsettled, and the worthy are not yet secure. What should be done?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Do not alter the old without cause, nor introduce the new rashly—be like Heaven and Earth. Share the wealth of Yin with its people, so that merchants gain their profits and farmers their fields. To see with one eye is not clarity; to hear with one ear is not acuity; to walk with one foot is not mobility. Select the worthy to replace yourself, so that superiors and subordinates each find their proper place.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked: \"May I hear the admonitions of the Five Emperors?\" Tai Gong replied: \"The Yellow Emperor said: 'I stand above the people, trembling, fearing I may not last from evening to morning.' Thus, the golden man seals his mouth thrice—be cautious in speech. Yao stood above the people, quaking as if on the edge of an abyss. Shun stood above the people, vigilant as if treading thin ice. Yu stood above the people, trembling as if fearing insufficiency. Tang stood above the people, reverent and fearful, daring not to rest. The Dao arises from the subtle, and calamity forms from the subtle. Be prudent from beginning to end, and your integrity will be like a fortress of metal.\"\n\n○ \"Act only after considering rectitude; do not harbor hopes of luck in your sandals. Endure but a moment, and you preserve your body from the blade. Though the knife gleams coldly, do not let it open for you. Though the spring flows smoothly, it will dry up in prolonged drought. Govern affairs with constancy; levy taxes with moderation, like drawing water from a well.\"\n\n**The Six Strategies of Tai Gong** – *Six Scrolls*\n\nTo have the reputation of seeking the worthy but no reality of employing them...\n\n○ King Wen said: \"A ruler strives to employ the worthy but fails to achieve success. Why?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Employing the worthy is not easy.\" King Wen asked: \"How should one employ the worthy?\" Tai Gong said: \"Examine their virtue, scrutinize their reputation, select their talents, and test their abilities—thus matching name with reality. A trickle unchecked becomes a river; two leaves unremoved will require an axe. A spark unquenched will grow into a raging fire—what then can be done?\"\n\nKing Wen asked: \"Why do rulers lose the people?\" Tai Gong replied: \"They are not cautious in their associations. A ruler has six virtues to uphold and three treasures to preserve. The six virtues are benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, courage, and strategy. The three treasures are agriculture, craftsmanship, and commerce. When the six virtues are cultivated, the ruler is secure; when the three treasures are intact, the state prospers. If the ruler’s authority is lent to others, he loses his majesty. Deep and boundless, who knows its source? The world is not the possession of one man—it is the world’s world. To seize the world is like chasing a wild deer, and all under heaven share in dividing its flesh.\"\n\n○ Tai Gong said: \"Fu Xi and Shen Nong taught but did not punish; the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun punished but did not pardon.\"\n\n○ The sage reveres Heaven, calms Earth, harmonizes people, and respects spirits.\n\n○ When King Wen was in Qi, he summoned Tai Gong and said: \"My land is small. What should I do?\" Tai Gong replied: \"Where there is grain in the world, the worthy eat it; where there are people in the world, the worthy govern them. To humble one man is to exalt ten thousand—only the sage can do this.\"\n\n○ \"Though a hat be worn-out, it is still placed on the head; though shoes be new, they are still trodden upon the ground.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked Tai Gong: \"Are there distinctions in the ranks of officers?\" Tai Gong replied: \"There are nine grades of men. One who speaks ill and is hated by all, yet rises early and retires late, is a leader of wives and children. One who understands hunger and thirst, and adapts to hardship and ease, is a leader of ten thousand. One who trembles with caution, saying, 'Be prudent for a day,' is a leader of a hundred thousand. One who knows the heavens, comprehends the earth, and governs the four seas as if they were his family is the lord of all under heaven. In military affairs, he does not await the ruler’s command.\"\n\n○ King Wu asked Tai Gong: \"I wish my three armies to love their general as parents, to vie in scaling walls when attacking cities, to vie in advancing when fighting in the field, to rage at the sound of gongs, and to rejoice at the sound of drums. Is this possible?\" Tai Gong replied: \"A general in winter does not wear furs, in summer does not hold a fan, and in rain does not raise a canopy. When the roads are muddy and cold, he dismounts first to walk. Before the army lights its fires, he does not eat. Soldiers do not delight in death or injury—their general knows their hunger, cold, and toil. The harm of warfare is extreme. To raise an army is like startling a beast; to employ it is like madness.

At thirty or forty, if one has no skill, then one truly has no skill. By fifty, if one has not become known for goodness, then one will have no renown.'\n\nWhen a coarse man and a coarse woman meet in the shadow of a wall, it may seem secret, but by the next day, someone may know of it. Thus it is said: in holding to benevolence and righteousness, none remain unaware.\n\n○ The bluegreen leek grows amid hemp and stands straight without support; white sand mixed with black dye becomes black with it. When the noble person wanders, it is as if entering a chamber of orchids and angelica—though long within, one no longer perceives their fragrance, for one has been transformed by them. When the petty person wanders, it is as if entering a chamber of salted fish—though long within, one no longer perceives the stench, for one has been transformed by it. Thus the noble person is cautious in his associations.\n\n○ To associate with the noble person is like lengthening the day—one gains without realizing it. To associate with the petty person is like treading on thin ice—how long before one falls through?\n\n○ If heaven were round and earth square, their four corners would not align. I have heard the Master say: the Way of Heaven is called round; the Way of Earth is called square.\n\n**The Book of Master Yan – Eight Scrolls**\n\nDuke Jing built a terrace, and upon its completion wished to cast a bell. Yanzi remonstrated: 'To levy taxes on the people to make a bell will bring them sorrow. To levy sorrow for amusement is inauspicious.'\n\n○ When Duke Jing’s favorite concubine, named Yingzi, died, the Duke mourned her for three days without eating, his flesh clinging to the mat and refusing to leave. Yanzi said: 'There are skilled physicians outside who can perform rites for the spirits.' The Duke believed him and withdrew to bathe. Yanzi then ordered a coffin brought in to enshroud the dead. The Duke grew furious, but Yanzi said: 'The dead do not return to life.' The Duke ceased his mourning.\n\nConfucius heard of this and said: 'The brightness of stars cannot compare to the radiance of the sun and moon.'\n\n○ During Duke Jing’s reign, snow fell for three days. Wearing a white fox-fur robe, he sat by the hall’s side and asked Yanzi: 'Though it has snowed for three days, why is the world not cold?' Yanzi replied: 'A worthy ruler, when sated, knows the people’s hunger; when warm, knows their cold.' The Duke then removed his robe and crown, sufficient to show reverence. Without adornment, his clothes were enough to cover his form. Without embellishment, earthworks were left uncarved, and woodwork unengraved—enough to instruct the people.\n\n○ Duke Jing said: 'I wish to become hegemon over the feudal lords. How may this be done?' Yanzi replied: 'The officials are not yet complete. I have heard that when Confucius dwelt in a humble lane, if his integrity faltered, Yuan Xian attended him; if his will was obstructed, Zilu attended him; if his virtue was not humbled, Yan Hui attended him. Now Your Lordship has no such attendants—thus the officials are not yet complete.'\n\n○ The ruler selects his ministers and employs them; though a minister may be lowly, he too selects his ruler to serve.\n\n○ One mind can serve a hundred rulers, but a hundred minds cannot serve one ruler. In serving the mighty, one cannot exceed them; in ritual, the mighty despise excess.\n\n○ After Yanzi governed the district of A for three years, slanderous reports spread throughout the state. Duke Jing summoned him and questioned him. Yanzi replied: 'I promoted frugality and punished indolence, and the lazy resented me; I did not fear the powerful in settling lawsuits, and the powerful resented me. These two evils slandered me within, while two flatterers drove me out. I beg to change my course and govern for three more years—then I shall surely earn praise.'\n\nDuke Jing suffered from edema for several days. He dreamed of struggling with two suns and failing to prevail. He summoned a dream-interpreter to divine it. When the interpreter arrived at the gate, Yanzi instructed him to say: 'Your Lordship’s illness is yin. The two suns are yang. Not prevailing means the illness will soon recede.' Three days later, the Duke recovered and rewarded the dream-interpreter. The interpreter declined, saying: 'It was Yanzi’s doing.' The Duke questioned Yanzi, who replied: 'Had I spoken myself, you would not have believed me.'\n\n○ Duke Jing suffered from an abscess on his back and could not see it. He asked Guozi, who said: 'It burns like fire, its color like the sun, and its size like an unripe plum.' The Duke then asked Yanzi, who said: 'Its color is like dark jade, and its size like a disc.' The Duke said: 'Without seeing a gentleman, one does not know the clumsiness of a rustic.'\n\n○ When Yanzi was sent as an envoy to Chu, the Chu king ordered his attendants to bind a man and pass him off as a thief. The king asked: 'Where is he from?' The man replied: 'From Qi.' The king looked at Yanzi and said: 'Are the people of Qi skilled at thievery?' Yanzi replied: 'Oranges grown south of the Jiang become trifoliate oranges when planted north of it—this is the work of the soil. Now, people born and raised in Qi do not steal, but upon entering Chu, they do. I do not know why.' The Chu king had only brought disgrace upon himself.\n\n○ When Yanzi was sent to Chu, the Chu king, considering him short, had a small gate made beside the main gate. Yanzi said: 'When one goes to a land of dogs, one enters through the dog gate. Now, as an envoy to Chu, I cannot enter through the dog gate.' He then entered through the main gate.\n\n○ The Chu king asked: 'Is the capital of Linzi in Qi truly devoid of people?' Yanzi replied: 'Linzi has three hundred wards. When sleeves are raised, they form a canopy; when sweat is wiped away, it becomes rain. Shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel—how could there be no people?'\n\n○ As Master Zeng was about to depart, Yanzi saw him off and said: 'To give a man wealth is not as good as giving him words.'\n\n○ The jade of He Shi was but uncut stone from a wellside—when a skilled craftsman refined it, it became a national treasure. Habits and customs transform one’s nature—can one not be cautious?\n\nSeventeen years after Yanzi’s death, Duke Jing enfeoffed the feudal lords, and all the ministers praised him. The Duke said: 'Since Yanzi’s death, I have not heard of any wrongdoing.' Xian Zhang replied: 'When the ruler favors something, his ministers follow it; when the ruler craves something, his ministers consume it.'\"",

A sage may please others, but he cannot make them necessarily pleased.\n\n○ When the state follows the Dao, one leads with righteousness; when it does not, one leads righteousness with oneself—such was Xun Xi.\n\n○ Words are trustworthy when trust precedes speech. Commands transform when transformation lies beyond the command. When a sage is above, his influence subtly shifts the world.\n\n○ Crafting a cart all year long without a single person to transport it renders it unrideable.\n\n○ A hundred minds cannot secure even one person; a single mind can secure a hundred.\n\n○ The ruler is the root; ministers are the branches and leaves. When the root flourishes, the leaves thrive; when the root withers, the leaves fall.\n\nA noble person does not fault others for what they can do, nor shame them for what they cannot. The petty man drowns in water; the noble man drowns in his own words.\n\n○ One overly devoted to pleasure is weighed down by sorrow; one deeply committed to righteousness is light in conduct.\n\nWhen encountering one’s elders and failing to humble one’s demeanor, or facing the esteemed and failing to refine one’s words—even in wind and rain, I would not enter such a person’s gate.\n\nThe noble person guides ears and eyes with the heart; the petty man guides the heart with ears and eyes.\n\n*Fourteen Chapters of Mencius*\nZhao Taiqing of Shu Commandery composed the *Chapter and Verse*, stating that *chapter and verse* refers to pointing out matters. ○\n\nMencius said to King Hui: \"Oppressive governance kills people—how is it different from a blade?\"\n\nWhen the kitchen has fat meat and the stables fat horses, yet the people bear hungry faces and the wilds starving corpses—this is leading beasts to devour men. People detest it, so how much worse is oppressive governance?\n\nRespect the elderly, cherish the young, and extend your heart to the people—then the world will turn in the palm of your hand.\n\nThus, extending kindness suffices to protect the four seas; failing to extend kindness cannot even protect one’s wife and children.\n\nThough one may possess wisdom, it is not as good as seizing the moment; though one may have an iron plowshare, it is not as good as awaiting the proper season.\n\nMencius said: \"The people of Qi mocked Guan Zhong and Yanzi, saying, 'The hungry are easily fed; the thirsty are easily quenched.' If one has long suffered in hardship, then reforming governance is like the parched who drink without choosing.\"\n\n○ A man of Song, distressed that his seedlings were not growing, pulled them up to make them taller. His son hurried to see them, only to find the seedlings withered. Not only was this of no benefit—it caused harm.\n\n○ Seeing a child fall into a well, even those who are not the child’s parents feel a heart of compassion. Without a heart of compassion, one is not human; without a sense of shame and aversion, one is not human; without a heart of deference, one is not human; without a sense of right and wrong, one is not human.\n\n○ Mencius said: \"Zilu, when informed of his faults, rejoiced. Yu, upon hearing good words, bowed. Using the Xia to transform the Yi is heard of; using the Yi to transform the Xia is not.\"\n\n○ One who bends oneself cannot straighten others. One must use uprightness to correct crookedness—how can one who is bent oneself set others right?\n\nJing Chun said: \"Are Gongsun Yan and Zhang Yi not true great men? When they rage, the feudal lords tremble; when they rest, the world is at peace.\"\n\nMencius replied: \"How can they be called great men? To be unmoved by wealth and honor, unshaken by poverty and lowliness, and unbending before power and force—this is what makes a great man.\"\n\n○ If the Son of Heaven lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve the four seas; if a feudal lord lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve his altars of soil and grain; if a scholar lacks benevolence, he cannot preserve his four limbs.\n\nNow, to detest death yet delight in lacking benevolence is like detesting drunkenness yet forcing oneself to drink. The people’s turn to benevolence is like water flowing downward.\n\nNothing in a person is better than the pupils of the eyes. The pupils cannot conceal one’s evil. When the heart is upright, the pupils are clear; when the heart is not upright, the pupils are dull.\n\n○ Chunyu Kun said: \"Men and women do not hand things to each other directly—what if a sister-in-law is drowning and one must grasp her hand?\"\n\nMencius replied: \"If one does not grasp her hand, one is a wolf. When the world is drowning, one rescues it with the Dao; when a sister-in-law is drowning, one must grasp her hand.\"\n\n○ When Zichan used his carriage to ferry people across the Feng and Wei rivers, Mencius heard of it and said: \"He does not understand governance—it would be better to repair bridges and roads in due time.\"\n\nA good man went out and left wine and meat. A man of Qi had one wife and one concubine. When their husband went out, he would eat his fill, then return and deceive his wife, saying, \"I dined with the rich and noble.\" Later, the wife spied on him and saw him begging for leftover food from sacrifices. The wife then told the concubine, and they wept together in the courtyard. When the husband returned, unaware of what had transpired, he still boasted to his wife and concubine—just like a noble person who bends the Dao to gain wealth and honor and then boasts to others. (The \"good man\" here refers to the husband.)\n\n○ Yi Yin would not give even a mustard seed to others, nor would he take even a mustard seed from them.\n\n○ One who does not follow the Dao is called a \"wilderness minister\" when in the wilds and a \"marketplace minister\" when in the state. Human nature is like rushing water—channel it east, and it flows east; channel it west, and it flows west.\n\n○ A white feather is white and light by nature; white snow is white and melting by nature; white jade is white and steadfast by nature. Though all are white, their natures differ.\n\n○ In winter, one drinks hot water; in summer, one drinks cold water—those who inquire about cold and heat do so from the heart.\n\n○ Benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust; delighting in goodness without weariness—these are the heavenly nobility. Dukes, ministers, and great officials are the human nobility.\n\nThe ancients cultivated heavenly nobility, and human nobility followed. Today, people cultivate heavenly nobility to seek human nobility; once they obtain human nobility, they abandon heavenly nobility—ultimately, they will lose everything.\n\n○ Mencius said: \"Benevolence triumphs over lack of benevolence as water extinguishes fire. Yet those who act today are like using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood—when it does not go out, they say water cannot extinguish fire. This is even more extreme in its lack of benevolence and will ultimately lead to ruin.\"\n\n○ The noble person has three joys: first, that both parents are alive; second, that looking up, one feels no shame before Heaven, and looking down, one feels no disgrace before others; third, to obtain the world’s finest talents and educate them.",

Kindness multiplies pardons, first making things easy, then difficult; law allows no pardons, first making things difficult, then easy.\n\n○ The hall’s upper floor is as distant as a hundred *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for ten days. The hall’s lower floor is as distant as a thousand *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for a month. The palace gate is as distant as ten thousand *li*—if something occurs, the lord remains unaware for a year.\n\n○ Duke Huan said to Guan Zhong: “I have three great faults. I love the hunt—sometimes I chase game into the night and do not return: this is my first fault. I love wine—day and night I drink without cease, and my conduct grows debased: this is my second fault. I love women—even my unmarried sisters and aunts: this is my third fault.”\nGuan Zhong replied: “These are indeed faults, but they are not urgent. For a ruler, only lack of love and lack of acuity are impermissible. Without love, he loses the people; without acuity, he cannot attend to affairs.”\n\n○ The waters of Qi are swift and then recede, so its people are greedy yet brave. The waters of Chu are deep and clear, so its people are light-minded yet resolute and fond of levies. The waters of Yue are turbid and heavy, so its people are hasty and unyielding. The waters of Qin are rushing and stagnant, so its people are avaricious and cruel. The waters of Jin are sluggish and mixed, so its people are fond of deceit. The waters of Song are strong and clear, so its people are simple and easygoing.\n\n○ Where there are regulations of law and measure, craft and deceit cannot prevail. Where there are scales and balances, cheating with weight and lightness cannot succeed. When the former kings governed the state, might was not applied in two directions, and governance did not issue from two sources. Even in matters of a hand’s span, discrepancies in length could not be tolerated.\n\n○ Duke Huan asked his stablemaster what task was most difficult. Before the master could answer, Guan Zhong said: “I once worked as a groom, and the hardest part was fitting the horses to the stable racks.

      "translated_text": "○ In winter, one says, \"Do not wash,\" not out of love for water; in summer, one says, \"Do not warm by the fire,\" not out of love for fire—it is for the sake of what suits the body. The enlightened king does not adorn his palaces, not out of stinginess with small things, but for the sake of fundamentals.\n\nThe King of Chu favored slender waists, and his beauties reduced their food; King Wu of Zhou favored swords, and his warriors held life lightly. Thus, if the ruler delights in grand palaces, craftsmen grow cunning; if the ruler delights in fine embroidery, weavers grow extravagant. Where profit lies, even a mountain of a thousand *ren* will be scaled without hesitation, and the depths of a deep spring will be plumbed without restraint.\n\nMerchants travel far, doubling their pace and pressing on through night and day, counting a thousand *li* as nothing—profit lies ahead. Fishermen enter the sea, braving waves of a hundred *ren* and battling the current, never leaving day or night—profit lies in the waters.\n\n○ The flood dragon gains its divine power from water; the ruler gains his majesty from the people. The sea does not refuse water, and so becomes vast; the mountain does not refuse earth, and so becomes high; the ruler does not reject people, and so his following grows; the scholar does not reject learning, and so attains sagehood.\n\nA mob gathered in haste may at first show fear, but later they will turn on one another—even if good, they do not remain close.\n\n○ The power over life and death does not rest with the ruler but lies with those beneath the grass.\n\n○ The five grains are the people’s lifeline; yellow gold and sharp blades are the people’s means of exchange. Farmers have their constant work, and women have their constant tasks. If one farmer does not plow, there will be those who go hungry; if one woman does not weave, there will be those who suffer cold.\n\n○ Duke Huan said to Guan Zhong: \"I wish to attack Chu.

Store five times the usual grain, and when Chu has ample coin but no grain, close the passes—then four out of ten in Chu will surrender.\n\n○ Land vast yet untilled is not one’s true land; ministers noble yet unbenevolent are not one’s true ministers; people numerous yet estranged are not one’s true people.\n\nWhat flies without wings is sound; what endures without roots is caution. Simply guard your reputation.\n\n*Dao and Virtue, Two Scrolls*\n\nTo give birth yet not possess, to act yet not rely. The primordial qi generates the myriad things yet does not possess them; the Dao bestows yet seeks no recompense.\n\nBlunt its sharpness, untangle its knots.\nSharpness is advancement. When human desire turns keen, advance with caution. Fame and achievement should be tempered by restraint—this is the Dao’s way of remaining unseen.\nKnots are entangled resentments. One must contemplate the supreme Dao to dissolve them.\n\nHarmonize its light. Though possessing unique insight, one should appear dim and not dazzle others.\nBlend with its dust. One should share in the common grime and not set oneself apart.\n\nMuch speech leads to frequent trouble; opening the mouth and raising the tongue invites disaster. Better to guard the center—nurture the spirit within, cherish qi, and speak sparingly.\n\nThe sage places himself last yet finds himself first; putting others before oneself, he becomes foremost in the world, for he holds office and leads.\nHe sets himself aside yet his person endures. By humbling himself and exalting others, he is cherished like parents, protected by spirits like an infant—thus his person long abides.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Cravings harm the spirit; wealth burdens the body.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall. The wealthy should relieve the poor; the noble should pity the lowly. If instead they grow haughty and indulgent, calamity will surely follow.\n\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness—this is the transformation of virtue, the return to purity.\nAbandon craftiness, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will vanish. When those above govern with impartiality, those below will harbor no private malice.\n\nTo bend is to be whole. To yield is to follow the multitude; not asserting oneself is to remain whole.\nTo twist is to straighten. By humbling oneself to exalt others, one will eventually find true straightness.\nTo have little is to gain, for the Way of Heaven aids the humble—those who humble themselves receive much.\nTo have much is to be deluded. Excessive wealth deludes one in guarding the self; excessive learning deludes one in what one hears.\n\nThe good deed leaves no track. One who practices the Dao seeks it within, not stepping beyond the hall or crossing the gate—thus no tracks remain.\nThe good word bears no flaw. By choosing words carefully, one avoids fault.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich. Knowing contentment ensures the long preservation of rank and emolument—thus one is rich.\nOne who dies yet does not perish enjoys longevity. By not gazing recklessly, not listening recklessly, not speaking recklessly, one incurs no resentment under Heaven—thus one attains long life.\n\nTo contract it, first expand it—open it wide to let excess and indulgence reach their peak.\nTo weaken it, first strengthen it—fortify it first to invite harm.\nTo abolish it, first exalt it—raise it first to invite arrogance and peril.\nTo seize it, first give it—bestow it first to satiate its greed.\nThis is called subtle illumination. These four principles reveal the Dao’s subtle yet manifest efficacy.\n\nWhen people act without goodness, how can they be cast aside? One should subdue them with the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—virtue’s transformation was profound.\nThus the Son of Heaven was established, and the Three Dukes were appointed to transform those who lacked goodness.\n\nRepay resentment with virtue. Cultivate the Dao and practice goodness to sever misfortune before it arises.\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy. Address difficult matters early, seeking resolution in their time.\n\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue arises; when the Dao declines, virtue emerges.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises; when virtue declines, benevolent love appears.\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises. When righteousness declines, ritual is enacted—exchanges of jade and silk.\nYet ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the abandonment of roots for branches, the daily erosion of loyalty and trust.\nAnd it is the harbinger of chaos. Ritual values ornament over substance, so rectitude wanes daily while perversity and disorder grow.\n\nThe noble must take the humble as its foundation. To attain true honor, one must take the lowly as one’s root—Yu and Ji tilled the fields themselves, Shun made pottery by the riverbank, and the Duke of Zhou descended to thatched cottages.\nThe high must take the low as its base. To stand tall, one must first lay a low foundation. Like building a wall, one rises from the humble to the lofty; if the base is not firm, the height will surely topple.\n\nThe superior scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it; the middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt; the inferior scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs heartily at it. If it is not laughed at, it is not the Dao. It is not worthy of being called the Dao unless it is ridiculed by the inferior scholar.\n\nThe Dao’s illumination appears dim. One who embodies the Dao seems obscure, as if seeing nothing.\nAdvancing the Dao appears as retreat. One who pursues the Dao seems to lag behind.\nThe level Dao appears uneven. The great Dao’s person does not set himself apart but blends like the multitude.\n\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley—like a deep gorge, untainted by disgrace.\nVast virtue appears insufficient. One of great virtue seems dull and lacking.\nGreat rectitude has no corners. One of perfect integrity shows no sharp edges.\nGreat vessels are late in completion. A masterwork, like fine jade, cannot be hastily finished.\nGreat sound is scarcely heard—like thunder and lightning, waiting for the right moment to strike, thus one should cherish qi and speak sparingly.\nThe great image has no form. The great exemplar of the Dao is unadorned and without pretense.\n\nSome things, when diminished, are increased—taking nothing, yielding generously, one gains distance.\nOthers, when increased, are diminished. Excessive accumulation leads to collapse; greed for emolument invites disaster.\n\nWhich is dearer, fame or the self? When fame is achieved, one should withdraw.\nWhich is greater, the self or wealth? Excessive wealth harms the self.\nWhich is more harmful, gain or loss? Fondness for profit brings affliction to one’s conduct.",

When power is firm, the chariot is steady; when authority is settled, the whip is strong; when ministers are obedient, the horses are tame; when the people are harmonious, the wheels turn smoothly. Those who govern a state and lose these will surely overturn their chariot and run wild with their horses, break their whip and shatter their wheels. Once the whip is broken, the wheels shattered, the horses bolt, and the chariot overturns, the passenger will also be thrown.\n\n---\n\nWithout forethought, one cannot respond to sudden events; without prepared troops, one cannot face the enemy. The Yellow Emperor’s army, with its thousand-mile temple councils and tented strategies, won every battle. In years of famine and disaster, when a father dies in the house and a son at the door, yet they bear no grudge—it is because they have nothing to cling to. When crossing the sea in the same boat and caught in a storm midstream, all work together to save the vessel, for their peril is shared. In a hunt with spread nets, the calls and responses never falter, for their gain is the same. Thus, when the body is sick, the mouth cannot help but spit; when the heart is joyful, the face cannot help but smile.\n\n---\n\nSeeing for oneself brings clarity; relying on others’ sight brings darkness. Hearing for oneself brings sharpness; relying on others’ hearing brings deafness. A single careless word cannot be retrieved even by a team of four horses; a single urgent word cannot be caught even by a team of four horses.\n\n---\n\nThe enlightened lord governs the people as one drives a carriage—racing without reins, treading on ice with a burden.\n\n---\n\nRewarding in delight without regard for merit; punishing in anger without regard for guilt.\n\n---\n\nLoyalty wanes with official success; filial piety fades with wife and children.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Fan Li* in twelve scrolls, all concerning yin-yang and calendrical calculations.\n\nJi Ran was a man of Caiqiu, a servant of the upper class, surnamed Xin and named Wenzi. His ancestors were princes of the state of Jin. In appearance, he seemed unremarkable, yet from youth he was perceptive, studying yin-yang and discerning the subtle to know the manifest. His conduct was vast, his aspirations boundless. Unwilling to reveal himself to the feudal lords, he secretly assessed what would benefit the seven states, yet none in the world knew of him. Thus, he was called Ji Ran. At times, he roamed the seas and marshes, styling himself the Fisherman.\n\nFan Li sought an audience with the King of Yue. Ji Ran said: “The King of Yue has the beak of a crow—he cannot share profit.”\n\n---\n\nTo cover one’s eyes and distinguish black from white, though one may occasionally guess correctly, is still to be ignorant of the Way of Heaven. Discussing yin and yang, one may sometimes err yet still be right.\n\nFan Li asked: “What use is the Nine Palaces?”\nJi Ran replied: “The Way of yin and yang is not confined to a single thing.”\n\n---\n\nThe sage’s adaptability is like water following form—when the form is level, it is level; when the form is perilous, it is perilous.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Hu Feizi* in one scroll.\n\nBearing a long sword and charging into thickets, cleaving rhinoceroses and leopards, wrestling bears—this is the bravery of the common hunter. Bearing a long sword and plunging into deep springs, slaying jiao-dragons and grappling lightning-dragons—this is the bravery of the fisherman. Standing perilously atop a high mound, gazing in all four directions without a change in countenance—this is the bravery of the potter’s urn. Striking without fail, gazing with intent to kill—this is the bravery of the five punishments.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi regarded Lu as his southern border. The Duke of Lu, distressed, went three days without eating. Cao Mo offered to slit his throat and spatter the duke with blood. The duke, terrified, knew not what to do. Guan Zhong then urged him to make an alliance. Cao Mo, a commoner in plain cloth shoes, in a single outburst repelled the army of a ten-thousand-chariot state and preserved a thousand-chariot state—this is the bravery of the noble man.\n\n---\n\n*The Writings of Mozi* in sixteen scrolls.\n\nThe noble man makes things difficult for himself and easy for others; the common man makes things easy for himself and difficult for others.\n\n---\n\nThe divine tortoise is scorched first; the sacred serpent is exposed first.\n\n---\n\nThough the noble man has learning, conduct is the foundation. Though battle has formations, courage is the foundation. Though mourning has rites, grief is the foundation.\n\n---\n\nMozi, seeing dyed silk, sighed and said: “Dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow. It is not only silk that is thus—people are also subject to influence. Shun was influenced by Xu You; Jie by Zixin; Zhou by Chong Hou.”\n\n---\n\nThe sage makes boats and carts sturdy and light, so they can bear heavy loads and travel far.\n\n---\n\nA son who loves only himself and not his father seeks to harm his father for his own gain; a younger brother who loves only himself and not his elder brother seeks to harm his elder brother for his own gain—this is not universal love. A thief loves his own house and not another’s, so he steals from another’s house to benefit his own—yet he too can practice universal love.\n\n---\n\nThe method of moderated burials: three layers of clothing are enough to rot the flesh; a three-inch coffin is enough to rot the bones. Depth reaches the springs.\n\n---\n\nFeudal lords must not govern arbitrarily—they are governed by the Three Dukes. The Three Dukes must not govern arbitrarily—they are governed by the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven must not govern arbitrarily—he is governed by the world.\n\n---\n\nSevering a finger to preserve the arm benefits the body.\n\n---\n\nThe noble man is like a bell: struck, it rings; left unstruck, it remains silent. A beautiful woman who stays hidden is sought after; one who parades herself in the streets is left unmarriageable.\n\n---\n\nMozi urged his disciples to study, saying: “Study quickly, and I will recommend you for office.” After a year of study, a disciple approached Mozi. Mozi asked: “Have you heard of the man of Lu? He had five brothers. When their father died, the eldest son, fond of wine, refused to take part in the burial. The four younger brothers said: ‘If you attend the burial, we will buy you wine.’ After the burial, he went to the four brothers to ask for wine. The four brothers replied: ‘You buried your father—was he yours alone? We feared others would laugh at us, so we deceived you with the promise of wine. Now, if you do not study, people will naturally laugh at you—this is why I urge you.’” Thereafter, Mozi no longer sought office for him.\n\nMozi asked his disciples: “Why do you not study?”\nOne replied: “There are no scholars in my family.”\nMozi said: “Not so. Would one who desires beauty say, ‘There is none in my family,’ and thus abandon the pursuit? Would one who desires wealth and honor say, ‘There is none in my family,’ and thus not strive? Exert yourself!”",

Their words exceed their deeds.\n\nThe gentleman, when clad in finery, grows more reverent; the petty man, when clad in finery, grows more arrogant.\n\n*Chánzǐ*, one scroll\nChánzǐ carried on the teachings of the Mò school and taught them to the world.\n\nAmong the Confucians was one named Dǒng Wúxīn. His words were refined yet fallacious, his conduct earnest yet mediocre. Fallacious words are hard to comprehend; mediocre conduct lacks principle. Wishing to study under Chánzǐ, he was told: “Ornate rhetoric that dazzles the world yet fails to benefit the people—such convoluted and entangling words were not cultivated by Mòzǐ. Exhorting goodness and universal love, however, Mòzǐ held in high regard.”\n\nDǒngzǐ said: “You believe in ghosts and spirits—how is this different from using your heel to untie a knot? It will never succeed.” Chánzǐ could not respond.\n\n*Suícháozǐ*, one scroll\nThose who deny the existence of ghosts asked: Yuè Lán questioned Suícháo, saying: “How does the wisdom of ghosts and spirits compare to that of the sage?”\nSuícháo replied: “It is sagely.”\nYuè Lán said: “Order and chaos arise from man—what then are ghosts and spirits?”\nSuícháozǐ replied: “The sage is born into a world with nothing to rely upon, yet ghosts and spirits regulate the four seasons and eight solar terms to nurture growth. Man rides the clouds and rain, receiving their moisture to flourish—all this is within the power of ghosts and spirits. How can one not call them wiser than the sage?”\n\nTo be distant yet not cut off, to have descendants yet not abandon—this is the conduct of the great sage who universally loves all people. Distant yet not cut off, the worthy rejoice in it, while the unworthy are pitied. If the worthy do not rejoice, it is a rejection of virtue; if the unworthy are not pitied, it is cruelty.\n\n*Shīzǐ*, twenty scrolls\nThe deer runs without looking back; even six horses cannot catch its dust. Yet it is caught because it looks back. Water, when accumulated, gives rise to fish that can swallow boats; earth, when accumulated, gives rise to trees like the yúzhāng. Learning, when accumulated, also bears fruit.\n\nFarmers compare their grain, merchants compare their wealth, and the resolute compare their righteousness. Low walls invite thieves; honor and disgrace arise from within, while respect and insult come from without. One who plants scallions and leeks selects them to ensure abundance—so too must one select benevolence and righteousness. Only goodness has no foundation, yet righteousness flourishes and reverence grows, while disasters and misfortunes do not multiply.\n\nThe owl keeps watch at night, the leopard cat seizes mice, and the firefly illuminates—none of these creatures are commanded, yet they preserve themselves.\n\nOne who says, “I am in a well,” cannot illuminate even ten paces; one whose gaze is fixed at his feet cannot see far—what use is brightness then?\n\nYáo was emaciated and Shùn was dark—both served the people.\n\nWhen a plumb line is set, crooked wood is found guilty; when a level is applied, uneven ground is found guilty; when names and duties are clarified, ministers who act improperly are found guilty. The farmer’s weeding removes what harms the seedlings; the worthy ruler’s governance removes what harms righteousness.\n\nThe young of tigers and leopards, though their patterns are not yet formed, possess the dark markings of creatures that devour oxen; the fledglings of swans and cranes, though their wings are not yet fully grown, harbor the ambition to traverse the four seas.\n\nTo see another’s goodness as one’s own, to see another’s faults as one’s own—this was the great virtue of the Yú clan.\n\nTo buy a horse without considering its strength but judging only by its black or white color ensures one will never obtain a swift steed. To buy jade without considering its quality ensures one will never obtain a fine treasure. To appoint scholars without considering their worthiness ensures one will have no true scholars.\n\nConfucius said: “Reciting the *Odes* and reading the *Documents* is to dwell with the ancients; studying the *Odes* and reciting the *Documents* is to consult with the ancients.” Jade’s color is not as white as snow, its moisture not as rich as rain, its smoothness not as fine as ointment, its luster not as bright as a torch. Yet obtaining jade is exceedingly difficult—crossing the Three Rivers and Five Lakes to reach the Kunlun Mountains, of a thousand who set out, a hundred return; of a hundred who set out, ten arrive. In the Central States, an army of a hundred thousand may be routed, and a siege of three thousand may be broken.\n\nWhen the carriage is light and the road is near, the whip is not needed. The whip is used when the road is long and the burden is heavy.\n\nTo see a single hair of a fine steed is not to know its form; to see a single color in a painting is not to know its beauty.\n\nThe butcher cutting meat knows the age of the ox; the bowmaker binding sinew knows the age of the ox; the carver shaping bone knows the age of the ox—each discerns it in his own way.\n\nGrass and trees, great or small, must await spring before they grow; man must await righteousness before he is complete.\n\n*Hánzǐ*, twenty scrolls\nLiú Xiàng said: The First Emperor of Qín esteemed Hán Fēi, saying in his book: “If I could wander with this man, I would have no regrets in death.” Lǐ Sī and Yáo Jiǎ harmed him, giving him poison to force his suicide. The First Emperor regretted it and sent to save him, but it was too late.\n\nDo not dwell near misfortune, and misfortune will not abide.\n\nThe difficulty of a minister’s speech lies in this: when it is smooth and flowing, observers deem it flowery yet insubstantial; when it is sincere and respectful, observers deem it hollow and useless; when it is concise and unadorned, observers deem it inarticulate and unpersuasive; when it is sharp and probing, delving into others’ intentions, observers deem it presumptuous and unyielding; when it is vast and profound, unfathomable in depth, observers deem it boastful and useless. This is why ministers find speech difficult and their concerns weighty.\n\nThe two handles are punishments and rewards. The tiger can subdue the dog because of its claws and teeth. If the tiger were to shed its claws and teeth, it would instead be subdued by the dog.\n\nThus, Tián Cháng requested that ranks and emoluments be granted generously to the people, and in the state of Qí, when Duke Jiǎn lost virtue, Tián Cháng seized power.\n\nDuke Zhāo of Hán, deeply drunk, went outside. The keeper of the cap, seeing the ruler was cold, placed a robe over him. When the duke awoke, he punished the robe-keeper and executed the cap-keeper. The robe-keeper had failed in his duty; the cap-keeper had overstepped his office. Overstepping one’s office is worse than cold. Thus, the enlightened king ensures his ministers do not overstep their offices to claim merit, nor make proposals that are inappropriate. To overstep one’s office is death; to propose inappropriately is punishment.\n\nExcessive fragrance and beauty harm the body; gleaming teeth deplete one’s essence.",

      "translated_text": "To eliminate extremes and excess is to keep the body from harm.\n\nAppoint the owl to guard the night, command the wildcat to catch mice—each thing has its proper use, each talent its proper application, each placed where it belongs. Thus, those above and below practice non-action.\n\nIf the ruler errs by a hand’s breadth, the subject errs by eight feet—this the ruler cannot but guard against. To entrust one’s desires to the ease of banquets, to seek them in the hour of drunkenness and satiety, is to ensure they will be granted.\n\nA neighboring state with a sage is a threat to the rival state.\n\nMí Zǐxiá enjoyed the favor of the Lord of Wèi. Once, he secretly took the lord’s carriage. The lord, hearing of it, said: “Zǐxiá, feigning command of the carriage to hasten to his ailing mother—what a filial son!” Later, when Mí Zǐxiá strolled with the lord in the orchard and, having eaten a peach, found it too sweet to finish, gave the remainder to the lord, the lord said: “How he loves me!” But when his looks faded and he fell from favor, the lord said: “This is the man who once commandeered my carriage and fed me his leftover peach.” What was once deemed worthy now brought punishment—the shift from love to hate.\n\nOne cannot bestow advantage on the beloved alone; one must wait for praise before granting it. One cannot inflict harm on the hated alone; one must wait for blame before acting. The carriage-maker wishes all men wealth and rank; the coffin-maker wishes all men death and mourning. If men are not noble, carriages go unused; if men do not die, coffins fetch no price. Not that they are kind or cruel—profit lies therein.\n\nThose who love one another form cliques and sing each other’s praises; those who hate one another band together and slander each other. When slander and praise contend, confusion arises.\n\nA household with a steady trade will not starve, even in famine; a state with a steady vocation will not perish, even in peril. If one abandons law to follow private whim, ministers will adorn their cleverness and skill. When they adorn their cleverness and skill, laws and prohibitions will not stand.\n\nThe ruler employs ministers with strategy; ministers serve the ruler with strategy. A minister will not harm himself to benefit the state; a ruler will not harm the state to benefit himself.\n\nIt is like water: the drowning man who drinks it dies; the thirsty man who drinks it lives.\n\nWhen Duke Huán lost his way attacking Gūzhú, Guǎn Zhòng said: “The wisdom of old horses may be put to use.” They released a horse, followed it, and found their way home.\n\nWhen Duke Huán attacked Gūzhú and, marching forth, found no water in the mountains, Yáng Péng said: “Ants winter on the southern slopes, summer on the northern slopes, and where their mounds rise an inch, water lies beneath.” They dug and indeed found water.\n\nHe who takes another’s words of praise to heart must also take another’s words of blame.\n\nCage a gibbon, and it shares the same plight as the tame monkey—it cannot display its abilities.\n\nIn carving and cutting, for the nose, nothing surpasses making it large; for the eyes, nothing surpasses making them small. A large nose can be made smaller, but a small one cannot be made larger; small eyes can be made larger, but large ones cannot be made smaller. All undertakings are thus.\n\nThe ancients knew their eyes were too short to see themselves, so they used a mirror to observe their faces. They knew their persons were too short to know themselves, so they used the Dao to correct themselves. Without a mirror, one cannot set right beard and brows; without the Dao, one cannot recognize delusion.\n\nXīmén Bào, quick-tempered, wore soft leather to restrain himself; Dǒng Ānyú, slow by nature, wore a bowstring to spur himself on.\n\nTo sever a hand and replace it with jade—thus the world suffers the affliction of exchanging bodies.\n\nShùn, as a commoner, could not set right three households. Though talented, he lacked power; though worthy, he could not prevail. Thus, set a log upon a high mountain, and it overlooks a ravine of a thousand fathoms. The timber is not long—its position is high.\n\nDo not spoil another’s beauty; do not speak of another’s faults.\n\nDuke Zhāo of Hán dug up melons and pretended to lose them, then searched for them with great urgency. His attendants, seeking to prepare for his needs, retrieved them. Thus the duke discerned the truth or falsity of his attendants.\n\nLord Sì of Wèi sent a man through the customs barrier. The customs officer reprimanded him, so the man gave the officer gold, and the officer let him pass. The lord said to the officer: “How did you come to accept the traveler’s gold?”—thus demonstrating his vigilance.\n\nIn the time of Duke Xī, the royal cook served a dish in which a piece of raw liver was found. When asked about it, the cook said: “Someone must have placed it there.” He sought to shift blame from himself. Later, when Duke Xī was about to bathe, he found gravel in the hot water. The duke said: “Someone wishes to take my place in heating the water.” When Duke Wén’s cook served meat with a hair wound around it, Duke Wén summoned the cook and said: “Do you mean to make me choke?” The cook kowtowed and said: “Your servant has three crimes: my blade is sharp as Gàn Jiāng, yet it did not sever the hair—this is my first crime; I threaded the skewer through the meat and did not see the hair—this is my second crime; the fire blazed, the meat roasted until red, yet the hair still clung—this is my third crime. Someone must wish to take my place.”\n\nDuke Jǐng of Qí despised Confucius for governing Lǔ. Lí Jǔ said: “To be rid of Confucius is as easy as blowing away a hair.” The duke then sent word to Duke Āi of Lǔ to rest from governance. Confucius remonstrated but was not heeded, so he went to Qí.\n\nMen of Zhèng argued over age. One said: “I am the same age as Yáo.” Another said: “I am the same age as the Yellow Emperor’s brother.” Their dispute over this never ceased, and the one who yielded last was deemed the winner.\n\nA guest painting for the King of Qí, when asked what was most difficult, replied: “Painting dogs and horses is most difficult; ghosts and goblins, easiest. Dogs and horses are what all men know; ghosts and goblins have no form or image.”\n\nThough a cap be threadbare and torn, it must be worn atop the head; though shoes be embroidered in five colors, they must tread the earth.",

When high and low reverse their positions and noble and base reverse their order, the Ru do not engage in it.”\n\nTo drive away ants with a bone only makes them multiply.\n\nDuke Huán asked Guǎn Zhòng, “There are few offices but many applicants—what is to be done?”\nGuǎn Zhòng said, “Do not heed men’s requests. When someone petitions, grant emolument according to ability and confer office according to merit.”\n\nIn Sòng there was a man who brewed fine wine. His measures were precise, his manners toward guests most respectful, his brew excellent, and his banner hung high—yet his wine did not sell and turned sour. He asked Wén Chángqiàn about it, who said, “Your dog is vicious.”\nA boy carrying coins and a jug went to drink, but the dog bit him—just as great ministers bite men of the Dao.\nThus Duke Huán asked Guǎn Zhòng, “What is the greatest concern in governing a state?”\n“If you burn the sacred rat, the wood burns with it.”\n\nTaxes should be neither too light nor too heavy. If too heavy, profit goes to the ruler; if too light, profit returns to the people.\n\nDuke Wén of Jìn fought with Chǔ. He asked his uncle Fàn, “The Chǔ forces are many, ours few—what is to be done?”\nFàn replied, “Deceive them.”\nHe then asked Yōng Jì, who said, “To govern the people by deception is a momentary advantage.”\nWhen Jìn won a great victory and returned, rewards were given first to Yōng Jì and then to Fàn. The duke said, “Fàn’s words were expedient; Yōng Jì’s words were for ten thousand generations.”\n\nDuke Huán of Qí drank to excess and lost his cap. Ashamed, he did not hold court for three days. Guǎn Zhòng said, “This is a national disgrace. Why not erase it with governance?”\nHe then opened the granaries and bestowed grain upon the poor for three days. The people sang, “Why not lose your cap again?”\n\nAn ancient proverb says: “Governance is like washing the hair. Though one loses some strands, the benefit is long hair.”\n\nIn a famine year, even younger brothers are not deferred to; in a year of plenty, even distant guests are surely fed—not because one is distant from kin, but because the mind differs in times of scarcity and abundance.\n\nAfter Mòzǐ’s death, there were the Mò of Xiānglǐ, the Mò of Xiāngfēn, and the Mò of Dènglíng. After Kǒng and Mò, the Ru split into eight, and the Mò into three.\n\nIf one waits for arrows to straighten themselves, there will be no arrows for a hundred generations; if one waits for wood to round itself, there will be no wheels for a thousand years.\n\nLaws and rewards, punishments and penalties are the state’s rouge and powder.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot be filled.\n\n*Yìlín, Scroll One, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth its strengths; the sage has his limitations, things their interconnections. A lovesick man remains unwed yet stirs emotion; a lovesick woman remains husbandless yet conceives. Ghosts are those who return—return to their true dwelling. The true dwelling is the Great Void.\n\nPoverty is the scholar’s constant, death the people’s end. A drunkard falls from a carriage, yet though injured, does not die. The terrors of life and death do not enter his breast.\n\nThe wisdom of birds and beasts shares much with man: male and female pair, mother and child bond, they shun the level and cling to the perilous, flee the cold and seek the warm. At rest, they have their grasses; in motion, their ranks; when drinking, they lead one another; when eating, they call in chorus.\n\nA man of Song kept apes and called them *ju*. Wishing to give them taro, he first deceived them, saying, “Three in the morning, four at dusk.” The apes were all enraged. Then he promised, “Four in the morning, three at dusk,” and the apes were all pleased. Thus the sage, in using wisdom to ensnare the foolish, is no different from the ape-keeper using cunning to ensnare his apes.\n\nAwareness has eight signs; dreams have six conditions. When yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through water in fear; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of treading through fire in scorching heat. The sated dream of giving; the hungry dream of taking. Sleeping with a sash beneath one’s head brings dreams of snakes and crows; holding hair in the mouth brings dreams of flight. When the sky is about to turn overcast, one dreams of fire; when the body is about to fall ill, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grow sorrowful; those who sing and dance weep. Daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—where spirit and form meet.\n\nA minister of Chen said: “In my state there is a man named Kàng Cāngzǐ, who can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.” The Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and summoned him with the rites of a senior minister. Kàng Cāngzǐ said: “My body harmonizes with spirit, my heart unites with the void.”\n\nYán Huí could be humane but not return to simplicity; Zǐgòng could be eloquent but not reticent; Zǐlù could be brave but not timid; Zēngzǐ could be solemn but not companionable. Even if one combined the strengths of these four, to exchange them for Confucius, Confucius would not consent.\n\nWhen the eyes are about to go blind, they first see autumn down; when the nose is about to block, it first smells mildew. Thus, if things do not reach their limit, they do not turn. The *Mínglíng* takes five hundred years as its spring, five hundred years as its autumn. In ancient times, south of Jing, there was a great *zhuāng* that took eight thousand years as its spring, eight thousand years as its autumn. Fungi and mushrooms are born at dawn and die at dusk. Oysters and clams come to life with rain and perish in sunlight. In the state of Yuèshù, when a family’s eldest son is born, they eat him, calling it “auspicious for younger brothers.”\n\nIn the state of Zhéxiū, when a man’s grandfather dies, they carry his grandmother away and abandon her, calling her “ghost’s leavings.”\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. Asking the reason, one said: “I believe that when the sun first rises, it is closer to people, and at noon, farther away.” The other said: “When the sun first rises, it is far, and at noon, near.” One child said: “When the sun first rises, it is as large as a carriage wheel, but by noon, only as big as a plate or bowl—is this not because when near it is large, and when far, small?” The other said: “When the sun first rises, it is dim and cold, but by noon, it is as if one were dipping into boiling water—is this not because when near it is hot, and when far, cold?” Confucius could not decide. The child said: “Who says you are so wise?”\n\nYáng Zhū said: “Among a thousand people, not one attains a lifespan of a hundred years, and half of that is spent in illness, sorrow, and suffering. To guard the sights and sounds of the ears and eyes, to plan for the aftermath of death, to forgo the joys of one’s prime—if one does not indulge in the moment, how is this different from being bound in fetters? Diligence can bring ease; cold can bring warmth.”\n\nYànzǐ said: “After I die, what does it matter to me? Burn me, sink me, bury me, expose me, cast me into a ditch, or seal me in a stone coffin—whatever comes to pass.”\n\nWithout marriage or office, half of human desires fade; without clothing or food, the Way of ruler and minister ceases.\n\nYáng Zhū said: “The people’s inability to rest arises from four things: longevity, fame, rank, and wealth. With these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, fears punishment. This is what it means to be a fugitive from life.”\n\nTo leave not by the gate, to walk not by the path—seeking profit thus, is it not difficult?\n\nDuke Wén of Jìn wished to attack Wèi. Gōngzǐ Chú laughed at him. Asked why, he replied: “I laugh at my neighbor. A man was escorting his wife home when he saw a woman picking mulberries by the road. Enamored, he spoke to her, and when he turned to look at his wife, someone had already beckoned her away.” The duke then withdrew his troops, but before they returned, someone had already raided his northern border.\n\nConfucius said: “One may have the strength to lift the bolt of a state’s gate, yet refuse to use force to open a door.”\n\nThe grandee of Húqiū said to Sūnshū Áo: “There are three things people resent—do you know them? Those of high rank are envied; those in great office are hated by their lord; those with ample emolument are resented.” Sūnshū Áo replied: “The higher my rank, the lower my ambitions; the greater my office, the smaller my aims; the richer my emolument, the broader my generosity. Can I thus avoid resentment?”",

Their root is one, their branches many.”\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son of stealing it. He observed the son’s gait and countenance—all seemed like a thief. Then, while searching his own valley, he found the axe. When he saw the neighbor’s son again, nothing about him resembled a thief.\n\nA man of Qí desired gold. At dawn, he went to the market and, seeing a gold-seller, seized the gold and fled.

The mind, too, has its deafness and blindness.\nNot knowing the ultimate subtlety of the perfect word, one dismisses it as madness and does not believe—this is the mind’s deafness and blindness.\n\nThe body may be made still as withered wood;\nThe heart may be made quiescent as dead ashes.\nIt is their silence and formlessness that is sought.\n\nGreat wisdom is at ease;\nSmall wisdom is restless.\nIn sleep, the spirits intermingle;\nIn waking, the body opens.\n\nWhere does the Dao hide that it has truth and falsehood?\nWhere do words hide that they have right and wrong?\nThis one deems right and that one wrong;\nThat one deems right and this one wrong—\nEach holds its own negation within.\n\nWhat is permissible is permissible to oneself;\nWhat is impermissible is impermissible to oneself.\n\nBeyond the Six Directions, the Sage acknowledges but does not discourse;\nWithin the Six Directions, the Sage discourses but does not debate.\nThe *Spring and Autumn* chronicles the world’s affairs, preserving the intent of the former kings—the Sage debates but does not contend, neither pursuing gain nor avoiding harm.\n\nOne who dreams of drinking wine may weep upon waking;\nOne who dreams of weeping may go hunting upon waking.\nIn the dream itself, one does not know it is a dream.\nFrom this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it is death but follows one’s will.\nWithin the dream, one may even interpret the dream—yet this differs not from waking.\nOnly upon waking does one know it was a dream.\nWhen all one encounters is sufficient, why fret over life and fear death?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering contentedly as a butterfly, self-so and at ease, unaware he was Zhou.\nSuddenly he awoke, and there he was, unmistakably Zhou.\nDid Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou?\n\nMy life has bounds, but knowledge has none.\nTo follow the boundless with the bounded is perilous.\nTo seek limitless wisdom with finite nature—how can one not be exhausted?\n\nTo flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature is to forget what one has received.\nWhat Heaven bestows as nature, each has its proper measure—neither to be escaped nor exceeded.\n\nTo come is to follow the time;\nTime arises of itself.\nTo go is to follow the natural course—\nThe principle of death is fitting.\nAbiding in the timely and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter.\nSorrow and joy arise from gain and loss.\nIf one follows what one has received, sorrow and joy have no place to intervene.\n\n---\n\nYan Hui said: “My family is poor; for months, I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. Can this be called the fasting of the mind?”\nConfucius replied: “That is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.”\nYan Hui asked: “May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?”\nZhongni said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with the *qi*.

      "translated_text": "To still the limbs, dim the senses, detach from form, and cast off wisdom—merging with the Great Flow—this is called \"sitting in forgetfulness.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person’s mind is like a mirror: it neither invites nor resists, responds yet does not retain. Thus it masters things without harm. Things come, and it reflects them. Reflection does not engage the mind, so though the whole world be mirrored, the heart remains unwearied.\n\nA classic text may be brief, yet to extend it brings sorrow; a crane’s legs may be long, yet to shorten them brings grief. Since the Three Dynasties, the world has bartered its nature for things. The petty person sacrifices himself for profit, the scholar for fame, the grandee for his house, the sage for the world. Though their pursuits differ, their self-sacrifice is one.\n\nZang and Gu herded sheep together and both lost them. Asked what Zang was doing, he held a book and read; asked what Gu was doing, he played at dice. Though their tasks differed, their lost sheep were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang, Robber Zhi died for gain upon Dongling. Though their deaths differed, their ruin of life and harm to nature were one. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? Then the whole world is self-sacrificing. Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men. Their sacrifice is the same. As for ruining life and harming nature, how can one distinguish gentleman from petty man between them?\n\nTo see others without seeing oneself, to gain from others without gaining for oneself—this is to gain others’ gains while not gaining one’s own. To suit others’ suits without suiting one’s own—though Robber Zhi and Boyi differ, both are excessive and perverse.\n\nIf uncarved wood is not marred, who would make sacrificial vessels? If white jade is not shattered, who would fashion scepters? If the Dao and its power are not abandoned, why would one need benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, why would one need rites and music?\n\nTo carve uncarved wood into vessels is the craftsman’s fault; to ruin the Dao and its power to create benevolence and righteousness is the sage’s error.\n\nRobber Zhi’s followers asked him, “Does theft also have a Dao?” Zhi replied, “How could one presume what lies hidden in a room without sagacity? To enter first is courage; to exit last is righteousness; to know what is possible is wisdom; to divide equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief. What prohibits these five makes thieves not thieves—it is their resource. From this we see: the good person cannot stand without the sage’s Dao, and Robber Zhi cannot act without it. Since good people in the world are few and the ungood many, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great.”\n\nCut off sagacity, cast aside wisdom, and great thieves will cease. Smash jade, shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise. Burn tallies, break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; split bushels, snap scales, and they will not contend.\n\nWhen joy and anger suspect one another, the foolish and wise deceive one another, the good and bad condemn one another, the truthful and false mock one another—the world declines.\n\nThe essence of the supreme Dao is dim and obscure; its utmost is murky and silent.\n\nGuard your inner self to preserve your true nature. Close yourself to the outer to keep to your allotted part. Excessive cunning brings ruin. Wisdom has no bounds, hence its ruin.\n\nThe common people all delight in those who agree with them and detest those who differ. The teaching of the great person is like a form giving rise to a shadow, a sound to an echo—questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their hearts.\n\nWhen Zigong taught the gardener of Hanyin to make a well-sweep, the gardener flushed with anger and laughed, saying, “Those who have machinery have mechanical affairs; those who have mechanical affairs have mechanical hearts. A mechanical heart in the breast leaves no room for purity; without purity, the spirit is unsettled; with an unsettled spirit, the Dao cannot be borne. I do not claim ignorance—I am ashamed to do this.” What seeks feasibility, what seeks completion, what uses little effort to achieve much—this is the sage’s Dao.\n\nWhen three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for the confused are few. If two are confused, the effort is laborious and the goal unattained, for the confused are many.\n\nWhat can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas, the world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the truth of things. Yet forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp that truth.\n\nScatter chaff before the eyes, and heaven, earth, and the four directions seem to shift. Mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, and one cannot sleep all night. Though external things may be small, their harm to nature is great. The swan does not bathe daily yet remains white; the crow does not blacken daily yet remains black. Nature suffices for each. Serene and at ease, cares cannot enter, and noxious qi cannot invade. Thus their virtue is whole and their spirit unharmed.\n\nDo not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Respond only when moved, without leading. Move only when pressed, act only when the moment arrives. Rise only when unavoidable—thus there is no heavenly disaster, no burden from things, no human blame, no ghostly reproach. In life, one floats; in death, one rests. Joy and anger are excesses of the Dao; likes and dislikes are losses of virtue. Unchanging unity is the height of stillness. Still and unified, one cannot be altered. Not engaging with things is the height of indifference. Things come of themselves—there is no impulse to engage them. If the body labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts.\n\nA rustic saying goes: “The crowd values profit, the incorruptible value fame, the worthy esteem aspiration, the sage treasures essence.” Adorn it with ornament, enrich it with breadth—ornament destroys substance, breadth drowns the heart. What the ancients called “attaining one’s aim” did not refer to carriages and caps.",

      "translated_text": "What is now called \"attaining one’s aim\" refers to carriages and caps. Carriages and caps upon the body are not one’s nature or destiny—they are but transient things that come by chance, a temporary lodging. Their coming cannot be warded off, their going cannot be halted. Thus, one should not indulge the will for carriages and caps, nor should one follow the crowd in poverty and constraint.\n\nThe well-frog cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its pit. The summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. The narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. One who views the great from the small cannot see the whole; one who views the small from the great cannot see clearly.\n\nThe thoroughbred and the fine steed gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they are no match for the wildcat in catching mice—this speaks of differing skills. The crow and the magpie pluck fleas at night and discern the finest hairs, yet by day they stare blindly and cannot see the hills and mountains—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThe Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing at Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying: \"I wish to trouble you with the affairs of the realm.\" Zhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying: \"I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise that has been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in the ancestral temple. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones honored, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?\" The ministers said: \"It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then go. I too will drag my tail through the mud.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?\" Zhuangzi said: \"You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?\" Huizi said: \"I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so it is clear you do not know the joy of fish.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. You asked how I know the joy of fish—you already knew I knew it when you asked. I know it by the Pu River.\"\n\nWhat to choose, what to rely on, what to avoid, what to dwell in, what to pursue, what to abandon, what to delight in, what to detest—choosing among these eight does not suffice to preserve life. Only by making no choice and following what one encounters can one rest.\n\nThe skull said: \"In death, there is no lord above, no minister below, nor the affairs of time. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn—even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.\" Zhuangzi did not believe it, saying: \"If I had the Controller of Fate restore your flesh and skin, return you to your parents, wife, children, and village acquaintances, would you desire it?\" The skull said: \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toil of the human world?\"\n\nThose who fear the perilous road—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another and set out only with a full escort. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly fear lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals, and those who do not guard against it err. If one in ten is killed, people greatly fear it, yet when it comes to the harm of sensual desire, none are willing to fear it—such are the foolish masses.\n\nZhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told: \"It is of no use.\" Zhuangzi said: \"This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan.\" Leaving the mountains, he lodged at an old friend’s house. The friend ordered his servant to kill a goose, and the servant asked: \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\" The host said: \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\" The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi: \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its lifespan, while the master’s goose, by being useless, died. Where will you, Master, take your stand?\" Zhuangzi said: \"I will stand between usefulness and uselessness—though it seems so, it is not, and thus I have not escaped strangeness. Straight trees are felled first; sweet springs are drained first.\"\n\nNo bird is wiser than the quail. Fearing humans, it nests among them. No one who distances themselves from others is preserved by them. Fearing humans and entering their midst—this is why the quail is called wise.\n\n*Wangsunzi, Scroll One*\n\nShun offered the world to Zizhou Zhibo, who said: \"I happen to suffer from a hidden sorrow and am just now treating it. I have no leisure to govern the world.\" Spring plowing and sowing are enough to labor the body; autumn harvest and gathering are enough to rest. Thus, those who honor life, though rich and noble, do not harm themselves with indulgence; though poor and lowly, do not burden their bodies with profit.\n\nThe achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover affairs of sages, not what preserves the body or nurtures life. Yet today’s worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable? If someone used the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand *ren* high, the world would surely laugh at them. Why? Because what they value is heavy, and what they seek is light. Is life not far weightier than the Marquis of Sui’s pearl?\n\nLie Yukou refused the gift of grain from Zheng Ziyang, saying: \"You do not truly know me. You give me grain based on others’ words, and when you punish me, you will also fear others’ words. That is why I do not accept it.\"\n\nZigong asked: \"Master Yuanxian, what ails you?\" Yuanxian replied: \"I have heard that lacking wealth is called poverty, and learning without practice is called ailment. Now I am poor, not ailing.\" Zigong withdrew with a look of shame.\n\nThose content with what they have are not burdened by profit; those who know themselves deeply are not dismayed by loss; those whose conduct is cultivated within do not act without position. To be poor in the Dao is true poverty; to hold to the Way of benevolence and righteousness yet suffer the calamities of a chaotic age—what poverty is there in that? The wise plan it, the martial carry it out, the benevolent dwell in it—this is the ancient Way.\n\nTo abolish superiors is not righteousness. To kill the people is not benevolence. Others face difficulty while I enjoy the benefit—this is not integrity.\n\nThose who chatter and wag their tongues, stirring up right and wrong, and those who flatter others to their faces—such people also slander behind their backs.\n\nTang exiled his lord; King Wu killed Zhou.

      "translated_text": "Human nature craves: the eye to see beauty, the ear to hear sound, the mouth to savor taste, and the will and qi to be fulfilled.\n\nThe longest lifespan is a hundred years, the middle eighty, the shortest sixty—excluding illness, infirmity, and untimely death.\n\n*Shenzi* in three scrolls. Liu Xiang states: Shenzi, named Buhai, was a native of Hedong and a lowly official in Zheng. He studied techniques to serve Marquis Zhao of Han, and the Qin armies dared not approach. His learning was rooted in the Huang-Lao tradition, yet he was harsh and unyielding, lacking mercy—unfit for the affairs of hegemons or kings.\n\nA three-inch basket, when set in motion, can settle the world; a six-inch plumb line, when aligned, can govern it.\n\nA domineering wife can easily destroy a household; a treacherous minister can easily ruin a state. If one wife monopolizes her husband, all wives fall into chaos. If one minister usurps the ruler, all ministers become obscured.\n\nWhen wisdom is equal, none can employ another; when strength is equal, none can overcome another.\n\nThe drum does not belong to the five notes yet presides over them.\n\nFor a hundred generations, sages may follow one after another, yet they trail a thousand li behind; only the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\n*Shenzi* in twelve scrolls, named Dao, studied the Huang-Lao tradition. Peng Zu was his disciple.\n\nThe petty man eats by his labor; the noble man eats by the Dao.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* records aspirations; the *Book of Documents*, harmonious governance; the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, past events.\n\nOne does not neglect the nurse of an infant; one does not slight the driver on perilous roads.\n\nIf you place a hook or stone before Yu, he could not discern it; but suspend it from a balance, and even a hair’s weight becomes clear.\n\nTwo nobles do not serve each other; two inferiors do not employ each other.\n\nWhen a family is wealthy, distant kin gather; when poor, even brothers part—not from lack of love, but because profit cannot accommodate them.\n\nOne who is neither sharp nor bright cannot rule as king; one who is neither blind nor deaf cannot govern as a duke.\n\nThe sea and the mountain contend for water, but the sea always prevails.\n\nWhere there are scales, one cannot be deceived by weight; where there are measures, one cannot be misled by length; where there are laws, one cannot be duped by craft or falsehood.\n\nIf one rabbit runs, a hundred men chase it. But when rabbits pile up in the market, passersby do not glance—though they desire the rabbit, its portion is fixed and cannot be contested.\n\nA filial son is not born in the house of a kind father; a loyal minister does not arise under a sagely ruler.\n\nWhen the six relations are not harmonious, filial piety and kindness are nurtured; when the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.\n\nA carpenter who makes coffins does not resent the dead—for where profit lies, shame is forgotten.\n\nThe timber for a grand hall does not come from a single tree’s branch; the white fox fur robe is not made from one fox’s armpit; a state that hoards armor will surely see soldiers flee.\n\nOne who acts with intent must first prepare the tools.\n\nMarket rabble can be driven to war, but the army of a secure state does not arise from anger.\n\n*Yandanzi* in three scrolls. Dan was the son of King Xi of Yan, held hostage in the time of Qin Shi Huang.\n\nA true man feels shame at receiving humiliation; a chaste woman feels disgrace at the loss of her virtue.\n\nIs blood-bravery anger that reddens the face? Is sinew-bravery anger that turns it pale? Is bone-bravery anger that whitens it?\n\nTian Guang said: I know Jing Ke’s courage—it is spirit-bravery. When enraged, his countenance does not change; his lofty conduct pierces the heavens, his fine reputation fills the ears. Such was Jing Ke in Yan.\n\nHe said to the crown prince: Guang praises the prince, whose lofty conduct pierces the heavens, whose fair name fills the ears.\n\nKe left the capital of Wei, gazing at no path, undeterred by peril, unmoved by distance.\n\nNow the prince honors him with the kindness of old friendship and receives him with the respect due a new guest. That he no longer declines is because he trusts in the prince’s recognition.\n\nThe wind howls, the Yi River runs cold;\nA stalwart departs, never to return.\n\nKe said: If the prince relies on Yan to resist Qin, it is like using a sheep to hunt a wolf.\n\nKe then entreated Fan Wuqi: The general has offended Qin, and your parents, wife, and children have all been burned. Ke grieves for you. Now I wish to present the general’s head and the map of Yan’s Dukang region to the King of Qin. He will surely rejoice and receive me. Then I will seize his sleeve with my left hand and stab his chest with my right, enumerating Yan’s grievances and reproaching him with the general’s terms.\n\nFan Wuqi grasped his blade and slit his throat; his head fell behind him, his eyes still open.\n\nWhen the crown prince heard this, he prostrated himself over the body and wept. He placed Wuqi’s head and the map of Dukang in a casket to offer to Qin, with Wu Yang as deputy.\n\nKe did not choose an auspicious day but set out at once.\n\nThe prince’s retainers, all in plain white robes and caps, saw him off at the Yi River. Ke rose to offer a toast and sang; Gao Jianli struck the zither, Song Yi joined in harmony, their voices swelling with valor, stirring fury and bristling hair. When they turned to a mournful tune, the warriors all wept. The two then mounted their chariot and drove away without looking back.\n\nWhen Jing Ke reached Xianyang, the King of Qin rejoiced greatly and received him with halberds arrayed. Ke presented Fan Wuqi’s head in a box alongside the map, advancing in order. The assembled ministers all cried “Long live the king!” Qin Wu Yang trembled with fear, but Jing Ke glanced at him and smiled, stepping forward to apologize: This rustic from the northern frontier has never seen the Son of Heaven. I beg Your Majesty to pardon him, that he may complete his task before you.\n\nThe King of Qin said: Ke, rise and present the Dukang map.\n\nJing Ke unrolled the map, and as it reached its end, the dagger appeared. He seized the king’s sleeve with his left hand and stabbed his chest with his right, saying: Follow my plan and live; refuse, and die.\n\nThe King of Qin said: Let me hear the sound of the zither before I die.\n\nHe summoned a concubine to play. The zither’s tune said: The single-layered robe of Luo Valley can be torn asunder; the eight-foot screen can be leapt over; the sword at the chariot’s shaft can be drawn by the back.\n\nKe did not understand the music, but the King of Qin followed its cue, drew the sword from behind, and severed Ke’s hands. Ke leaned against a pillar and laughed, squatting down to curse: I have been tricked by this wretch! My task has failed!\n\n*Guiguzi* in five scrolls, annotated by Yue Shi. A general overview of the text states: In the Zhou era, there was a bold hermit who dwelt in Guigu, calling himself Master Guigu. He had no recorded hometown, clan, or given name.",

From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been the followers of disorder.",

      "translated_text": "This was recorded by Su Qin.\n\nThe term \"Guigu\" suggests remoteness, much like Sima Xiangru’s feigned \"Lord Wu Shi.\" From ancient times to the present, the Dao remains one, yet its transformations are boundless, each finding its own return—now yin, now yang; now soft, now hard; now opening, now closing; now slack, now taut. Thus, the sage guards and oversees its gates and thresholds, scrutinizing what comes before and after.\n\nThe mouth is the gateway of the heart, from which all wisdom and strategies emerge.\n\nSome long for one another from afar; some advance yet remain unchecked.\n\nThe world holds no constant duties, nor do affairs have fixed masters.\n\nCarrying firewood into flames, the driest kindles first; pouring water on level ground, the damp is soaked first—such are the resonances of kindred things.\n\nThe wise do not employ their own shortcomings but instead utilize what the foolish excel in; they do not rely on their own clumsiness but instead apply what the foolish have mastered.\n\nWalls collapse where cracks appear; wood decays where knots reside.\n\nWhen others move, I remain still; when others speak, I listen. The power to hold fast or let go lies within me, awaiting inquiry.\n\nTo know one’s nature is to be free from entanglements; to know one’s fate is to be free from sorrow. When sorrows and burdens depart, the heart becomes tranquil, and virtue and righteousness manifest.\n\nNurturing the people with virtue is like plants and trees flourishing in season; transforming others with benevolence is like heaven nourishing grasses and trees with rain.\n\n*Yinwenzi* in two scrolls, annotated by Liu Yin.\n\nThe preface states: Wenzi hailed from Yin of Zhou and resided at Jixia during the reign of King Xuan of Qi. In the late Huangchu era, I first arrived in the capital, where Miao Xibo showed me this text, and I took the liberty of editing it.\n\nNames fall into three categories: first, names that designate things, such as square, round, white, and black; second, names of praise or blame, such as good, evil, noble, and base; third, names of analogy and reference, such as worthy, foolish, love, and resentment.\n\nLaws manifest in four forms: first, unchanging laws, such as the order between ruler and subject; second, laws of equality, such as the assessment of ability and mediocrity; third, laws governing the masses, such as rewards, punishments, and penalties; fourth, laws of standardization, such as measures, weights, and balances.\n\nThe noble person does not speak of principles that, though sound, bring no benefit to governance; nor does he act on abilities that, though competent, serve no purpose in affairs.",

      "translated_text": "The King of Chu was greatly pleased.\n\n*Master Lü’s Annals*, Scroll Twenty-Six\n\nLithe waists and gleaming teeth, the music of Zheng and Wei—these are axes that hew at destiny. Rich meats and thick wine—these are foods that rot the bowels.\n\nAt thunder, men cover their ears; at lightning, they shield their eyes. To hear what one loathes is worse than not hearing; to see what one loathes is worse than not seeing. A forced laugh brings no joy; forced tears bring no sorrow. For these do not arise from the heart.\n\nFlowing water does not stagnate; a door’s pivot does not rot—because they move. So too with the body’s qi. A spring’s waters bound forth, day and night unceasing, never exhausting above nor filling below.\n\nEars that hear yet do not learn are no better than deafness; eyes that see yet do not learn are no better than blindness.\n\nWere a man of Rong born in Chu, or a man of Chu born in Rong, the Chu man would speak the Rong tongue, and the Rong man the Chu tongue. Thus even a ruler who has lost his state may be transformed into a worthy sovereign.\n\nThe cherry is so called because crows pluck it—hence \"plucked cherry.\"\n\nCourage is a perilous virtue; weapons are perilous tools.\n\nA fine sword that fails to strike is no different from a poor one. Water flows from mountains to the sea—one may despise the mountains and desire the sea, yet high and low determine the course. Men say dodder has no roots, yet its roots do exist, only unconnected—such is the case with *fuling*.\n\nThe lodestone draws the needle; all things attract. So too when a sage faces south and stands, none under heaven do not crane their necks. King Wen of Zhou had men inspect the land, where they found dry bones. He ordered officials in robes and caps to bury them. When the world heard of this, they said: \"King Wen is worthy—his virtue extends even to dry bones.\"\n\nAmong the brave men of Qi, one lived in the eastern outskirts, another in the west. By chance they met and drank together. \"Does wine need meat?\" they asked. Each drew his blade and cut his own flesh, feeding it to the other until both died.\n\nStone may be shattered but never robbed of its hardness; cinnabar may be ground but never robbed of its redness—for these qualities are received from Heaven.\n\nIn Lu there was an ugly man. His father, seeing the handsome Shang Duo, returned and told his neighbor: \"Shang Duo is not as fine as my son.\" This is the height of beauty falling short of the depth of ugliness—for a father’s love blinds him to his child’s flaws.\n\nThere was a man who stank. None among his kin, brothers, wives, concubines, or acquaintances could bear to be near him. He exiled himself to the sea, where a man delighted in his stench and followed him day and night without parting.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao conquered the Di and took two cities, he drank with a troubled countenance. He said: \"The great rivers do not rise beyond three days—yet in a single morning I have taken two cities of the Di. Ruin will soon reach me.\" Confucius heard this and said: \"Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin.\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong was bound by Lu and sent to Qi in a caged cart, the laborers pulling it sang as they went. Fearing Lu might regret and halt the transfer, yet wishing to reach Qi quickly, Guan Zhong said to the laborers: \"Let me sing, and you join in.\" The laborers did not tire, and the journey was swift. Guan Zhong knew how to make use of things—he harnessed the laborers’ eagerness to flee, singing to urge them onward.\n\nThe man of the Dao values drawing the distant from the near, the ancient from the present, the unseen from what is seen. Thus by examining the shade beneath the hall, one knows the movements of sun and moon; seeing ice in a jar’s water, one knows the world’s cold; tasting a single bite of meat, one knows the flavor of the whole pot.\n\nA man was about to cross a river, carrying an infant he meant to cast into the water. When asked why, he replied: \"His father is a good swimmer.\" Though the father swims well, does that mean the child must too? The governance of Chu is much like this.\n\nI do not associate with those inferior to me, nor with those my equal—for they bring me no benefit.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou said: \"The noble man is constrained by those who do not know him, yet expands in the presence of those who do.\"\n\nA pit one *xun* deep is beyond the reach of a man’s arm—so too is there knowledge beyond human grasp.\n\nWhen Yue Yang returned from conquering Zhongshan, his face bore the look of one demanding reward. Marquis Wen of Wei showed him two baskets of slanderous letters. Yue Yang faced north, bowed twice, and said: \"Even a single slip of paper would suffice—why two baskets?\"\n\nWhen man and steed race together, the man cannot outrun the steed. But seated in a chariot, the steed cannot outrun the man. So too when a ruler competes for office—it is no different from racing alongside a steed.\n\nThe eye’s vision depends on light; the mind’s wisdom depends on principle.\n\nA boneless creature cannot be made to know ice—born in spring, dead by autumn, it knows nothing of winter’s frost. A question ten *li* away cannot be heard; what lies beyond curtains and walls cannot be seen; what occurs within three *mu* the heart cannot know—yet one desires to awaken the east, pacify the southern tribes, subdue the western lands, and embrace the northern peoples. How can this be achieved? These are the names of the four distant states.\n\nGuan Yiwu and Baili Xi were steeds for hegemons and kings. Those who cross rivers rely on boats; those who reach far rely on steeds.\n\nThe King of Chu asked Zhan He about the way to govern the state. Zhan He replied: \"I have heard of governing the self, not of governing the state—for the state’s root lies in the self.\" Zhan He was a recluse.\n\nGuan Zhong said: \"The noble man has three countenances: the joyful mien of bells and drums, the solemn and pure mien of mourning garments, and the surging and brimming mien of weapons and armor.\"\n\nWhen the Wei River flooded, a rich man drowned. Someone recovered his corpse and demanded a great sum for its ransom. The rich man’s kin consulted Deng Xi, who said: \"Be at ease—there will be no buyer.\" The finder, worried the corpse would not be ransomed, again consulted Deng Xi. Deng Xi said: \"Be at ease—no one else will sell it, and it will surely be ransomed.\" Words that do not deceive the heart are words that illuminate the heart. Words that divide kin bring misfortune.\n\nTo hew wood by the inked line is to build a palace that will not stand.",
      "overlap_context": "speech is respectful and proper; in sacrifices, harmonious and ordered; in military matters, voices united in vigor; in mourning rites, sorrowful and insufficient.\n\nThe King of Zhai sent an envoy to Chu. The King of Chu boasted of the Terrace of Zhanghua, so high one must rest three times to reach it. The king asked, \"Does Zhai have such a terrace?\" The envoy replied, \"The King of Zhai’s thatch is untrimmed, his painted rafters uncarved—yet he deems the builders laborious and the dwellers idle.\"",

      "translated_text": "Talented individuals are rare.\n\nPull its guiding cord, and ten thousand eyes arise; pull its main rope, and ten thousand eyes align. Governing the people is like this. A reservoir gathers water in a thousand-fathom gorge—who can withstand it?\n\nWhen the Rong Yi tribesman left Qi for Lu, the weather turned bitterly cold. He and one disciple lodged outside the city walls. As the cold grew more severe, he said to his disciple: \"You may save my life with your clothes. I am a man of the realm, one the world would grieve to lose. You are unworthy—your loss would not be mourned.\" The disciple replied: \"How could an unworthy man give his clothes to a man of the realm?\" Rong Yi sighed, then removed his garments and gave them to the disciple. By midnight, Rong Yi had died, but the disciple survived.\n\nWhen Yanzi faced danger from Cui Zhu, he grasped the carriage strap and mounted. His driver urged the horses to speed, but Yanzi said: \"Be at ease. Haste does not ensure survival, nor does slowness ensure death. A deer born in the mountains may yet hang in the kitchen. Now my fate hangs somewhere as well.\"\n\nTo summon rain with a dragon, to chase a shadow with its form—like calls to like, qi aligns with qi, and sound responds to sound. Thus, when the gong note is struck, the shang note answers. If the ruler’s virtue does not flow, the people’s desires cannot reach him—this is the stagnation of the state. A stagnant tree rots, stagnant water festers, and a stagnant state gathers every disaster. Though heaven is high, the sun, moon, stars, clouds, rain, and dew never rest. Though earth is vast, its springs, grasses, trees, and creatures never cease.\n\nA cap adorns the head, and robes adorn the body. Yet if one severs the head for a cap or slays the body for robes, one knows not what one does. The world’s pursuit of profit is likewise senseless.\n\nThe noble Yellow Emperor died, the worthy Yao and Shun died, the valiant Meng Ben died. Those who appraise jade fear stones that resemble jade; those who appraise swords fear blades like Wu and Gan Jiang; a worthy ruler fears eloquent men who seem wise. A doomed ruler may seem wise, and a doomed minister may seem loyal.\n\nWhen Zixia passed through Wei, he heard someone reading from the historical records: \"The Jin army’s three pigs crossed the river.\" Zixia said: \"That is incorrect—it was the day *ji-hai*.\"\n\nTo gain ten fine horses is not as good as gaining one Bo Le; to gain ten fine swords is not as good as gaining one Ou Leng; to gain a thousand *li* of land is not as good as gaining one worthy man.\n\nIn summer, one does not wear furs—not from lack of love for furs, but because warmth is already sufficient. In winter, one does not use a fan—not from lack of love for the fan, but because coolness is already sufficient. A torch illuminates one corner, leaving half the room in darkness. If the bones harden early, the body and mind will not grow.\n\nLü Buwei, Chancellor under the First Emperor, assembled scholars to compile the *Twelve Records*, *Eight Surveys*, and *Six Discourses*. Displayed in the Xianyang marketplace, it was said that anyone who could add or remove a single word would be rewarded with a thousand gold—yet none dared alter it. The rituals of the *Twelve Records* are not transcribed here.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* in twenty-two scrolls states: Pouring boiling water on boiling water only makes the chaos worse, just as whipping the sky or striking a horse will not teach it—even Yi Yin or Zao Fu could not transform it. Those who rely on schemes labor in vain.\n\nWhite stands alone, yet the five colors arise from it; the Dao stands alone, yet the ten thousand things arise from it. A deaf man learns songs but cannot enjoy them. One whose heart is closed yet forces himself to mimic the deaf emits songs from his mouth, only for them to scatter like mist.\n\nIce meets spring and melts into water; water faces winter and freezes into ice.\n\nUse the Dao as the fishing rod, virtue as the line, ritual and music as the hook, benevolence and righteousness as the bait. Cast it into the river, float it in the sea, and the ten thousand things will be caught.\n\nThe city of Liyang became a lake in a single night. Liyang was a county in Huainan. Someone warned the magistrate of Liyang: \"If you see blood on the city gate, flee without looking back.\" Later, a gatekeeper reported blood on the threshold. The magistrate fled to the northern mountains, and the city sank beneath the waters—he himself turned to stone.\n\nA Yue canoe or Shu raft cannot float without water; the Wu Hao bow or Xizi crossbow cannot shoot without a string.\n\nWhen the ruler punishes the violent, many whirlwinds arise; when laws are harsh, many pests appear; when the innocent are killed, the land turns red; when decrees are untimely, excessive rains fall.\n\nIn the south grows the herb of immortality; in the north lies ice that never melts.\n\nThose who drink water are skilled at floating and endure the cold—they are fish. Those who eat earth have no hearts yet are kind—they are earthworms. Those who eat wood are strong yet foolish—they are deer. Those who eat mulberry leaves produce silk—they are silkworms. Those who eat meat are brave and fierce—they are tigers and leopards. Those who consume qi are spiritually enlightened and long-lived—they are turtles, snakes, Wang Qiao, and Chi Song. Those who eat grain are wise yet short-lived—they are humans.\n\nThose born by day resemble their fathers; those born at night resemble their mothers.\n\nA single brave warrior is the hero of three armies.\n\nThe sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding yet not storing.\n\nBegging for fire is not as good as taking flint; borrowing water is not as good as digging a well. Like Yi, who sought the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, Chang’e stole and consumed it—yet she did not know from whence the elixir of immortality came.\n\nIn life, one has a seven-foot form; in death, one becomes a clod of earth in a coffin. How can one know the joys and sorrows, the gains and losses? Though heaven and earth are vast, their dimensions can be measured; the movements of the stars and moon can be known through calendars and calculations.\n\nWhen Cang Jie created writing, grain rained from the sky, and ghosts wept at night. Cang Jie was the historian of the Yellow Emperor. Once writing was invented, deceit and falsehood arose—hence the ghosts wept.\n\nToday’s rulers, with meager virtue, increase punishments, like holding a sling to lure birds or carrying a staff to tame dogs. A caged dog, though restrained, is not truly tamed.\n\nThose who ride carriages and horses travel a thousand *li* without wearying their feet; those who board boats and oars cross rivers and seas without swimming.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao of the sage is like setting up an altar at a crossroads—passersby draw from it as they will, each taking what suits them, though the amounts differ.\n\nA crossroads is where six roads meet; *dūn* means \"to squat,\" *jiǔfù* refers to a wine vessel.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows nothing of profit or harm, yet a loving mother cherishes it—such is the nature of affection.\n\nA kind father loves his child, a sage king nurtures his people, as fire is naturally hot, as ice is naturally cold—this is the way of their nature. But when it comes to exerting effort, one relies on its results, like fighting a fire aboard a boat. All hearts unite to save it.\n\nA chariot without a three-inch linchpin cannot be driven; a door without a five-inch bolt cannot be secured. Thus, the noble person values what is essential.\n\nGoverning a state is like tuning a zither or lute: if the thick strings are slack, the thin strings will snap.\n\nGoverning a state is like setting a net: pull the main rope, and all the meshes open.\n\nExcessive desires harm righteousness; excessive worries impair wisdom; excessive fear undermines courage.\n\nTigers and leopards are hunted for their patterned hides; the *Xuāndí* are lured by their agility to be stabbed. Thus, Zilu died for his bravery, while the wise and foolish alike may be trapped by their own cunning. One who blows away dust yet wishes not to be speckled, or wades through water yet wishes not to get wet—this cannot be.\n\nGrand mansions with connected halls and chambers are where people find comfort, yet birds entering them grow anxious. Dense forests and thickets are where people feel fear, yet birds find safety there. Deep ravines and towering trees with sprawling branches are where the *Huándí* delight, yet people shudder at the sight.\n\nWhen a round pellet is rolled on the ground, the spherical one rolls into the marsh, while the square one rests on high ground.\n\nOne in mourning hears music and weeps; one in joy sees tears and laughs. Those who force themselves to weep may appear sorrowful yet feel no grief; those who force themselves to laugh may smile yet feel no joy.\n\nStraw dogs and clay dragons, when first made, are dressed in fine silks and brocades; once their use is done, they are discarded in the dirt. Straw dogs are used in rituals to atone for faults; clay dragons are used to pray for rain. Though their names differ, they share the same principle—just as a butchered ox may be cooked in countless ways, yet it remains one ox.\n\nWhen a *yúzhāng* tree is felled, some parts become coffins, others beams and pillars—yet it is the same wood.\n\nDesolation is the ruler of form; silence is the master of sound.\n\nA guest once visited Zijian, who said: \"You alone commit three faults: smiling when you see me is insolence; speaking intimately despite our shallow acquaintance is recklessness; and not addressing me by name is perversity.\" The same person may be a gentleman or a petty man—it depends on how one views them.\n\nIf one waits for a flying hare to harness and ride, no one in the world will ever mount a chariot. If one waits for Mao Qiang or Xi Shi to marry, one will remain single for life. If one waits for ancient worthies to employ, no one will ever be used. A swift steed covers a thousand *li* in a day, but a mediocre horse, driven ten times over ten days, will also arrive—thus, talent alone cannot be relied upon.\n\nWhen a bird is cornered, it pecks; when a beast is cornered, it gores; when a person is cornered, they deceive.\n\nHarsh punishments and strict laws cannot suppress treachery.\n\nDiscourse on the Dao and virtue is like the sun and moon: south of the Yangtze or north of the Yellow River, their course cannot be altered; racing a thousand *li* cannot change their place.\n\nPreferences and aversions within the bounds of propriety are like the dwellings of a house: the eastern neighbor calls it west, the western neighbor calls it east. Yet when one knocks at the door to borrow fire, none refuse—such is the abundance of generosity. Thus, in the forest, firewood is not sold; by the lake, fish are not hoarded—because there is enough.\n\nOne does not exploit another’s advantage nor press another’s peril.\n\nShu Xiang said to a Mohist: \"Jiu wished to see King Hui of Qin but was denied for three years. Once he reached Chu, the king of Chu delighted in him.\" Some things are naturally near yet seem far, while others are far yet feel near. Thus, one must be flexible.\n\nA true man’s conduct cannot be concealed.\n\nBefore catching the beast, one fears too few wounds; after catching it, one fears too many.\n\nIn ancient marriage rites, the host was never named—only the parents and brothers were mentioned. Shun did not inform Gusou before marrying, which was against ritual. King Wen established Boyi Ke, which was not the proper system. The rites prescribe marriage at thirty, yet King Wen fathered a child at sixteen—this was not the law.\n\nGoverning a state has its constants: benefiting the people is the essence of governance; teaching has its principles, with effective commands as the priority. If it benefits the people’s hearts, there is no need to follow antiquity; if it suits the matter at hand, there is no need to adhere to convention. Laws and decrees are made according to what is fitting. Changing the ancient is not necessarily wrong; following custom is not necessarily praiseworthy.\n\nA hundred rivers flow from different sources yet all return to the sea; a hundred schools pursue different paths yet all aim for order.\n\nA blind man walks along the road: if told to go left, he goes left; if told to go right, he goes right. If he meets a noble person, he finds level ground; if he meets a petty man, he falls into a ditch.\n\nOne who faces east cannot see the western wall; one who faces south cannot see the northern direction—only one without fixed direction sees all.\n\nIf a father is drowning, one grasps his hair to save him—not out of disrespect, but to rescue him from death.\n\nThe highest reward costs nothing; the most severe punishment is not excessive.\n\nWhen sailing and encountering wind, waves rise and one fears death, leaping into the water—not because life is not precious or death not feared, but because the fear of death drives one to forget life.\n\nThose who indulge in desires are the same.\n\nA trickle of water can fill a comb’s case; the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers cannot fill a leaking goblet.\n\nA drunkard stumbles into the Huai, mistaking it for a shallow ditch; a hunchback enters a city gate, thinking it a seven-foot doorway—wine has clouded their minds.\n\nWhen a horse or hare falls into danger, they die and are buried with a mat; when an ox has served people well, it is buried with a great cart.\n\nThe way of warfare is to appear soft yet strike with hardness; to appear weak yet strike with strength. If you wish to go west, show them east, so they know where you emerge but not where you enter—like a ghost leaving no trace, like water leaving no wound, like lightning’s flash, impossible to guard against.\n\nBehind high walls and deep moats, arrows and stones rain down; on broad marshes and open plains, blades clash—yet soldiers vie to advance because rewards are certain and punishments clear.",
      "overlap_context": " than *xidu*; yet a skilled physician stores it, for it has its use. *Xidu* is *fuzi*. Even worthless weeds must not be discarded—how much less a person?\n\nA tree ten spans in girth can support a house of a thousand *jun*; a bolt five inches long can secure a gate’s opening and closing. Not that the material differs in size, but that its position is crucial.\n\nWere Confucius and Mozi to govern the world, the world would become wholly Confucian or Mohist—such is the power of grasping the essential.",

Troops dig wells before they drink; commanders eat only after their men have been fed, thus sharing hunger and thirst. Where arrows and stones fall, they share peril and safety alike.\n\nNothing in the world clings as fiercely as glue and lacquer, yet glue and lacquer corrode each other; once entwined, they cannot return to their original state. Nothing in the world is as opposed as ice and charcoal, yet ice longs for charcoal. When ice meets charcoal, it melts—thus it returns to its original nature.\n\nOrchids bloom in secluded valleys, not ceasing their fragrance for lack of admirers; boats float on rivers and lakes, not refusing to sail for lack of passengers. A man marrying off his daughter instructs her: \"Beware of doing good.\" When she asks why, he replies: \"If even good is not to be done, how much less evil?\"\n\nPrisoners in fetters lament the length of days; those condemned to the execution ground lament their brevity.\n\nA girl married to a man with wasting thirst—when her husband dies, they say she brought misfortune. A robe of white fox fur is worn by the Son of Heaven. Yet to the fox, a marsh is better than a tally.\n\nFirst bind the threads, then weave the hemp, and you may make a curtain; first weave the hemp, then bind the threads, and you cannot make a garment. Marriages arranged through matchmakers may not succeed; friendships formed through personal regard endure. To don a sheepskin and hire oneself out as a laborer is excessive; to wear a raccoon-dog fur while carrying a basket is most strange.\n\nThe noble person admits no unworthy kind; the sun and moon respond only to proper qi.\n\nTo perform rites improperly is like chasing a madman while fleeing, or a thief asking a beggar to copy laws. To squat and recite the *Odes* and *Documents*—\n\nA horse resembling a deer is worth a thousand gold pieces; yet there is no deer worth a thousand gold. Paint Meng Ben’s eyes large, and one cannot help but fear him; paint Xi Shi’s face fair, and one cannot help but delight in her.\n\nFouled by the same filth, no mud differs. A lone straight line is not tolerated among many crooked ones; a lone upright is not tolerated among many bent. Thus, when people are many, they devour wolves; when wolves are many, they devour people.\n\nA man of Ying buys roof beams and trades a chariot hub with another—though the size is sufficient, the length falls short.\n\nA pregnant woman who sees a hare will bear a child with a cleft lip.\n\nDuke Wen discarded his sleeping mat; Jiu Fan resigned and left. When Duke Wen of Jin cast aside the blackened mat, he was casting off the old. Thus Jiu Fan departed, knowing Heaven would grant amnesty and many would be executed. Some knew Heaven’s amnesty would spare many lives, yet people’s hopes aligned while punishments differed.\n\nA dwarf asked a tall man: \"Is the sky higher for you than for me?\" The tall man replied: \"I do not know.\" The dwarf said: \"You are closer to the sky than I.\" To ask about matters, one should ask those nearest.\n\nA man selling his own mother tells the buyer: \"This mother is old.\" He hopes for kind treatment—this is great unrighteousness seeking to appear as small righteousness. A madman who harms others is resented by none, for his illness has robbed him of reason.\n\nBeautiful women do not share the same form, nor do lovely women share the same face, yet all please the eye. Pears, oranges, jujubes, and chestnuts do not share the same taste, yet all delight the palate.\n\nA single move in chess does not reveal wisdom; a single string does not convey sorrow. A posthumous child does not long for his father, for he has no love in his heart.\n\nWhen bathing tools are prepared, ants and lice commiserate; when a grand mansion is completed, swallows and sparrows congratulate.\n\nThe angler stills the water; the netter stirs it; the trapper presses down; the spearer lifts up—though their methods differ, they all catch fish.\n\nWater from the fields flows into the sea; whispers in the ear are heard a thousand *li* away.\n\nIn mid-summer, one wears garments fit for winter and does not remove them; crossing water, one lifts one’s robes, yet on land does not lower them—this is not knowing how to adapt.\n\nDried meat on the cheek is pleasing; on the forehead, it is ugly. Embroidery suits a quilt; on a hat, it is foul.\n\nMountain clouds rise, and pillars grow damp; dodder withers when *fuling* sprouts. Dodder grows without roots; snakes slither without feet; fish hear without ears; cicadas sing without mouths.\n\nA crane lives a thousand years and exhausts its joy; a mayfly lives but a day and exhausts its joy.\n\nA luminous pearl is the clam’s affliction, yet my gain. The brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; the opening of ten windows does not equal the brightness of one door.\n\nTo don a straw raincoat to fight a fire, or to dig a channel to stop water, only increases the trouble.\n\nWhen the swan goose is in the egg, a single finger can crush it; when its wings are fully grown, it soars on its back through the azure sky, its breast brushing the red clouds—even its parents cannot catch it.\n\nHalberds are for storming cities; mirrors are for reflecting forms. Yet an official who obtains a halberd uses it to cut greens, and a blind man who obtains a mirror uses it to cover his wine cup.\n\nYao had eight brows—his brows bore eight lines.\n\nA man cooked a macaque and invited his neighbor. The neighbor thought it dog stew and ate with great relish. Later, hearing it was macaque, he spat it out onto the ground, never having known its true taste.\n\nIn Na and Deng there was a flutist who falsely claimed to be Li Qi. People rushed to learn from him, but when they discovered the truth, they abandoned his melodies—never having known true music.

His attendants said, \"This man was disrespectful and thus incurred guilt—why does the lord grieve so?\" Yu replied, \"The people of Yao took Yao as their heart; now the common folk each take their own heart as their heart—this is why I grieve.\"\n\nDuke Jing of Qi went hunting. Ascending a mountain, he saw a tiger; descending, he saw a snake. He asked Yanzi, \"Is this an ill omen?\" Yanzi replied, \"To have worthies yet not recognize them, to recognize them yet not employ them, to employ them yet not trust them—*that* is an ill omen. Mountains are the tiger’s den, marshes the snake’s lair—what ill omen is there?\"\n\nYanzi attended Duke Jing. The duke, feeling cold at court, requested, \"Bring warm food for me.\" Yanzi replied, \"I am not a kitchen servant but a minister of the altars of soil and grain.\"\n\nDuke Ping of Jin asked Shi Kuang, \"I am seventy and wish to study—is it too late?\" Shi Kuang said, \"When dusk falls, does one not light a candle? I have heard that to learn in youth is like the sunrise’s radiance; to learn in prime is like the midday’s brilliance; to learn in old age is like a candle’s glow—is this not better than darkness?\" The duke said, \"Well said!\"\n\nZengzi wore tattered clothes while plowing. The lord of Lu sent envoys to grant him a city, but he refused, saying, \"I have heard that those who receive from others fear them, and those who give to others grow arrogant. How do I know the lord will not grow arrogant toward me, or that I will not come to fear him?\" Thus he did not accept.\n\nThe official surrenders his person to his lord, his emoluments to his parents. The loyal minister does not serve two lords; the chaste woman does not remarry.\n\nTo dwell without walls yet suffer no harm, to walk without defense yet meet no violence—this is the conduct of the noble man.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu feasted his ministers. The candles went out, and someone tugged at a beauty’s robe. She tore off his cap tassel and told the king. The king said, \"To feast men and let them grow drunk, then expose a woman’s virtue—this I will not do.\" He commanded his attendants not to relight the candles, declaring, \"All who drink with me tonight must tear off their tassels to show they have reveled fully.\" The ministers all tore off their tassels, and only then were the candles relit. Later, in battle with Jin, the man who had tugged the beauty’s robe fought five times to repay King Zhuang.\n\nYang Hu offended the state of Wei and fled north to see Viscount Jian of Zhao, saying, \"From now on, I will no longer cultivate men.\" The men in the hall—more than half were those he had cultivated, yet now they endangered him. Viscount Jian said, \"Those who plant peach and plum trees rest in their shade in summer; those who plant thorns reap their prickles in autumn. The men you have planted are thorns. From now on, choose carefully whom you cultivate.\"\n\nIn governance, do not reject what comes uninvited, nor promise what is merely hoped for. Facing wealth, nothing surpasses integrity; facing abundance, nothing surpasses impartiality. No assault can breach the guard of integrity and impartiality.\n\nA state need not strive to be large, but to win the people’s hearts; an aide need not strive to be numerous, but to obtain the worthy and outstanding.\n\nKing Xuan of Qi asked Master Chunyu Kun, \"What, sir, does this lonely one favor?\" He replied, \"The ancients favored four things, and the king favors three. The ancients favored fine horses, and the king does too. The ancients favored jade, and the king does too. The ancients favored beauty, and the king does too. The ancients favored scholars, but the king does not.\" The king said, \"The state has no scholars—if there were, this lonely one would favor them too.\" He replied, \"The famed steeds *Lu* and *Qi Ji* were not born, yet the king sought them; the cubs of leopards and elephants were not born, yet the king sought them; Mao Qiang and Xi Shi were not born, yet the king sought them—why not seek scholars?\" Yang Hui sought an audience with Viscount Jian of Zhao, saying, \"I was banished from my village three times and left five lords’ service—I heard you favor scholars, so I have come.\" The attendants said, \"Banished three times from his village, he was not tolerated by the crowd; leaving five lords’ service, he was not loyal to his superiors.\" Viscount Jian said, \"A beautiful woman is the enemy of the ugly; a gentleman of great virtue is shunned in troubled times. Upright conduct is hated by the crooked and perverse.\" Thus he employed him as chief minister.\n\nA garment is made with a missing hem, a palace with a missing corner—this shows incompletion, for ghosts and spirits abhor fullness.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou admonished Bo Qin, \"Do not let Lu make you arrogant toward others.\"\n\nA state suffers five colds, and frost is not among them: first, misgovernance; second, epidemics; third, leaked schemes; fourth, disrespect that ruins the state; fifth, neglecting internal affairs while pursuing external ones.\n\nOffice does not seek power, yet power comes of itself; power does not seek wealth, yet wealth comes of itself; wealth does not seek nobility, yet nobility comes of itself; nobility does not seek arrogance, yet arrogance comes of itself; arrogance does not seek guilt, yet guilt comes of itself.\n\nIn Lu there was a reverent scholar who, though seventy, grew ever more reverent. The lord of Lu asked, \"At your advanced age, you may relax your reverence.\" He replied, \"The noble man is reverent to achieve renown; the petty man is reverent to avoid punishment.

Few praise a man, many revile him—how could one not be reverent?\n\nFamine and plague among the people are not to be feared; when high ministers, laden with emoluments, fail to remonstrate to the utmost, and close courtiers, fearing punishment, dare not speak—*this* is the great peril.\n\nZhao Xiangzi asked Zilu, “I once asked Confucius, ‘You have served seventy lords—was there not a single enlightened ruler among them?’ Confucius did not answer. What does it mean to be worthy?” Zilu replied, “If one sets up the world’s great bell but strikes it with a stick, how can it sound? One who sleeps soundly through the night cannot rise early; what flourishes in one place withers in another; what is long on the left is short on the right. When one is exalted and another debased, the depth of their bond is revealed; when one lives and another dies, the truth of their friendship is known.”\n\nThe mouth is a weapon: words spoken amiss rebound to wound oneself.\n\nWhat cinnabar stores turns red; what lacquer stores turns black—the noble man is cautious in what he treasures.\n\nBirds cherish their feathers, tigers and leopards their claws, for these sustain their bodies.\n\nAccumulated kindness becomes *love*; accumulated love becomes *ren*; accumulated *ren* becomes the *Spirit Terrace*.

He replied, “Virtue adorns the state—I have never heard of doing so with concubines and horses.”\n\nZhao Jianzi rode a shabby carriage drawn by a lean horse, and wore a coat of lamb’s wool. His steward said, “A new carriage brings comfort, a fat horse speed, a fox-fur coat warmth—my lord ought to change them.” Jianzi replied, “When a noble man wears fine things, his reverence increases; when a petty man wears fine things, his arrogance grows.” Zigong said to Zishi, “Why not study the *Odes*?” Zishi replied, “My parents demand my filial piety, my brothers my fraternal duty, my friends my trustworthiness—when would I find time to study?” Zigong said, “Set aside my *Odes* and learn from the *Odes*.”\n\nIn the fourth year of the *He Ping* era, the Director of Waterways and Remonstrating Grand Master Liu Xiang memorialized: “The higher the melody, the fewer who can harmonize with it; water both bears the boat and overturns it.”\n\nThe Master of Chuqiu, at seventy, clad in furs, sought audience with Lord Mengchang. The lord said, “You are aged, Master—what instruction can you give me?” The Master replied, “If you wished me to chase chariots, spur horses, pursue deer, and grapple with tigers, I would die at once—what leisure have I for age? But if you would have me resolve doubts and settle hesitations, then I am still young—what age is there in that?” Lord Mengchang flushed with shame.\n\nThe King of Wei wished to build the Terrace of Central Heaven, declaring, “Whoever dares remonstrate shall die.” Xu Wan shouldered a basket and hoe and entered, saying, “I hear Your Majesty plans to build the Terrace of Central Heaven—I wish to offer my strength.” He continued, “I have heard that Heaven is fifteen thousand *li* from Earth; if Your Majesty halves this, the terrace should rise seven thousand five hundred *li*, with a base eight thousand *li* wide. Even if you seized all the land within your realm, it would not suffice for the foundation. You would need to raise troops to conquer the feudal lords and claim their lands—still it would not be enough. You would then have to attack the Western Barbarians to secure the rest. Then you must gather timber, laborers, and provisions. Only when all this is prepared can construction begin.” The King of Wei fell silent and later abandoned the project.\n\nA man sent fish to the Chancellor of Zheng, who refused them. “You are fond of fish—why not accept them?” he was asked. He replied, “It is *because* I am fond of fish that I do not accept them. If I took the fish, I would lose my salary and have no means to eat fish. By refusing the fish, I keep my salary and can eat fish all my life.”\n\nGovern with the wisdom of the old and the vigor of the young, and order is assured. When Azi Qi was sixteen, the Lord of Qi sent him to govern the city of A. Later, the lord regretted it and sent an envoy to recall him. The envoy returned, saying, “Azi Qi will surely govern A well—all those riding with him were white-haired.” When Azi Qi arrived in A, he melted down the armory’s weapons to forge farming tools. The state of Wei said, “We hear a child governs the city—its armories are empty, its granaries bare.” They raised troops to attack. The people of A, fathers leading sons, elder brothers leading younger brothers, fought with their private weapons and routed the Wei forces.\n\n*Fayan* in fifteen fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, annotated by Li Gui and Hong Fan.\n\nTo pursue learning is not as good as to seek a teacher.

Frivolous speech invites sorrow; frivolous conduct invites guilt; frivolous demeanor invites disgrace; frivolous preferences invite calamity.\n\nIf a blade is dull, if a brush lacks sharpness, they must be honed and whetted.\n\nIf Heaven could be measured, its capacity to cover all things would be shallow.

Yet they did not bend their wills, nor debase their persons—they were neither compliant like Yi nor yielding like Hui, but stood firm in their judgments.\n\nThe Dao of Confucius is like the four great rivers, flowing through the Central States and ultimately emptying into the vast sea.\n\n*The Canon of Supreme Mystery* in ten fascicles, composed by Yang Xiong, annotated by Yu Fan.\n\nThe hawk gathers in the forest; the otter enters the spring.\n\nThe turtledove dwells in the woods, mocking the other birds.\n\nKing An of Huainan was rich in ornament but poor in substance.\n\nThe hegemony of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin followed one another like the sun and moon.

The kingly way is pure and unadulterated; its virtue is like that. The hegemonic way is mixed and uneven; its achievements are like this. Though both rule all under Heaven and govern the myriad people, passing down their legacies to their descendants, their essence is one.\n\nIf one fails to become a king, one may still become a hegemon.\n\nThe foundation of governing a state lies in its ministers; their appointments must all be men of great talent. Such great talent forms the limbs and wings of the ruler.\n\nA clear mirror is like divination by tortoise and milfoil; regulations and statutes are like measuring vessels; scales and steelyards are like rulers and foot-measures.\n\nThe outstanding scholars of former ages, who established merit and left behind names, had their portraits painted in palace halls and government chambers—these are the state’s greatest treasures, beyond any price. Though one were to amass He’s jades, pile up Xia’s huang-gems, fill a sack with the Marquis of Sui’s pearl, or a basket with night-shining jewels, it would not suffice as a comparison.\n\nMen like Yi Yin and Zhang Liang have existed in every age—yet if the ruler does not recognize them while the ministers do not exert themselves, they will not be employed.\n\nThere are five ranks of worthies: those who are diligent in family affairs and filial in their clans are scholars of the village; those who are vigorous, astute, and flawless in literature and history are scholars of the county court; those who are sincere and honest, whose conduct is upright and impartial, who manage subordinates and serve superiors, are scholars of the prefecture; those who are well-versed in the classics, whose reputations and conduct are lofty, who can govern with leniency and harmony while maintaining firm resolve, are scholars fit for the imperial court; those whose talents are surpassing and unique, who stand apart from the multitude, who devise grand strategies and can establish merit in the world, are scholars of all under Heaven.\n\nHad Jia Yi not been demoted and lost heart, his literary brilliance would not have flourished; had the Prince of Huainan not been wealthy and prosperous, he could not have widely recruited talented scholars to compose works; had the Grand Historian not been entrusted with records, he could not have systematically chronicled past and present; had Yang Xiong not been poor, he could not have written his profound discourses.\n\nThe Three Benevolent Ones of Yin were obscure in their time but illustrious afterward—what benefit did they bring to affairs? What aid did they give their lord?\n\nThe world has its twilight. Some speak of military strategy: the highest approach is to deploy forces in open terrain, securing victory through mobility; the middling approach is to block and intercept, contending for advantage; the lowest approach is to guard borders, fortifying strongholds, and arising from narrow lands. This is like Lord Xue’s counsel on Ying Bu’s rebellion: the superior plan was to seize the vast lands of Wu and Chu; the middling plan was to block the strategic passes and contend for advantage; the inferior plan was to rely on the Yangtze to face Yue, guarding borders and fortifying strongholds.\n\nWhen the generals and ministers of Gengshi failed to take precautions, they perished in the streets and were born in the tombs.\n\nKing Wen’s burial of dry bones brought no benefit to the common people, yet the people rejoiced—his benevolence and righteousness moved them. Wang Mang’s examination of the five viscera harmed no living person, yet the people loathed him—his cruelty was abhorrent.\n\nDongfang Shuo’s terse words and plain speech were taken as proof of his reliability, and all regarded him as a man of great wisdom, beyond the reach of later worthies. Huan Tan said: To mistake a fox for a wildcat, or a zither for a konghou, is already a false comparison. Yet if one not only fails to recognize the zither or the fox but also does not know the wildcat or the konghou, the error is compounded. To speak only of Shuo is also to fail to recognize later worthies.\n\nIf one accepts others’ praise, one must also accept their criticism. Wang Xi sent the commandant Mengsun to offer sacrifices at Mount Tai. On the way, he passed through Xuzhou, where the governor, Song Zhong, inquired about my talents and compared me to Chen Ping and the Marquis of Liu. Mengsun returned and joyfully told me, “Governor Zhong greatly praised your virtue—are you truly such a man?” I replied, “We have associated for four or five years, yet you never praised me. Now, upon hearing a single word from Governor Zhong, you find it strange. If someone were to slander me, would you also believe it? I fear you.”\n\nPreviously, when I served as Wang Xi’s instructor, a man killed his mother. There was an edict to burn his son’s corpse in the marketplace. I said this was not a matter that should be publicized.",

      "translated_text": "My memorial stated: During Emperor Xuan’s reign, when the high ministers and grandees assembled in court, the Chancellor remarked in passing, “When a *xiao*-owl hatches its young, the fledglings, once grown, devour their mother before they can take flight.” At this, a worthy official responded, “I have only heard of crows whose young return to feed their mother.” The Chancellor was momentarily abashed and repented. People all belittled the Chancellor while esteeming that worthy man, for the worthy man’s words better served moral transformation. Even birds and beasts observe such taboos—how much more should humans? Such matters ought not to be publicized.\n\nA dragon without a foot of water cannot ascend to heaven; a sage without a foot of land cannot rule the world.\n\nProphecies emerge from the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, bearing only omens and portents that remain unknowable. Later generations recklessly embellished and falsely attributed them to Confucius—this is a grave error.\n\nZhang Zihou said, “Yang Ziyun is the Confucius of the Western Way, yet he lived in such poverty.” I replied, “Ziyun is also the Confucius of the Eastern Way. In ancient times, was the Master solely a sage of Lu? Confucius was also the sage of Qi and Chu.”\n\nCarving water or engraving ice melts away with time.\n\nConfucius taught his disciples through the Four Subjects, adapting to their inclinations, much like a marketplace displaying myriad goods—those who wish to purchase come from all directions. I once heard a saying from the streets: “When people hear of the joys of Chang’an, they turn westward at their gates and smile; when they crave the taste of meat, they whistle before the butcher’s stall.” Even ordinary folk, though they may not distinguish the sagely, still yearn and admire.\n\nYan Yuan’s life was cut short because he longed to match Confucius in years. It is like a mediocre horse following a fine steed, nose to tail, until dusk: the fine horse whinnies and eats as before, while the mediocre one hangs its head and refuses fodder—how different are Yan and Confucius from such a pair?\n\nIn my youth, I admired Yang Ziyun’s ornate prose and sought to emulate him. Once, I composed a short *fu*, straining my thoughts so intensely that I fell gravely ill. Ziyun himself said that when Emperor Cheng ordered him to write the *Ganquan Fu*, he collapsed suddenly. His five viscera seemed to burst from his body, and he had to gather them back with his hands. Upon waking, he suffered from qi depletion for a year. From this, it is clear that exhausting one’s thoughts harms the spirit.\n\nWhen Zhuang Zhou’s illness grew severe, his disciples wept before him. He replied, “If I die now, who will precede me? After a hundred years, who will follow? Since none can escape death, why cling to this fleeting moment?”\n\nZigong asked Lian Boyu, “How do you govern the state?” He answered, “I govern it by not governing.”\n\nThe ancient *Classic of Filial Piety* consisted of one scroll, twenty chapters, and 1,872 characters. Today, over four hundred characters differ.\n\nZuoshi said, “The Classics and their commentaries are like clothing: the lining and outer layer depend on each other to be complete.”\n\nYao’s ability to emulate Heaven lay in his esteem for his ability to employ the two sages, Shun and Yu.\n\nLiu Zizheng, Zizheng’s son Jun, and Jun’s nephew Boyu were all learned men, particularly revering the *Zuozhuan* and teaching it to their descendants, even down to the women of the household—this, too, is a form of blindness.\n\nLift a net by its main cord, and a thousand meshes open; grasp a fur coat by its collar, and ten thousand hairs align.",

      "translated_text": "To govern a great state should be like this.\n\nTo replace the worthy with the worthy is called vexation; to replace them with the unworthy is called chaos.\n\nWang Pingzhong said: The *Zhou Genealogy* records that in the fifth year of King Ding, the Yellow River returned to its former course—yet the channel it flows through today is not the one Yu dredged.\n\nYang Ziyun was skilled in *fu* poetry, and Wang Junda was versed in weaponry; I wished to study under both. Ziyun said: “One who can read a thousand *fu* will excel in *fu*.” Junda said: “One who can observe a thousand swords will understand the sword.” The Master said: “Those who secretly practice to emulate divine skill do no more than enter the gate of those they imitate.”\n\nThe five blessings are longevity, wealth and honor, peace and joy, and many descendants.\n\nA centipede with a hundred legs, lifting its body as one—how could it not succeed?\n\nThe Marquis of Quyang summoned the fangshi Ximen Junhui to learn the art of reversing aging. Junhui said: “The tortoise is said to live three thousand years, the crane a thousand—why, with human talent, do we fall short of insects and birds?” I replied: “Who has ever lived long enough among tortoises and cranes to know their true age?”\n\nWhy do sages not study immortality and thus avoid death? Sages all attain liberation of form and ascend as immortals; they speak of death only to show the people that all things have an end.\n\nIn ancient times, when Shennong and Fuxi ruled the world, they made a zither of paulownia wood, three *chi* and six *cun* long with six *fen*, corresponding to the number of the twelve months. It was one *cun* and eight *fen* thick, corresponding to the three yang and six yin numbers. Its width was six *fen*, corresponding to the six pitch-pipes. The top was rounded and tapered, modeling Heaven; the bottom was square and level, modeling Earth. The top was broad and the bottom narrow, reflecting the rites of hierarchy.\n\nThe zither (*qin*) means “to restrain.” The sages of old played the zither to cultivate the mind. In adversity, they preserved their integrity alone, never losing their resolve—thus it was called *cao* (“resolve”). In success, they brought good to all under Heaven, with nothing left unharmonized—thus it was called *chang* (“harmony”).\n\nYao’s *Changjing* melody is lost; Shun’s *Cao* was clear and subtle; the Viscount of Wei’s *Cao* was clear and pure; Jizi’s *Cao* was pure and stirring.\n\n*Lunheng* by Wang Chong, twenty-seven scrolls:\nVirtue and conduct may be constant, but official position is not.\nWorthiness or unworthiness lies in talent; encounter or lack of it lies in timing.\nOne of high talent and pure conduct cannot be assured of noble rank; one of meager ability and impure conduct cannot be assured of lowly status.\nSome share the same conduct yet serve different lords—Yi Yin and Jizi are examples. Both were ministers for the ages: Yi Yin met Tang of Shang and became his chief minister, while Jizi met Zhou of Shang and became a slave. Thus we know the difference between encounter and lack of it.\n\nThe pure receives dust, the white receives grime. Where the green fly soils, it is always on fine white silk.\n\nVillage dogs bark in packs at what they find strange.\n\nThe zither player wishes Bo Ya’s fingers would break; the charioteer wishes Wang Liang’s hands would be severed—both resent those who surpass them.\n\nJade turns to stone, stone to gravel—slander brings this about. The jade-seeker breaks stone to obtain jade; the talent-selector discards the bad to choose the good. Fate does not strain.\n\nThe wise attribute it to Heaven. To seek wealth and honor is like digging a ditch or chopping firewood: dig without ceasing, and the ditch grows deep; swing the axe without pause, and the firewood piles high. Yet some dig a ditch only to meet a flood, or gather firewood only to meet a fire.\n\nEmbracing poverty averts disaster. Exert yourself in diligent work to attain wealth; hone your talent and refine your conduct to gain nobility.\n\nThe farmer who plows with strength reaps abundant grain; the merchant who travels far gains deep profit. Those destined for wealth naturally strengthen their sinews; those destined for nobility naturally heighten their talent—like the thousand-mile horse, whose vigor, keen eyes, head, hooves, and feet all match one another.\n\nThe wooden gate of Lu’s city wall had rotted and was about to collapse; Confucius hurried past it.

      "translated_text": "Confucius said: “I detest its long decay—should it collapse, misfortune would follow.”\n\nA worm falls into a vessel, and the wine is cast out, undrunk; a rat gnaws through a basket, and the rice is discarded, uneaten.\n\nThe Mohists say that when a man dies, there is no fate; the Confucians say that when a man dies, there is fate. The commandery of Liyang transformed into a lake in a single night; Bai Qi buried four hundred thousand Zhao soldiers alive—were these, too, matters of fate?\n\nThose who speak of fate say: “They were fated to drown, so they gathered at Liyang; they were fated to be crushed, so they gathered on the plain.” When the Lord of Pei first rose in rebellion, men entered the markets of Feng and Pei, saying: “Many here will be enfeoffed as marquises.” A man’s fate is bound to his state; a creature’s fate is struck by man.\n\nThe people of Qi are leisurely, the people of Qin are careless, the people of Chu are hasty, the people of Yan are bold—each of the four states’ peoples intermingle and move among one another.\n\nZhang Cigong took a shamaness from the neighboring village as his wife. A diviner said: “This woman is destined for nobility.” Later, Cigong rose to the rank of Chancellor, and indeed, it was Cigong himself who was noble, thus matching the woman’s fate.\n\nThe world speaks of dwellings having fortune or misfortune, of moving house requiring auspicious months. I say the Dao of Heaven is hard to know—if there are those who offend it, it is because their fate is one of fortune or misfortune. Consider Jing Bu, who was to be executed before becoming a king; Wei Qing, who was to be enfeoffed like Zhou Yafu yet starved to death; Deng Tong, who was to suffer poverty and hunger—each had bones, joints, and skin unlike the others.\n\nKing Wen had four nipples while still in his mother’s womb; he was not born through later cultivation of virtue and power. Hou Ji, as a child, played at sowing seeds; Confucius, as a boy, arranged ritual vessels for amusement. Stone is born hard; orchids are born fragrant. Born with good qi, they grow and achieve fulfillment.\n\nThe mosquito is no match for the strength of oxen and horses, yet horses are tormented by mosquitoes—such is the power of circumstance. A bull ten spans in girth is driven by a lowly herdsman; an elephant several fathoms tall is hooked by a Yue boy—such is the lack of advantage.\n\nWhen Confucius blew the pitch pipes, he knew himself to be a descendant of the Yin; Xiang Yu had double pupils, a scion of Yu Shun. The sage has his own lineage—how could Yao and Gaozu truly be sons of dragons?\n\nDuke Jing of Song spoke three virtuous words and gained thirty-one years of reign; when Prince Dan of Yan was held captive in Qin, Heaven rained grain, horses grew horns, Qi Liang’s wife wept and the city walls collapsed; during Tang’s drought, he cut his hair and offered himself as a sacrifice to bring rain; Magistrate Zhuo of Nanyang, as Prefect of Weishi, kept locusts from entering his borders; Sunshu Ao buried a two-headed snake and accrued hidden virtue—all these are said to be false.\n\nIf the dragon had fled into the trees to escape Heaven’s punishment, it would not be divine. If it were truly divine, it would not have dragon’s liver or leopard’s fetus. Thus, it is known that when water and fire clash, they create thunder, and the dragon rises at the sound of thunder.\n\nKing Wu’s conquest of Zhou was said to be “without blood on the blades”—a false claim. At dawn, torches were lit, and blood flowed so thickly it floated the pestles—how could it be called “without blood on the blades”? When the Han forces executed Wang Mang and reached the Gradual Terrace, blood flowed over their ankles. No army in the world has ever fought without blood on its blades.\n\nZhou’s wine pools and grain mounds were said to host three thousand men drinking like oxen. They feasted through the long night, losing track of days, with chariots carrying wine and riders bearing roasted meat, counting one hundred and twenty days as a single month. In truth, Zhou may have spilled wine copiously upon the earth, thus naming it a “pool,” or piled fermented grain, thus naming it a “mound.” To say wine was made into pools, chariots carried wine, and meat was hung in forests, or that men and women stripped naked and chased one another through the woods—these were slanders of the attendants, who claimed three thousand men were involved, when in fact there were not.\n\nThe term *heding* refers to Jing Ke’s case: the Qin king executed Jing Ke’s entire clan, razing his village, so that every household was destroyed—hence the saying *tingting*. Yet even in Qin’s lawlessness, it is unlikely the entire village was exterminated. When the First Emperor visited Liangshan Palace and saw Li Si’s grand procession, he found it strange. His attendants secretly informed Li Si, who then reduced his retinue. The First Emperor, not knowing which of his attendants had spoken, executed all those nearby—Jing Ke’s village would not have been entirely wiped out.\n\nLu Ban carved a great goose that flew for three days without landing; he made a wooden cart and wooden figures to pull it for his mother, but once the mechanism was activated, it departed and never returned—this is likely untrue. Confucius traveled to over seventy states to offer counsel. Yet from his return to Lu from Wei, his starvation in Chen, his erasure of traces in Wei, and his felling of a tree in Song, he visited no more than ten states.\n\nZigao wept blood for three years without ever showing his teeth—how could he not show his teeth if he did not laugh or speak? When Qin Xi shattered his skull to recommend Baili Xi to Duke Mu of Qin, it was likely a case of kowtowing until his head bled, not truly shattering his skull.\n\nZu Yi admonished Zhou, saying: “There is no one in the world who does not wish for Your Majesty’s downfall.” This is an exaggeration—it was meant to frighten Zhou. If the entire world truly wished for Zhou’s fall, the realm would have dissolved at once, and there would have been no battle where blood flowed thick enough to float pestles.\n\nThe Master asked Zigong: “Between you and Yan Hui, who is the better?” Zigong replied: “Yan Hui—he hears one thing and understands ten.”",

      "translated_text": "Confucius knew full well that Yan Hui surpassed Zigong—why then did he ask? Had he asked, how could Zigong have dared claim superiority? The Master’s intent was likely to curb Zigong’s envy of Yan Hui by posing the question to humble him.\n\nWhen [Confucius’s son] Li died, he was buried in a coffin without an outer casket. At that time, grand officers rode in carriages drawn by three horses—why not sell one to purchase a casket? When he had been a knight, he rode in a carriage drawn by two horses, and selling one to aid an old acquaintance would not have disrupted the ritual order. Yet to bury one’s son without a casket was truly improper. How could he value the favor of an old friend over the rites due between father and son? If he did not sell his carriage to bury his son, was it not because he coveted his official position?\n\nBoyi and Shuqi, when their elder half-brother seized the throne, starved to death on Mount Shouyang—not because they yielded the state to their half-brother, so how could they be called worthy men?\n\nWhen Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the realm and failed, in his rage he struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Nüwa smelted stones of five colors to mend the azure sky and cut off the legs of the great turtle to prop up the four extremities. Yet if Gonggong had the strength to shatter mountains, why did he lose the battle? If Nüwa could mend the sky with stones, was the sky truly made of jade? Heaven’s pillars were originally mountains—how could turtle legs support them? The turtle must have been enormous, so how could Nüwa have killed it? She would have been slain herself—how then could she have mended the sky?\n\nThe Gate of Heaven lies in the north, the Portal of Earth in the east. The lowest regions of the earth are Yangzhou and Yanzhou, which suffered the worst flooding during the Great Deluge. Heaven’s adornments—sun, moon, and stars—are called its *patterns*; earth’s adornments—mountains, rivers, ridges, and valleys—are called its *principles*. Earth’s principles face upward, heaven’s patterns face downward, and when earth and heaven unite in qi, the myriad things are born. Heaven and earth are husband and wife. The south of heaven is high, the north low; thus the sun is visible when it rises high but vanishes when it sinks low. Heaven’s form resembles an inclined canopy. If the canopy rested on the earth, it could not revolve; only when suspended from a tree can it turn. The sun does not enter the earth—it is like a man carrying a torch at night on level ground: ten *li* away, the light disappears, though it has not been extinguished. The sun is the same. Clouds, mist, rain, and snow all arise from the earth; they do not descend from heaven. In summer, mist forms; in winter, frost; in warmth, rain; in cold, snow.\n\nMen of talent follow the world’s currents, while men of principle guard narrow passes and flee into obscurity. Those who follow the currents grow daily more cunning; those who retreat grow daily more inept. It is not that their talents or wisdom are unequal, but that their habits differ. In Qi Prefecture, every girl learns embroidery; in Xiangyi, every girl masters brocade-weaving—because their eyes see it and their hands grow accustomed to it.\n\nIn the court, those who are young and called capable officials treat the court like farmland, their brushes and documents like plows and hoes, and their paperwork like farming and sericulture. Like the children of a household, they grow up accustomed to its ways, knowing every twist and turn better than any guest. Even a man of Confucius’s or Mozi’s talent could not discern the difference. A man with no money in hand who wishes to buy goods will find no merchant willing to sell to him; a man with no learning in his breast who seeks office is like a man with no money trying to buy goods—it cannot be done. To know the past but not the present is called *submerged on land*; to know the present but not the past is called *blindness*. One may not see how the hooves of a swift steed differ from those of an ordinary horse until it gallops a thousand *li* across level ground. Here is a man whose wisdom is like a spring and whose virtue is like a mountain, yet his strength cannot lift himself—he must rely on others to raise him, but no one does. Exiled to a secluded alley, he has no way to emerge. An empty vessel holds no food, so the hungry pay it no heed; an empty breast holds no learning, so the court does not employ it. The officials of the Orchid Terrace—Ban Gu, Jia Kui, Yang Xiong, and Fu Yi—were renowned for their elegant writings, yet they were of no great use. A man who can expound one classic is a scholar; one who has read widely in past and present is a man of broad learning; one who culls and compiles books and records to present memorials is a man of letters; one who can ponder deeply and compose connected chapters is a great scholar. Men like Liu Xin and his son, Yang Xiong, and Huan Junshan were like King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, all appearing in the same age. Ban Shupi continued *The Records of the Grand Historian* for over a hundred chapters, recording events in meticulous detail, so that readers mistook it for the original work of Sima Qian. Ban Mengjian’s writings surpassed his uncle’s by far more than five hundred *li*.\n\nWhen a tortoise reaches three hundred years, it grows no larger than a coin; when a milfoil reaches seventy years, it sprouts but a single stem. These are numinous creatures, so they grow slowly and live long. The worthy scholars of the world are like the sacred tortoise and divine milfoil. The maple and paulownia grow swiftly, so their bark is thick but not sturdy. The sandalwood and jujube bloom late, yet their wood is strong enough to make axle-pins.\n\nIn swift rapids, the current swirls sand and rolls stones, yet great boulders remain unmoved—because the stones are heavy and the sand light. The great scholars and vulgar officials of the world are like this.\n\nThe heart of High Heaven resides in the breast of the sage, and its reproofs issue from the sage’s mouth. Without sages in the world, how could one know Heaven?\n\nMan dwells between heaven and earth like a flea or louse in clothing, or an ant in its nest.\n\nAt the morning audience, the winds from the four directions are observed: a wind from the south brings drought; from the north, floods; from the east, plague; from the west, war.\n\nWhen the Qin were about to fall, the gates of their capital collapsed. When Huo Guang met with ruin, the thatched wall of his house also collapsed. Why did the wife of Qi Liang cause the city to crumble?\n\nWhen a hunting dog is lost in the mountains, calling its name makes it howl in response. Though man and dog are different species, they respond to each other because the dog recognizes its master.\n\nWhen the east wind arrives, wine overflows. Wine’s flavor is sour, and the east is the direction of wood, whose flavor is also sour—hence the wine overflows.\n\nBefore a general amnesty is granted, the locks of the prison move in response.\n\nWhen silkworms spin their cocoons, the strings of a merchant’s zither break; when the new grain is harvested, the old grain is exhausted. When a child is born, the parents’ qi declines.",
      "overlap_context": "shattering his skull.\n\nZu Yi admonished Zhou, saying: “There is no one in the world who does not wish for Your Majesty’s downfall.” This is an exaggeration—it was meant to frighten Zhou. If the entire world truly wished for Zhou’s fall, the realm would have dissolved at once, and there would have been no battle where blood flowed thick enough to float pestles.\n\nThe Master asked Zigong: “Between you and Yan Hui, who is the better?” Zigong replied: “Yan Hui—he hears one thing and understands ten.”",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nWhen the \"Disorderly Dragon\" appears, disorder will come to an end. Liu Zizheng and Dong Zhongshu did not fully explain the dragon, but the *Lunheng* completed their discourse—hence the term \"Disorderly Dragon.\"\n\nA fisherman carves wood into the shape of a fish, paints its body with red lacquer, and sets it afloat upon the water. As it rises and moves with the current, fish mistake it for a real one and gather around. If even a clay dragon can summon clouds and rain, why should a wooden fish fail to attract them?\n\nWhen Shaogong Mao was in Lu, he stood alongside Confucius. Confucius’s gate saw three waves of followers filling and emptying it—only Yan Yuan never left, for he recognized Confucius’s sageliness.\n\nThe \"Bending Elm\" grew in the courtyard, pointing at flatterers whenever they appeared. If this were truly so, why would Shun have needed Gaoyao to expound the art of discerning men?\n\nWhen Yao and Tang suffered floods and droughts, were these calamities caused by the governance of these two sages? They were merely the natural workings of heaven’s principle and the celestial reckoning—like a compassionate father managing his household, who cannot ensure all his descendants will be filial.\n\nThe nephew of the elder brother of Langya, Ming, once saw his brother about to be eaten by starving men. The younger brother bound himself, kowtowed, and offered to take his brother’s place. Moved by his righteousness, the starving men spared them both. Later, when the elder brother died, Ming raised his orphan. During a year of famine, he killed his own son to save his brother’s child. Xu Junsheng of Linhuai also starved, yet killed his own son to preserve his brother’s orphan.\n\nMen value magpies and despise parrots because magpies are distant while parrots are near. Painters favor depicting men of high antiquity and avoid portraying scholars of the Qin and Han because they revere the ancient. When Yang Xiong wrote the *Tai Xuan* and *Fa Yan*, Zhang Bosong refused even to glance at them, for he walked shoulder to shoulder with the man—thus he belittled his words. Had Yang Xiong lived in the Zhou, his works would have been stored in golden caskets.\n\nWhen King Wu attacked Zhou, the Grand Duke employed a secret scheme: he fed a child cinnabar to turn his body red and taught him to cry, \"Yin is doomed! Yin is doomed!\" When the people of Yin saw the child’s crimson body, they took him for a celestial spirit, and hearing his cries of doom, believed their kingdom would surely fall. The people of Zhou later concealed this affair.\n\nWhen ancient sage-kings established great virtue, they required ministers of great eloquence to eulogize and record their achievements. A dragon without clouds and rain cannot ascend to the heavens. Ministers of great eloquence are a state’s clouds and rain. Through their writings, men’s conduct is borne and their virtues transmitted—how could this be mere play with brush and ink, an empty display of ornate beauty?\n\nMan’s life is essence and qi. What produces essence and qi is the blood and vessels. When a man dies, his blood and vessels are exhausted, his essence and qi vanish, and his bones and flesh turn to ash and dust—how then could he become a ghost? If it is said the dead have no awareness, the sages feared opening the door to impiety, so they did not declare the dead devoid of knowledge—though in truth, they are without it.\n\nIt is taboo to raise a child born in the fifth month, for it is said such a child brings misfortune to its parents. Yet Tian Wen did no harm to Tian Ying. Sharpening a blade by the well stirs fear of falling in. Moreover, the character for \"punishment\" combines \"knife\" and \"well.\" Sharpening a blade by the well thus evokes the dread of punishment—such is the intent of men.\n\nDo not lie supine like a corpse. Do not pass objects hand to hand, for the exchange will not be secure.\n\nConfucius said: Washing one’s hair on a *zi* day makes one beloved; washing on a *mao* day makes one go gray. Love and hate, black and white—these do not depend on the day of washing. If a mother and child washed their hair on a *zi* day, could men truly love them? If fifteen youths washed their hair on a *mao* day, could they truly be made gray-haired?\n\nWhen Zilu saw Confucius, he observed that the shoulder blade of an ox could yield omens—why resort to turtle shells and milfoil stalks? Confucius replied: \"Milfoil\" (*shi*) means \"venerable,\" and \"turtle\" (*gui*) means \"ancient.\" In matters of doubt, one should consult the venerable and ancient. The turtle and milfoil are not divine—they are used merely for their names. When King Wu attacked Zhou, the first divination yielded great inauspiciousness. The Grand Duke overturned the stalks and trampled the turtle, saying, \"How can dead bones and withered grass know good or ill fortune?\"\n\nThe gates of a merchant’s household should not face south; the gates of a military household should not face north. Yet if a hall is built facing due south, why does no one choose otherwise?\n\nThe sage foresees a thousand years into the past and ten thousand into the future. As Confucius lay dying, he left behind a letter saying: \"A man will come claiming to be the First Emperor of Qin. He will turn my robes upside down and meet his end at Shāqiū.\" Later, the First Emperor of Qin indeed perished at Shāqiū. Confucius also said: \"Dong Zhongshu will disorder my books.\" Later, Zhongshu wrote commentaries on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. He further said: \"The one who will destroy Qin is Hu.\" Hu Hai later overthrew Qin—this was Confucius’s foresight of ten thousand generations. His ability to know the descendants of Yin by blowing pitch-pipes was his foresight of a thousand years.\n\nThe Tang was vast and boundless—none could name its virtue. The Yu was joyous; the Xia, great; the Yin, central; the Zhou, perfect. Where the will is fixed, one overlooks even Mount Tai. He who knows the leak in the roof stands beneath the eaves; he who knows the peace of governance dwells among the common folk; he who knows entanglement and error studies the various masters.\n\nThe *Lunheng* weighs light and heavy, establishes truth and falsehood—not to indulge in mere literary embellishment or ornate novelty, but to enlighten the customs of the age.\n\nWang Chong, styled Zhongren, was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. His writings were forthright and easy to examine, yet their language did not align with common usage. Jade is rare among stones, and rarity makes it precious; dragons are few among fish, and fewness makes them divine. When others found his books cumbersome, Chong replied: \"When words are many, they surpass the few; when wealth is abundant, poverty is all the more wretched. If the world has not a single citation, I have a hundred chapters; if others have not a single character, I have ten thousand words—who then is to be valued?\"\n\nIn the second year of Zhanghe, Chong moved his family to avoid disaster. Over the years, his work gradually fell into neglect. As he neared seventy, his time could have been spent in a suspended carriage, but his hair turned white, his teeth fell out, his peers dwindled, and poverty left him without means. His aspirations unfulfilled, he wrote the *Yangxing* in sixty chapters. In five volumes of *Zheng Lun*, Cui Yuanshi—seeing himself as a trusted minister—guarded his words like a sealed bag to preserve his salary. Those distant from power spoke only to be dismissed as base. Thus, the royal net slackened above, and wise scholars languished below.\n\nWhen a ruler’s governance declines, it is like riding a decrepit carriage. Yet if one seeks a skilled craftsman to mend it—splicing where it breaks, wedging where it loosens—it can be made new again.",

Even the worthy and sagacious must proceed gradually—how much more so for those of middling talent? Frequent replacements only lead to confusion and missteps on the path.\n\nIn ancient times, there were originally no slaves or bondservants. Slaves and bondservants were all those who had committed offenses. \"Slave\" (*nu*) means \"inferior,\" while \"bondservant\" (*bi*) means \"base and lowly.\"\n\nA local saying goes: \"To take office is a boundless expanse—half of those who resent it die.\" Even in an era of clarity and peace, when enlightened and compassionate gentlemen adjudicated cases with pity and restraint, there were still resentful words—how much more so in the present age? Ying Shao was a man of the Three Kingdoms period; this was a saying of his time.\n\nWhen Emperor Guangwu of Han moved his capital to Luoyang, he transported plain bamboo slips and paper, with a total of two thousand cartloads of classics. When Dong Zhuo overturned the royal house and the Son of Heaven was forced west, in the haste and chaos, seventy carts of books were carried along the road. Caught in the rain, half were discarded, and Dong Zhuo later burned the Bright Hall and its pavilions, reducing all the classics to ashes. What little remained was sometimes used to make sacks and curtains. The Dao of the former kings nearly vanished entirely.\n\nPopular belief holds that those granted gold as a reward received yellow gold. According to *Sunzi’s Art of War*, \"daily expenses amount to a thousand gold.\" A thousand gold means a million coins. When Chen Ping advised the Chu, he sent a thousand gold to the two Shu brothers. Fifty *jin* of gold—all of it yellow gold. Some say \"one gold\" refers to ten thousand coins.\n\nIt is said that one should not raise three children born at the same time. The common belief is that it resembles the breeding of livestock and harms the parents. Yet according to the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the *Discourses of the States*, in the time of the King of Yue, the people were given surplus grain if they bore two children, and a wet nurse if they bore three. Thus Yue destroyed the mighty Wu—what harm was there in it?\n\nOne should not raise a child born in the same month as one’s father. The common belief is that it harms the father. Yet according to the *Zuozhuan*, Duke Huan of Lu had a son born in the same month as himself, and so named the child \"Born Together.\"\n\nEmperor Ming of Han was also born in the same month as Emperor Guangwu. It is improper to return a bride to her natal home after marriage. The common belief is that it brings misfortune. The reason is that a woman’s beauty might lead her to exchange her daughter for another man’s son, so such returns are forbidden.\n\nAs for the sealing of Mount Tai, popular belief holds that atop the Sacred Peak lies a golden basket and jade tally, which can reveal a person’s lifespan. Emperor Wu of Han retrieved one that read \"eighteen,\" but upon reading it backward, declared it \"eighty.\" In truth, when the Sacred Peak was sealed, a stone stele twelve feet high was erected, inscribed with the words: \"Serve Heaven with ritual, establish oneself with righteousness, serve one’s father with filial piety, and achieve renown with benevolence.

If one claims it was read backward, the divine would be without blessing.\n\nI have humbly served at the Eastern Peak for six years, frequently performing prayers and sacrifices. Inquiring of the elders and those who have ascended Mount Tai, none have spoken of a golden basket or jade tally for divining lifespan.\n\nDongfang Shuo was said to be the essence of Venus, serving as Feng Hou in the time of the Yellow Emperor, as Wu Chengzi in the time of Yao, and later being reborn in Yue as Fan Li, then in Qi as Zhe Yi Zi—such tales speak of his ceaseless transformations. Yet, Shuo was merely a master of wit and humor; common folk ascribed strange words to him, but how could he be a deity?\n\nWhen the Governor of Pengcheng, Biao, came of age, his father, Bo Chu, was serving as Guanglu Qing. During the mourning period, Bo Chu fathered a child and, deeming it the greatest filial failing to leave no heir, raised the boy himself. A gentleman does not conceal his faults, so he named the child *Fu* (\"Mourning Garment\").\n\nNow, Biao’s courtesy name was *Yuanshu* (\"First Garment\"). His mother was from Runan, and his grandfather, named Jing, served as Palace Attendant. During Emperor An’s reign, Biao was born, and the hundred officials came to congratulate the elderly grandfather on the birth of his grandson. Delighted by this auspicious occasion, they named the child *He* (\"Congratulation\") and gave him the courtesy name *Yuanshu*. His father, Bo Chu, governed three commanderies and, after his wife’s early death, refused to remarry. On his deathbed, he instructed his son: \"Simply bury me here; do not retrieve your mother’s coffin. If the dead have awareness, coming and going will not be difficult; if they have none, it would only be a burden.\" Such was his lofty integrity—how could he have fathered a child during mourning and named him *He*?\n\nWang Shu of Runan and his son Fang once set out on a journey and did not return for over twenty years. Shu served as a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat. When someone reported that his son Fang had died in Runan, Shu immediately dispatched his elder brother, Bo San, to retrieve the coffin. He then donned mourning garments and issued an edict, sending twenty thousand coins in condolence. Later, Fang returned from Cangwu, and Shu petitioned the court to return the condolence money, accepting the charge of falsehood.\n\nEmperor Ling summoned the ministers and grandees to deliberate the matter. The Academician Ren Min argued: \"The average lifespan is seventy years; when a father sees his son as his peer, the son’s death may warrant mourning. But Fang was far away, and the report of his death could not be verified—no punishment should be imposed.\"",

      "translated_text": "The imperial edict returned the money and restored Shu to his original office.\n\nIn Runan, Zhang Miao attended a gathering at Du Shi’s home. During the feast, in jest, Zhang Miao bound Du Shi and struck him twenty times, then suspended him by his toes until Du Shi died. Bao Yu ruled on the case, stating: \"They were jesting while drunk; his original intent held no malice. He should be absolved of the death penalty.\"\n\nIn Runan, Zhou Wengzhong’s wife gave birth to a daughter, while the wife of a butcher bore a son. Wengzhong’s wife secretly exchanged money to take the butcher’s son as her own. Later, Wengzhong became the governor of Beihai. He sent his clerk, Zhou Guang, to accompany the boy in offering sacrifices at the ancestral tomb. Upon returning, the clerk said to Wengzhong: \"At the sacrificial site, I saw only the butcher’s son, dressed in tattered clothes, wielding a knife to carve the meat. Another figure, wearing a green sash, stood in the eastern chamber, hesitant and unwilling to approach. Why was this?\" Wengzhong drew his sword and questioned his wife, who confessed the truth. Wengzhong declared: \"Those who have sons do so to continue their ancestors’ line. If the ancestors refuse to accept the offering, what use is it?\" He then sent the boy back to the butcher’s family by carriage and horse, and retrieved his daughter. The daughter had already been married to a pastry seller, but he brought her home and betrothed her to Li Wensi of Anping. Wensi later rose to the position of governor of Nanyang. The spirits do not partake of offerings from those not of their kind—how could one raise another’s child?\n\nIn Chenliu, a wealthy elder of ninety had no sons. He married a peasant girl, but died after a single night. Later, she bore a son. When the child grew older, the elder’s eldest daughter said: \"Our father married her and died after one night—this child is not his.\" They contested the inheritance for years without resolution. The Chancellor, You Ji, ruled: \"An old man’s child casts no shadow and cannot endure the cold.\" It was the eighth month, so he gathered children of the same age and had them all undress for testing. The elder’s child alone cried from the cold, and at midday, indeed cast no shadow. The inheritance was thus awarded to the daughter.\n\nIn Yingchuan, two brothers lived together, and both their wives were pregnant. The elder wife’s fetus was injured in the third month, but she did not speak of it. When the time came for the younger wife to give birth, both women lay in the birthing chamber. The younger wife bore a son, but the elder wife stole him in the night. They disputed the matter for three years without resolution. The Chancellor, Huang Ba, ordered the child placed ten paces from each mother and commanded them to retrieve him. The elder wife clutched the child tightly, and he wailed loudly. The younger wife, fearing harm, released him, while the elder wife’s face lit with joy. The younger wife wept in sorrow. Huang Ba declared: \"This is the younger wife’s son.\" He then indicted the elder wife, who confessed her guilt.\n\nIn Linhuai, a man took a bolt of silk to the market to sell it. Caught in the rain, he draped it over himself. Another man sought shelter beneath it, claiming space for his head. When the rain ceased, they quarreled over the silk. The Chancellor, Xue Xuan, intervened: \"The silk is worth only a few hundred coins—why this dispute?\" He cut it in half and gave each a portion. Upon closer inspection, the silk’s owner cried out in injustice, while the other man showed satisfaction. Xue Xuan discerned the truth and, upon interrogation, forced a confession.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou’s music was called *Shao*, meaning \"to pour and deliberate the Way of the ancestors.\" King Wu’s music was called *Wu*, signifying the pacification of the realm. Shun’s music was called *Shao*, meaning \"to continue,\" as he continued Yao’s legacy. Yao’s music was called *Dazhang*, meaning \"to manifest.\" Emperor Yu’s music was called *Wuying*, meaning \"flourishing.\" Liu Xiang said: \"The *shang* note represents completion, for things reach fulfillment and can be measured. The *jiao* note represents sprouting, for things break through the earth with sharp points. The *gong* note represents the center; the *zhi* note represents prosperity, for things flourish and abound. The *yu* note represents shelter, for things gather and are covered.\"\n\nHearing the *gong* note makes one warm and expansive; hearing the *shang* note makes one upright and fond of righteousness; hearing the *jiao* note makes one orderly and fond of ritual; hearing the *zhi* note makes one compassionate and broadly loving; hearing the *yu* note makes one nurturing and fond of learning.\n\nThe pipa was created by musicians of recent generations, though its maker is unknown. Its name derives from the motion of the hands (*pi* and *pa*). It is three feet and five inches long, corresponding to Heaven, Earth, Man, and the Five Phases. Its four strings represent the four seasons.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"It is beneficial to see the great person.\" The great person and the sage share the same meaning.\n\nThe *Analects* states: \"The noble person ascends.\" Zang Sunhe said: \"The next one to ascend will surely be Kong Qiu.\" The term *ru* (Confucian) means \"to distinguish,\" separating the worthy from the foolish across past and present. The Zhang family of the time called Jia Kui a \"comprehensive Confucian,\" and people would say: \"Ask Jia Longtou about anything, and he will never tire.\"\n\nThe *Rites* state: \"When five people live in a thatched hut, the eldest must have a separate mat.\" Today, calling the powerful \"elders\" is incorrect.\n\nGuanzi said: \"The teacher imparts instruction, and the disciple follows—this is not knowledge of the ancient Way, but the title of the teacher.\" The term *disciples* refers to many students. Thus it is said: \"Among the teachers, one must be sober; among the students, all are drunk. When all are drunk, only the sober one presides over the libation.\" The *Rites* state: \"When drinking wine, one must offer a libation to honor one’s ancestors.\" When Xun Qing was in Qi, he was the most senior teacher, hence he was thrice called the \"libation officer.\" The *Book of Songs* states: \"The men of Yin are keen and swift; the eminent scholars are outstanding; the refined scholars are broadly learned; the ranked scholars have unchanging duties; the reclusive scholars speak freely.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"In leading the army, steadfastness in the elder brings good fortune.\" This does not merely honor age, but requires virtue and conduct surpassing others. The *Commentary* states: \"To rely on virtue, nothing is better than trustworthiness—such virtue can be trusted and relied upon.\"\n\nThe *Rites* state: \"Ten feet is called a *zhang*, the height of a grown man.\" The term *fu* (husband) means \"skin,\" signifying that his wisdom is keen and his teaching expansive. Thus, he is called a *zhangfu* (husband).\n\nThe *Analects* states: \"The common man and common woman.\" The *Commentary* states: \"One day and one night make a day; one man and one woman make a household.\" According to the ancients, two bolts of cloth were used to make clothes for a man and woman. Today, people wear single-layer garments, hence the term *pi* (bolt).\n\nWhen a man undergoes the dragon transformation and rises, he does not strike at his village. If he merely conforms to customs and, upon seeing goodness, does not emulate it, he is called a \"common person.\"",

Later, Fang returned from Cangwu, and Shu petitioned the court to return the condolence money, accepting the charge of falsehood.\n\nEmperor Ling summoned the ministers and grandees to deliberate the matter.

But Fang was far away, and the report of his death could not be verified—no punishment should be imposed.\"",

      "translated_text": "The inauspicious and the auspicious were spoken without taboo; sorrow and fear intertwined in the heart. Funeral preparations were already made, yet joy and grief faced one another. Boren remained in the post station for several tens of days before departing. He was appointed Palace Attendant and President of the Imperial Secretariat, then promoted to Inspector of the Capital Region. He recommended Ying Rong to succeed him, and Rong subsequently governed five commanderies. Xie Zhuo was not deemed worthy of recruitment by the imperial court.\n\nIn high antiquity, people dwelt among the grasses and lodged beneath the frost. In winter, they resided on the southern slopes of mountains; in summer, on the northern slopes.\n\nThe Filial and Incorrupt Candidate from Pengcheng, Zhang Zijiao, argued: \"If rulers and ministers could not share the same given names, then King Mu of Zhou, whose name was Man, would not have had a descendant named Sun Man in the time of King Ding.\"\n\nKing Li’s name was Hu, and King Zhuang’s son was also named Hu.\n\nA common saying goes: \"Those who take office in the fifth month will be dismissed without promotion.\" This year, a candidate of exceptional talent was appointed magistrate of Xiao. He took office in the fifth month, and on an inauspicious day, he entered his residence. After five months in office, he was recommended by the Four Ministries and promoted to magistrate of Wuling. When I served as magistrate of Yingling, I directly opposed the Grand Year Star. My chief clerk urged me to proceed northeast, but I refused. After five months in office, I was promoted to governor of Taishan.\n\nThe *Chu Ci* states: \"The Wind Earl is Feilian.\" According to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Wind Master is the star *Ji* (Winnowing Basket), which governs winnowing and can summon the winds. The spirit of the *wuxu* day governs the Wind Earl, hence on the *bingxu* day, sacrifices are made in the northwest.\n\nAccording to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Rain Master is the star *Bi* (Net). Among the masses of the central land, none surpass water, hence rain is called a \"master.\" The spirit of the *chou* day governs the Rain Master, hence on the *jichou* day, sacrifices are made to it.\n\nDuring the *Yuankang* era of Emperor Huan, the women of the capital fashioned \"sorrowful brows,\" \"weeping grains,\" \"falling-horse chignons,\" \"broken-waist gaits,\" and \"rotten-tooth smiles.\" \"Sorrowful brows\" were thin and sharply angled; \"weeping grains\" involved lightly wiping beneath the eyes to resemble tear stains; \"falling-horse chignons\" were tilted to one side; \"broken-waist gaits\" made the feet appear detached from the body; and \"rotten-tooth smiles\" mimicked the grimace of a toothache. These fashions all originated with Liang Ji.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: \"When the King of Zhao favored broad eyebrows, the people all drew them halfway up their foreheads. When the King of Chu favored wide collars, the people of his state all bared their necks. When the King of Qi favored slender waists, there were those in his harem who starved to death.\" In the capital, there were Hu-style robes, Hu-style tents, Hu-style forests, Hu-style harps, Hu-style flutes, and Hu-style dances. This was due to the influx of troops during Dong Zhuo’s time.\n\nEmperor Ling roamed the Western Park, driving a chariot pulled by four white camels and personally holding the reins. The court officials imitated him, and the price of camels rose to equal that of horses.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Huan, a popular rhyme went: \"Straight as a bowstring, dead by the roadside; crooked as a hook, enfeoffed as a lord.\" Liang Ji wished to enthrone a young ruler, while Li Gu sought to establish the Prince of Qinghe. Liang Ji then memorialized the throne, and Li Gu died in prison, his corpse exposed by the roadside. Liang Ji was \"crooked as a hook,\" and Li Gu \"straight as a bowstring.\"\n\nThe song went: \"The thousand-league grass, how lush and green! In the tenth month, the divination yields not a single day of life.\" This referred to Dong Zhuo. \"Lush and green\" described his violent and flourishing power.\n\nSince the Qin and Han dynasties, the exalted have named their palaces and halls, whereas previously, the noble and base made no such distinctions.\n\nAccording to the *Genealogical Origins*, Xian invented city walls. *Cheng* (city) means \"to contain,\" and *guo* (outer wall) means \"great.\"\n\nAccording to the rites, the Son of Heaven has an outer screen to make his ministers hold their breath in reverence.\n\n*Sousou* means \"accumulated.\" It refers to the gathering of firewood and kindling.\n\nSunzi said: \"A city with walls of metal and moats of boiling water, yet lacking grain, cannot be defended even by Taigong or Mo Di.\" *Jun* (commandery) means \"extensive.\" The *Zuozhuan* states: \"Senior ministers receive counties, while junior ministers receive commanderies.\" Only under the First Emperor of Qin were commanderies established to oversee counties. *Xian* (county) means \"level.\"\n\nA *post station* is where envoys, having transmitted their messages, are permitted to lodge.\n\nNorth-south roads are called *qian*; east-west roads are called *mo*.\n\nAccording to the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, in high antiquity there was a man named Yang You who was skilled at bringing misfortune upon others. Hence, when people inquire after one another in ordinary times, they ask, \"Are you well?\"\n\nWhen a city gate catches fire, disaster befalls the fish in the moat. The common explanation is that the moat and the fish are the names of a man who lived near the city gate. In truth, when a city gate burns, water is drawn from the moat, and thus the fish all die.\n\nPrisons originated with the Three Kings. After the establishment of corporal punishments, prisons were created. In the Xia dynasty, they were called *xiatai*; in the Zhou, *tuyu*. They serve to make people reflect and reform their evil ways. The character for \"prison\" (*yu*) consists of two dogs guarding it, implying that even dogs would imprison those without human sentiment. Criminals are placed in round enclosures, hence the character for \"prisoner\" (*qiu*) is a person within a mouth. The character for \"crime\" (*zui*) originally consisted of \"self\" (*zi*) and \"bitterness\" (*xin*), signifying suffering and sorrow. The First Emperor of Qin believed the character *gao* (a component of *zui*) resembled *huang* (emperor), so he altered it to *zui*.\n\nIn Kuaiji, there were many licentious sacrifices. Poor families unable to sacrifice an ox would, after death, transform into bellowing oxen. The governor, Diwu Lun, enforced strict prohibitions to eradicate this practice.\n\nWhen Li Shujian of Guiyang was young and served as an attendant in the provincial administration, a dog in his household stood on its hind legs. Shujian said: \"This dog is mimicking a human—what harm is there in a person’s conduct?\" Later, when Shujian was a county magistrate and removed his cap to rest on his couch, the dog took it and ran off. Shujian said: \"This dog has mistakenly caught its collar on its ears.\" The dog then gathered fire in front of a turtle-shaped censer, and the neighbors reported it. Shujian said: \"If a dog can gather fire, it is fortunate that no humans are needed.\" The dog soon died violently, and Shujian rose to high office.\n\n*The Book of Lord Shang* in four scrolls:\nThose with conduct surpassing others are condemned by the world; those with unique insight are resented by the people. The mole cricket and the locust are born in spring and die in autumn, yet a single emergence causes the people to suffer food shortages for years. Now, if one person farms while a hundred consume, it is worse than the mole cricket and the locust.\n\nWhen those who wander and consume outnumber the farmers, agriculture languishes, and when agriculture languishes, governance decays. The weak who remove the strong become strong; the strong who remove the weak become weak.\n\nThe scholars of antiquity wore clothes that did not warm their skin and ate food that did not fill their bellies. They tormented their minds and labored their limbs.\n\nIn ancient times, the people thrived in the wilds, and chaos led to the establishment of rulers.\n\nWhen woodworms multiply, the wood breaks; when cracks widen, the wall collapses. To perish without defeat or survive without victory—from antiquity to the present, such a thing has never existed.",

overbearing.\n\nEstablishing laws is to dam the people—then the common folk cannot breach them;\nErecting barriers is to dam the waters—then the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers cannot overrun them.\nIf barriers can be overrun, the rivers become disasters;\nIf laws can be breached, the common folk become harms.\n\nThose who do not plant trees die without coffins;\nThose who do not raise silkworms have no silk for their bodies;\nThose who do not spin meet misfortune without hempen cloth.\nThe nobleman, at leisure, ponders righteousness;\nThe petty man, at leisure, schemes wickedness.\n\nHigh birds gather on towering trees;\nThe wise choose their ground and soar.\n\nIf even one thief is left unpursued, harm spreads to burglars and robbers;\nIf flatterers are left unpunished, harm reaches

the Dao, they become noblemen;\nDeviating from ritual, they are called petty men.\nThe nobleman’s every act treads the path of virtue and radiates glory;\nThe petty man’s every move plunges into evil and invites punishment.\n\nBright and pure,\nWith indigo, it becomes blue;\nWith cinnabar, it becomes red;\nWith the bark of the cork tree, it becomes yellow;\nWith black dye, it becomes black.\n\nUncarved jade remains but a round stone from Nanshan.\n\nThieves who break through windows do not shrink from severing waists and necks;\nSoldiers who flee battle do not fear axes and blades.\n\nThe Han realm spans the ends of the earth, exhausts the limits of the land:\nTo the left, the Tang Valley;\nTo the right, the Yu Abyss;\nBefore, the scorching lands of Chu;\nBehind, the frontier gates.\nNorth of Qilian, south of Yellow Mountain,\nEast of Jieshi, west of Heli—\nNone fail to bear tribute and submit.\n\nConfucius and Shu Guang:\nAbove, they spoke the discourse of heaven;\nBelow, the language of the people.\nThey encompassed both men and women,\nProbing the outer and inner.\n\n*The Huainanzi* is frivolous and overly expansive;\n*The Great Mystery* is abstruse and yields little effect;\n*The Model Sayings* is jumbled and lacks a guiding principle;\n*The New Book* is verbose and of scant use.\n\nThe Jade Token states:\nRed as a parrot’s crest,\nYellow as steamed chestnut,\nWhite as fat,\nBlack as pure lacquer—\nSuch are the signs of jade.\nRefined speech and elegant instruction,\nWords that become classics and counsels—\nThese are the signs of a person.\n\nMountain spirits are called *li*;\nThe essence of creatures is called *mei*;\nThe essence of earth is called *jiyang*;\nThe essence of water is called *wangshe*;\nThe essence of wood is called *bifang*;\nThe essence of fire is called *youguang*;\nThe essence of metal is called *qingming*.\nWhen the world follows the Dao, all such essences withdraw and hide.\n\nHeaven calls the immortal *Child*;\nThe masses, *straw dogs*.\nIt cherishes its Child, favoring long life;\nIt scorns straw dogs, leaving them to early death.\nWithout study, it is as though one tries to see without eyes,\nTo run without legs,\nTo fly without wings,\nTo speak without a mouth—\nIt cannot be done.\n\nJie and Zhou, though they held the throne of the Son of Heaven, had not a single man’s praise.\nThey were like rotten stumps and withered trees—when the wind came, they toppled.\n\nEnforce punishments with clarity, administer laws with care,\nShow compassion for the people, bestow kindness upon those below.\nThen the living will bear no grudge,\nAnd the dead will hold no resentment.\nAs the saying goes:\n“Governance like frost and ice—\nDeceit and excess vanish.\nAuthority like thunder and lightning—\nBandits and thieves do not arise.”\n\n*Shiwei, Scroll Ten* by Yao Xin\nKong Wenju’s metal nature was too strong, his wood nature insufficient.\nTurning from shade toward sunlight, he stood alone and mourned his solitude.\n\nSilk all comes from silkworms;\nBronze equally from stone.\nWoven into plain cloth, it is cheap;\nWoven into brocade, it is precious.\nCast as a bell, it is small;\nCast as a bell, it is large.\n\nThe *Classic* is like water flowing beneath a carriage;\nThe *Calendar* is like sand clinging to a wheel.\nThe tracks of feet, high and low, cannot be reckoned.\nWater, when warm, becomes hot liquid;\nWhen cold, it becomes ice.\nThough ice and hot liquid differ in *qi*, the nature of water remains the same.\nSilkworms can spin thread, but without boiling water, it does not become silk.\nHuman nature shifts and changes—\nThis is the comparison.\n\nWhen zithers and lutes are strung, the music of Zheng and Wei arises;\nWhen the five colors are combined, embroidered silks are born.\n\nMengzi drove worldly affairs into the realm of benevolence and righteousness;\nThose who followed walked the path of uprightness.\nIf the South Seas had no pearl-gatherers,\nIf Kunlun had no jade-cutters,\nThen bright pearls would not adorn the pepper chambers,\nAnd fine jade would not hang in the cassia palaces.\n\n*Tongyu, Scroll Eight*\nThe wheel’s track is the carriage’s path;\nThe oar is the boat’s wing.\nThe body’s need for the Dao is like these two things.\nThose who slander others clamor in unison like thunder;\nThose who praise them spread like wildfire and stir waves.\nSomeone asked: Was Chen Fan loyal?\nThe reply: Riding alone to wield the axe against rebels,\nAscending the steps straight and unyielding—\nThis was no resource for a disordered age.\nTo know his loyalty is not as good as knowing his wisdom.\nTalent values precision;\nLearning values discourse.\nSubstance over form—like Shi Jian;\nForm over substance—like Cai Yong.\nWhen form and substance are in perfect balance,\nXu Gan comes close.\n\n*The Master Embracing Simplicity*, Forty Scrolls\nOuter Chapters, Twenty Scrolls;\nInner Chapters, Twenty Scrolls.\nBy Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan.\n\nFine wine and fragrant liqueurs confuse the nature;\nRed blossoms and plain silk cut short the lifespan.\n\nBan Di could not carve stone into a needle’s point;\nOu Leng could not cast lead and tin into a *Ganjiang* sword.\n\nThe *Han Court Daily Records* state:\nLi Shaojun wished to depart.\nEmperor Wu dreamed of ascending Songgao Mountain with him.\nHalfway, a messenger riding a dragon arrived from the clouds, bearing a tally, and said:\n“The Great One summons Shaojun.”\nThe Emperor said: “Shaojun will leave me.”\nA few days later, Shaojun died.\nAfter some time, his coffin was opened—\nOnly his clothes and cap remained.\n\nTo discard a flaw the size of an ant’s nose\nAnd lose a priceless piece of pure jade;\nTo cast aside a speck of imperfection the width of a hook\nAnd abandon a foot-long night-shining pearl—\nThis is why Zhuangzi grieved,\nWhy Xue Zhuo sighed endlessly—\nLike those who do not study immortality.\n\nThe Daoist arts enable one to change form and alter appearance,\nTo swallow swords and spit fire,\nTo sit and vanish, to stand and disappear,\nTo summon clouds and raise mists,\nTo call forth snakes and insects,\nTo gather fish and turtles,\nTo enter the depths without drowning,\nTo tread blades without injury.",

      "translated_text": "The *Records of Strange Tales* by Chen Zhonggong states: A man of the same commandery, Zhang Guang, met with chaos and abandoned his four-year-old daughter, who could not walk, in a tomb, leaving her with several months’ worth of provisions. Three years later, he returned to retrieve her for burial, yet the girl still sat in the tomb. When asked why, she said: “After the food ran out, I saw something at the corner of the tomb stretching its neck to swallow qi, so I imitated it and was no longer hungry.” Upon closer inspection, it was a large tortoise. When the girl was brought home and fed, her stomach ached at first, but in time she grew accustomed to it.\n\nThe spider taught by the Tang Master weaves its web; Jintian relied on the Nine Crows to set the seasons; Tang Yao observed the mojia plant to know the months.\n\nThe Dao enables one to ascend the void, tread upon shadows, and drink jade nectar, to feast on azure mushrooms.\n\nPeng Zu said: “In heaven there are many exalted offices; newly ascended immortals hold lowly ranks and serve in many capacities. Like a farmer who obtains a vermilion bow only to scare crows, or a man of Nancheng who receives a tattered robe only to gather firewood—so too do worldly men obtain the elixir of immortality yet fail to value it.”\n\nYuanjun was the teacher of Lord Lao.\n\nWorldly people vie only for fleeting glory, chasing after the gray hawk and the yellow hare, clinging to honor and pursuing profit.\n\nThe superior adept who attains the Dao becomes a celestial official; the middling adept dwells upon Kunlun; the lesser adept achieves longevity in the world.\n\nThe vermilion herb has stems like coral; when cut, its sap flows like blood. If jade is cast into the sap, it dissolves like mud, and over time turns to liquid. Gold cast into it becomes “golden nectar,” jade cast into it becomes “jade wine”—ingesting it grants longevity.\n\nMaster Shi’s cinnabar method: Take a fledgling crow before its feathers grow, feed it a mixture of true cinnabar and beef, and its plumage will turn crimson. Kill it, dry it in the shade, and consume it to live five hundred years.\n\nA face of unadorned fairness, skin of rosy hue, eyes that pierce the unseen—clear notes of shang and zhi mingling to confound the ear: such is the virtue of true principle.\n\nThe Dragon Abyss remains ever fresh through constant dredging; the axe and adze wear swiftly with daily use.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nA span-long dragonfly skims the surface of a puddle and claims the world holds no seas so vast; a mite writhes within a fruit pit and declares the world holds no realms so boundless. Dried meat may stave off hunger for a moment, and poisoned wine may quench thirst for an instant—yet death follows swiftly after. One prizes luminous pearls but scorns the deep pools that yield them, cherishes flawless jade but despises the Jing Mountains that bear it, unaware that the pools are the source of pearls, the mountains the birthplace of jade.\n\nIn this age, scholars languish in waiting, while no office remains vacant even briefly. When the balmy breeze rises, fur robes and braziers are set aside; when the world’s path levels, extraordinary men retreat.\n\nThe fleshly zhi is the ten-thousand-year toad, its head inscribed with eight vermilion characters. Harvested at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, it can trace lines on the earth to summon flowing water or be worn on the left hand to repel weapons. Encountering in the mountains a child seven or eight inches tall, riding a carriage or horse—this is the fleshly zhi. Consuming it grants transcendence.\n\nThe thousand-year bat is white as snow, roosting upside down, its brain too heavy to hold upright. The thousand-year swallow’s nest faces north.\n\nCloud essence, cloud pearls, cloud liquid, cloud mother, and cloud sand are ingested with jade water.\n\nEmperor Cheng hunted on Mount Zhongnan when he saw a naked figure, its body covered in black fur. Surrounding and capturing it, they found it could leap chasms and scale cliffs like a bird. The captive was a woman who claimed to be a palace attendant from the Qin. When rebels from east of the pass approached, the Qin king surrendered, and she fled into the mountains, nearly starving until an old man taught her to eat pine nuts, which banished hunger. She was a palace woman of King Ziying of Qin, living over two hundred years by Emperor Cheng’s time. When people later fed her grains, her fur gradually shed, and she aged rapidly before dying.\n\nTo attain long life, consume mountain essence—mountain essence is a tree.\n\nMaster Lingyang Zhong took *far-reaching ambition* for twenty years, fathered thirty-seven sons, and never forgot what he read.\n\nThe true sages are the Yellow Emperor and Laozi; the worldly sages are Zhou and Confucius.\n\nThose skilled in the game of *mu* are called *mu* sages—thus Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming earned the name of *mu* sages.\n\nPeng Zu boasted of serving Yao, living through the Xia and into the Yin. The Yin king sent palace women to learn his bedchamber arts; when they proved effective, he sought to kill Peng Zu to suppress his teachings. Forewarned, Peng Zu fled, and seventy years later, someone saw him in the shifting sands.\n\nTo achieve long life, keep the belly free of desires; to attain deathlessness, keep the belly free of filth.\n\nA village saying goes: A person in the world loses a day with each passing day, like driving oxen or sheep to the butcher—each step forward brings death nearer.\n\nLord Lao’s surname was Li, given name Pin, courtesy name Boyang. He stood nine feet tall, with a yellow complexion, a beak-like mouth, a prominent nose, and eyebrows five inches long. He dwelled in the Hall of Golden Towers and Jade Chambers.\n\nClove tongue incense and the milk of coptis root cure all eye ailments.\n\nA proverb says: No fat immortals, no rich Daoists. Though Daoists can make gold and silver, they remain poor.\n\nAnother saying: \"Three copies turn fish into *lu*, emperor into tiger.\" Even divine talismans, now rarely effective, are like this. White stone resembles jade, and treacherous flatterers resemble the worthy. The *luan* bird does not tangle in nets; the *lin* beast does not fall into traps.\n\nAn inch of glue cannot clarify the Yellow River’s turbidity; a foot of water cannot cool the heat of Xiaoqiu. Plugging a leak with a bored boat or quenching a raging fire with fierce flames—such efforts are futile.\n\nIf a plain scholar plows by day to feed his mouth and gathers firewood by night to pursue learning, then even You and Xia would not be deemed exceptional.\n\nOnce a great mansion burns, drawing water from the vast sea is too late; when torrents surge through the skies, launching boats on long rivers is futile.\n\nMinisters are like hands and feet—they cannot refuse treading on ice or grasping fire.\n\nWhen a lofty ridge is about to collapse, fine threads cannot stitch it together. When the Dragon Gate’s waters boil, a handful of earth cannot dam them. Swords and halberds, though unsuited for sewing, can butcher oxen and horses; awls and drills, though useless for slaughter, excel at stitching. Materials have their great and small uses—none should be discarded.\n\nAn army may stand thick as a forest, yet not all its soldiers are brave.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nVirtue is the rouge and powder of governance; punishment is the bridle and whip of the age. When one ought to kill but does not, great banditry arises.\n\nA spark from a drill’s tip may be quenched with a mouthful of water; a magpie’s egg, unhatched, may be crushed in the palm. Yet once it soars atop the clouds, scorching the vast wilds, beating six wings to pierce the dawn’s glow—even the wise and brave cannot restrain it. Releasing the reins and whip to ride a galloping steed on perilous paths, or casting aside the oar to drift a light boat on rivers and seas—how could this not be dangerous? A golden boat cannot dredge the waves of the Sun Marquis; a jade horse cannot gallop a thousand *li*.\n\nSome offer treasures to sell themselves; some peddle letters to influential men. Some, with fathers or elder brothers noble and eminent, are summoned merely by the sight of their gates; others, through long habit of bowing and scraping, are at last taken in.\n\nAs the saying goes: “They recommend ‘Outstanding Talent’ who know not books; they examine ‘Filial and Incorrupt’ whose fathers live apart.” The poor and pure, white as snow, are muddied like sludge; the high-ranking generals, fine as they seem, are timid as flies.\n\nThe proverb says: “The ancients sought advancement through diligent study of the classics; today’s men seek office by shunning worldly affairs.” I say: the bonds of friendship should not be shallow or insincere—outward smiles masking hollow hearts. As Yang Xiong mocked: “A bright mirror, when raised, reveals a crooked cap; the sun’s charioteer, when shining, exposes a warped shadow.”\n\nZhou Bo, a minister of the altars of soil and grain, could not answer questions on money and grain.\n\nThose who recognize treasures must gather the luminous pearls washed in clear waters; those who prize *qi* must seek the fragrant orchids amid foul marshes. Without a suspended mirror, who can sift jade from mud or retrieve sunken pearls from the river’s depths? The greatly wise stand firm as mountains; the petty drift like tumbleweeds and floating duckweed.\n\nThe straight plumb line is detested by crooked wood; purity and impartiality are loathed by the treacherous and wicked.\n\nWhen King Wen met Lü Wang, before the mulberry’s shade had shifted, he knew this was his teacher. When Xuande beheld Kongming, before the sun’s shadow had changed, he entrusted him with his heart and mind. Yet a grand appearance does not guarantee worthiness, nor does a feeble demeanor denote foolishness.\n\nBo Jie discerned a vessel of unmatched sound amid the ashes of a burnt-out hearth; Zhang Heng distinguished bamboo of rare resonance before it was ever used. Dignity moves like dragons and tigers, circling in perfect order.\n\nAfter wine, the body lightens and the ears grow hot; caps slip, belts loosen. The sluggish tumble like tumbleweeds in the wind; the composed leap like deer and fish. The tongue-tied wave their hands to keep rhythm; the unassertive grow bold and speak with vigor. They compare nine bends to an anthill, Lüliang’s rapids to an ox’s hoofprint—no matter how sternly forbidden, they cannot be stopped.\n\nIf a lord fears wine as he fears illness, loathes drunkenness as he loathes grave sickness, then he will avoid the fault of dissipation.\n\nWhen people dig cellars to brew wine and carry it in their sleeves, the law is light and profit heavy—how can one make them abstain? Guan Xiangru, with three *dou* of wine, grew eloquent and refined; Yang Xiong never parted from his cup, yet the *Tai Xuan* was completed.\n\nThose who love evil are like moths drawn to a bright flame; those who shun learning are like dust swept up by a whirlwind.\n\nWith an axe but no handle, what can be done?\n\nTo praise the supple and yielding as graceful while scorning the upright and solemn as rustic—is this not delusion?\n\nScholars in impoverished alleys chant by withered scrolls, cling to yellowed volumes, bow their heads and bend their knees, hastening to serve the powerful. Once their feathers grow and wings form, once they shed their earthen shells like cicadas, they strut with arrogance—these are the ones who shatter steles.\n\nLong ago, Xishi lay by the roadside clutching her chest in pain; her fragrance, like orchid and musk, made all who saw her admire her. A neighboring girl imitated her, and all who saw her loathed her—just as the world mimics Dai Shuluan and Ruan Sizong.\n\nWhen the age values something, even a lame donkey fetches the price of a dragon steed.\n\nFox-fur robes cannot ward off summer’s heat; dragon-prowed boats cannot traverse dry land.\n\nA fine general, when firm, is like heaven—visible but untouchable; when yielding, like an abyss—observable but impenetrable. Departing, he vanishes like lightning—seen but unreachable; standing, he is immovable as a mountain—gazed upon but unshaken.\n\nIn spring, long spears lead the way; in summer, great halberds; in autumn, bows and crossbows; in winter, blades and shields. This is the way of marching with the seasons, aligning with heaven’s law.\n\nTai Gong said: “Strike the solitary and weak, and ten thousand men will be no match; a single woman can withstand a hundred men.”\n\nWhen the wind rustles leaves, the enemy is ten *li* away; when it whistles through the branches, a hundred *li*; when it shakes the boughs, four hundred *li*. If metal vessels ring on their own, or scorched vessels sound, the army is exhausted. *Qi* like startled deer signals a defeated force.\n\nRain and dew soaking garments is called “moistening the army”; when they do not, it is called “weeping troops.” When the army’s *qi* resides in the Great One’s jade tent, it cannot be assailed.\n\nWhere crabs appear on the battlefield, the army should move swiftly.\n\nI once heard Ji Sheng say: “Can Zuo Taichong and Zhang Maoxian be called *tongren*?” The Way of the ruler replied: “*Tongren* stand next to the sages—there is no room between.”\n\nI asked Ban— Ban said: “Lü Wang saw clouds and knew where the High Ancestor was. Did heaven open only Lü’s eyes while blinding all others?” A eunuch without desire cannot be called chaste; a courtesan who does not drink cannot be called upright.\n\nKing Wen ate the soup of his son yet feigned ignorance—not because he savored it.\n\nDong Zhongshu’s learning was profound, but his natural talent dull. To mistake clams and wasps for divine dragons is not only to fail to recognize dragons, but also clams and wasps.\n\nWang Chong patted Ban Gu’s back and said: “This child will surely be known throughout the world.”\n\nThe Five Ridges know no trees that shed in winter; in the Southern Sea and Jin’an, rice ripens nine times a year.\n\nThe *Jade Register of Lord Lao* states: “Pine resin buried in the earth for a thousand years becomes *fuling*; *fuling* for a thousand years becomes amber; amber for a thousand years becomes chalcanthite; chalcanthite for a thousand years becomes *weixi*.”\n\nRoast the drum to make it sound; tighten the strings to make them mournful.",
      "overlap_context": "d feet—they cannot refuse treading on ice or grasping fire.\n\nWhen a lofty ridge is about to collapse, fine threads cannot stitch it together. When the Dragon Gate’s waters boil, a handful of earth cannot dam them. Swords and halberds, though unsuited for sewing, can butcher oxen and horses; awls and drills, though useless for slaughter, excel at stitching. Materials have their great and small uses—none should be discarded.\n\nAn army may stand thick as a forest, yet not all its soldiers are brave.",

      "translated_text": "Compared to others, they are as the Yangtze and Han rivers to a stagnant puddle.\n\nJi Sheng remarked: “Whenever I read the works of the Two Lu brothers, I cannot help but lay down the scroll in admiration, fearing their writings may one day be exhausted.” The *Master Lu’s Ten Essays* are indeed masterful works—where their language is rich, even the most refined thought cannot subtract from it; where their principles are concise, even the most eloquent brush cannot add to it. Observing these two, how could they be mere scholars of refined elegance or men of letters?\n\n○ The *Baopuzi* states: In Qin times, people did not notice the ugliness of noseless faces; in Yangdi, they despised those without goiters. Master Lu possessed profound insight into the unbridled nature of literature, yet he never indulged in empty or exaggerated speech—not because he could not, but because he chose not to. The writings of Master Lu are like jade from the Dark Garden, every piece a luminous treasure. Even centuries later, if there should arise men of talent comparable to the Two Lu brothers, they would still stand shoulder to shoulder. To call them sparse would be a grave misjudgment.\n\n○ At the gates of Confucius and Zengzi, those who learned by ear and mouth alone have long since vanished; only those who entrusted their teachings to bamboo and silk may be called treasures of the age. Restraint is the saddle and bridle of benevolence and righteousness; bonds and locks are the trappings of ritual and music.\n\n○ My friend, Master Xuanbo, built his walls with Confucianism and Mohism, wielded his weapons with wit and spirit—truly a man of antiquity. ○ Ice forms yet does not chill; provisions run out yet hunger does not come. ○ Where otters multiply, fish are disturbed; where hawks gather, crows are thrown into chaos. ○ A tail spanning a full zhang cannot belong to a body of a mere foot; tusks reaching several ren cannot fit in a mouth of a few inches. Mi Heng once said: “Only Kong Rong and Xun Qiang are worth speaking to—the rest are but wine jars and rice sacks.”\n\nHong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. His ancestors traced back to the clan of Ge Tian. After his family’s library was repeatedly destroyed by fire, Hong carried his books on his back and traveled on foot, borrowing texts to copy by hand. He sold firewood to buy paper, and by lamplight, he pored over his writings—what he transcribed was often written in reverse, few could read it. His nature was unassuming; his hat cords were frayed and soiled. Sometimes he wore flowing robes with wide sashes, sometimes tight sleeves and a short jacket; at times his robes dragged on the ground, at others they barely covered his knees. The people of his time called him a “Baopu scholar,” and thus he came to be known by his writings.\n\nHong was too poor to keep servants, and his fences were left untended. He often pushed through brambles to leave his home and parted the weeds to enter. By nature, he avoided offending officials or troubling his relatives.\n\n○ When Ji Jun was appointed Governor of Guangzhou, he recommended Hong as his adjutant. Hong saw this not as a path to profit or pleasure, but as a means to retreat to the southern lands.\n\n○ Hong never gambled at dusk with dice or tiles; when he saw others playing, he paid no attention.\n\n○ At fifteen, Hong composed grand poems and rhapsodies, believing they would endure through the ages.

After the fall of Zhang Jiao, the realm descended into chaos. Within the span of a single sigh, he composed this work, taking Yao and Shun as its pillars and Confucius as its teacher and admonisher.\n\n○ A charioteer who loses control shatters his own carriage. One who loses control of the realm causes the Four Seas to collapse. Jie and Zhou served as the stepping stones for Tang and Wu; Qin and Xiang became the ladder for the Great Han. If the four rebellions do not arise, the four submissions will not ascend.\n\n○ The worthy and wise cannot be lured by appearances, just as one does not set snares for phoenixes or lay traps for qilin. Bo Le chose horses from the lean; the sage selects men from the unrefined. Settling disputes is not as good as preventing them; excelling at quelling chaos is not as good as preventing it.\n\n○ To govern the celestial net, wield the eight handles, move the primordial signs, and gather the multitudes—this is the role of the Son of Heaven. To nurture the people and align with the will of Heaven—this is the duty of the Three Dukes. To uphold public integrity and cultivate order—this is the way of the scholar. To cultivate goodness only at death is too late; to turn back when matters press is too feeble. Those with a foundation build easily; those without struggle to succeed.\n\n○ The turtledove lends its wings to the fledgling; the lamb dons leopard skin—outward semblance belies inner truth, the surface conceals the core. Man is the tongue of Heaven; things are the mouth of the spirits. Heaven is high, Earth is deep—retribution comes late. Words are the sovereign’s bow and crossbow; teachings are the ruler’s mechanism.\n\n○ Bestow rewards as generously as spring; mete out punishments as severely as autumn. Perform rites with the fervor of fire; disseminate teachings with the flow of water. Yield one, gain a hundred; contend for ten, lose nine.\n\n**Xun Yue’s *Shenjian*, Five Scrolls**\nPreface states: The Dao is rooted in benevolence and righteousness. The Five Classics serve as its warp; the myriad texts serve as its weft. With past mirrors now clear, this work further expounds them—hence the title *Shenjian* (*Extended Mirror*).\n\n○ When ruler and minister are close yet observe propriety, when the hundred officials harmonize without uniformity—this is the wind of a well-governed state.\n\n○ When customs and rites vary, when the common folk voice their opinions—this is the wind of a declining state. When ruler and minister vie in oaths, when great officers contend for fame—this is the wind of a fractured state. When the ruler is full of desires, when the people are full of schemes, when laws are unstable and governance is scattered—this is the wind of a chaotic state. When exploiting the people is called ability, when flattering superiors is called loyalty—this is the wind of a rebellious state. When petty officials vie for favor, when great ministers vie for power—this is the wind of a harmed state. When the ruler does not consult, when the ministers do not remonstrate, when a woman’s words are heeded and inner politics prevail—this is the wind of a doomed state.\n\n○ The skilled at prohibition first restrain themselves before others; the unskilled first restrain others before themselves. Third: to achieve martial affairs. Fourth: to forbid frequent pardons.\n\n○ When the Qin destroyed learning, books rotted in the walls, and righteousness vanished from court and countryside. To study sageliness without attaining it is still to fulfill one’s life; to study longevity without attaining it is still to fulfill one’s fate.\n\n○ The noble person has three mirrors: the mirror of the past, the mirror of others, and the mirror of reflection.\n\n○ If the subordinate does not seal his mouth, if the superior does not stop his ears, then there is something to be heard.\n\n○ Reflecting on Yao and Shun in high antiquity, gazing upon Confucius in the middle ages—one knows that petty ways are shameful. Thinking of Boyi on Shouyang, imagining the Four Elders on Mount Shang—one knows that filth and falsehood are disgraceful. Recalling Zhang Qian at the western frontier, remembering Su Wu in the northern wastes—one knows that clinging to comfort is contemptible.\n\n**Zhongchang Tong’s *Changyan*, Ten Scrolls**\nTeachings take ritual and righteousness as their foundation; ritual and righteousness take the classics as their root. The constant Dao endures for a hundred generations; expedient measures are used for a single moment. Before Gaoxin, we hear of the men but do not see their books. From the Tang, Yu, Xia, and Yin, we see their books but not their full affairs. From the Zhou onward, records are complete.\n\n○ When a foolish heir sees none in the realm dare oppose him, he indulges his private passions and pursues his perverse desires. Ruler and minister revel in debauchery, high and low share in wickedness. Their eyes feast on extravagant spectacles, their ears exhaust the sounds of Zheng and Wei. Indoors, they gallop among women without restraint; outdoors, they race through the hunt without return. They trust and favor their kin, cherish and exalt their empresses and consorts—yet when fate shifts and fortune departs, they do not perceive it.\n\n○ Raising banners and beating drums, lighting beacons and keeping watch—these are the fierce generals who guard the frontiers, not the good officials of the Central States. Jade-belled carriages, cleared roads, deferential courtesies—these are the majestic rites of the Xia, not the customs of the Yi and Di.\n\n○ Dong Xian shared no kinship with Emperor Ai, not even a thread of blood. Nor could he transmit his lineage or secure his succession. Yet through the fleeting pleasures of a man’s embrace, he became as inseparable as lacquer and glue.\n\n○ When Emperor Jing ascended the throne, the regional inspectors were all sons of eunuchs—like jackals guarding meat, like demons awaiting illness. They said: \"Within Heaven’s bounds, beyond man’s reach.\"\n\n○ If others love me, I love them; if others hate me, I hate them.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm have three vulgarities: selecting men by clan and pedigree is the first; flocking to the gates of the rich and powerful is the second; fearing and submitting to the noble and exalted is the third.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm have three despicable traits: craving fame without knowing truth is the first; not daring to judge right and wrong before the rich and powerful is the second; turning toward the prosperous and away from the declining is the third.\n\n○ The scholars of the realm harbor three deceptions: feigning ignorance when they truly do not know is the first; plagiarizing others’ records to craft their own theories is the second; accepting anonymity to claim another’s knowledge is the third.\n\n○ To know the words but not act upon them is called an affliction. This affliction, though treated by the physicians of Heaven, cannot be cured. Why must those who spy on me be lovable?

During his father’s mourning, his conduct often strayed from ritual, and his reputation for filial piety was not heard.\nLater, he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace and then Gentleman of the Yellow Gate.\nA colleague asked about his aspirations, and he replied: \"When great ministers debate, some side with Party A to criticize Party B’s allies, or side with Party B to slander Party A’s allies.\nI stand between A and B, fortunate to avoid both praise and blame.\"\n\n*Master Fu’s Writings* in one hundred twenty fascicles:\nGreat trees flourish; small trees spread.\nEarth is humanity’s mother, so people cherish their homeland.\n\nOne may pay a high price for a neighbor, for the house can be bought, but the neighbor cannot.\n\n○ Wearing Yao’s cap while behaving like Jie—one is still Jie.\nWearing Jie’s clothes while behaving like Yao—one is still Yao.\nStanding in the marketplace’s shops, dressed in a noble person’s robes, performing the deeds of the wise among petty men—this is like walking at night adorned with pearls and jade, yet still shining brightly.\nThe spider weaves its web, the bee builds its hive—how exquisite their craft! How much more so for humans.\n\nA thousand taels of gold are not worth one worthy person.\nA person without integrity is like clothing without seams or food without flavor.\n\n○ Guo Linzong asked Qiu Zhiji: \"Have you ever made a mistake?\"\nZhiji replied: \"At dusk, I was feeding the ox, and when it would not eat, I struck it once.\"",

Thus, if yin and yang are not kept secret, the summer cannot complete the year; if a house’s eaves are not sealed, even nine stories cannot shelter a body.\n\n*Comprehensive Discourse on Past and Present* in three scrolls, by Wang Ying:\nKunlun’s southeast spans five thousand *li*—this is called the Divine Continent, the dwelling of emperors and the birthplace of sages.\n\n○ Cang Jie created writing: when form is established, it is called *wen*; when sound is complete, it is called *zi*. *Zi* derives from the blossoming and breeding of forms, and when inscribed on bamboo and silk, it is called *shu*.\n\n*The Central Treatise* in six scrolls, by Xu Weichang, with annotations by Ren:\nTo stand and ponder the distant is not as good as hastening forward to reach it; to crane one’s neck after flying things is not as good as cultivating wings to surely seize them; to live alone and wish for wisdom is not as good as accumulating learning to surely attain it.\nThe noble person does not worry that his years are waning but that his resolve may falter.\nThe Dao in relation to humanity is most simple, yet when submerged, it is not spoken of—this is as different from Sima Qian as a leopard is from a horse.\n\n○ One’s passage through the world is like playing chess: if one does not exhaust the Dao, who is without a fatal move? It is merely a matter of misfortune.\n\n*Tangzi* in ten scrolls, by Tang Pang, styled Huijian, born in the second year of the Taiyuan era of Wu:\nA boat following the river travels swiftly; a person following the road does not lose their way.\n\n○ A great tree of a hundred *xun* has deep roots; the vast sea of ten thousand *ren* is formed by many streams; profound wisdom and penetrating insight are the work of accumulated learning.\n\nThe noble person crowns himself with the Dao and rides in a carriage of the Dao. Without the Dao as his crown, he does not dare to go forth; without the Dao as his carriage, he cannot take a step.\n\nOne who has a father yet cannot be filial, a brother yet cannot be respectful, yet lectures others on the duties of father and son, elder and younger—this is like bending a bow to shoot oneself.\n\n○ If human nature possesses even one act of filial piety, then nothing is left unembraced, just as when a tree’s root is planted, a hundred branches grow.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Between Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin, who was superior?\"\nTangzi replied: \"In terms of merit, Huan is the elder brother and Wen the younger; in terms of virtue, Wen is the elder brother and Huan the younger.\"\n\n○ The Great Jin, responding to the mandate of the times, swept all before it like thunder crushing the withered, a thousand *jun* pressing upon an egg—nothing remained.\n\n○ People often suffer from seeing a hundred paces ahead yet not knowing their own brows and cheeks; those who know their brows and cheeks cannot see a hundred paces.\n\nThe noble person guards authenticity and wields trust; when the times do not permit it, though he may endure the shame of slander and the filth of hidden defamation, it is but a scratch upon his body.\n\nEagles in their prime take flight; phoenixes roam afar.

      "translated_text": "○ Master Fan Che resided within the capital city, where he possessed land for a garden but suffered from lack of water for irrigation. He thus devised the *fan che* (chain-pump), which a child could operate, increasing efficiency a hundredfold.\n\nHeaven and earth complete a year: spring precedes autumn. The governance of a ruler: ritual precedes punishment. To treat an infant’s illness yet refuse moxibustion, only to administer other remedies until death—this is no different than taking the wrong medicine. Today, those who abolish corporal punishment multiply, yet such abolition is like substituting one drug for another. Though corporal punishment severs a limb, the person may still live and bear children. When Zhang Cang abolished corporal punishment, tens of thousands were executed each year; when Zhong Xian restored it, two thousand lives were saved annually.\n\n○ The term \"corporal punishment\" is akin to birds and beasts being placed upon the cutting board as meat.\n\n○ If a beloved son were to face the death penalty, his compassionate father would surely beg to substitute it with corporal punishment—exchanging death for life if possible. Can a ruler of the Dao fail to extend this mercy to the people? When a snake bites one’s hand, a strong man severs his wrist, knowing that though the limb is lost, life remains.\n\n○ Cao Yi said: \"One tames a spirited colt with reins and binds a fierce horse with a frayed rope.\" Today, governing the people with lenient punishments is no different than killing them.\n\n○ All know that Guanzi borrowed the ears of the realm, yet none realize that Yao first borrowed the hearts of the people before employing their eyes and ears.\n\n○ Long ago, in the lands between Yan and Zhao, three brothers shared one wife, who bore four children. Later, they disputed in court. Minister Yan Shou memorialized: \"Beasts bear young and follow their mothers; the children should be returned to her, while the three men should be executed in the marketplace.\"\n\n○ Plugging an ant’s hole may stem the flow of a river; securing a chariot’s linchpin may prevent its overturning. Those who establish laws and decrees should likewise grasp the essentials.\n\n○ The *Rites* states: \"For a stepfather, one wears *qicui* mourning.\"\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"A mother who abandons her own father to remarry another man severs ties with her brother’s father more severely than if both had cut off all relations with Heaven.\"\n\n○ Moreover, the *Regulations on Mourning* were likely not composed by Zhou or Kong but fabricated by vulgar scholars after the Qin’s burning of the books.\n\n○ Those who recklessly advance are like eggs hurled at stone; those who flee punishment are like men rushing into a pit.\n\n○ Clamorous as spring blossoms bursting forth, fragrant as autumn orchids flourishing together.\n\n○ A gourd hanging from a tree is not the tree’s fruit; a fur coat worn on the back is not the skin’s own hair—these are resemblances, not realities.\n\n○ The ninth precept speaks of nourishing one’s parents, saying, \"Let them hunger.\" How can one claim they are well-fed if they are often starved? This is surely not filial. A horse fed grain for ten days and starved for one remains robust, with no harm to its well-being—yet one cannot equate this with starving a mother for a single day.\n\n○ At the end of the Han, a man named Guan Qiuyang fled with his younger brother and a companion. When snow fell and their provisions ran out, he said to his brother: \"If we do not eat now, the three of us will die together.\" They killed the companion, obtained food, and reached shelter.

      "translated_text": "Could this man be called a virtuous scholar? Kong Wenju said: \"Guan Qiuyang cherished the body bequeathed by his ancestors; eating the companion incurred no blame.\" The Attendant-in-Ordinary Xun countered: \"Qiuyang coveted life—how could killing not be a crime?\" Wenju replied: \"This companion was no sworn friend. Had Guan Zhong eaten Bao Shu or Gong Yu consumed Wang Yang, that would have been impermissible. The one they killed was but a talking beast. Now, if a dog bites a wildcat and the wildcat bites a parrot, what is there to marvel at? In former times, Chong'er clung to the Qi woman and wished to devour Hu Yan; Shu Ao raged at the Chu army and wished to eat Wu Can. Even the wrath of worthies and sages would drive them to consume men—how much more those reduced to extremity?\"\n\n○ Seeing but a single stripe, one does not know the tiger’s full pattern. Daoists mock the Confucians’ restraint; Confucians sneer at the Daoists’ abandon—neither perceives the root. Chasing echoes by sound, pursuing shadows by form, contention and dissipation surge without cease.\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Had Meng Ke and Xun Qing been among Confucius’ disciples, they would not have been mere You and Xia, but rather the likes of Ran Min.\"\n\n○ A pile of firewood stacked like a mountain, set alight at its base—before the flames rise, a single cup of water may yet extinguish them. But when fire rages and wind howls, even pouring forth rivers and seas cannot save it.\n\n○ King Zhao of Qin was the stacked firewood; the First Emperor kindled the blaze; the Second Emperor fanned the gale. The people of Qin regarded the folk of Shandong as a tiger eyes a sheep in the grass—what barrier or fear could there be?\n\n○ Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a man of the Three Hu of Chu. After his role in the destruction of Wu, he boarded a light boat and roamed the Five Lakes. The king had his likeness painted and daily paid homage to it, ranking him among the immortals of Xuren.\n\n○ The ancestors of the Fu clan descended from Fu Yue, minister to Emperor Yao of the Tang.\n\n○ Xuan, styled Xiuyi, and his son Zai, styled Changyu, have biographies in *The History of the Jin*.\n\n○ During the transition from Chu to Han, an enthusiast compiled the *Generational Origins*, tracing from the Yellow Emperor to the end of the Han. Ban Gu’s *History of the Han* was completed thanks to his father’s work.\n\n○ The highest filial piety nourishes the will; the next nourishes the body. To nourish the will is to fulfill harmony; to nourish the body is not to lose reverence. Seizing land for oneself, the world stands in awe; extending one’s heart to others, the world returns to one. Treating others with sincerity, the world trusts one; without sincerity, even wife and children doubt. If wife and children doubt, how can one serve a lord? The noble person cultivates the self; holding office is not for profit or fame, but for benevolence and righteousness.\n\n○ All know to cleanse their vessels, but none think to wash their hearts. The noble person examines the root before studying, clarifies the Way before acting.\n\n○ Some say Xuan Heng rose to prime minister through fine poetry, and Zhang Yu became the emperor’s teacher through eloquent discourse—was this not the glory of Confucian learning?\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Learning brings honor through the Way, not through rank. I observe Ban Gu’s *History of the Han*: in discussing statecraft, he adorns the ruler’s flaws and suppresses loyal ministers; in expounding degenerate teachings, he values conformity and scorns integrity; in addressing current affairs, he refines rhetoric and neglects facts—he is no true historian.\"\n\n○ Mozi’s universal love is the abandonment of kinship; his doctrine of mourning is the forgetting of sorrow.\n\n○ Emperor Taizong of Han abolished mutilating punishments—this was the benevolence of a common man, not the benevolence of the world. To endure maiming another’s body yet endure killing them is what is called the benevolence of a common man.\n\n○ Yi Yin tilled the fields of Youxin—who knew he was not a rustic of Xia? Lü Shang did not treasure incense but fished by the Wei—who knew he was not a fisherman of Yin? Only upon meeting Tang, Wu, and King Wen did their true nature become known.\n\n○ One standing at a forked road fears losing the way; one gazing at a high mountain harbors the ambition to soar to the heavens. Some ride horses or chariots to reach Qin—this is what is meant by differing forms but identical substance.\n\n○ If one claims that boats and machines arose only after the Yellow Emperor, what did Fuxi use to cross the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers? Those who traverse vast seas may pass years without seeing their shores; those who plumb the depths of Yu Yuan may live lifetimes without knowing its bottom—thus the near cannot measure the far.\n\n○ In the Han, linchpin carts were despised; now they are prized.\n\n○ Blue and red are called *wen*; red and white, *zhang*; white and black, *ling*; black and blue, *bi*; the five colors together are called *embroidery*.\n\n○ The First Emperor ordered artisans to install crossbow mechanisms in his tomb—anyone who tunneled in would be shot. He used human fat and fish oil to make candles.\n\n○ A hound chasing a hare spends the whole day tracking it, never losing its scent; though it sees a deer, it has no time to glance.\n\n○ Emperor Gaozu of Han was broad-minded and his governance loose, so later generations valued sincerity and simplicity; Emperor Guangwu of Han was meticulous and his governance tight, so later generations upheld convention and propriety; Cao Cao of Wei valued severity amid chaos, so the world refined laws and prized order.\n\n○ When the body is upright, one does not seek the shadow’s straightness—yet the shadow is straight. When the sound is level, one does not seek the echo’s harmony—yet the echo is harmonious. When virtue is lofty, one does not seek fame’s reach—yet fame spreads far.\n\n○ In the western lands, the Hu say: \"Storax is an animal.\" In China, animal excrement stinks; suddenly hearing that western animal excrement is fragrant, one does not believe it.\n\n○ If one insists on Kunshan jade before carving, then uncut jade will never reveal its night-shining beauty. If one demands southern pearls before valuing them, then the Marquis of Sui’s pearl will never earn its \"bright moon\" renown. The First Emperor’s distant travels along the sea did not spare him the disaster at Pingtai; his burial at Mount Li was soon followed by grave robbers.\n\n○ Now, with lead and tin ore, even if Ou Ye smelts it a hundred times, it will not surpass a clay knife. With a horse of inferior stock, even if Zaofu drives it, it will never match the Flying Hare or the Swift Shadow—its nature is dull and slow. Earth cannot become iron but can become tile.\n\n○ The physiognomist says: \"The three pavilions and nine pulses are determined in a face of one foot; foolishness, wisdom, courage, and timidity are revealed in eyes of one inch.\"",
      "overlap_context": "lial. A horse fed grain for ten days and starved for one remains robust, with no harm to its well-being—yet one cannot equate this with starving a mother for a single day.\n\n○ At the end of the Han, a man named Guan Qiuyang fled with his younger brother and a companion. When snow fell and their provisions ran out, he said to his brother: \"If we do not eat now, the three of us will die together.\" They killed the companion, obtained food, and reached shelter. Later, an amnesty pardoned their crime.",

      "translated_text": "The celestial granaries and golden treasuries distinguish poverty from wealth, lowliness from nobility.\n\n○ Emperor Guangwu soared like a phoenix over Nanyang, while swallows and sparrows transformed into quails. The ministers of the two Han dynasties shone resplendent as the Three Luminaries adorning the vast sky; the soldiers of Changping stood as numerous as autumn grasses beneath heavy frost—such was the force of circumstance.\n\n○ Some giants stand several *zhang* tall, their bodies spanning nine *mu*, two heads upon separate necks, four arms sharing the same bones. Old men growing horns, men and women transforming—what bearing do these have on wisdom or folly?\n\n○ How could the Supreme Unity’s sovereign sit upon a commoner’s seat, or the majestic deity of the Dipper dwell in a humble woman’s chamber?\n\n○ Master Fu said: \"Zhuge Liang was truly a man of extraordinary talent in his time. In governing the state, he had his principles; in commanding the army, he had his methods. Through accumulating merit and advancing his cause, he seized the opportune moment. Entering enemy territory, no blade was left unused; departing, provisions remained in surplus. He knew Shu was inherently weak and precarious, thus he exercised restraint to stabilize it. Jiang Wei, however, sought to swiftly establish his achievements—bold yet reckless.\"\n\n○ Master Ma’s drawloom—Master Ma, named Jun, styled Heng—was the most ingenious craftsman under heaven. The drawloom originally had fifty heddles and fifty treadles, or sixty heddles and sixty treadles. Master Ma reduced it to two treadles, producing intricate patterns and extraordinary variations. Inspired, he created designs that could generate endless yin-yang transformations. The south-pointing chariot is recorded in the *Rites of Zhou* and also appears in the *Guiguzi*. Master Ma refined its mechanism.\n\n○ In governance, nothing corrects position like proper rank; nothing uplifts a state like its people; nothing unifies internal and external affairs like clear divisions; nothing clarifies moral instruction like learning. Grasp the warp, and the weft aligns itself; hold the root, and the branches naturally follow. A wise rewarder, by rewarding one good deed, encourages all good deeds under heaven; a wise punisher, by punishing one evil, eradicates all evil under heaven.\n\n○ In simpler times, officials were few; in refined eras, clerks multiplied. The Youyu dynasty had fifty offices, the Xia a hundred, the Yin two hundred, and the Zhou three hundred. The decline of state canons is like the loss of rank; without rank established, the principles of names and reason collapse.\n\n○ If one selects people by reputation, power shifts downward, and cliques thrive. If one promotes scholars by merit, the virtuous may go unappointed while the mediocre are entrusted with office.\n\n○ The noble person inwardly purifies their heart to receive others with emptiness, while outwardly establishing laws and unchanging principles. Today, people praise antiquity for its many worthies, lamenting the lack of talent in the present age. Yet they do not reflect thrice before speaking of the world—how can this not be delusion?\n\n○ Human nature is like water: placed in a round vessel, it becomes round; placed in a square vessel, it becomes square. When stilled, it clears; when stirred, it muddies. The former kings knew the midstream was easily disturbed, so they guided and instructed, setting fixed laws for those with partial preferences.\n\n○ A dragon boat with its oars aligned—even Wang Liang could not steer it. A team of swift horses moving in unison—even a Yue man dare not rein them. Each has its own ability.\n\n○ Those building a great hall first choose the craftsman, then select the materials; those governing a state first choose their aides, then settle the people.\n\n○ Learning is like thirst driving one to drink from rivers and seas: drinking deeply, one is deeply filled; drinking lightly, one is lightly filled. Observing broadly, one sees broadly; observing narrowly, one sees narrowly.\n\n○ Gold is used for its utility, coin for its light circulation—yet neither can be eaten in famine.\n\n○ Granting official positions in exchange for grain is selling office; allowing criminals to redeem their crimes is indulging evil.\n\n○ When wealth flows through the world, counterfeit coinage is forbidden; when poverty stagnates it, the destruction of coinage is forbidden.\n\n○ No harm befalls the Son of Heaven greater than the adornments of women. A single headpiece may cost a thousand gold, while the garments of maidservants rival the rarest treasures of the four seas.\n\n○ Dukes, ministers, and grandees carve stone into steles and engrave it into tigers. These steles and stone tigers, erected with false grandeur along the three thoroughfares, obstruct merit and corrupt virtue. Heterodoxies arise, the bells of Qin’s downfall are struck, and the licentious music of Zheng and Wei is played—how can governance possibly thrive?\n\n○ Rewards do not avoid the distant and lowly; punishments do not spare the close and noble. The noble have their constant names, which the lowly cannot usurp; the exalted have their fixed positions, which the humble dare not overstep. Weave governance with the warp of Dao and virtue, the weft of benevolence and righteousness, interlacing with ritual and law. Only after completion is it put to use—hence the tribute of Filial and Incorrupt, of Cultivated Talent, where from a thousand *li* away, people gaze in admiration and respond to its reputation. Thus, those who rely on substance gradually diminish, while those who accumulate emptiness grow daily.\n\n○ Hearing one good word or witnessing one good deed, one pursues it fearing they may fall short. Hearing one evil word or witnessing one evil deed, one distances themselves fearing they may not be far enough.\n\n○ A thousand gold hung in the marketplace—no one dares take it, for its portion is fixed. A single coin left on the road—children scramble for it, for its portion is undetermined.\n\n○ The Three Sovereigns valued the Dao and exalted virtue; the Five Emperors prioritized benevolence, then righteousness; the Three Kings prioritized righteousness, then order.\n\n○ A single goose feather sinks in water because it lacks force; a million *jun* of gold floats in a boat because it relies on the boat’s force.\n\n○ Inscribing the Golden Man’s admonition, one composes the *Mouth Inscription*:\nThe spirit communicates through resonance, the heart expresses through the mouth.\nFortune arises with omens, misfortune comes with signs.\nThe mind must not be deceitful, the mouth must not be loquacious.\nAn ant’s hole can breach a river; a trickle can topple a mountain.\nIllness enters through the mouth; calamity emerges from it.\nThe mechanism of survival and ruin, the art of opening and closing—mouth and heart conspire.\nThe source of safety and danger, the trigger of the pivot—honor and disgrace follow.\nWith a public heart, there must be a public Dao.\n\n○ Those who love themselves cannot help but love others; those who hate themselves cannot help but hate others.\n\n○ When the people are wealthy, they settle in their villages and value their homes, respect their superiors, and follow instruction. When impoverished, they endanger their villages and scorn their homes, gathering to defy their rulers. Few are those who, pressed by hunger and cold, do not commit wrongdoing.\n\n○ If I wish to fight but the enemy does not, when I drum and advance, it is like a mountain collapsing or a river flooding.

When victorious, they shared the spoils; when defeated, they rescued one another.\"\n\nDry-field farming depends on Heaven—though human effort is diligently applied, if floods or droughts come unseasonably, a year’s labor is lost.

Though the four seasons oppose one another, Heaven and Earth harmonize and unite. Moreover, the *Changes* differ in approach—mining gold or carving jade requires enduring hardship. If a road is not perilous, one cannot know the excellence of a horse; if a task is not weighty, one cannot know a man’s talent.\"\n\nWhen gentlemen meet, they do not merely encourage goodness—they also attack evil. If evil is not abolished, goodness cannot arise. To cure heat, nothing compares to drawing near water; to relieve cold, nothing compares to donning thick furs; to silence slander, nothing compares to cultivating oneself. A skilled angler does not change his deep pool to fish; a gentleman does not shift his seat to pursue the Dao.\n\n○ The petty man feels shame if his face does not resemble Zidu’s; the gentleman feels shame if his conduct does not resemble Shun and Yu’s. Thus, the petty man values a clear mirror, while the gentleman esteems profound words.\n\n○ Archery serves to steady the will; charioteering, to harmonize the heart; writing, to record events; calculation, to order complexity.\n\n○ Profit arrives like a sudden gale or a violent downpour—indifferent to right or wrong, heedless of straight or crooked, it seeks only to avoid exhaustion, and in its impetuous release, victory is assured.\n\nTo be discerning is to distinguish—it means skillfully differentiating matters and categories, not merely outstripping others in glib speech.\n\n○ The sage treads upon the loom’s shuttle and grasps its mechanism, comprehending the completion of Heaven and Earth, causing the myriad things to follow their course and human relations to be rectified. Raising a banner upon high makes its signal widely visible; shaking a bell in the wind makes its sound carry far—not because the banner’s colors grow brighter or the bell’s tone lengthens, but because their position is well-chosen. How much more so with the rich and noble issuing decrees!\n\n○ A good farmer does not fret over an unkempt threshing ground but worries over untimely winds and rains; a gentleman does not fret over the failure to establish his virtue but worries over the untimeliness of his era.\n\n○ In the age of the sages, there was no socializing; the Way of Zhou declined, and socializing flourished. In ancient times, associations were close; today, they are distant. In ancient times, associations sought worthies; today, they seek reputation. Appointments bypass the village and clan; conduct is not examined at the inner gate. Those with many supporters are called worthy talents; those with few admirers are deemed unworthy.\n\n○ A horse must be ridden before it can travel far; a physician must be employed before he can cure illness; the worthy must be put to use before they can bring order. *Forest of Meanings*, Scroll Five, ends.",
