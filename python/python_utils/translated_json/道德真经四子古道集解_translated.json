  "full_translation": "**The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Preface)**\n\n**Title:** *The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the Dao De Jing*.\n**Author:** Ke Houcai, a man of humble talent.\n**Volume:** Ten.\n**Source of the base text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Tongshen Bu* (洞神部), *Yujue Leisure* (玉诀类).\n**Collated edition:** *Wuqiu Beiqing* (无求备斋) shadow-printed *Daozang Jiyao* (道藏辑要) from Qing Jiang Yutang’s publication (hereafter referred to as the *Qingkan Ben* 清刊本).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\nI, your servant, am a nameless rustic from the marshes, one who has never sought advancement nor cared for worldly gain.\nUpon reaching adulthood, I became deeply enamored with the pleasures of tranquility and simplicity, delving into the arts of *Dan Jing* (内丹经, Inner Alchemy) and divination.\nIn my later years, I read the works of ancient scholars, pored over the teachings of the *Zi* (诸子, Hundred Schools), and probed the profound mysteries of *Zhuangzi’s* (庄子) *Dao*, finding meaning in every passage—truly profound and far-reaching.\n\nObserving the interpretations and annotations of other schools, I found their words often frivolous and extravagant, giving rise to conflicting doctrines, where red and purple (orthodox and heterodox) are indiscriminately mingled. Alas, they stray so far from the original Dao of antiquity, losing its true essence—how lamentable!\n\nOnly the works of the four masters—*Zhuangzi* (庄), *Liezi* (列), *Wenzi* (文), and *Gengzi* (庚)—are the true teachings of the *Five Thousand Words* (五千言), passed down directly by *Laozi’s* (老氏) disciples, each expounding upon the same Dao with consistent intent.\nThe other commentaries, though numerous and verbose, merely rely on ink and speech for their claims, offering no substance, no grounding in truth—how can they compare with the four masters?\n\nIn my youth, I once followed the court and wandered the capital, where I had the fortune to encounter the lofty Dao.\nThe lecturers there touched lightly upon the *玄关* (Xuan Guan, Mystic Pass), yet spoke only of emptiness and voidness, unable to convey even a fragment of the true Dao.\nReflecting inwardly, I felt no guilt, for my own understanding of the Dao was deep and self-attained.\nI wished to rescue the multitude from their manifold obstructions, to mourn the Way’s failure to prevail, yet feared that those ensnared in doubt and confusion might rise in noisy contention.\nThus, I gathered the four masters’ works, cited the authentic *Jing* (经), and compiled them into one volume—ten in total—\nto dismantle the redundant claims of others, and named it *The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary*.\n\nI also wrote *Ten Volumes of Commentary on the Classics and Histories* (述经史疏十卷) to serve as its counterpart.\nNow, by fortune, this discourse is complete.\nI do not presume to rely solely on my own conjectures,\nbut hope it may benefit both those of my own time and as a lesson for all ages.\nMay those of goodwill not scorn it,\nand in moments of rest, take up their brushes and record it directly.\n\nComposed on the first day of the Year of *Jǐhài* (己亥, 1915) in the *Dàdìng* (大定) era,\nby **Ke Houcai** (古襄寇才质), with reverence.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\" (道可道)**\n\nThis chapter in the *Nanhua Jing* (南华经, *Zhuangzi*) states:\n*\"The silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth—without action—are what the ancients held in highest regard,\nand what the Three Sovereigns (三皇) shared in common.\"*\n\nWhat did the ancient rulers of the world do?\nThey simply followed *Heaven and Earth’s* (天地) Dao of non-action.\n\nIn antiquity, the *Great Dao* (大道) was not named, and great eloquence was not spoken of.\nThe *Great Dao* was manifest yet not proclaimed,\nand words were eloquent yet did not reach their full extent.\nWho in later ages understood the unspoken teaching and the unspeakable Dao?\nIf any could grasp it, then this is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao of non-action,\nand the silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s nature is without desire,\nand non-action brings forth transformation naturally—\nno teaching, no speech.\nThe Dao that can be spoken of—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经, *Dao Yuan* 道原篇) says:\n*\"The affairs of benevolence and righteousness arise from human contrivance,\nresponding to changes and moving with the times—\nchanges that come from the seasons, where nothing is constant.\nThus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\"*\n\nNot the constant Dao—\n*The Dongling Jing* (洞灵经) says:\n*\"The later ages’ Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, and human affairs—\nthe so-called ‘teaching that can be spoken of’—\nis merely an adornment of words and a failure of governance,\nnot the constant Dao.\"*\n\nThe name that can be named—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The study of books arises from human speech,\nwhich comes from wisdom—\nyet wisdom is deceitful and false,\nknowing nothing of the Dao.*\nThose words inscribed on bamboo and silk,\nor carved into metal and stone,\nthat can be passed down to others—\nthese are not the true treasures of the Dao.\nThus, the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"*\n\nNot the constant name—\n*The Dongling Zhenjing* (洞灵真经) says:\n*\"In later ages, many recite medical texts,\nor study arts and crafts,\ncalling their spoken explanations ‘words that can be spoken of’—\nmere clever embellishments, not the true words.\"*\n\nWithout name, there is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Without name, there is no form,\nand the Great Dao without form is stillness and non-action.*\nThe Dao of constancy, the unspeakable Dao—\nvast and profound indeed!\nThis is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao without teaching.\"*\n\nWith name, there is the mother of all things—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"With name, there is form,\nand Heaven and Earth with form are stillness yet without speech.*\nThe constant speech, the unspeakable words—\nvast and profound indeed!\nThis is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Heaven and Earth without speech.\"*\n\nConstantly without desire, one may observe its mysteries—\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"There is the Dao of Heaven,\nwhich is honored through non-action.*\nHeaven and Earth possess great wisdom,\nyet remain detached and effortless.\nThe Great Dao is non-action,\nits mysteries unfolding naturally.\"*\n\nConstantly with desire, one may observe its perils—\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"There is the Dao of humanity,\nwhich is humbled through action.*\nHumans cultivate petty wisdom,\nyet remain detached and effortful.\nThe Dao of humanity is action,\nits perils born of contrivance.*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Action leads to harm and peril—\nthis is the end of contrivance.\"*\n\nThese two Dao—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Following Heaven is playing with the Dao,\nwhile following humanity is mere worldly learning.*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity—\nhow distant they are!\nOne must not fail to discern them.\"*\n\n**Shared Origin—**\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Unite differences to form the same.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Sage engages in teaching,\nuniting hearts and aligning paths.\"*\n\n**Yet with Different Names—**\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Dissolve the same to form differences.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Five Emperors and Three Kings of later ages pursued different affairs and divergent paths,\nthe Five Emperors differing in Dao yet bringing ruin to the world,\nthe Three Kings differing in affairs yet adapting to the times and changing their words.\"*\n\n**The Mysterious Unity**\n\n*\"The same is called the Mysterious.\"*\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The sages of antiquity harmonized their hearts with Heaven and their essence with the Dao—\nthis is called the profound, wondrous, and boundless Way of Non-Action.\"*\n\n*\"Mysterious beyond mysterious,\"*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The Dao is deep beyond depth,\nyet it gives birth to all things;\nDivine beyond divine,\nyet it refines all things.\nThe gateway to all wonders.\"*\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Dao stands alone yet gives rise to ten thousand things—\nthus, the roots of all affairs emerge from the single gateway of the Dao.\"*\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"All things arise yet no one sees their root;\nthey emerge yet no one sees their gateway.\nIts coming leaves no trace,\nits going knows no bound—\nno gate, no door,\nyet it moves freely in all directions.\nThe vast and boundless sovereign.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Two: The Unspoken Teaching of Heaven**\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) speaks:\n*\"The Sage penetrates the numinous treasury,\nbecomes human through alignment with Creation,\nholds the Mysterious Virtue in heart,\nand transforms with divine swiftness—\nwithout a word, yet stirring the world.\nThus, the Sage moves Heaven’s heart and transforms it.\"*\n\nTherefore, the teaching of the unsaid is vast beyond measure,\nthe argument of the unsaid is the Way that is not a Way—\nif one attains it, it is called the boundless Dao of Heaven’s treasury,\nthe Non-Action of Heaven and Earth’s silent teaching.\nAll things transform spontaneously,\nrequiring no partial completion.\nTo speak of \"beauty\" is to mar it—\nthe people detest what is not good.\n\n---\n**The World**\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Later ages ruled without the Dao—\nthey were the world’s bandits.\nAction, though useful, cannot govern.\nWhen the ruler acts, the people also act.\nAll know beauty when it is called beauty—*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经, *□微明篇*) says:\n*\"Later ages knew learning was shallow compared to the Dao,\nbut the ancients did not know learning was shallow compared to the Dao.\nNow, they know learning is external to desire,\nbut the ancients did not know learning was internal to nature.\nWho in later ages knows that knowing learning is ignorance of the Dao?\nWho knows that ignorance of learning is true knowledge of the Dao?\nThus, when all know beauty as beauty, it becomes evil.\nIt becomes evil.\"*\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be heard with the ears—\nhearing is not the Dao, but learning.\nThe Dao cannot be seen with the eyes—\nseeing is not the Dao, but learning.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken with words—\nspeaking is not the Dao, but learning.\nThus, it becomes evil.\"*\n\n*\"All know goodness when it is called goodness—*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经, *□无始*) says:\n*\"The ancients did not know learning,\nyet they were deep in the Dao.\nNow, they know learning,\nyet they are shallow in the Dao.\nThey do not know the inner nature,\nbut know learning as external desire—\nthus, in the midst of purity, they sigh:\n'The ancients did not know learning,\nyet they knew the Dao.\nWho in later ages knows that ignorance is true knowledge of the Dao?'\nThus, when all know goodness as goodness, it becomes ungoodness.\nIt becomes ungoodness.\"*\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be heard with the ears—\nhearing is not the Dao, but learning.\nThe Dao cannot be seen with the eyes—\nseeing is not the Dao, but learning.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken with words—\nspeaking is not the Dao, but learning.\nThus, it becomes ungoodness.\"*\n\n---\n**The Interdependence of Opposites**\n\n*\"Being and non-being generate each other,\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The ruler’s Way lies in the interplay of being and non-being.\"*\n\n*\"Difficulty and ease complete each other,\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The ancients governed with upright teaching—\neasy and it would surely succeed.\nLater ages governed with perverse teaching—\ndifficult and it would surely fail.\nTo abandon what is easy and pursue what is difficult\nis to court failure—\nthus, difficulty and ease complete each other.\"*\n\n*\"Long and short define each other,\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"In ancient times, the people were unspoiled,\nand long and short did not contrast.\nLater ages, with their actions, made long and short define each other.\"*\n\n*\"High and low incline toward each other,\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"In ancient times, the people were unspoiled,\nand high and low did not incline—\nlight and heavy balanced, untilted, without overturning.\nLater ages saw high and low incline toward each other.\"*\n\n*\"Sounds harmonize with each other,\"*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The teaching of the Great Person is like sound to its echo.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Like an echo responding to sound,\nthe ruler sings above, the people respond below.\"*\n\n*\"Before and after follow each other,\"*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The teaching of the Great Person is like form to its shadow.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Like a shadow mirroring form,\nbefore and after follow each other.\"*\n\n---\n**Thus, the Sage**\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The origin of the Great Dao lies in conforming to Heaven.\nThe highest sages conform to Heaven.\nTo conform to Heaven is to follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nemptiness, stillness, and Non-Action—\nthis is called Heaven and Earth.\nTo dwell in Non-Action,*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The ancient kings of the Way dwelled in Non-Action.*\nTo practice the teaching of the unsaid,*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The ancient kings of the Way practiced the teaching of the unsaid.*\n\n*\"All things*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Now, when we count things by number, though they exceed ten thousand,\nwe call them 'ten thousand things' for the sake of naming and recitation—\nthus, we say 'ten thousand things.'\"*\n*—are made yet not claimed,*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Heaven does not give birth yet all things are nourished;\nEarth does not give birth yet all things are transformed.\"*\n*—born yet not possessed,*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to things,\nyet no one sees what nourishes them—\nthus, all things grow.\nThis is called the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action.\"*\n*—done yet not relied upon,*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Dao completes things,\nyet no one sees what it does—\nthus, all things are complete.\nThis is called the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action.\"*\n*—and the deed accomplished without taking credit.*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"To not take credit is to practice Non-Action.\nNon-Action means no dwelling, no speech, no action.\nThe Great Dao is Non-Action—\nits deeds are accomplished without knowing what is done.\nOnly by not taking credit*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"To not take credit is to dwell in Non-Action,\nto move without action, to speak without words.\"*\n\nThus, it is not abandoned. *The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*\"The Dao’s Non-Action makes talent arise naturally.\nThe Perfect Man’s virtue—\nunadorned, yet nothing can separate from it.\"*\n\n**Chapter 3: Not Exalting the Virtuous and Wise**\n\nThis chapter of *The Nan Hua Jing* (□ *Tian Dao Pian*) speaks:\n*\"In ancient times, the virtue of emperors and kings took Heaven and Earth as their foundation, Dao and virtue as their master, and Non-Action as their constant. Non-Action means governing the world with abundance.\nThus, the sage-rulers of the most ancient times ruled the world with empty hearts and full bellies—this was Non-Action.\nThey always kept the people ignorant, desireless, and without daring to act, not exalting the virtuous, the wise, or wealth.\nNon-Action brings governance.\nNot exalting the virtuous—\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'In the age of the Great Dao and supreme virtue, the virtuous were not exalted, the capable were not employed. The ruler was like a fallen branch, the people like wild deer. They made the people not contend.'\nMaking the people not contend—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Xia De Pian*) says:\n*'In later generations, human nature and disposition all desire to surpass others and resent those who outdo them. Desiring to surpass breeds contention; resenting those who outdo breeds grievance and contention. Grievance and contention arise, then the heart is disordered and qi reverses.\nThe ancient sage-kings retreated from contention and grievance—when contention and grievance do not arise, the heart is governed and qi flows smoothly.'\nThus it is said: Not exalting the virtuous, making the people not contend.\nNot valuing hard-to-obtain wealth—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Shang Yi*) says:\n*'The ancient way of governing a state led the people, not valuing hard-to-obtain wealth, not prizing useless things, making the people not steal.\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'The ancients hid gold in mountains, pearls in depths—they did not profit from wealth.'\nNot seeing what is desirable—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The ancient sages did not see what was desirable; their hearts and spirits were still, thus they were without desire, making the heart not disordered.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'In later generations, rulers indulged in beauty, not restraining their conduct, and the state fell into chaos, accumulating to the point of licentious calamity. Thus, those who govern must be cautious in what they inspire.\n*The Chong Xu Jing* says:\n*'Later rulers’ licentiousness led to the people’s licentiousness, but the ancient sages were serene and desireless, and the people naturally remained simple.'\nThus, the sage’s governance—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The foundation of governance lies in Non-Action. Thus, the sage’s governance is empty, still, and tranquil, cultivating the Dao of Nature, serene and without action, yet the world is governed.\nEmpty the heart—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'In governing, an empty heart attains the Dao. The sage empties the heart of all things, seeing insufficiency.\nSeeing insufficiency, thus able to perfect virtue, while the extravagant do not endure.\nFill the belly—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The ancient sages guarded the inner while not losing the outer, thus their chests and bellies were full and their cravings few.\nWeaken the will—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'In governing, a weakened will attains the Dao. A weak will and strong affairs—calm and undisturbed, yet naturally attaining.\nStrengthen the bones—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The governance of the Perfect Man abandoned cleverness, erased artifice, thus aligning with the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action.\nWhen the divine attains the inner, the five viscera are tranquil, thoughts balanced, sinews and bones strong, ears and eyes keen—firm and unexhausted, nothing they cannot reach.\nAlways keeping the people—\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'The ancients practiced Non-Action, thus governed the world with abundance. The ruler above practiced Non-Action, the people below also practiced Non-Action.\nIgnorant and desireless—\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'The ancients aligned with ignorance, their virtue not departing. Aligning with desirelessness, the people remained simple.\nMaking the knowing dare not act—\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'The ruler above must practice Non-Action to govern the world; the people below must act to serve the world—this is the unchanging Dao.'\nPracticing Non-Action—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'Practice Non-Action, manage without managing, know the unknown.'\n*The Nan Hua Jing* says:\n*'The emperor’s duty lies in Non-Action—then nothing is ungoverned.'\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The ancient sages were serene and without action, yet nothing was left undone. Serene and without governance, yet nothing was left ungoverned.'*\n\n**Chapter 4: The Dao’s Effortless Flow**\n\nThis chapter of *The Nan Hua Jing* speaks:\n*\"The Dao’s effortless and harmonious qi nourishes all things.\nIt is everywhere, wherever it is, it exists.\nIn ants and crawling creatures, it does not fail to nourish and rear—why does the Dao humble itself to blunt their sharpness?\nIn tiles, bricks, soil, and stone, it does not fail to complete—why does the Dao, instead, further scatter their confusion?\nIn weeds and grasses, it does not fail to grow—does the Dao humble itself to soften its radiance?\nIn excrement, urine, and filth, it does not discriminate against filth—it equals them with dust.\nDeep and vast, as if it might exist—\nI do not know whose child this great form is;\nit mirrors the Emperor’s primordial Heaven, the Dao’s qi.\nThe Dao’s effortless flow—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Great Dao’s yin-yang harmonious qi is pure and clear.\nAnd its use—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Wei Ming Pian*) says:\n*'The Dao’s effortless flow is used, yet it is not full.\nSometimes it does not overflow.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Dao—harmonious qi, effortless yet not full.\nDeep, as if the origin of all things.\nBlunting their sharpness—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Dao blunts sharpness—there is no cruelty or evil.\nDissolving their confusion—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Dao dissolves confusion—there is no contention or disorder.\nSoftening its radiance—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Dao softens its radiance—there is no grievance or resistance.\nEqualing the dust—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*'The Dao equals the dust—it unifies with filth.'\"\n\nThe Dao abides as if it exists.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Heaven, through it, is clear—\nserene and still.\"*\n\nI do not know whose child it is.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"I do not know whose child it is.\"*\n\nIt precedes the Emperor.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Ran Qiu asked Zhongni:\n'Can the child of the formless Dao\nbe the ancestor of the formed Heaven and Earth?'\nZhongni said:\n'If there is something that precedes Heaven and Earth in form,\nis it not all things?\nThings arise from things—\nthe Dao is not the maker of things.'*\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**\nThis chapter of *The Nanhua Jing (Zhi Beiyou)* speaks:\n*\"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak,\nthe four seasons have clear laws yet do not debate,\nall things have their natural order yet are not explained.\nAncient sages observed Heaven and Earth’s effortless beauty,\ngrasped the natural principles of all things—\nthus the sage does nothing,\nthe great sage takes no action,\nobserving Heaven and Earth’s effortless Way.\nThey do not teach the petty virtues of benevolence and righteousness,\nnor the many words of artificial deeds,\ntreating the people as grass-dogs,\nfollowing the natural winds of the sage—\nthus the world is governed.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent.\n*The Tongxuan Jing (Natural Section)* says:\n*\"The Way of Heaven and Earth takes virtue as its master,\nthe Dao as its decree,\nthings self-regulate.\nMost subtle within,\nit does not honor rank through deeds,\nnor demand ritual to be solemn—\nthus the Dao stands without teaching,\nits radiance shines without scrutiny.\nThe Dao stands without teaching—\nit does not deprive people of their abilities.\nIts radiance shines without scrutiny—\nit does not harm their affairs.\nThose who teach the Dao\nact against virtue and harm things—\nthus yin-yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases\nshare the Dao yet differ in principle,\nall things share sentiment yet differ in form.\nThe wise do not instruct one another,\nthe capable do not receive from one another—\nthus Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,\ntreating all things as grass-dogs.\"*\n\nTreating all things as grass-dogs.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth do not act artificially—\nthey rectify the Dao, and things naturally arise.\nYin-yang and the four seasons do not create all things,\ntimely rain and dew do not nourish plants—\nwhen divine resonance meets,\nyin-yang harmonizes,\nall things are born.\"*\n\nThe sage is not benevolent.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts,\nletting them follow their nature—\nthus the living have no virtue,\nthe dead have no grievance.\nBenevolence, love, righteousness—\nthese are narrow ways.\nThe narrow enter the great and are lost,\nthe near travel far and are confused.\nThe sage enters the great without losing his way,\ntravels far without confusion,\nconstantly empty and self-guarded—\nthis is called Heaven’s virtue.\nThus the sage is not benevolent,\ntreating the people as grass-dogs.\"*\n\nTreating the people as grass-dogs.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The people follow their ruler like grass follows the wind,\ntheir transformation is like wind swaying grass.\"*\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Earthly resonance—this is the multitude of holes.\nResonance—\nthe Great Block exhales, its name is Wind,\nblowing in myriad ways,\nyet letting things be natural.\nAll things roar and cry—\nwho commands them?\nIt is as if they cast away their keys.\"*\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Human resonance—this is the bamboo pipes.\nWind acts without force—\nif it acts, all things roar and cry,\nmovement becomes sound.\nA cool wind brings small harmony,\na gusting wind brings great harmony—\nlike blowing through human resonance,\nbamboo pipes, or keys.\"*\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The highest sage follows Heaven’s empty stillness and effortless action—\nthis is the Way to govern Heaven and Earth.\nKnowing the Way of empty stillness,\none can begin and end—\nthis is called Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nMoving yet ever emerging.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"The Tang ruled the world,\nwandering the broad streets,\nheard children’s songs:\n*'Establish the boiling people,\nnone but your extreme.'*\nNot knowing, not knowing,\nfollowing the Emperor’s decree.\nTang asked joyfully:\n'Who taught you this song?'\nThe child said:\n'An ancient poem.'*\n\nMany words lead to exhaustion.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Later generations know books yet the Dao declines,\nknow numbers yet virtue declines.\nThose who rely on numbers labor without fruit,\nthose who rely on books and numbers\nare born from clever speech.\nWords arise from intelligence—\nthe clever are deceitful and false,\nunaware of the Dao.\nMany words lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the Middle.\"*\n\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"Qi and Lu abound in clever devices,\nthere are those skilled in books and numbers.\"*\n\nBetter to guard the Middle.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The foundation of teaching lies in removing petty achievements.\nThose who embody the Dao\nare at ease and unexhausted,\ntheir spirit transforms effortlessly—\nthe world subtly responds.\nThis is called Heaven and Earth’s unspeakable teaching—\nvast and boundless!\nIf later ages know this,\nit is called the great Dao of Heaven’s treasury,\nHeaven and Earth’s unspeakable teaching.\"*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**\nThis chapter of *The Nanhua Jing* speaks:\n*\"The Great Dao is formless,\nyet it gives birth to emotions, ghosts, gods, and the Emperor—\nit generates Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven receives one breath—\nclear and empty, it governs its movement,\nEarth receives one breath—\nsettled and tranquil, it holds its place.\nThus the Valley Spirit of Heaven and Earth does not die—\nthis is called the divine mystery of yin-yang’s primal mother,\nthe creative force.\nThe primal mother—\nthe gateway of yin-yang,\nthe root that moves Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven is continuous, as if it exists,\nEarth uses it without effort.\nThe Dao—\nthe root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Valley Spirit does not die,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*'Heaven and Earth constantly generate and transform—\nnever ceasing to generate,\nnever ceasing to transform,\nthe four seasons—\nthe Valley Spirit does not die.'\nThis is called the primal mother.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*'The Great Dao constantly generates and transforms,\nnothing it does not generate,\nnothing it does not transform—\nyin-yang—\nthis is called the primal mother.\nThe gateway of the primal mother,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*'The Great Dao’s yin-yang—\ndoubtful, its Way is unfathomable,\nthe gateway of the primal mother.'\"\n\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nHeaven and Earth’s four seasons—\ntheir cycles endlessly return,\nnever ceasing to return—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous, as if it exists,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nContinuous, as if it exists.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Great Dao’s utmost subtlety—\ncontinuous, as if it exists,\nthus able to govern Heaven’s movement.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nHeaven’s movement.\n\nUsed without effort.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nUsed without effort.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nEarth’s use is natural.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nUsed without effort,\nthus able to sustain Earth’s endurance.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**\nThis chapter from *The Nanhua Jing* [☐ *Yang* Section] speaks:\nThe Great Dao—\nthe greatest of *qi*.\nHeaven and Earth—\nthe greatest of form.\nThe Dao acts impartially;\nHeaven and Earth are without favor,\nthus able to endure.\n\nTherefore, the ancient sages, when about to abdicate,\noffered the throne to rulers who upheld Heaven’s impartiality,\ncovering all like the heavens.\nThe realm endured long,\ntheir bodies perished yet they lived on,\ntheir bodies abandoned yet they survived—\nwas it not because of their lack of favoritism?\nThus their favor was fulfilled.\nHeaven long, Earth enduring.\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nHeaven covers without favor,\ncovering all without exception.\nEarth bears without favor,\nbearing all without exception.\nThus Heaven and Earth could endure long.\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Great Dao—\nthe greatest of *qi*.\nHeaven and Earth—\nthe greatest of form.\nThe Dao acts impartially;\nHeaven and Earth are without favor,\nthus able to endure.\n\nBecause they do not seek self-generation,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nAs Heaven’s own height,\nEarth’s own depth,\nthe Sun and Moon’s own luminosity—\nwhy should they seek to prolong themselves?\nBecause they do not seek self-generation,\nthus able to endure long.\nThus able to long endure.\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nHeaven and Earth go without favor,\nneither repelling nor attracting,\nthus able to endure long.\n\nTherefore, the sages—\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nTang and Zhao abdicated to Shun,\nwho did not refuse and accepted it.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nEmperors and kings properly abdicated,\nthe Three Dynasties properly succeeded—\ntiming their era,\nopposing customs was called usurpation.\nWhen in accord with the times,\nfollowing customs was called the righteous path.\n\nDelaying the times,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth takes the later as primary;\nthe sage follows the Dao’s retreat,\nthus securing safety through retreat.\n\nYet their bodies perished first,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nRetreat, thus able to lead—\nthis is what Heaven and Earth accomplish,\ntaking the later to gain the first.\n\nAbandoning their bodies,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth takes the small as foundation;\nthe sage follows the Dao’s smallness,\nthus securing protection through humility.\n\nYet their bodies survived.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nSmall, thus able to become great—\nthis is what Heaven’s Dao accomplishes,\ntaking loss to gain preservation.\n\nWas it not because of their lack of favoritism?\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient sages preserved with Heaven and Earth,\nimpartial and just.\nThus their favor was fulfilled.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe sages of old had no private virtue,\ntheir lack of private virtue—\ntheir lack of private fortune.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good as Water**\nThis chapter from *The Tongxuan Jing* [☐ *Dao Yuan* Section] speaks:\nWater’s Way—\nabove, it becomes Heaven’s rain and dew,\nbelow, it becomes Earth’s moisture,\nall things cannot but live,\nall affairs cannot but succeed.\nIt bears Heaven’s gifts and gives to all,\nnourishing all things,\nsharing with Heaven and Earth—\nthis is called supreme virtue.\n\nWater’s gentleness nears the Dao;\nthe ancient sages modeled Heaven’s goodness,\nlike water’s supreme virtue.\n\nThe supreme good as water,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNone are softer or weaker than water.\nWater benefits all things,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s Way—\nabove, it becomes Heaven’s rain and dew,\nall things cannot but live.\nAnd it does not contend,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater flows without contention,\nswift in departure yet not delayed.\nIt dwells where all despise,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIts blessings extend even to gnats,\nyet it seeks no reward.\nThus it nears the Dao.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater aligns with Heaven and Earth’s vastness—\nthis is called supreme virtue.\nWater’s gentleness nears the Dao.\n\nDwelling is good in humility,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s Way—\nbelow, it becomes Earth’s moisture,\nall things cannot but live.\nThe heart is good in depth,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s breadth is boundless,\nits depth unfathomable.\nGiving is good in kindness,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater enriches the world yet exhausts no virtue.\nSpeech is good in trustworthiness,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater supplements what is lacking,\nbearing Heaven’s gifts and giving freely.\nGovernance is good in order,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s ebb and flow—\nits excess is beyond measure.\nAction is good in capability,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s utility penetrates metal and stone,\nstrong enough to overcome all.\nMovement is good in timing.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater nourishes all things without precedence.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s ability to fulfill Heaven and Earth’s supreme virtue\nlies in its flexibility and reach.\nThus it incurs no blame.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWater’s Way—\nall affairs cannot but succeed,\nits extent endless, its depth boundless,\nit encompasses all life,\nbenefits the people without exhaustion.\n\n*The Dao De Jing: Four Children’s Ancient Dao Exegesis, Volume One Complete*\n*The Dao De Jing: Four Children’s Ancient Dao Exegesis, Volume Two*\n\n**Chapter Nine: \"Holding and Filling\"**\nThis chapter, from *The Tongxuan Jing*, speaks of the last age’s rulers—dukes and marquises—whose arrogance and extravagance cannot endure. *The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The ancient sages destroyed the reckless surge of ambition.\"*\nWealth and nobility, these two, are the surge of ambition.\nIf the heart remains undisturbed, it is upright.\nUprightness means emptiness, stillness, non-action—and yet nothing remains undone.\n\n*\"Holding and filling\"*—\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Filled, it overflows—one must not indulge to excess.\"*\n*\"Do not push to the limit.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (*Wei Ming* section) says:\n*\"Holding and filling—better to stop in time.\"*\n*\"Prodding and sharpening\"*—\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Sharpened, it dulls—one must not indulge in arrogance.\"*\n*\"It cannot long endure.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Prodding and sharpening—it cannot long endure.\"*\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"Weighing harm and gain—better to stop in time.\"*\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Ancient sage-kings dwelled in fullness without overflow, thus enduring.\nThe last age’s overflowing perishes.\nNone can guard it.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Dwelling in great fullness without spilling, filled yet unlacking—\nthus one long preserves wealth.\nThe last age cannot guard it—losing the world.\"*\n\nWealth and nobility bring arrogance—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Born noble, one grows arrogant; born rich, one grows extravagant.\nThe last age’s arrogant and extravagant perish.\nThey invite their own ruin.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Few are the wealthy and noble who, without self-restraint, do not perish.\"*\n\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is secured—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth reach their limit and reverse; fullness brings depletion.\nThe sun and moon are proof—\nat zenith, they decline;\nat fullness, they wane.\nHow much more so for mortals!\nRetreat is the Way of Heaven.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"When a ruler grows arrogant, he indulges to excess—\nnone who do so escape ruin.\nThus, when achievement is complete, retreat is the Way.\"*\n\n**Chapter Ten: \"Carrying the Vital Essence\"**\nThis chapter, from *The Zhuangzi* (*Tian Dao* section), speaks:\nThe six qualities—emptiness, stillness, softness, weakness, simplicity, non-action, purity, and naturalness—\nthese are the form of the Dao.\nHeaven and Earth are balanced; virtue reaches its peak.\nThus, emperors and sages rest their thoughts and quiet their hearts.\nRest brings emptiness, stillness, non-action—and the world is governed,\nnothing left undone.\n\nTherefore, the divine persons of antiquity—true persons, perfect persons, sages, Daoists, virtuous ones—\nembodied these six qualities:\nemptiness, stillness, softness, weakness, simplicity, non-action, purity, and naturalness,\nunmixed with things.\nTheir virtue was supreme, the Way of Heaven and Earth—\nthus they were called divine and sage.\nThe truly authentic, through non-action, governed the world—\nthus they endured.\n\n*\"Carrying the vital essence, embracing unity\"*—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The divine persons of antiquity embodied the Dao in emptiness and stillness—\n'emptiness' is the Dao’s dwelling.\nEmptiness means the heart bears no burdens;\ndesires are not loaded—\nthis is the utmost emptiness.\nMachinations and cleverness do not burden the sovereign’s heart;\nunified, all affairs are complete.\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The divine person rides the light—\nwith form, he perishes.\nThis is called the divine person.\nCan he truly be unattached?\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The ancients aligned inwardly with the Dao, doing nothing.\nTheir unity made them companions of Heaven.\nNowadays, they conform outwardly but not inwardly—\ndoing much, they follow others.\"*\n\n*\"Focusing the vital breath, attaining softness\"*—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The ancient sages embodied the Dao, guarding softness and weakness—\nsoftness is the Dao’s strength;\nweakness is the Dao’s power.\nSoftness and weakness are the Dao’s operation.\nAccumulated softness becomes strength;\naccumulated weakness becomes power—\nwithout accumulation, this never occurs.\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Sage governance—\nofficials act without losing propriety,\nthe capable are promoted without losing their talents,\nall emotions and affairs are revealed,\nactions and words are spontaneous—\nthus the world transforms.\nWhen the hands move, the fingers point—\npeople from all quarters come together.\nThis is called sage governance.\nCan one be like an infant?\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The ancients transformed outwardly but not inwardly—\nnon-acting governed within, yet they did not act outwardly.\nNowadays, they transform inwardly but not outwardly—\nacting outwardly, they do not govern within.\"*\n\n*\"Purifying and gazing into the mysterious\"*—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The ancient perfect ones embodied the Dao, guarding simplicity—\n'simplicity' means the heart bears no burdens.\nNeither liking nor disliking—\nthis is the utmost simplicity.\nSimplicity and ease—\nthis is Heaven and Earth’s balance.\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The perfect person’s heart is like a bell—\nneither repelling nor inviting,\nresponding to things without hoarding,\nthus overcoming things without harm.\nThis is called the perfect person.\nCan one be without flaw?\"*\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The ancients governed inwardly without action,\nyet did not govern outwardly with action.\nNowadays, they govern outwardly with action,\nyet do not govern inwardly without action.\"*\n\n*\"Loving the people, governing the state\"*—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The ancient Daoists embodied the Dao, guarding non-action—\n'non-action' means guarding stillness.\nGuarding stillness makes one king of the world.\nStillness is the Dao’s mirror.\nUnchanging unity—\nthis is the utmost stillness.\nSo-called non-action—\ndoes it mean things do not come when drawn,\nor go when pushed?\nPressured, it does not respond;\nmoved, it does not stir;\nrigid and stagnant, it does not flow;\nrolled and grasped, it does not scatter.\nDoes this mean private desires do not harm the public Way?\nDesires do not injure proper virtue—\nthus ever empty, ever non-acting,\nembracing simplicity, holding purity,\nnot clinging to things—\nthis is called non-action.\"*\n\nCan one attain non-action?\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancients savored the Dao without abandoning it,\nwhile the moderns abandon the Dao without savoring it.\nTo abandon the Dao and rely on learning is perilous;\nto forsake virtue and employ talent leads to困境.\n\nThe opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient True Persons embodied the Dao, guarding purity.\nPurity—this is the Dao’s essence.\nUnmixed with things, the utmost purity.\nStill, it aligns with yin’s closure;\nmoving, it aligns with yang’s opening.\nTo reach the point of no excess in pleasure—\nthen there is no lack of joy.\nNo lack of joy is the utmost joy—\nthis is how True Persons wander the Dao of purity.\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe ancients, True Persons—\ntheir sleep was dreamless,\ntheir waking free of worry,\ntheir spirit pure,\ntheir soul unexhausted,\nempty and tranquil,\nthus harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue.\nPurity unmixed—\nthis is the Way of nurturing the spirit.\nThe Way of purity\nis guarded solely by the spirit,\nso *sū* (素) means unmixed with anything,\n*pú* (纯) means unblemished in spirit.\nTo embody purity and simplicity—\nthis is called a True Person.\n\nCan one attain non-duality?\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNow, observing the ranks of True Persons above,\ndelving deep into the intent of virtue and Dao;\nbelow, examining the common customs of the world—\nthis is enough to shame and disgrace the shallow and impure.\n\nClarity and openness in all directions,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient virtuous embodied the Dao, guarding simplicity.\nTo have no worry, no joy—\nthis is the utmost virtue.\nConfucius asked of the Dao, and Laozi said:\n*\"Rectify your form,\nunify your gaze—\nHeaven’s harmony will arrive.\nGather your wisdom,\nrectify your measure—\nthe spirit will come to dwell.\nVirtue will be your vessel,\nthe Dao will be your abode.\nYour pupils like those of a newborn calf, without desire,\nyour form like withered wood,\nyour heart like dead ashes.\nTrue and real, yet not scheming—\nthus self-sustaining, boundless,\nheartless in plotting,\nclear and open in all directions—\ncan one attain non-knowing?\"\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe virtuous person—\ndwelling without thought,\nmoving without deliberation,\nnot storing up right and wrong, beauty and ugliness—\nall within the Four Seas rejoice in sharing benefits as ease,\nfind security in mutual provision,\nlost as an infant separated from its mother,\nwandering as one who has lost the path.\nWealth overflows yet they know not its source,\nfood suffices yet they know not its origin—\nthis is called the bearing of the virtuous person.\n\nCan one attain non-knowing?\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancients of old were clear, entering simplicity,\nreturning to non-action, restoring purity,\nupright without guile—\nthus the people were easily guided.\nUtmost loyalty restored purity—\nthe people had no deceit or concealment.\nNow, those of later generations who govern through cleverness\nlabor their minds yet remain unclear;\nthose who govern through scheming\ntoil their hearts yet achieve no success.\n\nThe nurturing of life and its sustenance—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThese six principles of governance—\nthe ancient kings thus held the realm without action and yet prevailed.\nThe Dao generates and sustains without contrivance—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nTo generate yet not possess,\n*The Nanhuajing* says: To generate yet not possess.\nTo act yet not rely,\n*The Nanhuajing* says: To act yet not rely.\nTo grow yet not dominate,\n*The Nanhuajing* says: To grow yet not dominate.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe sages of the Great Antiquity held the Mysterious Virtue in heart,\nand their transformations moved like the divine—\nno decrees issued, yet customs shifted,\nmores transformed—\nthis was the silent teaching of the unspoken Way,\nthe boundless and vast.\nFew know this teaching of non-action,\nthis Way of the unuttered.\nHow profound and great it is!\nIf later ages could but know this,\nit would be called the Dao of Heaven’s Treasury, the Way of Non-Action.\n\n**Thirty Spokes Converging at the Hub (Chapter Eleven)**\nThis chapter from the *Nanhuajing* [missing character] *Mati* [or *Mashui*] says:\nIn my view, the ancients who governed well did not rely on fixed rules.\nThe people of old had natural inclinations—\nthey wove and clothed themselves,\nthey tilled and fed themselves—\nthis was called harmony of virtue.\nUnified yet without factions,\nthis was called Heaven’s release—\nthe people were pure and simple, without artifice or craft.\nLater generations, the potters said:\n“I excel in shaping clay—\nround forms conform to the compass,\nsquare forms to the square.”\nThe carpenters said:\n“I excel in working wood—\ncurved forms fit the hook,\nstraight forms align with the plumb.”\nYet clay and wood by nature do not seek to conform to compass, square, hook, or plumb—\nand yet ages praise them as “the potter and carpenter excel in shaping clay and wood.”\nThus, they fostered artifice and deceit—\nthis too is how later rulers, teaching the crafts of earth and wood,\nexceeded in artifice and deceit.\nIn ancient times, white jade was left uncarved—\nwho would make it into *gui* or *zhang*?\nPure simplicity was left unbroken—\nwho would carve it into sacrificial vessels?\nThus, to ruin simplicity for tools—\nthis was the excess of later artisans’ craft.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the age of perfect governance,\nplain and undyed carriages and garments made people envious,\ndesires were sparse and light—\npeople took joy in their labor and service.\nThis was the foundation of governing the state.\nIn the decadent later ages,\nornate and elaborate carriages and garments made the vulgar emulate them—\npeople lost sincerity and purity, shaming simplicity while valuing extravagance.\nTo shame simplicity and value extravagance—\nthis is called the *fufu* (floating and insubstantial),\nthe ladder to a state’s ruin.\nThus, in later ages, the Five Emperors introduced carriages, dwellings, and the three implements—\nthey shamed simplicity and valued extravagance.\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient governance, artisans did not indulge in excess craft—\ntheir carriages were plain and uncarved,\nthirty spokes converged at one hub.\nWhen their essence was absent,\nthe carriage’s use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater artisans indulged in elaborate craft—\ncarriages became extravagantly carved,\ntaking years to complete,\nbenefiting expense more than use.\nTo mold clay into vessels,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient governance, artisans did not indulge in excess craft—\ntheir vessels were plain and undecorated.\nWhen their essence was absent,\nthe vessel’s use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater artisans indulged in elaborate craft—\nvessels became excessively carved and inlaid,\ntaking years to complete,\nbenefiting expense more than use.\nTo pierce doors and windows for dwellings,\n*The Nanhuajing* says:\nAnciently, they dwelled in nests and caves—\ncalled the *Youcang* (Nest-Dwelling) clan,\neating acorns and chestnuts by day,\nsheltering in trees by night.\nWhen their essence was absent,\nthe dwelling’s use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater, under a single ruler’s authority,\nthey exhausted the people’s strength to indulge the senses—\ntheir ambitions fixed on palaces, pavilions, ponds, and enclosures.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nTo seize control of affairs through earthworks—\nthis is called great calamity.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nQi and Lu abounded in ingenuity,\nwith masters of earth and wood.\nThus, they took what was present as profit—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNow, shaped tools serve their purposes.\nTo serve purposes is to complete tools.\nThus, labor yields profit,\nbut useful tools destroy the Way.\nTo take what is absent as use—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient Way was formless—\nthis was the beginning.\nThe beginning was simplicity.\nThus, the unnamed was taken as use—\nto use simplicity is to avoid tools.\n\n**The Chapter of the Five Colors (Chapter Twelve)**\nThis chapter from the *Nanhuajing* says:\nIn ancient times, perfect joy lay in preserving life,\nmerely by preserving non-action.\nBut people of the later ages—\nwho among them could attain non-action?\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue.\nWhat they delight in are bodily ease, rich flavors,\nfine garments, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds.\nWhat they despise are poverty, lowliness, and evil.\nWhat they suffer are:\nthe body not at ease,\nthe mouth not tasting rich flavors,\nthe form not adorned in fine garments,\nthe eyes not feasting on beautiful colors,\nthe ears not hearing pleasing sounds.\nIf these are not obtained, great anxiety arises—\nfearing harm to the body,\nthey injure their essence and damage their nature—\nhow foolish and deluded they are!\n\nMoreover, losing one’s nature has five forms:\nOne, the five colors dazzle the eyes, making them dim;\nTwo, the five sounds assail the ears, making them deaf;\nThree, the five stinks assail the nose, bewildering the forehead;\nFour, the five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue parched;\nFive, taking and rejecting disturb the heart, causing the nature to scatter.\nThe finery of feathers and tassels—\nthis is the extreme of color;\nThe sounds of bells and drums—\nthis is the extreme of music.\n\nThe palate’s indulgence in sweetness is the extreme of taste.\nThese five extremes—color, sound, scent, flavor, and desire—\nare all great harms that shorten the lives of the people.\n\nThis warns the degenerate rulers of the last age,\nwho indulge in sound and color, abandoning Dao and losing the world.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Nine Guards Section] says:\n*\"One: The five colors dazzle the eyes, making them dim.\"*\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"The eyes behold the dazzling hues of brocade and embroidery,\nand are thus bewildered, forgetting their purpose—this is called chaos.\"*\n\nThe five tones deafen the ears.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Two: The five sounds assail the ears, making them deaf.\"*\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"The ears are assailed by the clamor of bells, drums, pipes, and strings,\nand are thus bewildered, forgetting their purpose—this is called chaos.\"*\n\nThe five flavors parch the mouth.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Three: The five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue ulcerate.\"*\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"The five stinks assail the nose, bewildering the forehead.\nThe five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue parched.\nThe mouth indulges in the flavors of grain, livestock, wine, and rice wine,\nand is thus bewildered, forgetting its purpose—this is called chaos.\"*\n\nHunting and galloping madden the heart.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Four: Taking and rejecting disturb the heart, causing the nature to scatter.\"*\nHunting and galloping disrupt the people’s seasons and exhaust their strength.\nThe degenerate rulers dissect fetuses and burn the altars,\noverturn nests and shatter eggs,\nburn forests and drain marshes to catch fish—\nphoenixes no longer soar, and qilin no longer roam.\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"The people of Handan, on the first day of the first month,\npresented doves to Lord Jianzi, who rejoiced greatly and rewarded them.\nA guest asked why. Lord Jianzi said:\n‘On the first day, I release them to show my benevolence.’\nThe guest replied:\n‘The people, knowing you wish to release them,\ncompete to capture them, and many die.\nIf you truly wish them to live,\nyou should forbid the people from capturing them.\nCapturing and releasing them—your kindness does not compensate for the harm.’\"*\n\nRarity in goods leads to misconduct.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"In the degenerate age, those seeking wealth vie for the difficult,\nand jade and pearls are coveted by all under heaven.\"*\nThe degenerate rulers quarry mountains, extract gold and jade,\ndig for pearls and abalone, melt copper and iron—\nand all things wither and fail to flourish.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"Now all under heaven are bewildered by sound, color, scent, and taste—\nwho can rectify them?\"*\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The foundation of rectification lies in abandoning sound and color.\nThe gentleman cultivates upright qi;\nthe petty man cultivates perverse qi.\nTo align internally with nature and externally with righteousness,\nto move in accordance with principle without being enslaved by things—\nthis is upright qi.\nTo indulge in flavors and lust after sound and color,\nwithout heeding future calamity—\nthis is perverse qi.\"*\n\nFor the sake of the belly,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds,\nthe nose in fragrance, the mouth in taste—\nall united in pleasure, never departing from desires of gain and harm.\"*\nThe ears, eyes, mouth, and nose know not their own desires;\nthe heart alone governs them, each attaining its fill—\nthus, it is clear that desire cannot be exhausted.\n\nNot for the sake of the eyes,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves flavors,\nthe ears lust after the five tones, the nose after the five scents—\nthe seven orifices contend, harming the one true nature,\ndaily drawing in perverse desires and exhausting the celestial harmony.\nThe body itself cannot be governed—\nhow then can one govern the world?\"*\nThus, abandon these and take that.\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Thus, abandon these and take that—\nand calamity from Heaven will not arise.\nIf one obtains this, forgetting that,\nthen blame departs and fortune arrives.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On Honor and Humiliation**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks of the ancients’ abandonment of turbulent ambition.\nName and profit, honor and display—these are turbulent ambitions.\nIf the heart remains undisturbed, then it is upright;\nupright, it is empty, tranquil, and without action.\n\nTang yielded the world to Yú Yóu, but Yú Yóu refused.\nHe then yielded it to Zīzhōu Zhīfù, who said:\n*\"To be made king is acceptable.\nYet I suffer from melancholy illness and must attend to it—\nI have no leisure to govern the world.\"*\nThe world is the heaviest of burdens,\nyet he did not use it to harm his life—\nhow much less would he harm other things?\nOnly those who do not cling to the world\ncan entrust themselves to it.\n\nShun yielded the world, and Shàn Jiàn said:\n*\"I stand amid the cosmos,\nwearing fur in winter and hemp in summer,\nplowing and planting in spring to labor,\nharvesting and storing in autumn to rest.\nI rise with the sun and rest with the moon,\nwandering freely between Heaven and Earth,\nand my heart and mind find contentment—\nwhy should I concern myself with the world?\"*\nAlas, the Master does not know me!\nThus, he declined and departed into the deep mountains,\nand none knew his whereabouts.\n\nHow much more so the warring states’ rulers,\nwho contend for fame and profit,\nruining themselves and their nations—\nfor they take honor as their affliction.\nOne who can yield the kingship to entrust the world,\nwho values life and honors the body,\ncan thus endure long.\n\nHonor and humiliation strike like a shock.\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"Name is a guest; the body is the host.\nName is the guest of the body,\nyet the foolish pursue only the guest.\nIf there is a name, there is honor;\nif the name is lost, there is humiliation.\nHonor brings ease and pleasure—\nthis aligns with nature.\nHumiliation brings sorrow and suffering—\nthis violates nature.\"*\n\nTreasure great affliction as the body.\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"To cling to a name and burden the body\nis to invite ruin and death—\nhow much worse than mere ease or suffering?\"*\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation striking like a shock?\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"When honor and humiliation are established,\nthen one perceives their affliction—\nhow can one not be cautious?\"*\n\nHonor is supreme,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Dao Original Section] says:\n*\"Wealth, nobility, and renown.\"*\n\n「Having a name is honor and esteem, with the highest virtue as its pinnacle.\nShame is the lowly state,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Dao Original Section] says:\n*\"Poverty and obscurity lack a name.\"*\n\nWithout a name, one is lowly and shamed—\nthis is the fate of the base and despised.\nTo gain it is as if struck by a shock,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Profit is the beginning of fortune,\nyet profit and harm share the same gate.\"*\n\nTo lose it is as if struck by a shock,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Fortune is the precursor of calamity,\nand calamity and fortune dwell as neighbors.\"*\n\nThis is what is called *honor and humiliation striking like a shock*.\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Discern the distinction between inner and outer,\nand clarify the boundaries of honor and shame.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *treasuring great affliction as the body*?\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Now, those who take the profit and harm of the Spring and Autumn era as great affliction—\nthey must not fail to observe them carefully.*\n\n*My great affliction lies in this:*\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The will has desires,\nyet forgets its afflictions.\"*\n\n*For me, having a body is the affliction,*\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The foolish are bewildered by petty profit\nand forget their great affliction.\"*\n\n*When I have no body,*\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"If one does not seek a name, there is no exhaustion;\nif one does not seek profit, there is no harm.\nWhat affliction do I have?\"*\n\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The body’s completeness is its foundation;\nwealth and nobility are but its lodging.\"*\n\nThus, *treasuring the body as the Dao for all under Heaven*,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Upper Virtue Section] says:\n*\"The ancients who could honor life—\nthough wealthy and noble, they did not let a name exhaust their body,\nthough poor and lowly, they did not let profit burden their form.*\n\n*Now, those who receive noble titles from their ancestors—*\ntheir life’s origin is distant indeed,\nyet they lightly court its loss—\nare they not bewildered by name and

Great [State]\ncan be said to have honored life.\nHe loved the body as the Dao for all under Heaven.\"*\n\n*The *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"The ancients who could honor life—\nthough wealthy and noble,

speaks:\n*\"In ancient times, the sage followed the Dao of yin-yang and emptiness-nothingness,\nto govern the manifest forms of Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*Heaven and Earth, with their manifest forms,*\nare born from the Dao of yin-yang’s formlessness—\nthus, Heaven and Earth’s manifest forms arise from the Dao of yin-yang’s formlessness,\nand so there is the *Taiyi* [Great Unity],\nthe *Tai Chu* [Great Primordial],\nthe *Tai Shi* [Great Beginning],\nand the *Tai Su* [Great Primitive].\n\n*Thus, the Taiyi is the beginning of the spirit,\nthe Tai Chu is the beginning of qi,\nthe Tai Shi is the beginning of form,\nand the Tai Su is the beginning of substance.\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s qi, form, and substance are complete yet separate,\nit is called *Hun Dun* [Chaotic Primordium].\n*Hun Dun* refers to Heaven and Earth’s mingling and separation in formlessness.\n\n*Seeing yet not seeing,*\nhearing yet not hearing,\npursuing yet not attaining—\nthis is called the *Great Dao*.\n*The Dao has no form yet stands firm,*\nand so it is called *natural*.\nIf one can shape the primordial transformations of antiquity,\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nthe mingling of yin and yang in

*Xi* [Rarity],\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"The Taiyi is the beginning of the spirit,\nand hearing yet not hearing.\nIt is also called the *Tai Ji*.\"*\n\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The Tai Ji has a name—\nhearing yet not hearing its sound,\nthis is called the *ultimate subtlety of yin-yang*.\n*Life emerges from nothingness,*\nand though soundless, it gives Heaven and Earth their voices.\"*\n\n**Pursuing yet not attaining** is named *Wei* [Faintness],\n*The *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"The Tai Shi is the beginning of vital essence,\nand pursuing yet not attaining.\"*\n\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The Tai Shi has a name—\npursuing yet not attaining its form,\nthis is called the *subtle and mysterious state*.\n*Form emerges from the faint,*\nand though formless, it gives Heaven and Earth their shapes.\"*\n\nThese three—\nthey cannot be fully explained,\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The Great Dao of yin-yang,\nin stillness, has no body, no hue, no sound—\nthus, the Dao cannot be spoken of.\"*\n\nThe Dao is without inquiry,\ninquiry without response.\n*The *Zhuangzi* says:\n\"The Dao is without inquiry,\ninquiry without response—\nit cannot be spoken of.\nThe

Sixteen: *Zhì Xū Jí* (Extreme Emptiness)**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:\n*\"Ancient worthies lived long without artificial exercises,\nfor they neither forgot the heart nor cultivated the spirit,\nneither neglected the Dao nor guarded stillness—\nthis is the Way of Heaven and Earth,\nthe virtue of the Sage’s non-action.\nThus it is said:\n*'Serene, tranquil, still, and without

externals,\nand their life and fate lost their truth.\nNot knowing constancy,*\n*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"When the Zhou declined,\npurity dispersed, simplicity departed,\nthe Dao became the falsehood of literature,\nvirtue became the ritual of music,\ncleverness and artifice arose,\nancestral teachings doubted the Sage,\nornate deception coerced the masses,\nand the world became muddled

Shang’s Talent and Quality*: Some editions suspect the omission of the phrase *\"Bo Le (伯乐) was skilled in treating horses\"* after the word *\"say.\"*\n\n**Volume III, *The Essence of the Dao and Upholding Non-Action*: *Ancient Shang’s Talent and Quality***\n\n**Chapter Seventeen of the *Tao/Way*’s Supreme Perfection**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings addressed flaws and reformed institutions,\ncompleted matters and then altered their approach;\ntheir excellence lay in harmony,\ntheir shortcoming in *authoritative measures* (权).\nLater generations’ Dao says:\nWithout laws, governance cannot be established;\nwithout knowing *rites and moral principles* (礼义), laws cannot be formed.\nLaws can kill the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\ncan punish thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above,\nthey clearly showed what was good and evil,\nguided the people with *non-punitive* (经非誉) instruction,\nadvanced the worthy and virtuous,\nrelegated the unworthy and base,\nand laid aside punishments, never using them.\nThe Three Kings made the world fear punishments and dare not steal or plunder—\nhow could this compare to the ancient Dao’s simplicity and purity,\nwhere there was no thievish heart at all?\nTeaching should not be harsh;\nremoving harshness brings self-regulation.\nIf one does not know the principle of *non-action* (无为) for the individual,\nbut instead relies on *punishments and governance* (刑政) as a remedy,\nthis is no different from\ndigging a channel to stop water,\nembracing firewood to extinguish flames—\nthe more you add, the more it overflows;\nthus, *stirring to calm* (扬止沸) only makes the disturbance worse.\nThose who know the principle of *non-action* governance\nneed only remove the fire.\nHence it is said:\n*I uphold non-action and the people transform themselves,*\n*I love stillness and the people become upright.*\nThe Supreme Perfection—\nthe people below know its existence.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing*’s *Natural Chapter* (□自然篇) says:\nThe Supreme Perfection is *spontaneous transformation* (神化);\nin ancient times, the Three Sovereigns (三皇) nurtured this transformation,\nissuing no commands yet the people followed.\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above,\nthey clearly showed what was good and evil,\nlaid aside punishments, never using them—\nthis was the foundation of governance.\nCourts were uncluttered, with no litigious disputes,\nfields were cultivated, with no pretense of martial tools;\nthus, the Supreme Perfection—\nthe people below know its existence.\n\n**The Next Level:**\nThey were close to them and praised them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe next level was the Five Emperors (五帝), who issued commands,\npreventing wrongdoing but without rewards or punishments.\nThe next level:\nThey were feared and reviled by them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe next level was the Three Kings (三王), who relied on punishments and rewards,\nlevying punishments to suppress violence,\ngranting rewards to encourage virtue.\nThe people feared punishments and dared not act wrongly—\nthis was not *law and order* (法令) being upright above,\nbut the people below submitting in fear;\nthis was the end of governance.\n*Trust was insufficient,*\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*When words are the same, trust lies in their sincerity—*\n*sincerity precedes words;*\n*when commands are the same, obedience lies in their truth—*\n*truth lies beyond the commands.*\nThe Xia ruler did not break his word,\nthe Shang people swore oaths,\nthe Zhou people made alliances.\nYet there were still cases of dishonesty.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nThis shows that the world’s dishonesty\ncomes from rulers not being diligent and clear.\n*It was because they valued words.*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*When the ruler speaks, the subjects act;*\n*when the subjects speak, the ruler acts.*\n*When the ruler speaks, it is always applied;*\n*when the subjects speak, it is applied contingently.*\nAncient sage-kings knew how to use *contingent measures* (权),\nso when they spoke, it must be believed,\nand their words must always be fulfilled.\nWhen their deeds were accomplished and their purposes realized,\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*Ancient sage-kings*\n*refined themselves inwardly*\n*and governed the people outwardly;*\n*when their deeds were accomplished and their purposes established,*\n*they dwelled beside Heaven,*\n*upholding non-action yet achieving all things.*\nThe people said they acted *spontaneously*.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*Sincerity is the word of the virtuous;*\n*loyalty is the intention of the virtuous.*\nWhen loyalty and sincerity manifest inwardly,\nthey move and respond outwardly—\nthis is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:\nIn ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,\nthe time of *He Xiu* (赫胥氏),\nthe people did not know what to do,\ntheir actions had no fixed direction;\nthey carried their food in their mouths and walked joyfully,\nthey drummed their bellies and wandered at ease.\nThe people could thus remain pure and simple,\npossessing loyalty and filial piety.\nWhen the Three Kings (三王) suspended *benevolence and righteousness* (仁义) to soothe the world’s hearts,\nthe Great Dao declined, yet *benevolence and righteousness* arose,\nand the six relationships (六亲) became discordant.\nThen the Five Hegemons (五霸) bent and twisted *rites and music* (礼乐) to rectify the world’s punishments,\nand *wisdom* emerged, bringing great *deceit* (伪).\nStates became chaotic and confused,\nand the people began to strain for cleverness,\ncompeting to gather *skillful advantages* (巧利),\nunable to be restrained.\nThis was also the fault of the Three Kings’ *benevolence and righteousness*—\nthough they achieved minor success,\ntheir teaching of cleverness and wisdom bred *thieves and deceit* (贼诈) among the people.\nThe Three Kings relied on *punishments and governance* (刑政) under the pretense of the Dao,\nand took shelter in *righteousness* (义).\n*Benevolence and righteousness* were the Three Kings’ *temporary dwelling* (蓬庐),\nsufficient only for a night’s stay,\nnot for long-term residence—\nthey were not the enduring Dao.\nWhen the Great Dao declined,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*rectitude was natural, yet they did not call it benevolence;*\n*mutual love was natural, yet they did not call it righteousness.*\n*Following one’s nature was called the Dao;*\n*attaining one’s natural endowment was called virtue/power (德).*\nThus, the Five Emperors’ Dao dispersed into human virtue/power (德).\n*Benevolence and righteousness* arose;\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Three Kings’ virtue overflowed into *benevolence and righteousness*,\nand when *benevolence and righteousness* were established,\nthe Dao and its virtue/power (德) declined.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The Three Kings’ governance of the world*\n*was called \"benevolence and righteousness through action,\"*\n*and their governance brought the greatest chaos.*\nWhen *benevolence and righteousness* advanced the worthy,\nthe people turned to *mutual deceit* (相贼),\ninsufficient to enrich the people—\nsons began to kill their fathers.\n\nWhen *wisdom* emerged,\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*The Five Hegemons’ Dao narrowed,*\n*later relying on rites and wisdom.*\nThose who relied on wisdom\nbrought disorder to the hearts of the people;\nthe wise produced *fraudulence* (奸),\nand *fraudulent customs* (奸俗) became the wind of *state collapse* (亡国).\n*Great deceit* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*When the Five Hegemons’ rites and music spread widely,*\n*the seven states waged war with their armies,*\n*and the world fell into chaos.*\nWhen rites and music relied on wisdom,\nthe people turned to *mutual deceit* (相盗),\ninsufficient to enrich the people—\nsubjects began to kill their rulers.\n\nWhen the six relationships (六亲) became discordant,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The six relationships were discordant,*\n*the old and young lacked order—*\n*this was the concern of the common people.*\n*Filial piety and kindness* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*filial sons did not flatter their parents—*\n*this was the height of a son’s virtue;*\n*serving one’s parents brought kindness and filial piety.*\n\nWhen states became chaotic and confused,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The court lacked loyal ministers—*\n*this was the concern of chaotic states and the lords.*\n*Loyal ministers* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*loyal ministers did not flatter their rulers—*\n*this was the height of a minister’s virtue;*\n*serving one’s ruler brought loyalty and steadfastness.*\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: \"Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom\"**\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sages established teachings and governed by first examining their ultimate outcomes, seeing how they fostered virtue. In later ages, when the people knew scriptures, the Dao declined; when they knew calculations, virtue declined; when they knew contracts, trust declined; when they knew mechanical arts, substance declined.\n\nMinor cleverness harms the true; minor skill harms the Way; petty debate ruins governance; harshness injures virtue. In ancient times, the Great Way was unobstructed and straightforward, so the people were easily guided. In the age of perfect governance, all were at ease, so the lower ranks did not harm the higher. In the age of supreme loyalty, they returned to simplicity, and the people had no deceit or concealment.\n\nWhen they composed written records, it was to oversee and manage all affairs—so the simple remembered, and the wise recorded events. But when [governance] declined, they used deceitful writings to exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent.\n\nThose who scrutinize the traces of ink and parchment do not know the principle of non-action as the root of order and chaos. Cunning and deceit took root, thieves and bandits multiplied, and the more the ruler desired, the more the people schemed.\n\nTo use writing and cleverness to generate solutions is like stirring water and hoping for clarity—it is difficult. Thus, to stop the boiling, one removes the fire. Those who know the principle of non-action as the root of governance say: *\"I take no action, yet the people govern themselves.\"*\n\n**Discard the Sage, abandon wisdom.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in the sage? That aids the people’s artifices.\nDo you delight in wisdom? That aids the people’s flaws.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Discard the sage, abandon wisdom, and the world will flourish greatly. The people’s benefit will be a hundredfold.\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nScholars of writing are the source of speech. Speech arises from wisdom, and the clever, though skilled in deceit, do not know the Dao. The people become chaotic through falsehood.\n\n**Discard benevolence, abandon righteousness.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in benevolence? That disrupts the people’s virtue.\nDo you delight in righteousness? That contradicts the people’s natural order.\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAbandoning benevolence and righteousness, the people revert to filial piety and kindness, and thus the world’s virtue begins to harmonize in its primal unity. When people embrace their inherent virtue, the world becomes unerring.\n\n**Discard cleverness, abandon profit.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in ritual? That aids the people’s artifices.\nDo you delight in music? That aids the people’s excesses.\nDo you delight in sharp hearing? That makes the people indulge in sound.\nDo you delight in bright vision? That makes the people indulge in color.\nThen thieves and bandits will cease.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—selecting the worthy and employing the wise—are insufficient to enrich the people. The people are overly eager for profit, stealing even in broad daylight, digging through walls at noon. Thus it is said: *\"Discard cleverness, abandon profit, and great thefts will cease.\"*\n\nThese three [principles]—\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nWhen the people’s strength and wisdom are exhausted, they rely on deceit. The more they scheme, the more falsehood spreads, and how can the common people avoid it? When strength is insufficient, they resort to deceit; when wisdom is insufficient, they resort to cunning. If deceit and falsehood prevail, whom can one blame? Blame the ruler’s fondness for cleverness and wisdom.\n\nThey say: *\"The written word is insufficient,\"*\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nTo value ornate language, to discard substance, to drown in cleverness—this is when the people begin to be confused by superficiality. Without returning to their true nature, it is insufficient to enrich the people.\nThus, this is what is said today.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nMountains produce gold, stones produce jade—\nYet they erode each other in turn.\nHumans cultivate learning,\nYet it harms them in return.\nEach pursues what they fancy,\nOnly to injure themselves in turn.\n\nWhen the ruler is troubled, the people are unsettled;\nWhen the ruler demands much, the people contend.\nTo govern through learning and then suppress learning—\nIt is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nThus, to stop boiling by adding more water\nOnly makes the boiling worse.\nThose who know the root of governance\nRemove the fire itself.\n\nTherefore, abandoning sage-wisdom,\nDiscarding virtue and righteousness,\nRejecting the worthy and capable,\nErasing artificial conventions,\nProhibiting deceit and falsehood—\nThen the virtuous and the base alike align with the Dao.\n\n**Seeing the Unadorned**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-governed\nPracticed clarity and stillness—\nTrue and unadorned,\nEmpty and effortless,\nReturning to simplicity,\nUnmixed with the world.\n\n**Embracing Simplicity**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAncient sages illuminated the unadorned,\nPracticed non-action and returned to simplicity—\nSimple and unadorned,\nYet none could rival their excellence.\n\n**Few Private Interests**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn the southern lands of Yue,\nThere was a realm called Jiande,\nWhere the people were simple and unadorned,\nFew in private desires,\nKnowing to act but not to hoard,\nGiving without seeking return,\nUnaware of where righteousness lay,\nUnconcerned with where propriety led—\nYet their reckless freedom\nAligned with the Great Way.\n\n**Few Desires**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nAncient sages acted without effort,\nYet the people transformed naturally;\nThey were detached without desire,\nYet the people returned to simplicity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty: \"Abandon Learning, Be Without Worry\"**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* speaks:\nIn the latter ages, great academies are established to teach—\nThis is but a skill of governance.\nWhen the Dao is attained, learning is practiced;\nWhen the Dao is lost, learning is abandoned.\n\nAll things have their tension and release,\nTheir flourishing and decay.\nWhen decline comes, they drift without return,\nIndulging in lust and color,\nIgnoring proper law,\nTheir corruption spreading to later generations,\nUntil kingdoms fall—\nThis is the result of their learning.\n\nTo lose the Dao and rely on learning is perilous;\nTo abandon virtue and employ talent is to invite hardship.\nTo govern through cleverness is to labor the mind without clarity;\nTo govern through cunning is to exhaust the mind without success.\n\nWhen the ruler studies much, the people labor much;\nWhen the ruler is troubled, the people are disordered.\nTo govern through learning and then suppress learning—\nIt is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.\nThus, abandon learning, be without worry.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Dao Yuan] says:\nBooks of learning are the source of spoken words.\nWords arise from cleverness,\nAnd cleverness is deceit and falsehood—\nUnknowing of the Dao.\nThus, abandon learning, be without worry.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAbandon learning, discard books—\nThen there will be no worries.\n\n---\n**Yes and Ah**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* recounts:\nLaozi asked Nan Rongzi:\n*\"You come from Chu, do you not?\"*\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n[Laozi] used cleverness in his questioning,\nYet Nan Rongzi, in his madness and bending,\nReplied, *\"Ah!\"*\nHow far apart were they?\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, the nine schools of scholars\nClutch their texts,\nHold fast to doctrine and law,\nHoping to govern by them—\nLike gripping a square handle to fit a round hole,\nSeeking what is proper—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\n---\n**Good and Evil**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nAncient practitioners of the Dao—\nDeep practice was called *virtue and power*,\nShallow practice was called *righteousness and justice*,\nThin practice was called *rites and wisdom*.\nHow far apart are they?\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnciently, one must first attain *virtue and power*;\nCunning schemes were not employed.\nOne must return to Heaven’s way,\nGovern through non-action—\nThis is the utmost in peaceful governance.\n\n---\n**What People Fear**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Shang Ren] recounts:\nWenzi asked:\n*\"What conduct makes the people love their ruler?\"*\nLaozi replied:\n*\"Govern them with due timing and reverence,\nAs if standing at the edge of a deep abyss,\nAs if walking on thin ice.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nThe good are my nurtured kin,\nThe unrighteous are my foes—\nThus, what people fear,\nOne must indeed fear.\"*\n\n**It Cannot But Be Feared**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times,\nThe ministers of Xia and Shang\nTurned against their tyrants, Jié and Zhòu,\nAnd served Tāng and Wǔ instead.\nThe people of Hù Hóng\nAttacked their own descendants\nAnd returned to Shén Nóng.\nThus, what people fear,\nCannot but be feared.\n\n**Endless Wasteland**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, to govern without the Dao\nIs to harm the world.\nTo make an enemy of the people—\nThis cannot be done.\nEndless wasteland.\n\n---\n**The Common Folk Rejoice**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, when rulers employ people,\nThey value those whose ears hear well,\nWhose eyes see clearly,\nWhose words can be spoken—\nThus, the people compete to gain praise,\nAdorning their speech to be heard—\nGovernance fails.\n\n**Like Feasting on the Grand Sacrifice**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Ji Cheng] says:\nThrough diligent and laborious cultivation,\nTen days without food,\nYet it is like feasting on the grand sacrifice—\nLearning without satiety,\nThis is how one sustains oneself.\n\n**Like Ascending Spring Terrace**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, when rulers employ people,\nThey value those whose ears hear well—\nThen the people transport goods for profit,\nCompeting for praise.\nThey value those whose eyes see clearly—\nThen the people display their forms and skills,\nStriving to advance.\nThey value those whose words can be spoken—\nThen the people practice flattery,\nAdorning their speech.\n\n**I Alone Fear**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings employed people\nWho were valued not for what their ears heard,\nNot for what their eyes saw,\nNot for what their mouths could speak—\nYet the people acted effortlessly and naturally.\n\n---\n**Its Onset Unseen**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nScholars learn what they should not learn—\nUntil they attain the Dao—\nLike an infant before it knows harm.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nA three-month-old infant,\nUnknowing of gain or loss,\nUnspeaking yet transformative—\nHow vast is this change!\n\n**The Wanderer**\n\n*\"Buying Buying\"*—as if having nowhere to return.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nTo dwell is to act without purpose,\nTo move is to go without destination,\nTo undertake is to ride without aim,\nTo stir is to halt without intent—\nThis is called the Dao.\nThe common folk all have excess,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe common people’s learning is laborious,\nThey listen yet lack clarity,\nThey see yet fail to discern,\nTheir offices are untrustworthy,\nTheir actions bring no order,\nTheir deeds achieve nothing.\nYet I alone seem abandoned.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Sage’s Dao is simple and humble,\nNot listening yet clear,\nNot seeing yet insightful,\nNot speaking yet trustworthy,\nNot acting yet bringing order,\nNot doing yet achieving success.\nI am but a foolish man’s heart—\nPure and unadulterated.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe vulgar scholars of old,\nThe Sage did not follow.\nThe common folk are bright and discerning,\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, those who take people\nBy their sharp hearing and keen sight—\nTheir offices multiply yet governance is chaotic,\nAnd all vie for profit.\nI alone seem dim.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, those who sought\nUnseen, unheard, unspeakable talent—\nTheir officials were upright yet diligent in virtue,\nAnd the people transformed without words.\nAlas, does the ruler know this?\nI alone am obscure and veiled.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, when the Way was followed,\nThose who sought unseen, unheard, unspeakable talent—\nTheir officials were upright yet diligent in virtue,\nAnd the people transformed without words.\nAlas, does the ruler know this?\nDark as if in eclipse,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe ancients’ Sages had hearts like dead ashes,\nObscure and dim,\nNo scheming in mind—\nThis was their *wuwei*.\nSilent, yet as if endless.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe heavens have light—\nThey do not fear the people’s dimness;\nThe earth has wealth—\nThey do not fear the people’s poverty.\nOnly by following the natural Way of heaven and earth,\nCan one master the principles.\nThe common folk all have means,\nThe *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:\nAll take what comes first—\nThe sharp are destroyed.\nAll seek fortune—\nThe keen are blunted.\nI alone am stubborn, like the vulgar.\nThe *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:\nI alone take what comes last,\nAnd receive the world’s defilements;\nI alone bend yet remain whole,\nAnd escape blame.\nI alone differ from others,\nThe *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:\nAll take what is real—\nI alone take what is void,\nWith depth as my root,\nWith restraint as my measure,\nAnd laugh at cleverness without action.\nYet I cherish the nourishment of the Mother.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nTo always be broad and accommodating toward things,\nYet never diminished by others—\nThis can be called the utmost extreme.\nLaozi! The ancient sage of boundless truth.\n\n**The Sage’s Virtue and Form (Chapter 21)**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* (from the \"□至乐篇\" [*Zhi Le Pian*]) speaks:\nThe Dao is formless yet gives rise to the formed heaven and earth,\nVague and indistinct yet never exceeds existence.\nIndistinct yet vague—\nYet no image can be found.\nExamining its Way, it first arises yet originally has no arising,\nOriginally has no *qi*, originally has no form.\nMixed amid the indistinct, vague, and void—\nVoid transforms into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into *qi*,\n*Qi* transforms into form,\nForm transforms into life—\nThis is the interplay of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons.\nThus it is said: *\"Yǎo míng wú xíng\"*—profoundly formless,\nYet within it is essence.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it are the four seasons’ verities—\nThis is the Dao’s true essence.\nThe Sage’s virtue and form,\nFollow the Dao alone.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Great Constant Dao,\nFlows and permeates,\nNever moves in vain,\nWith yielding and contracting,\nWith the ebb and flow of yin and yang.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs but faint and fleeting.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nBefore heaven and earth took form,\nProfound and dark,\nFaint and fleeting.\nFleeting and faint—\nYet within them are images.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nFleeting and faint—\nImages cannot be fixed.\nFaint and fleeting—\nYet within them is substance.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nFaint and fleeting—\nTheir application is unyielding.\nProfound and dark—\nYet within them is essence.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nAgain, obtaining the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang,\nOnly then can heaven and earth, the myriad things, arise and flourish.\nWithin it is verity.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Dao is formless—\nYet within it is verity.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Dao has sentiment and verity—\nThis is the interplay of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name does not fade.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe four seasons as markers,\nFrom ancient times to now,\nNever changing or altering—\nThis is called the natural principle of heaven.\nTo observe the myriad people.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Dao stands and gives rise to the myriad things,\nThus the myriad things’ totality,\nAll pass through the Dao’s single aperture;\nThe myriad affairs’ roots,\nAll emerge from the Dao’s single gate.\nHow do I know the myriad people are thus?\nBecause of this.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nYin and yang, the four seasons,\nGive rise and form to the myriad things.\n\n**Bending Preserves Wholeness (Chapter 22)**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* (from the \"□天地篇\" [*Tian Di Pian*]) speaks:\nThe ancients who nurtured the world,\nOne person without desire—\nYet the world is sufficient;\nOne ruler without action—\nYet the world is transformed;\nOne sovereign profound and tranquil—\nYet the people are settled.\nUnified in One,\nAll affairs are complete.\nThus the ancient Sages feigned crookedness and harm to their own abilities,\nEmbraced the ruler’s *wuwei* as the method\nTo govern the world,\nAnd the myriad things transformed of their own accord.\nFew officials yet governance was clear—\nThey did not boast of their many talents.\n\n**Bending Preserves Wholeness (Chapter 22 continued)**\n\nBending preserves wholeness.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe bent seeks to stretch—\nBend an inch to stretch a foot.\nThe noble one does this.\n\nCrookedness brings straightness.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe crooked seeks to straighten—\nA small crook yields great straightness.\nThe noble one does this.\n\nHollow makes full.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient skilled rulers modeled themselves on the rivers and seas,\nHollow and low, to achieve their vastness.\nThose who follow this Dao do not desire fullness.\n\nWorn becomes new.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nOnly because it is not full does it renew itself without ceasing.\n\nFewness suffices.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe affairs of the ancients were few.\nWhat is meant by \"few affairs\"?\nGrasp the essential to match the many,\nHold the simple to govern the broad.\nFewness is the economy of what is held—\nThus, with the Dao to guide it, even fewness suffices to govern.\n\nExcess brings confusion.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe affairs of today’s people are many.\nWhat is meant by \"many abilities\"?\nCultivated in both martial and civil arts,\nBalanced in action and stillness,\nEvery move and pause fittingly placed—\nMany abilities seem to govern all,\nYet the more they seek, the less they gain, unaware of their loss.\nThus, though many, they bring disorder.\n\nTherefore, the Sage:\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancients—when unified in One, all affairs were complete.\nThe ancients knew One, and the world knew none unknown.\nLater ages did not know One, and the world knew none truly.\nEmbrace One as the model for the world.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancients held to *wuwei* and One—\nHold One, and governance succeeds;\nLose One, and chaos follows.\nOne is the Dao of no preference,\nThe root of all things.\nThus, to lose One is worse than to have no ruler.\nA ruler must hold to One to govern the people,\nYet tremble and fear daily,\nEver cautious—\nThus, through *wuwei*, the Dao of One is fulfilled.\nWhat is held is strict,\nWhat is governed is vast.\n\nNot self-visible, hence clear;\n*The Tongxuan Jing* [*Natural Section*] says:\nNot self-visible, hence clear.\n\nNot self-righteous, hence manifest;\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNot self-righteous, hence manifest.\n\nNot self-praising, hence功 (*gōng*) achieved;\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNot self-praising, hence功 (*gōng*) achieved.\n\nNot self-proud, hence enduring.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNot self-proud, hence enduring.\n\nOnly the non-contending:\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient skilled rulers practiced *wuwei* and non-contention,\nThus none could contend with them.\nTherefore, none in the world could contend with them.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nPlain and unadorned, none could contend with their beauty.\n\nWas the saying \"Bending preserves wholeness\" mere empty words?\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient rulers’ Dao was not for having,\nBut for *wuwei*.\nThe wise do not take possession as their affair,\nThe benevolent do not take position as favor—\nThis is called *wuwei* and One.\nTruly whole, returning to it.\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe ancients valued *wuwei*—\nAbove, *wuwei*; below, also *wuwei*.\n\n---\n**Silent Speech of Nature (Chapter 23)**\n\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks:\nIn the later ages, kings and feudal lords treat the world and their states as their own,\nThe myriad things as their livestock,\nHarboring the world’s vastness,\nPossessing the myriad’s abundance—\nTheir *qi* is full, their wills arrogant,\nLike sudden winds and torrential rains, unable to endure.\n\nThus, the ancient Sages embraced softness and weakness,\nDared not the sudden winds and violent rains,\nAnd so endured.\n\nModeling Heaven’s non-anger,\nFollowing the Dao as good—\nThe world endures.\n\nSilent speech of nature.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThose skilled in anger invite many grievances;\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course can one attain sage wisdom.\n\nSudden winds do not last a morning,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThough the seas overflow, they do not exceed three days.\nSudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day,\nNor even a moment in midday.\n\nWho says this?\nHeaven and Earth.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nSudden winds and torrential rains—\nThey unleash the force of tyranny.\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure them long,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nSudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day,\nYet cannot endure and vanish—\nHow much less so for humans?\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nDo not indulge in reckless joy or anger,\nNor favoritism in rewards and punishments.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe ancient Sages shed the burdens of virtue—\nWhen anger and joy do not disturb the heart, it stands upright.\nUpright, it is empty, tranquil, and *wuwei*—\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus, following the Dao,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nTherefore, the Sage models Heaven as good,\nDoes not act in wrathful anger to complete virtue,\nAnd so endures.\n\nThe Dao aligns with the Dao,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThus, above and below align in the Dao—\nAbove and below align in the Dao, and there is no lordship.\n\nVirtue aligns with virtue,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThus, below and above align in virtue—\nBelow and above align in virtue, and there is no servitude.\n\nLoss aligns with loss.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nWhen blaming others’ faults,\nExamine your own goodness first.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nAnger controlled, grievances do not arise;\nAnger from non-anger—\nAnger without color—\nThis is called calculated gain.\n\nThose who align with the Dao,\nThe Dao also gains them;\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Dao and virtue—\nLike leather and hide—\nFar apart, they draw near;\nNear, they grow distant.\nExamined, they cannot be grasped;\nScrutinized, they are not empty.\n\nThus, the Sage is like a mirror—\nNeither pushing nor welcoming,\nResponding to things without hoarding,\nOvercoming things without harming.\n\nThose who align with virtue, virtue also gains them.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nVirtue without accumulation yet without worry—\nThis is called *reaching its fullness*.\n\nThus, the good align weakness with strength,\nTurn misfortune into blessing,\nPile stones to form mountains,\nGather waters to shape rivers,\nAccumulate virtue to become kings.\nWithout accumulation, there is no such attainment.\n\nThose who align with loss, loss also gains them.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nHow could joy and anger be recklessly expressed?\nJoy returns, it must bring anger;\nAnger returns, it must bring joy—\nBoth are unbalanced.\nNow, my heart has neither resistance nor compliance.\n\nFaith is insufficient,\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nComplete faith brings peace to the world;\nLost faith brings peril to the world.\nThere is no faith at all.\n\n*The Dongling Jing* also says:\nFor people lack faith,\nBecause governance is unjust,\nAnd the ruler is not diligent and clear.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: \"The Lame Do Not Stand\"**\nThis chapter of *The Nanhua Jing* states:\nThe Great Dao perishes through excessive distinctions;\nScholars lose the Dao through excessive methods.\nThus, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Li Zhu,\nGong Tui, Zeng Shi, and those skilled in eloquence,\nsensual allure, and varied pursuits—\nthough their endeavors differ,\nthey all meet the same fate of losing the Dao.\n\nTo pluck the strings of the *liu* and disrupt the six pitches,\nTo melt and sever the *yu* and *se*—\nPlugging Shi Kuang’s ears,\nAnd the world begins to hold its breath in silence.\nTo extinguish patterns and disperse the five colors,\nTo glue Li Zhu’s eyes—\nAnd the world begins to hold its tongue in darkness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: \"The Lame Do Not Stand\" (continued)**\n\nDestroy the hook and line, abandon the compass and square,\nPluck Gong Tui’s fingers,\nAnd the world begins to possess its own cleverness.\n\nSever Zeng Shi’s conduct,\nSilence Yang Zhu and Mo Di’s mouths,\nReject virtue and righteousness,\nAnd the world’s virtue begins to merge in mysterious unity.\n\nThough one gathers virtue and righteousness—\nEven if as skilled as Zeng Shi—\nThough one gathers the five tones—\nEven if as skilled as Shi Kuang—\nThough one gathers the five colors—\nEven if as skilled as Li Zhu—\nThough one gathers the five flavors—\nEven if as skilled as Yu Er—\nThis is not what I call *plunging into the Dao* or *excellence in virtue*.\n\nWhat I call *excellence* is merely *mastery of the Dao through non-action*.\n\nNow, losing one’s true nature through the five tones, colors, and true flavors—\nThose who take or discard these five matters\nAre all great harms to the people’s lives and deaths.\nYet Yang Zhu and Mo Di began to abandon the six tones and colors,\nDeeming themselves enlightened—\nThis is not what I call *attaining the Dao*.\n\nThose like Zeng Shi, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Gong Tui, and Li Zhu—\nAll externally establish the illusions of cleverness, eloquence, allure, and skill,\nAnd thus disturb the world—\nThings the law has no use for.\n\n**The Lame Do Not Stand.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Fused toes and branch fingers on the hand—\nThese are useless fingers on a tree,\nEmerging from nature yet extravagant in virtue.\nThose who employ many methods in virtue and righteousness—\nAre they not like superfluous organs?\nYet they are not the true path of virtue and the Dao.\"*\n\n**The Crippled Do Not Walk.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Hanging warts and dangling excrescences—\nThese are clustered useless flesh on the feet,\nEmerging from form yet extravagant in nature.\nThose who cluster many methods in the emotions of the five viscera,\nIndulge in perverse and twisted conduct of virtue and righteousness,\nAnd multiply the uses of cleverness and insight—\nThis is not the straight path of virtue and the Dao.\"*\n\n**Those Who Self-See Are Blind.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Those fused in clarity—\nThey disrupt the five colors, indulge in patterns,\nIs not the dazzling of green, yellow, and variegated brocade?\nYet this is Li Zhu.\"*\n\n**Those Who Self-Right Are Not Illuminated.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Those excessive in hearing—\nThey disrupt the five tones, indulge in the six pitches,\nIs not the clamor of metal, stone, silk, bamboo, bells, and great *lu*?\nYet this is Shi Kuang.\"*\n\n**Those Who Self-Praise Achieve No Merit.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Those who branch from virtue—\nPlucking virtue to block nature and gain fame,\nForcing the world to play the *huang* and *gu* in service of unattainable laws—\nIs this not Zeng Shi?\"*\n\n**Those Who Self-Commend Do Not Endure.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Those fused in eloquence—\nStacking bricks, knotting ropes, weaving sentences,\nTrapped in debates over solid-white and difference—\nIs this not the empty praise of useless speech?\nYet this is Yang Zhu and Mo Di.\"*\n\n**Regarding the Dao, *The Nanhua Jing* says:**\n*\"Thus, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Zeng Shi, Shi Kuang, Li Zhu, and Gong Tui—\nAll amass minor achievements in cleverness, allure, skill, eloquence, and branch paths,\nYet they are not the utmost rectitude of the world.\nI consume *The Nanhua Jing*:\nThose ancient ones who rectified the Dao and nature,\nDid not lose their innate nature and spontaneous life,\nThus aligning with the Dao—\nThey did not multiply branches and diverge,\nIn virtue, they did not stray,\nThe long did not exceed,\nThe short did not fall short—\nThey followed the natural rectitude.\n\nNow, minor achievements in tones and colors—\nThese sever and extend human nature.\nThus, though the duck’s legs are short,\nExtending them brings sorrow,\nThough the crane’s legs are long,\nSevering them brings grief.\nThus, what is naturally long should not be severed,\nWhat is naturally short should not be extended—\nNo need to fear sorrow or grief from tones and colors.\"*\n\n**Superfluous Conduct.**\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"To take life as a hanging wart or excrescence,\nTo take death as a festering ulcer or abscess.\nIn ancient times, when people contained their clarity,\nThe world did not melt away;\nWhen people hid their hearing,\nThe world was not burdened;\nWhen people contained their wisdom,\nThe world was not confused;\nWhen people hid their virtue,\nThe world was not perverted.\n\nYet those like Zeng Shi, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Gong Tui, and Li Zhu—\nAll externally established minor virtues\nAnd thus disturbed the world—\nThings the law has no use for.\nThus, those of the Dao do not dwell among them.*\n\n*The Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:\n*\"I am ashamed that virtue and the Dao are not practiced,\nThus I do not accept the perverse doctrines of minor achievements from Yang Zhu and Mo Di.\nTherefore, Zhuangzi neither dared to uphold the petty virtues of righteousness,\nNor descend to the perverse conduct of Yang Zhu and Mo Di.\"*\n\n**End of *The Four Children’s Commentary on the Ancient Dao*, Volume Three, *Tongshen Department—Jade Precepts Category*.**\n\n**Volume Four, *The Four Children’s Commentary on the Ancient Dao*, *Ancient Sheng’s Collection of Talent and Quality***\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Primordial Mixture of Things***\nThis chapter of *The Chōngxū Jing* [□ *Heavenly Felicity Canon*] states:\nThe Dao/Way is formless and boundless, transforming into one *qi*.\nOne *qi* undergoes nine transformations and becomes the Primordial Chaos.\nThe Primordial Chaos is the origin of the forms of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, when things are in a state of primordial mixture,\nWhen yin and yang unfold and divide,\nBefore Heaven and Earth were born,\nThe light and clear ascended to form Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descended to form Earth—\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen things are in a state of primordial mixture,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* [□ *Passage of the Mysterious Origin*] says:\nThis refers to the state before Heaven and Earth came into being.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth came into being,\n*The Nanhua Jing* [□ *Southern Bloom Canon*] says:\nThe Dao/Way is formless,\nGiving birth to Heaven, giving birth to Earth,\nAnd existing before Heaven and Earth were born.\n\nSilent and vast,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nOnly the Dao/Way is formless,\nDark and unfathomable,\nSilent and boundless,\nIts sound unheard.\n\nStanding alone yet never changing,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe Dao of yin and yang\nExists independently, giving birth to all things,\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nNever ceasing to transform.\n\nCirculating endlessly without cessation,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nHeaven moves in cycles, Earth remains firm,\nThe four seasons as its eternal framework.\nHard and soft intermingle,\nAnd all things are born.\nThus it can be the mother of the world.\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nWhere the Dao/Way exists,\nThere is nothing it cannot permeate.\n\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nTaking Heaven as father,\nTaking Earth as mother,\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of all things.\n\nI do not know its name,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nI forcefully name it,\nAnd call it the Dao/Way.\n\nI forcefully name it the Dao/Way,\n*The Dònglíng Jing* [□ *Canon of the Cavern Spirit*] says:\nThe Dao/Way is the wondrous operation of the natural order.\nFilial piety is the supreme virtue of human Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nNurturing all things,\nShaping their forms and kinds,\nDistributing their nature and lifespan.\nIts function is supremely real yet never serves as a storehouse for things,\nNor as an official for affairs.\nIt is the embodiment of effortless action,\nSeeking through touch and perception,\nYet nothing can grasp its presence—\nI forcefully name it the Dao/Way.\n\nI name it forcefully as *Great*.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* [□ *Sutra of Sincere Essence*] says:\nThe Dao/Way originally has no sound,\nThe sages forcefully name it,\nAnd call it *Great*.\n\n*Great* is *Passing*,\n*Passing* is *Distant*,\n*Distant* is *Returning*.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way, before Heaven and Earth,\nHas existed since antiquity.\n\n*Passing* is *Distant*,\n*Distant* is *Returning*.\n*The Chōngxū Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way extends from the farthest antiquity,\nReturning to the present day.\nIts years are beyond measure,\nHeaven enduring, Earth lasting,\nTheir limits unfathomable.\n\nThus the Dao/Way is *Great*,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe Great Dao/Way of yin and yang\nIs the vastest *qi*.\nIt dwells beyond Heaven,\nSupremely high without equal,\nSupremely deep without bottom,\nEnveloping Heaven and Earth without surface or core,\nEmpty yet encompassing all,\nCirculating without hindrance.\n\nHeaven is *Great*,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe manifest forms of Heaven\nAre the greatest of forms.\n\nEarth is *Great*,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe manifest forms of Earth\nAre the greatest of forms.\n\nThe King is also *Great*.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nNone is greater than the Emperor-King,\nWhose virtue matches that of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWithin the realm there are four *Great* ones,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd how can one know\nThat Heaven and Earth suffice to exhaust the domain of the four *Great* ones?\nYet the King occupies one of them.\n\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nWhen the King is bright, the ministers are bright,\nAnd the realm is at peace.\n\nThe King’s law follows Earth,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nNone is richer than Earth—\nSpring *qi* arises, and all grasses grow,\nAutumn’s harvest is right, and all treasures mature.\n\nEarth’s law follows Heaven,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nNone is more divine than Heaven.\n\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nEarth receives from Heaven,\nAnd all things take form.\n\nHeaven’s law follows the Dao/Way,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way is supremely divine,\nGuiding the revolutions of Heaven’s course.\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way is formless,\nCovering Heaven and Earth yet never contrived.\n\nThe Dao/Way follows Nature.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: *The Heavy as the Root of the Light***\nThis chapter of *The Tōngxuān Jing* states:\nIn the later ages, the kings and feudal lords,\nThough possessing the power of ten thousand chariots,\nWere not content with their wealth and authority—\nHeaven’s riches and the world’s prosperity\nCould not satisfy their desires.\nThey grew frivolous and covetous,\nLight and restless, losing their foundation,\nAnd thus lost the world.\n\nThe heavy as the root of the light,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of antiquity acted without doing,\nAnd their transformation was rooted in weightiness, not lightness.\nMaintaining weightiness to govern the light,\nThe world was at ease.\n\nThe still as the ruler of the restless,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of antiquity possessed the virtue of quietude—\nThey were tranquil and not restless.\nDwelling in stillness to restrain the restless,\nThe world was at peace.\n\nThe ruler is the root.\nThus the *junzi* [noble/princely person] walks all day,\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nWith propriety as their conduct,\nWith music as their harmony,\nTheir benevolence and compassion naturally perfumed—\nThis is called the *junzi*.\nThe *junzi* thus govern the state,\nAnd the worthy never fail to inquire\nInto their labor and ease.\n\nThey do not abandon their baggage and supplies.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says:\nHow dare the *junzi* govern lightly?\nThough there are palaces and grand displays,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way of the *junzi*\nIs to cultivate oneself through stillness.\n\nDwell in serene detachment.\n\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe *junzi*’s Dao/Way—\nWhen still, the lower ranks are undisturbed;\nThe lower ranks undisturbed, the people remain orderly.\nHow could the sovereign of a realm of ten thousand chariots—\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe power of ten thousand chariots relies on all things for merit and fame,\nWith authority so grave, one cannot govern lightly—\nYet govern with levity toward the world?\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nIf the power of ten thousand chariots acts lightly, merit and fame will not be fulfilled.\nLightness leads to losing one’s ministers.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing*—Wénzǐ asked of the foundation of governing the state,\nLǎozǐ replied: *\"The foundation lies in cultivating oneself.\nNever have I heard of a state in chaos while the self is governed,\nOr a state governed while the self is in disarray.*\nIf one governs lightly, one loses the foundation of sovereignty.\nAgitation leads to losing sovereignty.\"\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nEven the power of ten thousand chariots is insufficient for gratification,\nThe wealth of the world insufficient for joy—\nYet agitated, with boundless desires,\nIndulging desire loses the foundation.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Benevolent Action**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks:\nThe virtue of the sovereign and emperor harmonizes with the effortless Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is to ride the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nTo let all things govern themselves while employing the effortless Dao/Way of humanity.\nThe foundation of virtue and Dao/Way lies in establishing the essential,\nIn the sovereign’s effortless action, the world is governed.\nTo always uphold the five virtues of effortless action,\nTo rescue humanity—when all are virtuous, this is called the essential mystery.\nThe five virtues: saving the people.\nBenevolent action leaves no trace.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of antiquity acted without doing,\nTheir teachings spread without descending from the hall,\nAnd yet transformation reached the four seas—\nThey acted without leaving a trace.\nBenevolent speech leaves no flaws.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nLater ages awaited commands through words,\nAnd governing became difficult.\nThe sages of antiquity issued commands without speech—\nThe sages of old were thus teachers,\nMoving the world with a single word, yet without uttering it,\nTheir hearts and actions were effortless—\nThey acted without transmission.\nBenevolent planning requires no calculations.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sage unifies all things in one,\nAnd all affairs are complete—\nThe sage acts without contrivance, without scheming,\nWithout deliberation, yet all is appropriate.\nBenevolent closure requires no locks or keys, yet cannot be opened.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings ruled above,\nMaking their preferences clear to the people,\nYet punishments were discarded and unused—\nOrders were given, yet the people restrained themselves.\nBenevolent binding requires no ropes or knots, yet cannot be undone.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of old did not impose laws or decrees,\nYet customs shifted naturally—\nThis was through their hearts and actions in the Dao/Way,\nWithout action, yet self-regulated.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, restraint was not by ropes or cords.\nLater ages relied on ropes and knots for firmness,\nThus their virtue declined.\nTherefore, the sages—\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of antiquity acted without doing,\nIlluminating the world,\nHolding the essential of the Dao/Way,\nGrasping the essential to rescue the multitude.\nAlways rescuing people, thus no one is abandoned;\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe world’s affairs cannot be forced—\nFollow their natural course, and thus no one is abandoned.\nThe *Dònglíng Jing* says:\nRescuing flaws is precious in reducing affairs.\nAlways rescuing things, thus nothing is abandoned.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe transformations of all things cannot be rescued—\nHold their essential and return them, thus nothing is abandoned.\nThe *Dònglíng Jing* says:\nRescuing flaws is precious in a single decree.\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe Dao/Way can be hidden, can be manifest,\nCan be obscure, can be clear—\nAccumulating subtlety forms clarity.\nThus the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous;\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sovereign is the people’s teacher.\nThe unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe sages of old skillfully employed the Dao/Way,\nUsing what people relied upon to establish merit,\nTrusting their weaknesses to their strengths,\nGoverning many, occupying the essential—\nSeeing virtue as if unable to catch up,\nSeeing vice as if it were an omen.\nNot honoring their teachers,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nTeaching without weariness—this is how one governs the people.\nDiscarding worthy teachers and good friends,\nFew would abandon virtue to become corrupt.\nNot cherishing their resources.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIs it not that the teacher is correct and without error,\nThe teacher governs and there is no chaos?\nThis clarifies the principles of Heaven and Earth,\nThe nature of all things.\nThough one may know the great confusion,\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe ancients did not indulge in trivialities,\nNor fall into great confusion;\nDid not practice minor kindnesses,\nNor become greatly foolish.\nIn the later ages, though one knows trivialities,\nOne is greatly confused by the Dao/Way.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:\nThe foundation of governing the multitude lies in one essential—\nWhen the world is at peace, it depends on one person.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks:\nIn ancient times, how did the Dao/Way hide, yet true and false emerged?\nIt was because the Five Emperors of later ages hid the Dao/Way in petty achievements,\nThus falsifying the Dao/Way and making it untrue.\nIn the age of the Great Dao/Way and supreme virtue,\nThey dwelled with beasts and birds,\nTheir clans united with all things—\nHow could they know of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music,\nOr *junzi* and the petty?\nIn harmony with ignorance, their virtue did not depart;\nIn harmony with desirelessness, the people remained simple and unadorned.\nSimple and unadorned, their nature was pure and genuine, and they governed themselves.\nWhen the Five Emperors of later ages\nClimbed and hung with ornaments, calling it benevolence,\nDragged their feet and bound their thumbs, calling it righteousness—\nThen the world began to doubt the falsehoods of petty scholarly achievements.\nThe muddled and licentious became music,\nThe bizarre and perverse became ritual—\nThen the world began to divide into laws, calendars, sounds, and colors.\nThus, the Great Dao/Way of the later Five Emperors scattered,\nAnd they crafted books and tools for governing.\nKnowing the heroic,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Five Emperors knew the heroic,\nAnd thus created the five tones.\n\n---\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□下德篇] says:\nThe thunderous roar can be likened to bells and drums,\nThe changes of wind and rain can be understood through music and rhythm.\nSounds that can be heard can be regulated,\nAnd thus the five tones are attuned.\nBy preserving its **yin** (feminine, receptive),\nOne becomes the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the five tones were not disordered—\nWho then created the six *lü* (pitch pipes)?\nBy preserving its **yin** (feminine, receptive),\nOne becomes the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven.\nAs the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven,\nOne’s enduring virtue/power does not depart,\nAnd returns to the state of the infant.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient rulers who excelled in governance\nModeled themselves on the **non-action** of the rivers and seas,\nBecoming the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven,\nAnd their virtue/power did not depart.\nThus, the **Perfect Ones** (*zhìrén*) did not perceive what was desirable,\nTheir minds and spirits dwelled in harmony,\nAt rest they embodied virtue/power,\nIn motion they aligned with the Dao/Way.\n\nBy knowing its **white** (bright, manifest),\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Five Emperors knew its **white** (bright, manifest),\nAnd thus created the five colors.\nWhat can be seen with clarity can be obscured,\nWhat can be discerned in color can be distinguished,\nAnd thus the five colors were differentiated.\nBy preserving its **black** (dark, hidden),\nOne becomes the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the five colors were not disordered—\nWho then created patterns and hues?\nBy preserving its **black** (dark, hidden),\nOne becomes the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven.\nAs the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven,\nOne’s enduring virtue/power remains unerring,\nAnd returns to the **Non-Extreme** (*wújí*).\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe governance of the ancient Perfect Ones\nWas void, tranquil, and still—\nThey cultivated the Dao/Way of Nature,\nAnd with indifference and non-action,\nAll under Heaven found harmony.\n\nBy knowing its **honor** (flourishing, prominence),\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Five Emperors knew its **honor** (flourishing, prominence),\nAnd thus established laws and calendars.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe greatest of all, Heaven and Earth cannot contain it,\nThe subtlest of all, divine brilliance cannot perceive it.\nWhat can be observed in vastness can be measured,\nAnd thus calendars and numbers were set.\nBy preserving its **humiliation** (abased, lowly),\nOne becomes the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, white jade was not shattered—\nWho then created the *guī-zhuāng* (jade tablets)?\nBy preserving its **humiliation** (abased, lowly),\nOne becomes the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven.\nAs the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven,\nOne’s enduring virtue/power is complete,\nAnd returns to the **Uncarved** (*pǔ*).\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient rulers who excelled in governance\nModeled themselves on the rivers and seas.\nThe rivers and seas act without striving,\nBecoming the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven,\nAnd their virtue/power is complete.\nThey did not divide and contend for wealth,\nYet wealth was abundant.\nThe Sage was pure and unadorned yet did not scatter,\nIndifferent and desireless yet the people remained simple.\nThe **Uncarved** (*pǔ*) scatters, becoming tools—\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWhen the Five Emperors established laws and calendars,\nDifferentiated the five colors,\nDistinguished pure and impure,\nAnd tasted sweet and bitter,\nThen the **Uncarved** (*pǔ*) scattered into tools.\nThey set forth **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness),\nAnd refined **ritual** and **music**—\nThen virtue/power shifted into falsehoods.\nThe people adorned cleverness to dazzle the simple,\nEmployed deceit to attack their superiors,\nAnd though some could uphold it,\nNone could govern well—\nFor cleverness multiplied while virtue/power waned.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, purity and simplicity were unbroken—\nWho then created the sacrificial ox and wine?\nVirtue/power and the Dao/Way were not abandoned—\nWhy seek **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness)?\nHuman nature and disposition were not straying—\nWhy use **ritual** and **music**?\nLater ages shattered simplicity to make tools—\nThe fault of artisans.\nThey destroyed virtue/power to create **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness)—\nThe error of the Five Emperors.\nThe Sage used them as **officials and leaders** (*guānzhǎng*).\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe **Shu-Wei** (狶韦氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,\nTo grasp the **non-action** of Heaven and Earth;\nThe **Fuxi** (伏牺氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,\nTo follow the **Qi-Mother** (气母) of the Dao/Way;\nThe **Shennong** (神农氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,\nTo rule through the **virtue/power of Fire** (火德);\nThe **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) obtained it from the Dao/Way,\nTo ascend the realm of **Jingyun** (景云, \"illuminated clouds\").\nThus, the **Great Measures** (*dàzhì*) were not severed.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nHence, one ruler’s decree could govern all under Heaven—\nIt was like the **one breath** (*yīxī*) of the **Tang and Yu** (唐虞).\nThey knew the use of **accomplished persons** (*xiánrén*) for the benefit of all under Heaven,\nYet did not know their harm to all under Heaven.\nOnly through severance—\nThe outsiders knew this.\n\n**Chapter 29: \"The Manifest\" (章第二十九)**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:\nIn the **end times** (*mòshì*), kings and feudal lords\nTreated all under Heaven as their own family,\nAnd all things as their livestock.\nThey harbored the ambition of all under Heaven,\nAnd sought the abundance of all things—\nThus, their **qi** was full yet their wills were arrogant.\nThe great contended with the small through warfare,\nThe small defied and oppressed the lowly,\nAnd none could endure long—\nNot in contention, not in the Dao/Way,\nNot in the Sage, not in the Perfect Ones.\n\nEarth clings to the low yet does not contend for height—\nThus it is stable and not in peril.\nWater flows to the low yet does not contend for swiftness—\nThus it departs and is not delayed.\n\nThus the Sage acts without action and thus meets no defeat,\nActs without grasping and thus meets no loss.\n\nThose skilled in military formations\nDo not know the divine transformations of temple battles and strategic shifts.\n\nThose who love war have never failed to suffer defeat,\nThose who contend in battle have never failed to lose.\nThe skilled swimmer drowns,\nThe skilled rider falls—\nEach perishes by their own fondness,\nThus, those who act meet defeat,\nThose who grasp meet loss.\nThe Seven Kingdoms perished through warring for Heaven under Heaven.\n\nTo take Heaven under Heaven,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nA kingdom should not greedily seek what it seeks,\nBut receive it from Heaven under Heaven.\nNot through self-taken virtue and righteousness does one obtain it,\nBut through giving it.\n\nTo contend for fame is to seek what is already possessed—\nI see this as unavoidable.\nI see this as unavoidable.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThough one grasps it, it will not remain.\nFame cannot be sought and obtained—\nIt is given by Heaven under Heaven.\nWhat is given returns to Heaven under Heaven,\nAnd what returns is **virtue/power**.\nIf one lacks **virtue/power**, the people will not return.\nWithout their return, the use of arms is perilous to the Dao/Way—\nI see this as unavoidable.\n\nHeaven under Heaven is a divine instrument.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nHeaven under Heaven’s divine instrument,\nThe emperor’s weighty station—\nIt cannot be seized.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nHeaven under Heaven is a great instrument,\nIt cannot be grasped, cannot be seized.\nThose who seize meet defeat.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThose who love fame have never failed to be struck down,\nThe skilled swimmer drowns—\nEach perishes by their own fondness,\nThus it is said: those who act meet defeat.\nThose who grasp meet loss.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThose who contend for gain have never failed to be exhausted,\nThe skilled rider falls—\nEach perishes by their own fondness,\nThus those who grasp meet loss.\n\nTherefore, things—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nCalamity and fortune share the same gate,\nGain and harm reverse each other—\nOne must not fail to discern them.\nSome advance, some follow,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nSome are long, some are short.\nSome warm, some chill,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nSome are fair, some are foul.\nSome are strong, some are weak,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nSome are joyous, some are stern.\nSome are raised, some are ruined.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nSome are right, some are wrong.\n\nThus the Sage—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nTo endure is not in contention,\nTo govern is not in sainthood.\nEarth clings to the low yet does not contend for height—\nThus it is stable and not in peril.\nWater flows to the low yet does not contend for swiftness—\nThus it departs and is not delayed.\n\nThus the Sage acts without action and thus meets no defeat,\nActs without grasping and thus meets no loss.\n\nAvoiding excess,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of strength lies in guarding weakness,\nThus the Sage guards gentleness and does not grow strong,\nAnd so can complete his kingship,\nAnd Heaven under Heaven endures long.\n\nAvoiding extravagance,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of moderation lies in rejecting excess,\nThus the Sage rejects extravagance and luxury,\nDares not be proud or wasteful,\nAnd so can endure long.\n\nAvoiding arrogance.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of avoiding arrogance lies in emptiness and nothingness,\nThus the Sage rejects arrogance and excess,\nDares not be proud or overflowing,\nAnd so can endure long.\n\n---\n**Chapter 30: \"Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way\"**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:\nThe ministers of the Seven Kingdoms raised unrighteous arms,\nUntil corpses lay piled and blood flowed,\nClashing before one another.\nWhere wars arise, Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder—\nThe path of loving valor leads to peril and ruin.\n\nArms are cruel instruments.\nWarfare is a perilous affair.\nRinging bells to destroy oneself,\nBurning candles to scorch oneself—\nThe brave perish by their strength,\nThe eloquent perish by their cleverness.\nMen die violently, not by fate,\nCrushing few against many,\nWeak against strong—\nArms kill them together.\nThe path of loving war leads to peril and ruin.\n\nNow the Seven Kingdoms’ rebellious ministers love war and battle,\nAnd Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder.\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, ministers governed the state,\nRuled within their borders,\nPracticed **virtue/power** and morality,\nSpread benevolence and bestow favors—\nThis was the highest path.\nThey did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, deceit did not arise,\nPeace and ease knew no strife,\nHeaven under Heaven was at peace,\nThe wise had no place to display their cleverness,\nThe brave had no place to wield their might—\nThey did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven.\nTheir affairs returned to goodness.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Warring States resorted to arms for self-preservation,\nDeceitful men flattered and schemed in secret,\nHastily provoking the ruler to use their #1,\nAnd the chaotic aided their schemes.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Seven Kingdoms raised arms in difficulty,\nNo leisurely steps on the road,\nNo standing crops in the fields,\nThorns and brambles grow.\nAfter a great army passes, there will surely be years of famine.\n*The Tongxuan Jing [Weiming Section]* says:\nRaising ten thousand soldiers costs a thousand gold daily,\nAfter the army’s departure, there will surely be years of famine.\n\nThus the virtuous are resolute yet yield,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe advantage of arms is not sufficient to rely upon for strength.\nThey dare not take strength from it.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the brave dared not act recklessly and thus lived.\nResolute yet not boastful,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness\nDared not rely on strength,\nThus they could boast.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient brave did not use force violently,\nThis may be called being one with the Dao/Way.\nResolute yet unavoidable,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWhen the enemy attacks and one is forced to act.\nThis is resolute yet not strong.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness\nWere the living—\nHeaven under Heaven thrived.\n\n「Things grow strong, then grow old. The *Chōngxū Jīng* recounts how Confucius spoke to Zǐlù, saying: *\"Yóu, you can be brave but cannot be cowardly.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states:\n*\"Martial valor dies by reckless strength,\nWits perish by clever scheming.\nThis is called not abiding by the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states:\n*\"There are those who die by violence, not by fate.\nThey provoke the multitude with their few,\nThey defy the strong with their weak—\nAll soldiers slay them,\nFor their arms are not in accord with the Dao/Way.\nNot in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early.\nNot in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Not serene, not content—this is not the Dao/Way,\nNot virtue/power.\nNot in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Virtue of Fine Arms**\nThis chapter in the *Nanhua Jing* recounts:\nIn ancient times, King Zhao of the Wén dynasty delighted in swords. Three thousand sword-wielders stood at his gates, clashing day and night before him, with a hundred or more dying or wounded each year. Yet he never tired of it. The heir apparent, Prince Dàn, was troubled by this and asked Zhuangzi to counsel the king to cease his fondness for swords.\n\nZhuangzi saw the king and said:\n*\"I have three swords—let Your Majesty choose which to use.\"*\n\nThe king replied:\n*\"I wish to hear of these three swords.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"There is the Sovereign’s Sword, the Noble’s Sword, and the Commoner’s Sword.\nThe Sovereign’s Sword rectifies the Nobles—then all under Heaven submit.\nThe Noble’s Sword within the Four Seals* has none who do not yield.\nThe Commoner’s Sword, once drawn, severs life—useless for state affairs.\n\nNow, Your Majesty holds the Sovereign’s rank yet favors the Commoner’s Sword. I humbly think Your Majesty underestimates its weight.\"*\n\n*The Four Seals (四封) refers to the boundaries of a feudal lord’s domain.*\n\nThe king was suddenly lost in thought, ascended the hall in silence, and the attendants served him food. He took three mouthfuls before Zhuangzi spoke again:\n*\"Your Majesty, now seated and composed, the matter of swords is already settled.\"*\n\nThus, King Zhao did not leave the palace for three months, and all the sword-wielders perished in their dwellings.\n\nDiscussing arms, there are six ill omens—never a good omen, never to be used lightly.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states:\n*\"Arms are instruments of ill omen,\nWar is a perilous affair.\nThe most unauspicious of tools.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states:\n*\"Those who delight in arms provoke the utmost calamity.\nThings may even come to hate them,\nFor arms ravage the land, causing unrest among the ten thousand households.\nThey slaughter without cause—\nThe people’s resentment rises,\nAnd things come to hate them.\nThus, those who abide by the Dao/Way do not dwell upon them.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states:\n*\"The virtuous/powerful* seek the Dao/Way and virtue/power,\nNot the frequent use of arms.\nThe virtuous/powerful* at rest honor the left—\nThe *Dònglíng Jīng* says: *‘Yang virtue/power abides on the left.’*\nIn war, they honor the right—\nThe *Dònglíng Jīng* says: *‘Yin punishment abides on the right.’*\nArms are instruments of ill omen—\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘Thus, arms are not the tools of the virtuous/powerful.*’\nNot the treasure of the virtuous/powerful.\nWhen used unavoidably, the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘There are five uses of arms;

six things inflame ambition.\nIf the heart remains undisturbed, it is upright.\nUprightness brings emptiness, tranquility, and non-action—yet nothing remains undone.\nThus, the ancient sages possessed wisdom in knowing others and clarity in self-awareness,\nstrength to excel over others and resolve to overcome oneself,\nwealth in contentment and resolve in steadfast action.\nWith these six virtues,\nin life, their deeds were enduring and their path unerring;\nin death, their names were immortal and their legacy eternal.\nHence, these are called the *Six Virtues of Longevity*—\nwisdom in knowing others is called wisdom.\n\nKnowing others is wisdom.\nAs the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nTo recognize the worthy is wisdom,\nand no wisdom surpasses knowing others.\nKnowing others prevents chaotic governance.\n\nSelf-awareness is clarity.\nAs the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nTo cherish the worthy is benevolence,\nto revere the worthy is propriety.\n\nTo excel over others is to have strength,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* [missing text] *De* Chapter says:\nThose who excel over others possess strength,\nand those who can wield others’ strength must first win their hearts.\nThose who win hearts also secure themselves.\n\nTo overcome oneself is to be strong,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nSelf-mastery is strength,\nand those who are strong must wield others’ strength.\nThere has never been one who gained themselves while losing others,\nnor one who lost themselves while gaining others.\n\nContentment is wealth,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe root of sufficiency lies in frugality—\nwithout hoarding wealth, one is rich.\n\nSteadfast action is resolve,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nIn ancient times, they did not deem lowliness perilous,\nnor poverty shameful,\nnor criticism unjust.\nThose who never stray from their path endure long.\n\nTo die without fading is longevity,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThough the noble perish, their names do not vanish.\nTheir fame transmitted to posterity—\nwhere could such be called not long-lived?\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\nThis chapter from the *Nánhuá Jīng* states:\nNothing is more divine than Heaven,\nnothing richer than Earth,\nnothing greater than the sovereign.\nThus, the sovereign’s virtue aligns with Heaven’s grandeur and Earth’s abundance—\nthis is how the ancient sages rode upon Heaven and Earth’s riches,\nnurturing all things and guiding humanity with the Dao of love and care.\nThe *Classic* does not claim greatness itself,\nyet all things return to it,\nand thus it accomplishes the greatness of the world—\nfollowing the Dao to nourish the people.\n\nThe Great Dao flows,\nas the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nObserving the Dao broadly, all things respond in fullness.\nTo love all things universally is to recognize Heaven and Earth as one.\nIt can be wielded at will,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe Great Dao knows no impossibility.\nIt abides in principle—\nwhen seen as possible, do not rush;\nwhen seen as impossible, do not abandon.\nPossible and impossible are like left and right,\nlike exterior and interior.\nAll things depend upon it,\nas the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe Dao nourishes all things without transgression,\nits blessings extend to ten thousand generations without being called benevolent.\nIt gives life without complaint,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe Dao—all things rely upon it for life,\nyet none know its virtue.\nIts deeds accomplished, it claims no ownership,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe Great Constant Dao gives life without possession,\nits virtue unknown.\nIt nurtures all things without lordship,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe Great Constant Dao stores and accumulates without growing rich,\ngives and receives without impoverishing others,\nnurtures all things without claiming mastery.\nEver without desire, it may be called small;\nto have all things return without lordship is great,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThe Great Constant Dao transforms without domination.\nThe *Dònglíng Jīng* says:\nThe Dao is neither a treasury of schemes nor an office of affairs;\nits work is most subtle, yet it claims no achievement.\nThus, the sage\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThus, the sage broadly loves through the Dao,\nloving below and thereby accomplishing the great.\nYet it never claims greatness,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nAncient wise rulers modeled themselves after rivers and seas.\nRivers and seas love what is below,\nyet never claim greatness—\nall streams return to them, and thus they accomplish greatness.\nThus, they accomplish greatness.\nAs the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThrough this, the Dao bestows a grand vision upon the world.\n\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nThis chapter from the *Nánhuá Jīng* states:\nIn the age of Shénnóng of old,\nresting, they lay in ease;\narising, they moved with grace.\nThe people knew their mothers but not their fathers,\nliving alongside deer and elk,\nplowing for food and weaving for clothing,\nwithout hearts of harm or contention—\nthis was the age of the Great Dao,\nthe peak of virtue.\nTo grasp the Dao is to attain tranquility,\nand thus the world is at perfect peace.\n\nTo grasp the Great Symbol,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nThose who grasp the Dao are complete in virtue.\nVirtue complete is the sage’s Dao.\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns established the Dao’s succession at the center,\nacting without action yet in harmony with the Dao,\nspeaking without words yet in accord with virtue.\nAll under Heaven turned toward them.\nTurning without harm,\nas the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:\nIn ancient times, calamities did not arise,\ndisasters did not occur,\nand the world was in peace—\nthis was the foundation of governance.\nPeace, stability, and harmony,\nas the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nIn ancient times, clever schemes were unused,\nall returned to Heaven—\nthis is called perfect peace, the foundation of governance.\nDelight and bait,\nas the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThey found their food sweet,\ntheir customs joyful.\n\n「过客止。 [*Nánhuá Jīng*] says: Let them dwell in peace.\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: In ancient times, the sage’s governance of the people was such—\nthey allowed each to follow their nature,\nto dwell in their homes without interference.\nThe Dao’s expression in words,\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be articulated in speech,\nfor speech that is not the Dao is false.\nIn ancient times, the Dao was practiced without words.\nIt was subtle, without savor.\n\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao is subtle, without desire,\nindifferent, without action.\nSubtle, it lacks savor;\nwithout contemplation, yet attained.\n\nIt cannot be seen by mere sight,\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be clearly perceived,\nfor perception that is not true is false.\nThose who strain their eyes to see clearly\nweary their minds yet fail to grasp it.\nIf one waits for the eyes to discern,\nthen governance becomes arduous.\nKnowing through sight is called losing the Dao;\nin ancient times, one saw without straining.\n\nIt cannot be heard by mere listening,\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be fleetly heard,\nfor hearing that is not true is false.\nIf one uses their ears to govern,\ntheir minds labor in vain.\nIf one waits for the ears to hear clearly,\nthen governance becomes arduous.\nKnowing through hearing is called losing the Dao;\nin ancient times, one heard without straining.\n\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* records: Wénzǐ asked: How does the sovereign gain the people’s joy?\nLǎozǐ replied: Like the rivers and seas.\nSubtle, without savor,\nits use cannot be exhausted,\nfirst small, then great.\n\nIn the chapter *Jiāngyù Qìzhī* (第三十六), this passage from *Nánhuá Zhēnjīng* (《南华真经□胠筐篇》) states:\nThe virtuous cannot stand without the sage’s Dao;\nthieves cannot act without the sage’s wisdom.\nWhen virtuous people are few and the unvirtuous many,\nthen the sage’s wisdom benefits the world little\nwhile harming it greatly.\nRú’s wine was thin yet Hán Dān was besieged;\nthe sage arises yet great thieves multiply.\nThus, the sage’s wisdom—\nthough it restrains violence with laws and seals,\nand though thieves may be granted their measures and weights,\ntheir jewels and pearls—\nthe world will not be governed.\nHence it is said:\nFish cannot be removed from the deep;\nthe world’s useful tools,\nshould not be displayed to the people.\nTools for measure and weight\nproduce theft and deceit.\n\nIf one would weaken them,\none must first strengthen them;\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, though sages valued wisdom to govern the world,\nthey were in fact valuing tools for theft and deceit.\nIf one makes measures and weights to weigh with,\nthen both the people and the weights will be stolen.\nIf one would weaken them,\none must first strengthen them;\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, when sages arose and great thieves multiplied,\nif one makes scales and balances to measure with,\nthen both the people and the scales will be stolen.\nIf one would abolish them,\none must first establish them;\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In ancient times, when sages died and their wisdom perished,\ngreat thieves did not arise,\nand the world was peaceful without strife.\nIn later ages, if one makes seals and tokens to trust in,\nthen both the people and the seals will be stolen.\nIf one would take them away,\none must first give them.\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, if sages’ wisdom did not perish,\ngreat thieves would not cease;\nif one uses virtue and righteousness to correct it,\nthen both the people and virtue will be stolen.\nThis is called subtle clarity.\n\n*Nánhuá Jīng* (《南华真经□微明篇》) says: The Dao can be yin, can be yang,\ncan be hidden, can be manifest.\nBound yet expansive, hidden yet clear—\nit contains yin and releases yang,\nilluminating the three luminaries.\nFirst revering the subtle and minute,\nthen attaining great clarity.\nSoftness overcomes strength.\n\n*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao can be weak, can be strong,\ncan be yielding, can be firm.\nYielding yet firm, weak yet strong—\nit begins in yielding and weakness,\nachieves in strength and firmness,\naccumulating yielding to become firm,\naccumulating weakness to become strong.\n\nFish cannot be removed from the deep,\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: The beasts of a cage carapace,\nif they leave the mountains, will not escape the nets;\nthe fish that can swallow boats, if they lose their water,\nwill be tormented by ants.\nThus, birds and beasts do not tire of heights,\nfish and turtles do not tire of depths.\nIf the spring dries up,\nfish will gather on land,\nmoistening each other with breath,\nnourishing each other with spittle,\nyet unable to save the drought—\nit is better to forget each other in rivers and lakes.\n\nFish create their own conditions in water;\nthose who create their own conditions in water\ndig ponds to raise and provide for them,\nthus it is said: Fish cannot be removed from the deep.\n\nThe world’s useful tools,\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: Sages of later ages are the world’s useful tools,\nnot meant to reveal the world’s wisdom—\nfor wisdom itself generates theft and deceit.\nIf thieves steal virtue and righteousness,\nalong with measures, weights, seals, and tokens,\neven with the rewards of carriages and fine robes they cannot be persuaded,\nnor with the threats of axes and halberds be deterred.\nThis is valuing tools for theft\nand making them ungovernable—\nthe fault of later sages’ teachings to the people.\nThe sage does not weary of simplicity;\nit is better to forget each other in Dao and skill.\n\nPeople create their own conditions in the Dao;\nthose who create their own conditions in the Dao\nlive without strife, attaining steadfastness,\nthus it is said: The world’s useful tools,\nshould not be displayed to the people.\nShould not be displayed to the people.\n*Nánhuá Jīng* says: Abolish the sage, discard wisdom,\nand great thieves will cease;\ndiscard jade, shatter pearls,\nand petty thieves will not rise;\nburn the seals, break the tokens,\nand the people will be simple and unrefined;\nabolish the measures, discard the weights,\nand the people will not contend.\nShould not be displayed to the people.»\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seventh: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**\n\nThis chapter of the *Nánhuá Jīng* speaks:\nThe One Dao does nothing—\nit covers and nourishes all things,\nvast and boundless, so great!\nThus, the virtuous person cannot but carve the heart to do nothing in the Dao.\n\nTo do nothing while doing is called great;\nto do nothing while speaking is called virtue.\nGreat virtue—this is all.\n\nIn ancient times, through doing nothing, transformation occurred naturally,\nand the world was in great harmony.\n\nThe Dao ever does nothing.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nDoing nothing is the constant of the Dao,\nyet nothing is left undone.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Great Dao does nothing,\nyet all things arise naturally and nothing is left undone.\n\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nthe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe virtuous person, governing the world,\ndoes nothing—this is best.\nDo nothing,\nand thus the nature of life and destiny finds peace.\nAll things will transform naturally.\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* recounts: Hongmeng said to Yunshang:\n\"You dwell in doing nothing,\nand all things transform of themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs to action,\nthe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen the people desire to act and move,\nit is because the orders are inconsistent.\nThe heart is not sincere in the Dao,\norders are labored upon by those above,\nyet do not respond from below.\nI shall govern them with the nameless simplicity.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAncient sages governed with the Dao,\ndoing nothing above,\nand the people transformed as if by divine will.\nThe nameless simplicity—\nit too shall not desire.\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nAll things have distinct principles,\nthe Dao does not favor any;\nthus it is nameless.\nNameless, hence it does nothing.\n\nAbove does nothing,\nbelow also does nothing.\nTo not desire is to be still.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAncient wise rulers did nothing—\ndoing nothing is guarding stillness,\nguarding stillness can make one sovereign over the world.\nThe world will naturally align itself.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen the ruler returns to purity and stillness,\nall things will naturally align.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**\n\nThis chapter of the *Nánhuá Jīng* [□ *Zhìběi Yóu* Section] speaks:\nIn the highest antiquity, the sages practiced the teaching of no-speech,\nand through doing nothing, the world was governed.\nThus, the Way of the Three Sovereigns cannot be attained,\nthe virtue of the Five Emperors cannot be reached,\nthe benevolence of the Three Kings can be emulated,\nthe righteousness of Shang and Zhou can be diminished,\nthe rituals of the Five Hegemons were mere pretense,\nand the wars of the Seven States brought only chaos.\n\nThus it is said:\nLose the Dao, then virtue arises;\nlose virtue, then benevolence arises;\nlose benevolence, then righteousness arises;\nlose righteousness, then ritual arises;\nlose ritual, then war arises.\n\nRitual is the superficial aspect of the Five Constants,\nthe ornament of the Dao,\nthe thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—\nand the beginning of chaos.\n\nThe supreme virtue does not virtue,\nand thus virtue exists.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Upper Virtue* Section] says:\nNothing is higher than Heaven,\nthe Dao of Heaven is supreme and does nothing—\nthe sage follows it,\nand the world is settled.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is supreme virtue.\nSupreme virtue does not virtue,\nand thus virtue exists.\n\nInferior virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus virtue does not exist.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nNothing is lower than Earth,\nhuman affairs are active and lowly—\nthe virtuous person embodies this,\nand the world falls into disorder.\n\nHuman affairs are inferior virtue.\nInferior virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus virtue does not exist.\n\nSupreme virtue does nothing yet does nothing,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Upper Benevolence* Section] says:\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns of supreme virtue did nothing,\nand the world turned to them.\n\nInferior virtue acts yet does nothing,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn later times, the Five Emperors of inferior virtue acted,\nand the Four Seas turned to them.\n\nSupreme benevolence acts yet does nothing,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Three Sovereigns of supreme benevolence,\nand the world within the seas turned to them.\n\nSupreme righteousness acts and does nothing,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Shang and Zhou of supreme righteousness,\nand one kingdom turned to them.\n\nSupreme ritual acts, yet none respond,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Five Hegemons of supreme ritual,\nand one village turned to them.\nThen they rolled up their sleeves and forced compliance,\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Seven States, lacking these five virtues—morality, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, ritual—\nthe people did not turn to them.\nWhen they were not turned to, they used force,\nand the world fell into great chaos.\n\nThus, lose the Dao, then virtue arises,\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe Five Emperors lost the Dao and then used virtue,\nbut virtue could not be reached.\n\nLose virtue, then benevolence arises,\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe Three Kings lost virtue and then used benevolence,\nbut benevolence could be emulated.\n\nLose benevolence, then righteousness arises,\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nShang and Zhou lost benevolence and then used righteousness,\nbut righteousness could be diminished.\n\nLose righteousness, then ritual arises.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe Five Hegemons lost righteousness and then used ritual,\nbut ritual was mere pretense.\n\nRitual—\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn the final age, those who practice ritual\ncall shallow conduct \"benevolence and righteousness,\"\ncall thin conduct \"ritual and wisdom,\"\nand shallow conduct brings little blessing.\n\nRitual is the ornament of substance.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nThe sage practices the teaching of no-speech;\nthe Dao cannot be attained,\nvirtue cannot be reached,\nbenevolence can be emulated,\nrighteousness can be diminished,\nritual is mere pretense.\n\nRitual is the ornament of the Dao,\nthe thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nand the beginning of chaos.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn the final age, practicing benevolence and righteousness\ncan rectify one kingdom,\npracticing ritual and music\ncan rectify one village—\nthe virtue is thin, and the blessings are small.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Five Hegemons used ritual as a weapon,\nand became the origin of chaos.\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nRitual—\nit is the beginning of chaos.\n\nForeknowledge—\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAncient practitioners of the Dao\ncalled deep practice \"morality and virtue,\"\nshallow practice \"thick blessings,\"\nand complete practice \"the world submits.\"\n\nThe ornament of the Dao—\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAncient practitioners of morality and virtue\nrectified the world—\nthick virtue brings great blessings—\nand the beginning of folly.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Five Sovereigns first relied on virtue and the Dao for their renown,\nthough ancient times were simple, their virtue remained abundant.\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\ntheir actions were measured and deliberate,\ntheir enlightenment effortless and natural.\nThus, the true gentleman—\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThus, the true gentleman remains serene without thought,\nunconcerned without care,\nwalks where no path exists,\nwanders without weariness,\nexits without gates,\nenters without walls,\nharnessing his spirit,\nlaying aside his perceptions—\nso that within he cultivates his essence,\nnot adorning its external trappings,\nvirtue and the Dao require no action.\n\nHe dwells in substance, not in ornament.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng [□ Upper Benevolence Section]*—Wénzǐ asked the Master:\nHow do benevolence, righteousness, and ritual cause chaos?\nBecause they are thin compared to the Dao’s virtue.\n\nThe Master said:\nTo act in benevolence is to govern through human sorrow and joy,\nto act in righteousness is to take and give based on human affairs.\nYet sorrow and joy cannot spread universally,\nand exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the extravagance of all people.\nThus, knowing is inferior to practicing the Dao and embodying virtue,\naligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth—\nall things will then self-regulate,\nand the world will be sustained.\nBenevolence and righteousness cling to human sentiment,\nso they are thin—\nhence the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in ornament.\n\nHe abides in truth, not in its trappings.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng*—Wénzǐ asked the Master:\nWhy do later ages use benevolence, righteousness, and ritual to justify war and punishment?\nBecause they are thin compared to the Dao’s virtue.\n\nThe Master said:\nAncient times followed nature’s course, calling it the Dao,\nand realized its inherent nature, calling it virtue.\nWhen virtue and the Dao were pure and profound,\nwar and punishment were unnecessary.\nIn later ages, virtue and nature were lost,\nso benevolence and righteousness were employed—\nbut when these were shallow and insubstantial,\nwar and punishment were resorted to.\nThus, the true gentleman abides in truth, not in its trappings.\nHence, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nHence, he discards the latter and embraces the former,\nand Heaven’s calamities do not arise.\nHe who gains this forgets the other,\nand thus misfortune departs, blessings come.\n\nThe chapter *\"Obtaining the One\"* (39th):\nThis chapter of the *Tōng Xuān Jīng* speaks:\nIn the most ancient age, the sage cultivated virtue beyond praise,\nnot seeking others’ praise,\nbut what he used to win the world—\nit was not about occupying power or bearing noble titles,\nbut about mastering the heart’s governance over the world,\nand harnessing its natural force.\nLater ages had the name \"ruler,\" yet lacked even one man’s praise,\nand thus lost the world.\nJié and Zhòu did not rule as kings,\nShāng and Wǔ did not act as rebels.\nIn ancient times, the sage received countless praises of the world,\nyet it did not make him better—\ntrue praise is no praise,\nand he grasped the essence of the Dao.\nWithout praise, he embodied Heaven’s will,\nand thus the world endured long.\n\nThe chapter *\"Obtaining the One\"*:\nThe *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:\nThe Dao has no form or boundary,\none *qi* transforms into nine variations,\nwhich then return to one.\nThis One—\nthe origin of all transformations in Heaven, Earth, and beings.\nHeaven obtains the One to remain clear.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nHeaven acts without doing, and thus remains clear.\n\nEarth obtains the One to remain tranquil.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nEarth acts without doing, and thus remains tranquil.\n\nThe spirit obtains the One to become responsive.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nHe who is serene, unadorned, still, and without action—\nthis is the way to nourish the spirit,\nso that worries cannot intrude,\nand malevolent *qi* cannot assail,\nand longevity is attained.\nOnce, Guāngchéngzǐ attained this from the Dao,\nand lived a thousand two hundred years without aging.\n\nThe valley obtains the One to remain full.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nA hundred rivers flow together,\nyet if they do not empty into the sea, they are not valleys.\nThe source of rivers and seas is deep,\nflowing without ceasing.\nAll things obtain the One to flourish.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nAll things cannot but thrive—\nis this not their Dao?\n\nRulers obtain the One to govern the world.\nThe *Dònglíng Jīng* says:\nAncient rulers did not prize their ceremonies,\nnor did they seek praise—\nthese were truly discerning.\nTheir governance—\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nWhen governance is unified, it is not divided.\nHeaven, without remaining clear, would fear fragmentation.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* is divided, it forms a rainbow,\nand the sun cannot endure.\nWinter and summer alternate,\nmoons forget their days,\nsuns forget their nights.\n\nEarth, without remaining tranquil, would fear upheaval.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen Earth’s *qi* is divided, it leaks and conceals,\nand the moon cannot endure.\n\nThe spirit, without remaining responsive, would fear exhaustion.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen a man’s *qi* is divided, he falls ill—\nhis body labors without rest, and thus exhausts,\nhis spirit is used without cessation, and thus perishes.\nThe spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, and overthinking—\nwhen the spirit is spent, the body dies.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nWhen the body labors without rest, it becomes worn,\nwhen the spirit is used without cessation, it becomes strained—\nstrain leads to depletion,\nand depletion leads to extinction.\n\nThe valley, without remaining full, would fear drying up.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nDitches and ponds overflow in floods,\nand wither in drought—\nwhen rivers dry, valleys become empty,\nand hills level while depths are sealed.\n\nAll things, without flourishing, would fear annihilation.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen things thrive, they bear flowers and fruit—\nwhen things die, they wither and decay.\n\nRulers, without attaining true elevation, would fear decline.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThose in high station must not be arrogant—\nelevated yet not precarious,\nfull yet not overflowing—\nthis is how one endures wealth and honor.\nIf precarious, elevated, full, yet overflowing,\nthey cannot endure long.\n\nThus, elevation is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on lowliness.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng [□ Talisman of Speech Section]* says:\nMan has three grievances—\ndo you know them?\nThe high in rank are envied by others,\nthe great in office are hated by their lords,\nthe rich in wealth are resented by the people.\nThe higher the rank, the lower the ambition,\nthe greater the office, the smaller the heart,\nthe richer the wealth, the broader the giving—\nif one cultivates these three, grievances will not arise.\nThus, elevation is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on lowliness.\n\nHence, rulers call themselves *\"gū guǎ\"* (lonely and solitary), *\"bù gǔ\"* (not full).\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Dao Yuan* Section] says:\nThe Sage calls himself *\"gū guǎ\"* (lonely and solitary), *\"bù gǔ\"* (not full), returning to his original root.\nIs this not because he takes lowliness as his foundation?\nIs it not so?\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen the will is weak yet deeds are strong,\nhe entrusts smallness to encompass greatness.\nThe Sage follows the Dao’s principle of *subtraction*,\nthus humbling himself.\n\nSubtraction brings greatness—\nthe world endures long.\nThis is the completion of the Dao’s movement.\n\nThus, though praised by many, he is without praise.\nThe *Nán Huá Jīng* [South Flower Sutra] says:\nIn ancient times, the Sage encompassed heaven and earth,\nhis virtue extending to all under heaven,\nyet he did not know who he was.\nThus, in life he held no rank,\nin death no posthumous name,\nhis substance did not accumulate,\nhis name did not stand.\nThis is called the Great Person.\n\nThough the world praises him, it does not add to his virtue or vice—\nhow could one recognize his true worth?\nThus, praise becomes no praise at all.\n\nHe does not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor dull like stone.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Fú Yán* Section] says:\nIn ancient times, there were no named officials,\nno scheming ministers,\nno taskmasters,\nno masterminds.\nThey hid in formlessness,\nmoved without weariness,\ndid not seek to precede in fortune,\ndid not initiate misfortune.\nThey began in namelessness,\nacted when compelled.\n\nIf one desires fortune to precede, let him not see it;\nif one desires profit, let him distance harm.\nThus, those who act without action and find peace—\nif they lose their peace, they face peril;\nthose who govern without action—\nif they lose their governance, they face chaos.\n\nThus, he does not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor dull like stone.\n\n**Reflection—The Dao’s Movement, Chapter Forty**\nThis chapter of the *Nán Huá Jīng* speaks:\nExtreme yin is solemn and still,\nextreme yang is radiant and fierce.\nSolemn stillness arises from heaven,\nradiant fierceness issues from earth.\nThese two—yin and yang—interact harmoniously,\nand all things are born from them.\n\nSome mark their course yet their form is unseen,\nebbing and flowing, full and empty,\ndarkening and brightening daily,\nchanging monthly,\never acting yet unseen in their deeds.\nLife sprouts from its origin,\ndeath returns to its end.\nBeginning and end oppose the boundless,\nyet their limits are unknown.\n\nThe cold and heat of heaven and earth—\nthese are the Dao’s yin and yang in motion,\nthe generation and transformation of all things.\n\n**Reflection—The Dao’s Movement**\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen yin-qi prevails, it transforms into yang—\nthis is the Dao’s movement of reversal.\n\nThe weak—this is the Dao’s application.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen yang-qi prevails, it transforms into yin—\nthe weak is the Dao’s application.\n\nAll things under heaven—\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThe Dao of heaven and earth:\nhaving and not-having generate each other—\nthis is the transformation of all things.\nThe *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:\nAll things generate and transform,\nentering and exiting the mechanism of change,\nconstantly generating, constantly transforming.\n\nThey generate from what exists—\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAll things move and align with yang’s waves—\nthis is generation.\nThe *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:\nAll things that generate\nemerge from the mechanism and constantly generate.\nAll things that generate cannot but generate.\n\nTheir end—this is the necessary conclusion of generation.\nThey generate from non-existence.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nAll things stilled align with yin’s virtue—\nthis is transformation.\nThe *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:\nAll things that transform\nenter the mechanism and constantly transform.\nAll things that transform cannot but transform.\nGeneration is the necessary end of transformation.\n\nThe Noble Hear the Dao, Chapter Forty-One\n\nThis chapter of the *Nán Huá Jīng* states:\nIn ancient times, when evil was hidden and distinctions of right and wrong arose,\nit was all due to the teachings of the Zhou.\nWhen hidden in the *Wén Huá* (cultural refinements),\nthe distinctions of Confucianism and Mohism emerged—\nthe prominence of Confucian and Mohist distinctions\nis how the Dao was diminished.\n\nIn the Zhou era, many scholars of Confucianism and Mohism flourished,\nall relying on their artificial methods and doctrines,\ndisturbing the world with their teachings—\nthis could not be remedied.\n\nThe so-called Dao-teachings of antiquity,\ndid they truly hide within Confucianism and the various schools?\n\nThere are those who carve their intentions and follow rigid conduct,\ndeparting from the world and its customs,\nuttering lofty theories and grievances—\nthis is mere arrogance.\nThese are the mountain-valley scholars,\nnot the world’s withered ones who rush toward the abyss,\nthe kind favored by Yíqí and Qūyuán.\n\nThere are those who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness,\nrespectfulness, frugality, and yielding—\nthis is mere cultivation.\nThese are the scholars of the common world,\nteachers who dwell in ease and study,\nthe kind favored by Kǒngzǐ and Mèngzǐ.\n\nThere are those who speak of great achievements,\nestablishing great names,\nordering ruler and subject,\nrectifying high and low—\nthis is mere governance.\nThese are the court scholars,\nthose who honor the sovereign and strengthen the state,\npursuing combined merit and power,\nthe kind favored by Yīyīn and Zhōugōng.\n\nThere are those who dwell in marshes and wilds,\nreside in seclusion and leisure,\nfish and drift without purpose—\nthis is mere inaction.\nThese are the river-sea scholars,\nthose who avoid the world and seek repose,\nthe kind favored by Cháo Fù and Xǔ Yóu.\n\nBut the ancient noble ones—\nwithout rigid conduct yet lofty,\nwithout benevolence and righteousness yet cultivated,\nwithout fame and merit yet governing,\nwithout rivers and seas yet at ease—\nwithout forgetting anything,\ntheir hearts are clear and still;\nwithout lacking anything,\nthe Dao is effortless.\nIn their simplicity, without bounds,\nall beauties follow them—\nthis is the effortless Dao of heaven and earth,\nthe still virtue of the Sage,\nthe great governance of the world.\n\nThe Noble Hear the Dao,\nand diligently practice it.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn the upper antiquity, they followed heaven’s effortless Dao—\nfollowing heaven is the Dao of governing heaven and earth,\nstillness and effortlessness are called the Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Middle Hear the Dao,\nand hold it as if it were both present and lost.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn the middle antiquity, they valued the worthy and shaped teachings—\nvaluing the worthy is the origin of doubt and confusion.\nIn the middle antiquity, they upheld virtue but did not cherish the Dao,\nthe Dao faded while virtue flourished.\n\nThe Lowly Hear the Dao,\nand laugh at it.\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nIn the lower antiquity, they relied on ministers and learned skills—\nrelying on ministers is the Dao of peril and ruin.\nIn the lower antiquity, they anxiously clung to their teachings,\nfearing they might lose them.\n\nThe *Nán Huá Jīng* (in the [Autumn Water] chapter) states:\nNorth Sea If said to River Master:\n“Bìyī declined it for the sake of reputation,\nand Zhòngnǐ spoke of it for the sake of knowledge—\nthey both boast of their learning,\nlaughing at the Dao’s effortlessness,\nnot unlike how you, River Master, boast of your waters,\nlaughing at the North Sea’s paucity!”\n\nThe frog of a well cannot be spoken to of the sea,\nfor it is confined to the mud of the well.\nThe summer insect cannot be spoken to of ice,\nfor it is bound to the warmth of summer.\nThe rigid scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao,\nfor he is enslaved by the teachings of learning.\n\nNow you have emerged from the banks of the Jīng River,\ngazing upon the great sea,\nyet you know your own insignificance—\nhow then can you speak of the great principles?\n\nThe waters of the world are none greater than the sea—\nall streams flow into it,\nyet it does not know when to stop and overflows not;\nits ebb drains it,\nyet it does not know when to cease and empties not.\nSpring and autumn remain unchanged,\nand it knows not drought or flood.\nIts currents surpass the rivers and seas—\nthis cannot be measured.\n\nYet I have never boasted of this,\nfor I compare my form to heaven and earth,\nand receive my *qi* from yin and yang.\nI exist between heaven and earth,\nlike a small stone or small tree in a great mountain.\nWhile my existence is visible,\nmy understanding is limited—\nhow dare I boast?\n\nConsidering the vastness of the four seas within heaven and earth,\nit is not like stacked emptiness in the great marshes—\nhow could it be vast?\nConsidering the multitude of China within the sea,\nit is not like scattered grains in the great granary—\nhow could it be many?\nConsidering the abundance of people and things in the nine regions,\nit is not like hairs and fur on a horse’s body—\nhow could it be abundant?\n\nThe five Emperors’ dominions,\nthe three Kings’ struggles,\nthe benevolent’s worries,\nthe capable’s labors—\nall are bounded by greatness and smallness.\n\nSeeking the utmost greatness with their utmost smallness,\nthey are thus confused and cannot find themselves.\nFrom this perspective,\nhow can they know that heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the utmost greatness?\nThe one who views greatness from the small\nbecomes lost in himself—\nnot laughing is not enough to be the Dao.\n\nThe *Nán Huá Jīng* recounts how the debater Gōngsūn Lóng questioned Prince Móu of Wèi:\n“I was young when I learned my Master’s Dao,\nand grew long in understanding the practice of benevolence and righteousness.\nI harmonize what is same,\nseparate what is different,\nand exhaust the arguments of all mouths—\nthus I laugh at Zhūangzǐ’s words,\nwhich seem vague and contradictory.”\n\nPrince Móu reclined, sighed deeply,\nand laughed toward heaven:\n“Have you not heard of the frog of a well?\nTo the turtle of the Eastern Sea, I say:\n‘I delight in the great and boundless—\nwhy does my Master not come to observe it?’\n\nBefore the Eastern Sea turtle’s left foot had entered,\nits right knee was already bound—\nthus it hesitated and withdrew,\ntelling the frog of its sea:\n‘A distance of a thousand *lǐ*,\nis not enough to display its greatness;\na height of a thousand *rèn*,\nis not enough to exhaust its depth.’\n\nThe frog of the well, hearing this,\nwas startled and lost in confusion.\n\nObserving Zhūangzǐ’s most wondrous words,\nyou are content with a moment’s gain—\nare you not the frog of the well?\n\nYou now seek it with careful scrutiny,\nand probe it with argumentative skill—\nthis is truly like using a tube to view heaven,\nor a needle to point at earth—\nis it not small?\n\n#2 Away you go!\n\nGōngsūn Lóng’s mouth gaped but could not close,\nhis tongue rose but could not descend—\nthus he faltered and fled.\n\nZhì Zhī spoke thus:\n\n*\"The* South Flower Sutra *records: Zhī Zhī said to Confucius: ‘I have heard that in antiquity, men tilled to eat and wove to clothe, with no hearts of mutual harm or slaughter—this was the height of virtue’s flourishing, the world at great peace. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not attain this virtue, and fought with Xiōng Yóu at Zhúlù’s wilds, staining the earth a hundred *lǐ* with blood. The Tang and Yú ruled, established ministers, the Shāng king was overthrown, the Wǔ king slew Jié. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, the many tyrannized the few. The kings of Shāng and Zhōu onward were but agents of chaos—how could they be worthy of veneration?\n\nNow you, refining the ways of the martial and the literary, wielding the world’s arguments to teach posterity—your robes are patched, your sash frayed, your conduct thin and insincere. You have lost the ancient simplicity, and the world is in disarray.\n\n**Clarity of the Way seems obscured.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies aligned their inner selves with the Dao, doing good without contrivance, and took Heaven as their companion. The worthies of today, though outwardly conforming to rites and respectful in action, take humanity as their companion.\n\n**Advancing the Way seems like retreat.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies cultivated non-action within, yet did not contrive without. The worthies of today contrive without, yet do not cultivate non-action within.\n\n**The Way’s rectitude seems crooked.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancients transformed outwardly yet remained untransformed within—they guarded their inner purity without contriving for the outer world. The worthies of today are transformed within yet untransformed without—they guard the outer world with contrivance, yet neglect their inner selves.\n\n**Great virtue seems like a valley.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient worthies savored the Dao without abandoning it. The worthies of today abandon the Dao without savoring it. To forsake the Way and rely on learning is perilous; to discard virtue and employ talent is to invite ruin.\n\n**Pure white seems like shame.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, though pure and unadorned, were called ‘great white’ as if shamed. They returned to simplicity, their essence unspoiled. The worthies of later ages, treating cleverness as governance, labor their minds yet fail to enlighten; those who rely on wit, though they strain their hearts, achieve nothing.\n\n**Ample virtue seems insufficient.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity had virtue so vast it seemed lacking. *The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The superior worthies had virtue so broad it seemed insufficient. Yet today’s worthies, though they master a single learning or refine a single skill, can only offer partial explanations—unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.\n\n**Great sound is rare in voice.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose Dao was most vast, had no sound or voice—they returned to simplicity at their end, and the people acted without guile. The worthies of later ages, though they excel in minor arts, break harmony; those skilled in trifles lose their naturalness. To debate a single phrase, to master a single technique—though one may speak eloquently, it is unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.\n\n**Great form has no shape.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose simplicity was most vast, had no fixed form. Their eyes, though clear, did not see; their ears, though still, did not hear. Their mouths, though closed, did not speak; their hearts, though at rest, did not scheme. They abandoned cleverness, returned to the uncarved block, preserved their spirit, discarded knowledge—neither liking nor disliking—this is called Great Harmony. The Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: To revere antiquity while belittling the present is the way of the shallow scholar. Yet if one views the present through the lens of the Jié Wéi lineage, who could avoid eccentric learning? Only the truly wise, with profound virtue and perfect humanity, can wander the world in the Dao without eccentricity, follow humanity with non-action without losing their true nature. They do not teach through cleverness, nor do they cling to learning—they receive meaning from the Dao, not from study.\n\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: To dwell in obscurity, speak in silence, govern with non-action, yet see deeds accomplished without knowing how—this is the Dao of the Sage.\n\nFor only the Dao—\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient true worthies were those whose nature aligned with the Dao. They cultivated within yet did not contrive without, wandering the roots of Heaven and Earth. Unconcerned with the dust of the world, they roamed freely in the business of non-doing. Mechanical cleverness did not burden their minds; they knew without learning, saw without looking, achieved without action, spoke eloquently without effort—adrift in non-action. The world transformed of itself; this was the true worthies’ pure wandering in the uncarved Dao.\n\n**Generosity in lending, yet completion is assured.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *records: Lǎo Dān said to Yáng Zǐ Jū: ‘The governance of the enlightened king covers the world yet seems not of his own doing. He transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely on him. He has no ostentatious name, yet things take joy in him. He stands firm yet unobtrusive, wandering in the Dao—he is nonexistent.’\"*\n\nThe ancient **true worthies** stood in the realm of **non-lending** (*bù dài*), adrift in non-action. **Non-lending** means no excess—nothing is thrust upon things. The *Chapter of the Dao’s Generation* (Fourth Twenty-Two) of the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (*Tōng Xuán Jīng*) states: The Dao’s generation begins with the **origin** (*yuán*) and **production** (*chǎn*), having no beginning. It begins with **softness and weakness** (*róuruò*), yet completes as **firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*). Those who seek **firmness** must guard it with **weakness**, accumulating weakness to achieve strength. Observing what they accumulate reveals the Dao of **preservation and decay** (*cúnwáng*).\n\nIn the **Great Ancient Age**, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) used the Dao to **settle** (*zhèn*) it and **reduce** (*sǔn*) the **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), guarding softness without forcing strength. By **transforming** (*huà*) himself through **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), he thus achieved his kingship.\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guarding Chapters*) says: Before Heaven and Earth took form, they were **dim and indistinct**, **mysterious and unified** (*yǎoyǎo mínghún ér wéi yī*), **silent and lucid** (*jìrán chéngqīng*)—this was the Dao. The Dao generates **One** (*yī*), which is Heaven (*tiān*); **One** generates **Two** (*èr*), which is Earth (*dì*), **pure and refined** (*qīngwēi*) for Heaven, **dense and turbid** (*chóngzhuó*) for Earth. **Two** generates **Three** (*sān*), which is **Human** (*rén*), with **vital essence and qi** (*jīngqì*) as the human form. **Three** generates **ten thousand things** (*wànwù*), with **coarse qi** (*cūqì*) forming insects. **Firmness and softness** (*gāngróu xiāngchéng*) intermingle, and thus ten thousand things are born.\n\nAll things **carry yin** (*fù yīn*) and **embrace yang** (*bào yáng*), hence **wood fruits** (*mùshí*) grow from the **heart** (*xīn*), and **grass fruits** (*cǎoshí*) from the **flower** (*yīng*). The **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*), and **balance** (*hé*) resides at the **center** (*zhōngyāng*), hence **embryonic and oviparous** (*tāiluǎn*) beings are born from the center. The *South Flower Sutra* says: All things generate from **form** (*xíng*). Those with **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiàng*) are born from the **embryo** (*tāi*), those with **eight orifices** (*bāqiàng*) from the **egg** (*luǎn*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Void* (*Chōng Xū Jīng*) says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) in **harmony** (*hé*) forms the human.\n\nWhat people abhor, the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **petty man’s** (*xiǎorén*) emotional nature loves **strength** (*qiáng*) and abhors **weakness** (*ruò*), loves **firmness** (*gāng*) and abhors **softness** (*róu*), yet knows not the **loss** (*shī*). Only the **lonely, widowed, and childless** (*gūguǎ bùgǔ*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Dao’s Origin*) says: **Kings and nobles** (*wánggōng*) possess **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), while the lonely, widowed, and childless lack it. They guard **humility** (*qiān*) and **reduce** (*sǔn*), yet kings and nobles take this as their **standard** (*chēng*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: In ancient times, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) daily **reduced** (*sǔn*) his **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), never daring to **be self-satisfied** (*zì mǎn*), daily advancing through **humility** (*qiān*). His **virtue and power** (*dé*) did not **decay** (*cuì*), for this was the **Way of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Symbols*) says: Those with **little virtue yet much favor** (*dé shǎo ér chǒng duō*) are **mocked** (*jī*), those with **low talent yet high station** (*cái xià ér wèi gāo*) are **in peril** (*wēi*), and those with **no great merit yet thick rewards** (*hòu lù*) are **humiliated** (*wēi*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **No greater blessing** (*fú*) than **no calamity** (*wú huò*), **no greater advantage** (*lì*) than **no loss** (*bù sǎng*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nWhat people teach, the *South Flower Sutra* says: **Confucian scholars** (*rú*) **adjust** (*qū*) the **rites** (*lǐ*), teaching **respect** (*jìng*) and **humility** (*qiān*). I also teach this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are the **companions of life** (*shēngzhī tú*). **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are **supreme** (*shàng*). **Harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) cannot **attain their end** (*bù dé qí sǐ*), for in the **end times** (*mòshì*), those who **harbor harsh and rigid qi** (*bào qiángliáng zhī qì*) cannot endure long—**harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) lead to **death** (*sǐ*). I will take this as my **teacher** (*jiào fù*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are the **companions of death** (*sǐ zhī tú*). **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are **inferior** (*xià*). The **Supreme Softness of the World** (Chapter Forty-Three) of the *South Flower Sutra* (□ *Chapter of the Way of Heaven*) states: **Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and ease** (*xūjìng tiándàn*), **silent, empty, and non-acting** (*jìmò wúwéi*), **pure and uncarved** (*chúncuì sūpǔ*)—this is the **balance of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì zhī píng*) and the **supreme Dao of virtue** (*Dàodé zhī zhì*), the **root of ten thousand things** (*wànwù zhī běn*).\n\nTo **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while ruling as **sovereign** (*jūn*), **Emperor Yao** (*Táo Tāng*) was a **lord** (*wáng*). To **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while serving as **subject** (*chén*), **Emperor Shun** (*Yú Shùn*) was a **minister** (*shì*). The **sage-king** (*shèngwáng*) **dwells** (*chǔ*) in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) at the **ruling position** (*jūnshàng*), a **virtue of emperors and kings** (*Dìshǐng Tiānzǐ zhī dé*). **Lǎo Dān** stood in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) as a **subject**, the **Dao of the Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng sūwáng zhī dào*).\n\nThe **recluse** (*yìshì*) **retired** (*tuìjū*) in this **vacuity and stillness** (*xūjìng*), wandering freely in the **rivers and seas** (*Jiānghǎi*), and the **mountain and forest dwellers** (*shānlín zhī shì*) **submitted** (*fú*). The **scholar** (*shìrén*) **advanced** (*jìnwéi*) through this **tranquility and ease** (*tiándàn*), **nurturing the world** (*fǔshì*), and thus achieved **great merit and renown** (*gōng dà míng xiǎn*), with the world unified in **one** (*yī*).\n\n**Stillness** (*jìng*) brings **sageliness** (*shèng*), **action** (*dòng*) brings **kingship** (*wáng*). **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet **is honored** (*zūn*), **simplicity and purity** (*pǔsū*) yet the world **cannot rival** (*mò néng yǔ zhī zhēng měi*)—thus the ancient sage said: *\"I thereby know the benefit of non-action, the teaching of silence, the advantage of non-action—few in the world can attain it.\"* **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) is indeed beneficial.\n\nThe **Supreme Softness of the World**, the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **supreme softness** (*zhì róu*) of the world **gallops** (*chíchèng*) over the **supreme firmness** (*zhì jiān*) of the world. **Galloping** (*chíchèng*) over the **supreme firmness** (*zhì jiān*) of the world.\n\nThe *South Flower Sutra* says: **Water flows** (*shuǐ liú*) in **formlessness** (*wúxíng*), **emerging** (*fāxiè*) in the **Great Clarity** (*Tàiqīng*). The **overflowing** (*shuǐ zhī jū*) of water is **non-acting** (*wúwéi*) yet **its talent** (*cái*) is **naturally** (*zìrán*) displayed. **No gap** (*wújiàn*) enters **no gap** (*wújiàn*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **No gap** (*wújiàn*) enters **no gap** (*wújiàn*).\n\nThe *South Flower Sutra* says: **Heaven’s Gate** (*Tiānmén*) is **no gap** (*wújiàn*). All things **emerge** (*chū*) from **no gap** (*wújiàn*). **Gap** (*yǒu*) cannot **with Gap** (*yǒu*) be **Gap** (*yǒu*), **Gap** (*yǒu*) must **emerge** (*chū*) from **no gap** (*wújiàn*), yet **no gap** (*wújiàn*) has **gap** (*yǒu*). **Gap** (*yǒu*) emerges, **Gap** (*yǒu*) dies, **Gap** (*yǒu*) emerges, **Gap** (*yǒu*) enters. **Entering and emerging** (*rù chū*) yet **no form is seen** (*wú xiàn qí xíng*), this is called **Heaven’s Gate** (*Tiānmén*).\n\nI thereby know, the *South Flower Sutra* says: **Lǎo Dān** stood in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) as a **subject** (*chén*), the **Dao of the Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng sūwáng zhī dào*). The benefit of **non-action** (*wúwéi*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of Naturalness*) says: The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì zhī dào*) is **complete** (*bèi*) through **non-action** (*wúwéi*), **obtained** (*dé*) without **seeking** (*qiú*). I thereby know its **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet **is beneficial** (*yǒu yì*).\n\n---\n\n**The teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*), the *South Flower Sutra* says: In the **Age of High Antiquity** (*shànggǔ*), the **Sages** (*shèngrén*) practiced **the teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*), established **non-teaching** (*lì bùjiào*), sat without debate (*zuò bùyì*), **void** (*xū*) yet they went, **substantial** (*shí*) yet they returned. Thus, **the teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*) exists—those who act in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet their **heart is fulfilled** (*xīnchéng*).\n\nThe **Great Dao** (*dàdào*) does not proclaim itself, the **Great Discourse** (*dàbiàn*) does not speak. The benefit of **non-action** (*wúwéi*), the *South Flower Sutra* says: The **Mysterious Ancient Lord** (*Xuán gǔ zhī jūn*), in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) ruled the **world** (*tiānxìa*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*Tiāndé*) was all. **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet it is **Heaven** (*tiān*), **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet it is **virtue** (*dé*). Above, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) prevails; below, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) also prevails. The **world** (*tiānxià*) rarely attains this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **root of benefit** (*yǒuyì zhī běn*) lies in **non-benefit** (*wúyì*). Thus, **non-benefit** (*wúyì*) is harmful to governance, yet **beneficial to chaos** (*yǒuyì yú luàn*), and the **Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng*) does not act. **Chapter of Name and Body** (*Míng yǔ shēn zhāng*) **Forty-Fourth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: **The unbenevolent** (*bùrén*) yet greedy for **wealth, honor, fame, and profit** (*fùguì mínglì zhī huì*), in turn harm their **body** (*shēn*). The **King of Chu** (*Chǔ wēiwáng*) heard of **Zhuang Zhou’s** (*Zhuāng Zhōu*) virtue (*xián*), sent envoys with **rich gifts** (*hòubì zhī*), offering him the position of **prime minister** (*xiàng*), and **Zhuang Zhou** told the **Chu envoy** (*Chǔ shǐ*): \"A thousand **gold** (*jīn*), heavy **profit** (*zhònglì*); **prime minister** (*xiàng*), an **exalted position** (*zūnwèi*). Have you not seen the **sacrificial ox** (*xīniú*) of the **autumnal sacrifice** (*jiāojì*)? Nurtured and fed for **many years** (*shùsuì*), adorned with **embroidered patterns** (*wénxiù*), given **grain and beans** (*chúshū*), until it is led into the **grand temple** (*tàimiào*), even if it wished to be a **lonely calf** (*gǔdú*), could it obtain this? I hasten to depart, lest I be **defiled** (*wū*). **Rulers** (*yǒuguó zhě*) are **captured** (*jī*), yet **Zhuang Zhou** served none his whole life, **self-contented** (*zìkuài*) in the **Dao of non-action** (*wúwéi zhī dào*).\n\nThe **Lord of Lu** (*Lǔ jūn*) heard that **Yan He** (*Yán Huò*) was a **man of the Dao** (*dézhī rén*), sent envoys with **gifts** (*bì*) first. **Yan He** did not accept them, truly **hating wealth and honor** (*zēn wù fùguì*). Hence it is said: The **true Dao** (*dàozhī zhēn*) is used to **cultivate the body** (*zhìshēn*), its **leftover threads** (*xùyú*) for **states**, its **coarse husks** (*tǔjū*) to **govern the world** (*zhìtiānxìa*). Observed thus, the **functions of emperors and kings** (*dìwáng zhī gōng*) are the **leftover tasks** (*shèngrén zhī yúshì*) of the **Sages**, not what is used to **perfect the body and nurture life** (*wánshēn yǎngshēng*). Today’s **common scholars** (*jūnzǐ*) often **endanger their body and abandon life** (*wēishēn qìshēng*) to **sacrifice themselves for things** (*xùnwù*) in **name and profit** (*mínglì*). Is this not tragic?\n\nNow, there is a man here who uses the **Sui Hou’s jade** (*Suìhóu zhī zhū*) to shoot a **thousand-ren high bird** (*qiān rèn zhī què*). The **world** (*shì*) would surely **mock him** (*xiào*), why? Because what he **employs** (*suǒyòng*) is **heavy** (*zhòng*), yet what he **desires** (*suǒyào*) is **light** (*qīng*). Life (*shēng*) is not merely the **weight** (*zhòng*) of **Sui Hou’s jade**—**name and profit** (*mínglì*) destroy the **body** (*shēn*). **Knowing sufficiency** (*zhīzú*) prevents **humiliation** (*rǔ*), **knowing restraint** (*zhīzhǐ*) avoids **peril** (*dài*). Thus, one may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*). Hence this chapter was composed.\n\n**Name and body** (*míng yǔ shēn*), which is more **intimate** (*qīn*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Bao Jiao, and Jie Zi Yi** (*Bó Yí, Shū Qí, Bào Jiāo, Jiè Zǐ Tū*), these four **men** (*zǐ*), **valued name yet despised death** (*zhòngmíng qīngsǐ*). **Body and wealth** (*shēn yǔ huò*), which is more **abundant** (*duō*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: In ancient times, **Jie** (*Jié*) killed **Guan Longfeng** (*Guān Lóngfēng*), **Zhou** (*Zhòu*) killed **Wang Zi Biduan** (*Wáng Zǐ Bǐgān*), hence **Guan Longfeng** was **beheaded** (*zhǎn*), **Wang Zi Biduan** was **flayed** (*pōu*), **Peng Hong** was **castrated** (*jiāng*), and **Zi Yu** was **minced** (*mí*). These four **virtuous men** (*xiánzhě*) were **greedy for fame and profit** (*hǎomínglì zhě*), yet their **bodies** (*shēn*) were not spared from **slaughter** (*lù*).\n\n**Gain and loss** (*dé yǔ wáng*), which brings more **suffering** (*bìng*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: These are the **kindred** (*shǔlèi*) of **Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Wang Zi Biduan, and Zi Yu** (*Bó Yí, Shū Qí, Bǐgān, Zǐ Yú*). Thus, it **discourses the Dao** (*lùndào*) of **long life, bodily safety, and joyful intent** (*chángshēng āntǐ lèyì zhī dào*), is it not **far removed** (*bù yì yuǎn*)?\n\nHence, **excessive love** (*shèn ài*) brings **great expenditure** (*dàfèi*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **patterns of tigers and leopards** (*hǔbào zhī wén*) come to be **shot** (*shè*), the **agility of monkeys and barbarians** (*yóudí zhī jié*) comes to be **trapped** (*gé*). **Chimes** (*míngzhuó*) are **self-destructive** (*zìhuǐ*) by **sound** (*shēng*), **oils and candles** (*gāojìng*) are **self-consumed** (*zìjiān*) by **brightness** (*míng*). **Martial prowess** (*wǔyǒng*) perishes from **strength and force** (*yīnqiángliáng*), **eloquent scholars** (*biànshì*) perish from **ability** (*yīnnéng*). **Excessive hoarding** (*duōzàng*) leads to **great loss** (*hòuwáng*).\n\nThe *South Flower Sutra* says: **Forest trees** (*shān mù*) **self-destroy** (*zìkòu*), **oils and candles** (*gāohuǒ*) **self-cook** (*zìjiān*). **Sweet osmanthus** (*guì*) can be **eaten** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **peeled** (*bō*), **lacquer** (*qī*) can be **used** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **cut** (*gē*). All **know** (*rén jiē zhī*) that **sweet osmanthus and lacquer** (*guì qī*) have **use** (*yòng*), yet **do not know** (*wúzhī*) that the **oak tree** (*lìshù*), though **useless** (*wúyòng*), **preserves its life until Heaven’s end** (*dézhōng tiānnián*). **Knowing sufficiency** (*zhīzú*) prevents **humiliation** (*rǔ*).\n\nThe *South Flower Sutra*, **Zeng Zi** said: The **Son of Heaven** (*tiānzǐ*) cannot **obtain subjects** (*dé chén*), **feudal lords** (*zhūhóu*) cannot **obtain friends** (*dé yǒu*). **Nurturing the spirit** (*yǎngzhì zhě*) **forgets name** (*wàngmíng*), **nurturing the form** (*yǎngxíng zhě*) **forgets profit** (*wànglì*), **attaining the Dao** (*zhìdào zhě*) **forgets the heart** (*wàngxīn*). **Knowing restraint** (*zhīzhǐ*) avoids **peril** (*dài*).\n\nThe *Sutra of the Void and the Substantial* says: **Not greedy for wealth** (*bùtān huò*), why **covet profit** (*hé xiàn lì*)? **Not greedy for honor** (*bùtān guì*), why **covet name** (*hé xiàn míng*)? This is called **conforming to the people** (*shùnmín*). The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Name and profit** (*mínglì èr zhě*), **agitate the spirit** (*bózhì*). **Not stirring the heart** (*bùdòng xīnzhōng*) is **upright** (*zhèng*), **upright** (*zhèng*) is **void and tranquil** (*xūjìng wúwéi*) yet **non-doing** (*wúwéi*), and thus **nothing remains undone** (*wú bùwéi*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Jade and jade-like vessels** (*bìyàn zhī qì*), the **craft of carving** (*zhuāngyǒu zhī gōng*); **knives and hatchets** (*liàngzhǐ duànlì*), the **strength of whetstones** (*dǐlì zhī lì*). **Cunning hares die, yet hounds are boiled** (*jiǎotù sǐ ér lièquǎn pēng*), **high fowl are exhausted, yet fine bows are stored** (*gāoqín jìn ér liánggōng cáng*), **enemy states are annihilated, yet scheming ministers perish** (*dígú miè ér móuchén wáng*). **When the task is complete, withdraw** (*gōngsuì shēntuì*), such is **Heaven’s Dao** (*Tiāndào*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).\n\n**Chapter of Great Achievement as if Deficient** (*Dàchéng ruò quē zhāng*) **Forty-Fifth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: Though **Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndì*) are vast, their **transformations** (*huà*) are **uniform** (*jūn*). Though **all things** (*wànwù*) are numerous, their **governance** (*zhì*) is **one** (*yī*). Though **people** (*réncú*) are many, their **master** (*zhǔ*) is **only the lord** (*wéijūn*). The lord **originates from virtue** (*yuán yú dé*) yet **achieves through Heaven** (*chéng yú tiān*), hence it is said: The **Mysterious Ancient Lord** (*Xuán gǔ zhī jūn*), in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) ruled the **world** (*tiānxìa*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*Tiāndé*) was all. Thus, the **Sages of High Antiquity** (*dàgǔ shèngrén*) were **greatly skilled yet seemingly clumsy** (*dàqiǎo ruò zhuō*), **greatly eloquent yet seemingly tongue-tied** (*dàbiàn ruò nè*). **Embodying the Dao** (*tǐdào*), they were **void and tranquil** (*qīngjìng wúwéi*), **the rectifiers of the world** (*tiānxià zhī zhèng*), **teaching the use of the inexhaustible** (*jiào qí yòng wúqióng*). Thus they could **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*), hence this chapter was composed.\n\n**Great achievement as if deficient** (*dàchéng ruò quē*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Heaven’s roundness** (*Tiān yuán*) does not **conform to compasses** (*zhōng guī*), **Earth’s square** (*dìfāng*) does not **conform to rulers** (*zhōng jǔ*). The **Dao** (*dào*) is the **greatest** (*zhìdà*), yet it has **no compasses or rulers** (*wú guījǔ*). Its **use is not exhausted** (*qí yòng bùbì*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Void and tranquil** (*qīngjìng*) is the **mirror of the Dao** (*dào zhī jiàn*). **Void and pure** (*qīngxū*) is **Heaven’s brightness** (*tiān zhī míng*). **One yet unchanging** (*yī ér bùbiàn*), **the utmost of tranquility** (*jìng zhī zhì*). **Great fullness as if empty** (*dàyíng ruò chōng*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Heaven’s rectitude** (*tiānzhèng*) does not **conform to hooks** (*zhōng gōu*), **Earth’s straightness** (*dìzhí*) does not **conform to plumb lines** (*zhōng shéng*). **Virtue** (*dé*) is the **greatest** (*zhìdà*), yet it has **no hooks or plumb lines** (*wú gōushéng*). Its **use is inexhaustible** (*qí yòng bùqióng*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) is the **constant of the Dao** (*dào zhī cháng*). **Non-action** yet it is **Heaven** (*wúwéi wéizhī tiān*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*tiāndé*) was all.\n\n**The Way’s Great Straightness as if Bent**\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nIn ancient times, there was the constant Dao of the world—\nthe curved was not measured by hooks,\nthe straight was not measured by plumb lines,\n**the greatest straightness as if bent.**\n\n**The Way’s Great Skill as if Clumsy**\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nIn ancient times, there was the constant virtue of the world—\nthe round was not measured by compasses,\nthe square was not measured by squares,\n**the greatest skill as if clumsy.**\n\n**The Way’s Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied**\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nThe Great Dao does not speak,\nthe greatest eloquence does not argue,\n**the greatest eloquence as if tongue-tied.**\n\n**Agitation Overcomes Cold**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nWhen **yang-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yin**,\nthus **skill cannot be overfilled.**\n\n**Tranquility Overcomes Heat**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nWhen **yin-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yang**,\nthus **eloquence cannot be pushed to extremes.**\n\n**Pure Tranquility as the World’s Rectitude**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages, who practiced **non-action**,\nguarded **stillness**—\nguarding stillness could rectify the world.\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\nThis chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Upper Virtue Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, those who wielded arms did not covet lands or riches,\nbut acted when danger loomed, pacifying chaos and removing harm for the people—\nthus turning peril into security.\nThe **Red Sovereign** brought great calamity,\nso the **Yellow Emperor** subdued him.\n**Gonggong** caused the flood disaster,\nso **Zhuànxū** executed him.\nNow the Seven States are without the Dao—\ngreedy, covetous men ravage the world,\nthe people restless, finding no peace.\nWhen the Dao is absent, arms are used—\nwarhorses roam the suburbs,\nthe world descends into great disorder.\n\n**When the World Has the Dao**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, those who summoned the distant\nlet them act in **non-action**,\nand those nearby\nwere told to do nothing—\nonly those who walked secretly in the Dao\ncould truly possess it.\n\n**Turning Warhorses to Manure**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nTurning warhorses to manure,\ntheir tracks do not reach beyond the farthest lands—\nthis is called **sitting while galloping, floating while submerged.**\n\n**When the World Lacks the Dao**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, when the world lacked the Dao,\nwar became the master of chaos.\nWarhorses roamed the suburbs.\n*The Sutra of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nNow, in the Spring and Autumn era, few rulers had the Dao,\nwhile many lacked it—\none cannot abandon the root for the branches,\nnor use war as the primary means.\n\n**No Greater Crime Than Covetousness**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater crime than lacking the Dao.**\nFighting over trivial matters, unable to restrain the heart—\nthis is **the army of rage**, and thus it fails.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**No Greater Calamity Than Insatiability**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater calamity than lacking virtue.**\nTaking others’ lands, desiring their wealth—\nthis is **the army of greed**, and thus it perishes.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**No Greater Blame Than Desiring More**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater blame than lacking virtue.**\nRelying on the greatness of one’s state,\nboasting of one’s people’s multitude,\nand seeking to surpass enemy nations—\nthis is **the army of arrogance**, and thus it is destroyed.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThus, **knowing sufficiency is sufficiency itself.**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, those who nurtured life knew sufficiency—\nthus crime did not burden them.\n\n---\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nThis chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, rulers taught without leaving their doors,\nknowing thus the governance of the world—\nobserving things through things,\nknowing people through people.\nFirst cultivating oneself, then one could govern the people.\nOrdering the home and managing affairs,\nonly then could one extend to officials and the world—\nthus the world was governed.\n\nLater generations issued ever-farther decrees,\nbringing chaos and confusion,\nwhile those who knew governance grew fewer—\nfor they did not cultivate their own roots.\n\nThus the ancient sages practiced **non-action**,\nrectifying themselves,\nand without commands, their virtue took hold;\nwithout movement, their wisdom was known;\nwithout being seen, their names were honored;\nwithout action, their deeds were complete—\nthe world self-governed.\n\n**Not Leaving the Door, Knowing the World**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, teaching did not leave the door\nto know the world’s governance—\nthis speaks of **precision and sincerity in non-action**, emanating from within.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nThe ancients governed their inner selves by the Dao,\nand did not govern the outer.\n\n**Without Gazing Through the Window, Seeing the Dao of Heaven**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nNot gazing through the window to see the Dao of Heaven—\nthis speaks of **spirit and qi**, pure and tranquil, moving with Heaven.\n\n**The Farther One Goes, the Less One Knows**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guardians Section*) says:\nThe farther one’s actions extend,\nthe less one knows—\nthis speaks of **spirit and vitality** in **action**,\nwhich must not be allowed to stray outward.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nNow people govern the outer while neglecting the inner.\n\n**The Less One Knows**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nWhen **precision and sincerity** stray outward,\nand **thought and calculation** scatter inward,\none cannot govern.\nWhen the **form and spirit** are used far,\nwhat is neglected grows near—\nthus one knows less.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nNow people guard the outer while neglecting the inner.\n\nThus the sage,\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**The root of no-command lies in rectifying oneself.**\n\n**Without Movement, Knowing**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\ntheir bodies issued no commands yet restrained,\nthey did not act yet were benevolent,\nthey did not move yet were wise.\n\n**Without Being Seen, Named**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\ntheir eyes did not gaze yet were clear,\ntheir ears did not listen yet were sharp,\nthey were not seen yet their names were honored.\n\n**Without Action, Achieved**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\nthey did not speak yet were trusted,\nthey did not seek yet obtained,\nthey did not act yet succeeded.\n\n---\n**Chapter 48: Daily Learning Increases**\nThis chapter from *The Zhuangzi* says:\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns—\nthe people used knotted cords and had no writing,\nand in such times, the world was at **great peace**—\nthis was the governance of the Dao.\n\nNow it has come to this:\npeople stretch their necks and lift their feet to attend lectures,\nsaying, *“There is a sage in such-and-such a place,”*\nand with exhausted provisions, they rush to learn—\nabandoning their inner duties and outer service to their lords.\nThus, warhorses’ tracks connect the states,\nand chariot ruts stretch a thousand *li*—\nthe world descends into great disorder.\n\nThis is the chaos of learning—\nit is the fault of the rulers above who love knowledge and learning.\n\nFor those who love knowledge and learning to bring chaos to the world,\nit began with the Three Kings and their descendants,\nwho still valued literary arts as the way.\n\nThey abandoned the simple and pure people,\nand delighted in the scheming, laboring, and cleverly learned flatterers,\ndiscarding the tranquil, effortless Dao,\nand taking pleasure in the clamor and superficiality of words.\n\nThe clamor and superficiality of words,\nthe shallow and ornate learning of later scholars,\nhas already spread its disorder across the world.\n\n*Daily Learning Increases*, the *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Zhou era was vast in learning and abundant in eloquence,\nyet it could not escape chaos.\n\nNow, if we take petty learning as education,\nwe cannot attain the great Dao’s clarity and establish the sage.\nIf we cling only to written laws,\ngoverning the world will be difficult indeed.\n\n*The Way Daily Decreases*\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, those who cultivated the Dao did so by daily diminishing.\nDiminishing again and again,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says: Diminishing again and again.\nUntil they reached *wuwei*.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: Until they reached *wuwei*.\n*Wuwei* yet nothing remained undone.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: *Wuwei* yet nothing remained undone—\nabove, there was *wuwei*,\nbelow, there was also *wuwei*.\n\nTo take the world,\none must always act with *wu* (no affairs).\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient skillful rulers,\ntook the world yet had no affairs.\n\nThe root of *wu* (no affairs) lies in the Dao’s daily diminishing.\nWhen affairs arise,\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Wood breeds worms, which return as its rot;\npeople breed affairs, which return as their thieves.\n\nEach follows what they delight in,\nonly to harm themselves in return.\nWith learning as their affair,\nand affairs used to stop affairs,\nit is like stirring water yet hoping for clarity—\ndifficult indeed,\nand insufficient to take the world.\n\nInsufficient to take the world.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those of high station cannot be burdened with affairs;\nif affairs burden them, governing is difficult,\nand insufficient to take the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: In later ages, those who promulgated laws and offered rewards yet failed to transform customs and mores did so because their governance and punishments did not align with the Dao. In ancient times, the sage listened to the people’s music and knew their customs; observed their rituals and knew their mores; saw their mores and understood their transformation. Knowing the Dao’s unity, though he spoke not a word, all under heaven and the myriad people were transformed by him. This was because he sought only one thing: sincere adherence to the Dao—the supreme virtue of divine transformation.\n\nThus it is said: The sage has no fixed heart; he takes the people’s heart as his own. Nurturing the people as an infant, all under heaven will return to him.\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage’s heart, night and day, never forgot benefiting the people. His virtue extended far, reaching the four seas.\n\nTaking the people’s heart as his own.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the sage is above, the realm is governed; when below, the people emulate his intentions.\n\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage saw virtue as if he could not attain it himself; saw vice as if it were an omen. Teaching without descending from his hall, he rectified all under heaven. The people transformed and turned toward goodness—this was because he sought only his own virtue.\n\nTo the wicked, I am also virtuous.\nVirtue is power.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw gains as belonging to the people, losses as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.\n\nTo the trustworthy, I trust them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Trust is the noble’s word; loyalty, the noble’s intent. When loyalty and trust manifest within, they resonate without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nTo the untrustworthy, I also trust them.\nVirtue is trust.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw righteousness as belonging to the people, perversity as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.\n\nThe sage in all under heaven.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The fundamental duty of governing is to secure the people.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw one person lose their form and in retreat blamed themselves.\n\nDiligent, for all under heaven.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient perfect ones refined their sincerity within, their virtue flowing to the four quarters. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoiced yet did not forget; seeing harm for all under heaven, they grieved as if in mourning.\n\nUnified in heart.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven, to grieve with all under heaven—yet never failing to rule—is without precedent.\n\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: He who grieves with the people’s grief, the people also grieve his grief; he who rejoices with the people’s joy, the people also rejoice his joy.\n\nThe sage treats them all as children.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Above views below as children, below views above as father; above views below as younger siblings, below views above as elder brothers. Viewing below as children—thus ruling all under heaven; viewing above as father—thus rectifying all under heaven; viewing below as younger siblings—thus not causing their deaths through hardship.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**\n\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: Today, the seven kingdoms’ lords and ministers engage in birth-and-death struggles—knowing the suitability of lands, mastering the advantages of rugged terrain, discerning the shifts of oppressive governance, and probing military formations. Blades clash, arrows fly, the wounded are carried, blood flows for thousands of *li*, bones litter the wilds. Victory and defeat both bring ruin, and war becomes the realm of death—not the way of those who truly nurture life.\n\nTruly, those ancient masters who skillfully governed their troops avoided the death-ground of arms—this was excellence. Now, the seven kingdoms’ arms have become that death-ground.\n\nBirth and death.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: There is one who, in war, can revive the dead. Used well, it brings fortune; used poorly, it brings calamity.\n\nThe living, thirteen in number.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: There are those who die unnaturally, not by fate. The few attack the many; the weak assault the strong—soldiers kill them.\n\nThe dead, thirteen in number.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Skilled warriors kill, each according to their desires, only to harm themselves in return. Killing ten thousand, they lose three thousand of their own.\n\nHuman life.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: Human nature desires life and abhors death.\n\nDriven to the death-ground.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Upper Virtue Section*] says: War kills and wounds—thus it is called the death-ground.\nAlso thirteen in number.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: War is the death-ground, yet half who fight die in it.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Nine Guards*] says: Why do the people of the seven kingdoms not complete their natural years? It is because of war’s slaughter.\n\nBecause of their thick accumulation of life.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, because of their thick accumulation of life.\n\nTruly, those who nurture life well.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Even those who seek to nurture life do not rely on beasts—bears, tigers, leopards, and panthers serve as their banners, yet outwit them.\n\nTraveling by land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: To traverse water without fearing dragons is the fisherman’s courage; to travel land without fearing rhinoceroses and tigers is the hunter’s courage.\n\nEntering battle, they do not don armor.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: When blades clash before them and they regard death as life, this is the warrior’s courage.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, beasts gathered in herds—thus they could be tethered and led without harming people.\n\nThe tiger has no place to strike with its claws.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, men dwelled with beasts—thus they could climb and peer among them without danger.\n\nWeapons find no place to wield their blades.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, deceit and evil did not arise, peace and ease prevailed, the world was harmonious, and the wise had no need to employ their strategies, nor did the brave need to wield their might. Why is this?\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not tyrannize the few, and people preserved their lives without dying young. Why? It was because there was no place for war and death.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, calamities and disasters did not arise, nor did misfortunes and chaos take shape—the world was at great peace, for there was no place for death.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: \"Dao Generates\"**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:\nForm does not arise without Dao; life does not flourish without virtue/power. Thus, Dao abides in nature, and virtue/power sustains life.\nDao and virtue/power—these are the great furnace of heaven and earth, the great alchemist of transformation, using yin and yang as fuel and the four seasons as timing to mold all things.\nWhen spring’s breath unfurls, all grasses sprout;\nWhen autumn arrives, all treasures mature.\nMetal and stone cannot but resound—\nThey store Dao’s qi.\nAll things cannot but thrive—\nThis is their Way, is it not?\nCarving and shaping myriad forms, yet Dao does not contrive artifice.\n\nThe **Heavenly Gate**—it does not exist.\nAll things emerge from non-existence,\nAll things have being in birth,\nYet none see their root—\nThey emerge, yet none see their gate;\nThey are born, they die, they emerge, they return—\nEntering and exiting without revealing form—\nThis is called the **Heavenly Gate**.\n\nHeaven does not give birth, yet all things are nurtured;\nEarth does not grow, yet all things transform.\nHeaven and Earth act without action,\nYet all things act without fail.\nIt is Dao that generates all things.\n\nDao generates them,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Dao is that which nurtures and sustains growth.\nWithout generation or growth, all things could not flourish.\nTo generate and sustain—\nThis is called the **Great Dao** generating all things.\n\nVirtue/power nourishes them,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Virtue/power is that which nurtures and feeds.\nWithout nurturing or feeding, all things could not mature.\nTo nurture and feed—\nThis is called **Heaven’s virtue/power** sustaining all things.\n\nForm shapes them,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing*: Heaven’s movement through the four seasons, rain and dew descending in due time—this generates all things.\nMomentum completes them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Earth’s depth bears all things, containing and responding to their uses—this nourishes all things.\nThus, all things do not fail to revere Dao and honor virtue/power.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: That which gives birth to things is Dao.\nThat which sustains their growth is virtue/power.\nDao’s preservation of life, virtue/power’s securing of form—\nDao and virtue/power are the parent and mother of all things.\n\nDao is revered, virtue/power is honored,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Dao is what the people revere.\nVirtue/power is what the people honor.\nNone confer rank upon it,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: What the world reveres and ranks is Dao.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: Where Dao resides, the sage honors it—how dare any not revere it?\nYet it remains ever natural.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: The Way of Heaven and Earth—\nNone act upon it, yet it acts naturally.\n\nThus, Dao—\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Way is pattern, Earth’s Way is principle, yin and yang are the rhythms, the four seasons are the messengers. It is called Dao.\nSweet rains descend in season, the five grains flourish and multiply, and all things are born and completed.\nTo generate and nurture,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Spring generates all things.\nAll things are born at the spring equinox—\nTo generate and nurture.\nTo lengthen and cultivate,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Summer lengthens all things.\nAll things grow in full summer—\nTo lengthen and cultivate.\nTo complete and ripen,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Autumn harvests all things.\nAll things mature at the autumn equinox—\nTo complete and ripen.\nTo nourish and shelter,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Winter stores all things.\nTo gather and preserve without increasing wealth,\nTo distribute and receive without adding poverty—\nTo nourish and shelter.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: None are as divine as Heaven, none as abundant as Earth.\nThey nourish all things yet do not claim righteousness,\nTheir blessings extend to all ages yet they do not claim benevolence.\nThey give birth yet do not possess,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao generates things yet does not possess what it generates. None see its nurturing, yet all things grow—\nThis is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.\n\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have color have Dao coloring their colors.\nAll things colored by color reveal their hues,\nYet Dao colors all things’ colors without ever displaying its own hue—\nThis is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.\n\nIt acts yet does not rely,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao—\nAll things depend on it for their growth,\nYet none see what it grows—\nThis is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have sound have Dao sounding their sounds.\nAll things sounded by sound reveal their tones,\nYet Dao sounds all things’ sounds without ever emitting its own—\nThis is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.\n\nIt lengthens yet does not rule,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao transforms and completes without governing. None know its virtue/power—\nThis is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have taste have Dao tasting their tastes.\nAll things tasted by taste reveal their flavors,\nYet Dao tastes all things’ tastes without ever presenting its own—\nThis is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.\n\nThis is called **mysterious virtue/power**.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Dao can be yin, can be yang,\nCan be soft, can be hard,\nCan be short, can be long,\nCan be round, can be square,\nCan give birth, can die,\nCan bring heat, can bring cold,\nCan float, can sink,\nCan be high-pitched, can be low,\nCan emerge, can vanish,\nCan be dark, can be yellow,\nCan be sweet, can be bitter,\nCan be rancid, can be fragrant.\n\nThe Dao is without knowing, without ability—\nDao is without action, yet all things are without not-knowing, without not-ability, without not-action.\nThis is called **mysterious virtue/power**, the role of **effortless action**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of All Things**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:\nHeaven has six poles and five phases,\nYet governs without action.\nWhen emperors and kings follow without action, the realm is governed;\nWhen they oppose without action, disaster ensues.\n\nThe affairs of the Nine Regions,\nWhen governance is complete and virtue/power is full,\nOverseeing the common folk,\nThe realm bears them—\nThis is called the **Supreme Sage**.\n\nThe ancient rulers of the world,\nThough their wisdom rivaled Heaven and Earth,\nDid not ponder for themselves;\nThough their eloquence surpassed all things,\nThey did not boast for themselves;\nThough their abilities exhausted the land,\nThey did not act for themselves.\n\nHeaven does not produce yet all things transform,\nEarth does not grow yet all things nurture,\nThe emperor and king act without action yet the realm prospers,\nThe Sage follows the Dao without action yet the realm is governed.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Natural Section] says:\nThe world has a beginning,\nYet none know its principle—\nOnly the ancient Sage could know it.\nThus Heaven and Earth were completed,\nYin and Yang took form,\nAll things were born,\nAnd the Dao named them—\nWithout words, without deeds,\nThis is **effortless action**.\n\nThis is the **Mother of the World**.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Sincere Section] says:\nThe Son of Heaven takes Heaven and Earth as his standard,\nAll things as his resources,\nHis virtue and power being most sublime,\nHis prestige and name most weighty,\nThe beauty of these two virtues/powers matches Heaven and Earth—\nThus he cannot but follow the Great Dao as the **Mother of the World**.\n\nOnce he has obtained its Mother,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nHeaven and Earth act without action.\nYet he does not fail to act—\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nOnce he knows its children,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Great Dao acts without action yet without failing to act.\nReturning again to guard its Mother,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe Sage above guards without action while things transform effortlessly.\nHis body perishes yet he is not harmed—\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of effortless action is to discard cleverness,\nClose the four gates,\nCease the five passions,\nThus merging with the Dao.\nDivine clarity hides in the formless,\nSpirit merges with the True Dao,\nHis body perishes yet he is not harmed.\n\nSeal its **joy**,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient Sage of old followed the Great Dao without action,\nHis mouth open yet not speaking,\nHis heart clear yet not pondering or scheming,\nStraightforward in his natural emotions and wisdom—\nThus he could not be harmed.\nSo the essence remains in his mouth,\nHis speech is apt,\nGathers in his heart,\nHis thoughts are clear.\nMoving the world without action,\nHe does not speak yet is public,\nHe does not scheme yet is wise.\nClose its **gates**,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient Sage followed the Great Dao without action,\nHis ears keen yet not listening,\nHis eyes bright yet not seeing,\nForgotten yet not acting,\nWise yet not contriving—\nThus his essence remains in his ears,\nHis listening is keen,\nRemains in his eyes,\nHis seeing is bright.\nMoving the world without action,\nHe does not listen yet is keen,\nHe does not see yet is bright.\nThus his whole life is without toil—\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThus closing the four gates,\nHis whole life is without calamity,\nHis limbs and nine orifices do not generate desire or disease—\nThis is called the **True Person**.\n\nOpen its **joy**,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater generations, with partial enlightenment and contrived action,\nOpen their **joy**,\nSpeak with their mouths,\nScheme with their hearts,\nTwisting eloquence to sway the world—\nTheir ears and eyes, though keen and bright,\nDo not listen or see in accord with the Dao—\nThus their whole life is without salvation.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Sage’s Clarity**\nThis chapter of the *Dongling Jing* states:\nFrom the recent past to now,\nThe world’s deceitful and perverse are many,\nThe upright and honest are few,\nThe frivolous and licentious are many,\nThe virtuous and retiring are few.\n\n*(Note: \"兑\" [duì] was translated as \"joy\" in the previous section, but here it may also carry the connotations of \"mouth\" or \"open expression\" depending on context. For consistency, it is kept as \"joy\" in the first instance and \"gates\" in the second, where it aligns with the four gates [四关] mentioned earlier. \"九洛\" [Jiǔ Luò] and \"九窍\" [Jiǔ Qiào] are translated as \"Nine Regions\" and \"nine orifices\" respectively, following the previous context. \"九洛\" may also be interpreted as \"Nine Passes\" or \"Nine Rivers,\" but \"Nine Regions\" is retained for parallelism with the previous section.)*\n\nThe deceitful and perverse in speech deceive the loyal and upright,\nThus causing the people of the world to mutually indulge in licentiousness and corruption.\n\nIn ancient times, Heaven acted naturally and Earth remained tranquil,\nTen thousand things refined and transformed of their own accord—\nGhosts and spirits lacked efficacy.\n\nIn the latter age, the Son of Heaven is strange and eccentric,\nGreat ministers are bizarre and perverse—\nThen the arts of ghosts and spirits arise.\n\nWhen the spirits are enraged, it is not because they are not worshipped.\nWhen licentious rites prevail, the spirits grow ever angrier.\nWhen the people favor shortcuts, they turn to ghosts and spirits.\n\nLicentious rites pervade the world, corrupting customs and fostering omens of calamity—\nFamilies are ruined, livelihoods lost.\n\n*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*\nAs benevolence and righteousness decline, the people’s nature grows thin—\nThe Dao cannot prevail.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nIf one listens to wise counsel and acts accordingly,\nEven the foolish know to take joy in it.\nIf one praises the saintly virtue and noble conduct,\nEven the unworthy know to emulate it.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThose who delight in the Great Dao are many,\nYet those who practice it are few;\nThose who aspire to it are many,\nYet those who truly walk it are few.\nOnly the wise fear this.\n\n*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*\nIf the Dao does not prevail,\nA single kingdom may yet endure as in years past—\nBut how can the world and future generations endure?\n\nThe Great Dao is most simple,\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe Great Dao is broad and easy—\nIt lies not far from the self.\nSeek it near, yet return empty-handed.\nThe people love shortcuts.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe people greatly favor perverse shortcuts,\nTurning to ghosts and spirits.\nLicentious rites prevail, the spirits grow ever angrier.\n\n*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*\nThe foundation of governance lies in securing the people.\nIf the times are not oppressive,\nYet one seizes upon laborious projects—\nThis is called great calamity.\n\n*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*\nQi and Lu abound in ingenuity,\nWith skilled artisans in earth and wood.\n\n*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*\nFields lie overgrown—\nPeople abandon essential pursuits for trivial ones.\n\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings governed by first attending to agriculture.\nWhen the people tilled the land, they were simple,\nAnd simplicity made them easy to guide—\nThus the borders were secure.\n\nWhen the people turned to farming, they became youthful,\nYouthful, they held less to private affection and more to public law.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* discusses the laws of Shennong:*\nIf men of prime strength do not plow,\nThere will be those who starve in the world;\nIf women of childbearing age do not weave,\nThere will be those who freeze in the world.\nThus the Emperor himself plowed,\nAnd the Empress herself wove—\nSetting an example for the world.\n\nTherefore, those who till do not toil excessively,\nFor they have no means to sustain life;\nThose who weave do not labor excessively,\nFor they have no means to clothe the body.\nWhen food and clothing are abundant,\nDeceit and perversity do not arise.\n\nTo preserve the essentials of the seasons,\nOne must reduce unnecessary pursuits.\n*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*\nAgriculture yields food, artisans yield tools, merchants yield goods—\nGrain is the people’s Heaven.\nThus, when a sage-king arises, he prioritizes agriculture.\nIf a king does not prioritize agriculture,\nHe abandons the people—\nWhat kingdom can he then rule?\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe sage-king enriches his people,\nThe conqueror enriches his land,\nThe endangered state enriches its historians,\nThe well-governed state finds sufficiency,\nThe doomed state suffers from empty granaries—\nThus it is said: *When the ruler has no burdens, the people prosper naturally.*\n\nThe foundation of sufficiency lies in not seizing the seasons.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) states:*\nIn the latter age, what the people delight in\nAre fine garments and beautiful colors,\nWhich confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—\nThis is called chaos.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nTo teach the people’s customs,\nClothing should be plain, belts simple—\nModest and unadorned.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) recounts how Zhuangzi admonished King Zhao of Yan for his love of swords:*\nZhuangzi said: *I have three swords—\nOne for the Son of Heaven, one for the feudal lords, one for the commoner.*\nThe king said: *I wish to hear of these three swords.*\nZhuangzi replied: *There is the sword of the Son of Heaven,\nThe sword of the feudal lords,\nAnd the sword of the commoner.*\n*Now, Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven,\nYet you delight in the sword of the commoner—\nI humbly fear this for Your Majesty.*\nThe king then had the swords drawn and presented to him,\nAnd the royal attendants served him food three times.\nZhuangzi said: *Your Majesty, remain seated and composed—\nThe matter of the swords is now complete.*\nThus, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months,\nAnd all the swordsmasters perished in their homes.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nIn the latter age, what the people delight in\nAre rich flavors and music,\nWhich confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—\nThis is called chaos.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nTo hoard wealth and take comfort in it,\nTo covet power and exhaust it,\nTo accumulate goods and seek profit—\nThis is called thievish arrogance.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nAll these seven evils\nAre the world’s greatest harms.\nYet people forget them and fail to discern—\nTheir desires sever from their bodies, yet they still covet—\nIs this not delusion?\n\n*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*\nWhen teaching is clear above and transformation spreads below,\nThe people have a sense of shame—\nWhy would there be thieves?\nThus, when governance aligns with the natural order,\nBandits flee and hide.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe foundation of pure transformation lies in rejecting artifice.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nCunning, extravagance, and superficiality\nAre insufficient to stabilize the world—\nThis is not the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Unshakable Builder**\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* records Wenzi asking:*\nMaster, your words say that without virtue and the Dao,\nOne cannot govern the world.\nYet in ancient times, kings inherited their predecessors’ legacies—\nSome ruled without virtue, yet their ages endured without calamity.\nHow is this possible?\n\nLaozi replied:\nFrom the Son of Heaven down to the commoner,\nEach lives their own life—\nYet life varies in depth.\nThe world at times sees ruined families and fallen states,\nAll due to the absence of virtue and the Dao.\n\nIf one remains ever vigilant, day and night,\nStriving with fear and caution,\nGuarding diligently without fail—\nThen disaster is averted.\n\nBut if one indulges in desires and neglects duty,\nUnable to guard diligently,\nThen ruin comes without warning.\n\nIf Jie and Zhou had followed the Dao and cultivated virtue,\nEven if Tang and Wu were wise,\nThey would have had no means to establish their deeds.\n\nIn ancient times, those who built well were unshaken,\nThose who guarded well were unlost—\nThus their descendants continued sacrifices without interruption,\nTheir virtue never severed,\nAnd the world endured for generations.\n\nThose who build well are unshaken—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: In ancient times, those who built well were unshaken,\nMeaning that the cultivation of virtue in building was without action or favor,\nAnd they upheld modesty and frugality.\n\n*The Scripture of the Numinous Spirit* says: King Wen acted with tranquility in advance and retreat,\nAnd Heaven would surely assist him—\nHis fortune was divined as lasting thirty generations.\n\nThose who embrace well are not abandoned—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: In ancient times, the sage-kings dwelled in great fullness yet did not overflow,\nAnd in lofty nobility yet did not grow proud.\nDwelling in great fullness yet not overflowing,\nThis is how they long preserved their wealth;\nResiding in lofty nobility yet not growing proud,\nThis is how they long preserved their honor.\n\n*The Scripture of the Numinous Spirit* says: The virtue of King Wen was such that Jie could not harm it.\nHis longevity was foretold in dreams—\nSeven hundred years, a command from Heaven.\nThus his descendants continued sacrifices without interruption.\n\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: Riches and honor never depart from their person,\nAnd blessings extend to their offspring—\nThis was indeed the ancient royal Dao.\nCultivate it in oneself, and its virtue becomes true;\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Subtle Clarity*] says:\nCommoners and scholars alike, if they follow the Dao,\nWill preserve their own lives—\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in oneself,\nAnd its virtue becomes true.\n\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nIn antiquity, the five offices fulfilled their distinct duties,\nAnd commoners governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—\nThis was the beauty of governance.\n\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes abundant;\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, great officials with the Dao\nDid not lose their families—\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the family,\nAnd its virtue becomes abundant.\n\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nGreat officials governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—\nThis was the beauty of governance.\n\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes enduring;\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, prefects and counties with the Dao\nDid not lose their villages—\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the village,\nAnd its virtue becomes enduring.\n\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes plentiful;\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the feudal lords with the Dao\nDid not lose their states—\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the state,\nAnd its virtue becomes plentiful.\n\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nFeudal lords governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—\nThis was the beauty of governance.\n\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the Son of Heaven with the Dao\nLong held dominion over the world—\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the world,\nAnd its virtue becomes universal.\n\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nThe Son of Heaven governed himself and cultivated his virtue—\nThis was the beauty of governance.\n\nThus, observe oneself with oneself—\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nIn the latter ages, if the five do not cultivate,\nNo greater loss can there be.\nCommoners not cultivating, lose their own lives.\nObserve the family with the family—\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nGreat officials not cultivating, lose their families.\nObserve the village with the village—\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nPrefects and counties not cultivating, lose their villages.\nObserve the state with the state—\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nFeudal lords not cultivating, lose their states.\nObserve the world with the world—\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nThe Son of Heaven not cultivating, loses his world.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nNot losing the root of the state lies in the virtue of guarding well—\nThose who do not increase its substance yet expand its reach are ruined,\nThose who do not broaden its foundation yet raise its height are overturned.\n\nNo burden is heavier than the beams,\nNo governance of the state is heavier than virtue.\n\n*The Chapter of Embracing Virtue’s Depth* [This chapter, *The Scripture of the South Flowering* [*The Chapter of the Horse’s Hoof*], says:]\nIn the upper antiquity, the age of the Perfected Dao and Supreme Virtue,\nIts people were like infants, pure as newborns.\nTheir actions were simple and unadorned,\nThey did not know east or west;\nTheir vision was unclouded,\nThey did not know darkness or light.\n\nIn that time, birds and beasts gathered in flocks,\nGrasses and trees grew in abundance—\nThus, birds and beasts could be tethered and led about,\nYet they did not harm people;\nThe nests of crows and magpies could be climbed and observed,\nYet they did not injure people.\n\nBeasts could not prey upon them,\nNot because their virtue was thin—\nRather, they discerned safety and danger,\nSettled in peace with calamity and fortune,\nAnd were cautious in their choices—\nNone could harm them,\nFor this was the result of embracing virtue.\n\n*The Scripture of the Void and the Primordial* says:\nIn the age of the Great Beginning,\nBirds and beasts dwelled with humans,\nAnd moved alongside them.\nIn the time of the Five Emperors and Three Kings,\nBirds and beasts began to scatter in alarm.\n\nBy the latter ages,\nBirds and beasts hid and fled, escaping their hardships.\n\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn the latter ages, the Dao declines and virtue thins—\nHumans become the robbers,\nAnd birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all harm people—\nThus, iron is cast and blades are forged to repel their dangers.\n\nIn the upper antiquity, virtue was profound,\nTheir nature was like that of a newborn babe—\nWithout the hearts of harm or gain,\nThey were simple and long-lived.\n\nThe depth of embracing virtue—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the treatment of the Perfected Ones\nWas to embrace virtue and hold the Dao,\nTo be serene and content without arrogance,\nAnd thus attain harmony—\nRobbers and thieves did not act,\nFor this was the result of embracing virtue.\n\n*The Scripture of the Void and the Primordial* says:\nEmbrace their virtue, and they harmonize with all things created.\nLike a newborn babe—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the age of supreme virtue,\nIts people were like infants, pure as those three months old,\nUnknowing of harm or gain—\nRobbers and thieves did not act,\nFor this was the governance of embracing virtue.\n\n*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:\nDoes the *Scripture of Vitality* teach the art of longevity?\nAll day long they move, yet do not know where they go,\nThey dwell, yet do not know what they do—\nTheir bodies are like withered branches of wood.\nIf such is their state,\nThen calamity will not come,\nNor fortune arrive—\nCalamity and fortune are nonexistent,\nFor evil men and malevolent things cannot harm them.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Pure Sincerity*] says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,\nHis virtue gave life yet did not kill.\nAt that time, even venomous serpents\nHeld their tail-poisons in concealment,\nAnd their sting-poisons were hidden—\nThey did not bite people,\nFor this was the result of embracing virtue.\n\nFierce beasts did not attack—\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,\nHis virtue gave life yet did not kill.\nAt that time, even fierce beasts\nHad their claws and teeth—\nYet the herds of running beasts could be tethered and led,\nAnd they did not harm people,\nFor this was the result of embracing virtue.\n\nBirds of prey did not strike.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,\nHis virtue gave life yet did not kill.\nAt that time, even birds and beasts had their claws and talons—\nYet the nests of flying birds could be approached and explored,\nAnd they did not harm people,\nFor this was the result of embracing virtue.\n\nBones were weak, sinews supple, yet their grasp was firm.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe child held all day, yet his hands did not tire,\nHis virtue was one—\nHe gazed all day, yet his eyes did not strain,\nFor his mind was not outward.\nThis was the virtue of the Perfect Man.\n\nUnknowing of male and female union yet life arose—\nThe essence was supreme.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe child moved without purpose,\nHis body like a withered tree’s branch,\nHis heart like dead ashes—\nThis was the essence supreme.\n\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nThe infant brother’s wholeness.\n\nCrying all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse—\nHarmony was supreme.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe child cried all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse,\nFor harmony was supreme.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Lower Virtue*] says:\nIn the ancient times, life was cherished,\nLife was valued above gain—\nNo harm came to the spirit,\nAnd longevity was granted.\nThus it is said: To know harmony is to know constancy.\n\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn ancient times, the infant’s nature was pure,\nQi focused, will unified—\nThis was harmony supreme.\nNothing injured it,\nNo virtue surpassed it.\n\nTo know constancy is to know clarity.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nLater generations valued gain above life,\nThis is called excessive harm.\nThose who harm themselves thus have no longevity.\nThus it is said: To know constancy is to know clarity.\n\nTo benefit life is auspicious.\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn their youth, they were delicate and skilled,\nTheir fame and reputation were exaggerated in the world.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nTo benefit life is auspicious.\n\nTo let the heart command qi is strength.\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn their youthful vigor, blood and qi overflowed,\nDesires and thoughts filled them,\nThey were assailed by external things,\nAnd their virtue thus declined.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nTo let the heart command qi is strength.\n\nWhen things are strong, they age.\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn their old age, desires and thoughts grew soft,\nTheir bodies neared rest,\nNothing could precede them.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe spirit, will, and qi—\nWhen still, they grow daily stronger;\nWhen agitated, they waste and age.\nThis is called *not-Dao*.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nSome die young, not by fate but by self-harm,\nNeglecting their bodies, letting illness kill them.\nOnly the tranquil and content can manifest virtue,\nThus, to act against the Dao is not virtue,\nAnd none can endure long—\nThe world has none who live long against the Dao.\nNot-Dao brings early death.\nNot-Dao brings early death.\n\n*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn death, they return to stillness,\nAnd return to their origin.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Silent Sage**\nThis chapter of *The South华 Scripture* speaks:\nThe ancient Dao and virtue were obscured by those who followed the various schools,\nThe Nine Flows heard their heterodox winds and rejoiced in them,\nUsing rigid rules to correct themselves,\nTo address the world’s urgencies,\nThey destroyed the ancient Dao and virtue,\nAnd did not align with the former kings.\n\nTo govern the world and nourish the people—\nWhat is this different from tending horses?\nOne removes only what harms the horses,\nAnd those who harm the people.\n\nThe wise scholar without thought and contemplation is not content,\nThe eloquent scholar without discourse is not content,\nThe discerning scholar without judgment is not content—\nAll are constrained by things,\nAnd have lost their Dao.\n\nThose who attract the world’s favor rise in court,\nThe common scholars are honored in the halls,\nThe strong are praised for their strength,\nThe brave are celebrated for their daring,\nThe martial are delighted in war,\nThe ascetics cherish their names,\nThe legalists expand their governance,\nThe ritualists respect their forms,\nThe benevolent are esteemed for their connections.\n\nWithout accumulated wealth, the greedy grieve,\nWithout unrivaled power, the ambitious sorrow—\nThose who rely on external things\nTake pleasure in change and opportunity,\nAnd cannot avoid causing harm.\nThe Nine Flows obstruct the Dao,\nAnd learning becomes chaotic.\n\nThe sage does not speak.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe ancient scholars did nothing, thought nothing, contemplated nothing,\nAnd thus came to know the Dao.\nThe sage does not speak.\nThose who speak do not know.\n\nTo block the mouth,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Lower Virtue*] says:\nThe ancient scholars blocked their mouths,\nTheir speech was cautious,\nGreat eloquence seemed stammering.\n\nTo close the gate,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient scholars closed their gates,\nSilent yet wise,\nGreat skill seemed clumsy.\n\nTo blunt the sharp,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient scholars blunted the sharp,\nAbandoning vigor and ambition,\nNo weapons were needed.\n\nTo resolve the tangled,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient scholars resolved the tangled,\nThere was no strife or disorder,\nAnd the world was at peace.\n\nTo harmonize their light,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient scholars harmonized their light,\nThere was no resentment or defiance.\n\nTo blend with the dust,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient scholars blended with the dust,\nThere was no contention or grievance.\nThis is called *Mystic Unity*.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nYan Hui said:\nTo abandon limbs and senses,\nTo discard form and wisdom,\nTo merge with the Great Communion—\nThis is called *Sitting-Forgetting*.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nAll things are mystically unified,\nNeither this nor that.\n\nThus it cannot be approached or avoided,\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe benevolent are esteemed for their connections,\nThe discerning scholar without judgment is not content.\n\nIt cannot be distanced or drawn near,\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe ritualists respect their forms,\nThe wise scholar without thought is not content.\n\nIt cannot be used for gain,\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe eloquent scholar without discourse is not content.\n\n《The Scripture of Perfected Mystery》 says:\nThe resentful are contrary to *virtue/power*.\nStrife is the source of human disorder.\nTo employ dark schemes contrary to *virtue/power* to suppress human disorder is the height of perversity.\nOne cannot bring calamity upon others unless they are already calamitous.\nIt cannot be used to cause harm;\n\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe bold and courageous delight in slaughter,\nThe martial scholars delight in war.\n\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nWeapons are cruel instruments.\nTo delight in using cruel instruments to suppress human disorder is the height of perversity.\nOne cannot bring calamity upon others unless they are already calamitous.\n\nIt cannot be esteemed for its own sake;\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThe noble do not take honor as their ease,\nNor rely on power to be revered.\n\nWithout glorying in *Mystic Unity*,\nThere is no *Daoist* resentment from Heaven.\nWithout being held in contempt,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nOne need not depend on wealth to be rich,\nNor fear disgrace as perilous.\n\nWithout being shamed by poverty,\nThere is no human censure.\nThus, one is held in highest esteem by the world.\n\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nIn ancient times, the sudden outburst of ambition was condemned.\nHonor, wealth, high rank, splendid appearance, fame, and profit—\nThese six things are the sudden outburst of ambition.\nIf the heart remains unmoved,\nThen one is upright.\nBeing upright,\nOne attains emptiness, tranquility, and non-action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\n*The Collected Commentaries on the Four Children of the Daoist True Scripture* concludes Volume Seven,\nBegins Volume Eight.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seventh: Governing by the Dao**\n\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* speaks:\nIn the Spring and Autumn era, the Warring States’ ambition gave rise to cunning and deceit, while theft and banditry flourished. The ruler and ruled harbored mutual resentment, and decrees failed to take hold.\n\nWhen waters grow turbid, fish scatter;\nWhen governance grows harsh, the people rebel.\nExcessive prohibitions breed defiance below,\nExcessive demands spawn contention.\nThus, applying the remedy of boiling water to boiling water only intensifies the heat—\nOne who understands *wuwei* as the foundation of governance knows to remove the fire itself.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves.\"*\n\nThe Five Hegemons’ reliance on arms and punishments bred bandits and chaos.\n\n**Governing by the Dao,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* (□ *On Rites Above*) states:\nTo govern by the Dao, first establish policies that cannot be overcome,\nThen seek victory over adversaries.\nTo attack a disordered state before it is pacified\nIs like responding to fire with fire or water with water—\nOpposites cannot govern one another;\nThis is called *increasing disorder*.\n\n**Employing the Unconventional in Warfare,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nTo employ the unconventional in warfare,\nOne must make the strange appear strange.\nThe unconventional in stillness appears agitated,\nThe unconventional in order appears chaotic,\nThe unconventional in abundance appears starved,\nThe unconventional in ease appears labored.\n\nThe interplay of the unconventional and the conventional\nIs like the clash of water, fire, metal, and wood—\nWherever it turns, it prevails.\n\n**Conquering the World Without Conflict,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sage-rulers conquered the world without conflict.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nExcessive affairs are difficult to govern,\nHarsh laws are difficult to enforce.\nWhen taboos proliferate,\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nWhen customs overflow with taboos,\nEmotions stagnate, and the world grows rigid;\nWhen customs lack taboos,\nSuppression and release flow freely, and joyous communication thrives.\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\n\nWhen sharp weapons abound,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nHeavy armor and sharp blades cannot be relied upon for strength.\nWhen the state grows ever more corrupt,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nWhen rulers favor martial prowess and incite the people to contention,\nThe state faces endless calamity, and rebellion will surely follow.\n\nWhen cunning and skill proliferate,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nWhen cleverness and ingenuity flourish, strange things arise.\n*The South华 Scripture* says:\nThose who excel in cleverness, wisdom, and saintly virtue—\nI alone consider myself lost among them.\nWhen those who rely on cunning to overcome strength become too numerous,\nExcessive precision will inevitably breed unworthy hearts in response,\nYet they remain unaware.\n\nWhen laws and decrees multiply,\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe art of governance lies not in eloquence.\nWhen laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits thrive.\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nCunning and deceit take root, and banditry spreads.\nThus the sages say:\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nLaws may kill the unfilial, yet cannot make one filial;\nPunishments may deter thieves, yet cannot instill honesty.\nIn the latter ages, when the world fears punishment and dares not steal—\nIs this not inferior to the ancient purity where no thief’s heart arose?\nThus, applying the remedy of boiling water to boiling water only intensifies the heat—\nOne who understands *wuwei* as the foundation of governance knows to remove the fire itself.\n\nTherefore the sages say:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n*\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves,\"*\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* (□ *On the Origin of the Dao*) says:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves,\nThus the ruler practices non-action, and the people transform themselves.\"*\n\n*\"I engage in no affairs, yet the people grow rich,\"*\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\n*\"I engage in no affairs, yet the people grow rich,\nThus the ruler engages in no affairs, and the people grow rich.\"*\n\n*\"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves,\"*\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\n*\"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves,\nThus the ruler cherishes stillness, and the people align themselves.\"*\n\n*\"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\n*\"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity,\nThus the ruler desires nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eighth: The Obscure Governance**\n\nThis chapter, from *The South华 Scripture* (□ *On the Redundant Thumb*), speaks:\nSince the Three Sovereigns, how have the world’s rituals of benevolence and righteousness, its rules and measures, its hooks and cords, become so clamorous?\nThey carve and polish what is naturally upright in humanity.\n\nMoreover, the Three Sovereigns relied on hooks and cords, rules and measures, to straighten what was already straight—\nThis was to chisel away at their natural uprightness.\nThey bound with cords and sealed with glue to solidify what was already firm—\nThis was to encroach upon their innate virtue.\n\nThey bent and folded rites and music,\nThey stifled and smothered benevolence and righteousness,\nTo pacify the world’s hearts—\nThis was to lose their natural order.\n\nWhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary;\nIn ancient times, the world had its natural order:\nThe crooked were not straightened with hooks,\nThe straight were not measured with cords,\nThe round were not circumscribed with compasses,\nThe square were not checked with rulers,\nThe separated were not glued together,\nThe bound were not restrained with ropes.\n\nThus the world spontaneously gave birth to all things, yet knew not how it came to be;\nAll things naturally attained their place, yet knew not how it happened.\n\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure.\nThis principle is unchanging from ancient to modern—\nIt cannot be diminished.\nThen why do benevolence and righteousness cling so tightly,\nLike glue and cords, to wander between virtue and the Dao?\n\nIf governance is overly analytical,\nIt is like recklessly digging through walls to cultivate weeds—\nLaboring without fruit.\n\nThe hair was simply unbound and combed,\nThe rice was merely counted and cooked—\nYet how could such modest means suffice to save the world?\n\nThe Three Sovereigns governed by discerning the people’s hardships.\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* (上礼篇) says:\nThe waters of Ying are ten *ren* deep, yet they do not receive filth.\nJade and stone within reveal their forms without—\nNot because they are not thick or clear,\nBut fish, turtles, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there.\nNo grains grow upon barren stone,\nNo deer roam the bald mountains—\nFor there is no shelter or refuge.\n\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure.\nWhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nLater rulers govern with severity as discernment,\nWith harshness as clarity,\nWith cruelty as loyalty,\nWith scheming as merit.\nSuch rulers are like broad leather—\nThe wider they stretch, the more they tear.\n\nWhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\nCalamity is the reverse of fortune.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nBenefit and harm share a gate,\nCalamity and fortune share a neighbor.\nThus it is said: Calamity is the reverse of fortune,\nFortune is the reverse of calamity.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns’ wisdom was shallow,\nThen they relied on scrutiny.\nThose who rely on scrutiny\nTake the good from below to serve above, yet are deceived.\nTo scrutinize the traces of blades and brushes—\nThey know not the Way of *wuwei*,\nThey know the roots of chaos.\nTo be scrutinizing brings chaos,\nCorrupts customs,\nAnd breeds the winds of ruined states.\nWho knows its ultimate end?\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nCalamity, fortune, benefit, harm—\nNone but the ancient sages could truly distinguish them.\nThus it is said: Who knows its ultimate end?\nIs there no right or wrong?\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients governed with righteousness and transformed with ease—\nLater ages govern with deceit, and though difficult, they fail.\nThe right becomes the strange,\n*The *Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nIn recent times, upright men are few.\nWhen governance is simple, the people are pure and honest,\nThe common folk are virtuous—\nThey can be transformed, not punished.\nThe good becomes the monstrous.\n*The *Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nIn recent times, the wicked are many.\nWhen governance is burdensome and harsh, the people become deceitful.\nTo blame the many for their deceit—\nShould you not first examine your own rectitude?\nThe people’s confusion has long endured.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nLater ages take petty acts of benevolence and righteousness as their measure,\nYet those who know how to use hooks, cords, compasses, and rulers can govern men—\nWithout these tools, one cannot establish the square or round,\nWithout hooks and cords, one cannot straighten the crooked.\nIf the ruler relies on these tools,\nThe people below also harbor such scheming hearts—\nThey are clever devices, yet not the means to govern.\n\nThus the sage\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nMurky waters choke the fish,\nHarsh governance breeds chaos in the people.\nWhen the ruler’s desires multiply, the people’s deceit multiplies,\nWhen the ruler is troubled, the people become unsettled.\nNot knowing the root of *wuwei* for one person,\nThey seek to remedy it with the superficial laws of governance—\nHow different is this from digging canals to stop the flow of water,\nOr embracing firewood to extinguish flames,\nYet calling it an increase?\nThus, to stop the boiling with a ladle only makes it worse—\nHe who knows the true method of governance removes the fire itself.\n\nTherefore the sage governs with simplicity and achieves order,\nSeeks few things and finds abundance,\nFor what he cultivates is the root.\n\nSquare yet not cutting,\nModest yet not stingy,\nStraight yet not domineering,\nBrilliant yet not dazzling—\nThese four, truly cultivated, are the Way of proper governance.\n\nSquare yet not cutting,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* (道德篇) says:\nThe ancients governed with the Dao—\nSquare yet not cutting, and the people naturally conform.\n*The *South Flower Sutra* says:\nThe ancients had the constant Way—\nThe square was not measured with a ruler.\n\nModest yet not stingy,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients nourished with virtue—\nModest yet not stingy, and the people submit.\n*The *South Flower Sutra* says:\nThe ancients had the constant Way—\nThe round was not circumscribed with a compass.\n\nStraight yet not domineering,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nWithout adding force,\nStraight yet not domineering, and the people suffice in frugality.\n*The *South Flower Sutra* says:\nThe ancients had the constant Way—\nThe crooked were not straightened with hooks,\nThe straight were not measured with cords.\n\nBrilliant yet not dazzling.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nWithout displaying virtue,\nBrilliant yet not dazzling, and the people remain pure and honest.\n*The *South Flower Sutra* says:\nThe ancient sages did not ponder or premeditate,\nThey shone yet did not dazzle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing Men and Serving Heaven**\nThis chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks:\nThough noble as the Son of Heaven, they did not use their nobility to domineer over others;\nThough wealthy with all under heaven, they did not use their riches to mock others.\nRich and noble yet frugal—\nThis is truly virtue.\nWhen the people are frugal, the state endures.\n\nGoverning men and serving Heaven,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ruler’s relation to the people is like the foundation to a city.\nA thick foundation makes the city firm,\nA wealthy people make the state prosperous.\nNone surpass frugality.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages governed with the Dao—\nFrugality and modesty were seen as scarcity,\nFor seeing scarcity, they could achieve abundance,\nThus enduring long.\n\nOnly frugality,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ruler’s Way lies in frugality to preserve life—\nThis is called early cultivation of virtue.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nFrugality prevents the people from hunger.\nEarly cultivation is called accumulating virtue—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nAccumulating virtue makes kingship,\nAccumulating stones makes mountains,\nAccumulating water makes rivers.\nWithout accumulation, nothing is achieved.\nAccumulating virtue without limit,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe skilled ruler accumulates virtue,\nAnd the people can be employed.\nWithout limit, none know its end,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages dared not indulge in extravagance,\nGuarding frugality, thus enduring long.\nNone know its end—this is how one establishes a state.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages did not dare to be extravagant or arrogant,\nGuarding frugality, thus enduring long.\n\nThe mother of a lasting state—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe people are the root of a state.\nFrugality is the foundation of humanity.\nThis is called deep-rooted and firmly anchored—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ruler’s possession of the people is like a tree’s possession of its roots.\nThe greater the tree, the deeper its roots and the firmer its trunk.\nThis is the Dao of enduring life and long reign.\n\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe people are the root and foundation,\nThe state is the branches and leaves.\nWhen the root and foundation are deep and robust,\nThe branches and leaves flourish and excel.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**\nThis chapter from *The South华经* speaks:\n*My teacher!* *My teacher!*\nHe nourishes all things without excess,\nHis blessings extend to all ages without partiality,\nHis life surpasses the ancient sages without boasting of longevity,\nHe encompasses heaven and earth,\nMolds myriad forms without artifice—\nThis is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.\n\nThe ancient sages who understood *Heaven’s Harmony*\nHad no celestial grievance,\nNo human censure,\nNo burden from things,\nNo reproach from spirits.\n\nThe Dao does not harm the people,\nAnd the world finds harmony and joy,\nIn accord with the people’s harmony.\n\nGoverning great states—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancient sages were clear in the virtue/power of heaven and earth’s non-action,\nThis is called the great lineage, the great root,\nRooted in the Dao,\nIn harmony with heaven.\n\nIn harmony with heaven—\nThis is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.\nThus, those who know *Heaven’s Harmony*\nHave no celestial grievance.\n\nIf one cooks a small delicacy—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe sages’ non-action\nBalances and harmonizes the world,\nIn accord with humanity—\nThis is called *The People’s Harmony*.\nThus, those who know *The People’s Harmony*\nHave no human censure.\n\nWith the Dao to govern the world—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancient sages’ life was in accord with heaven’s movement,\nTheir death was in accord with nature’s transformation.\nIn stillness, they aligned with the yin’s virtue/power,\nIn motion, they rode the waves of the yang—\nThis is called *in harmony with heaven*.\n*In harmony with heaven*—\nThis is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.\nThus, those who know *Heaven’s Harmony*\nHave no burden from things.\n\nTheir spirits are not numinous—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancient sages—\nIn action, they were heaven,\nIn stillness, they were earth.\nWith a single, steadfast heart, they ruled the world,\nTheir spirits did not vex,\nTheir souls did not weary,\nWith a single, steadfast heart, all things submitted—\nThis is called *in accord with humanity*.\n*In accord with humanity*—\nThis is called *The People’s Harmony*.\nThus, those who know *The People’s Harmony*\nHave no reproach from spirits.\n\nIt is not that their spirits are not numinous—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancient sages spoke of emptiness and stillness,\nExtending it to heaven and earth,\nPermeating all things—\nThis is called *Heaven’s Harmony*,\n*In harmony with heaven*.\nTheir numinous transformations did not harm the people—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* [□ *Precision of Sincerity*] says:\nThe highest numinous transformations,\nThe people have no complaint.\nYet when numinous transformations have complaint—\nIt is not that their numinous transformations harm the people—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe numinous transformations of the wordless Dao\nCarry all without complaint,\nNot harming the numinous nature of those who possess the Dao’s spirit.\nThe sages also do not harm the people.\n\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe people are governed without action,\nAction brings harm.\nGoverning without action—\nThe two do not harm each other,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThose who act\nCannot truly be without action,\nThose who cannot be without action\nCannot truly act—\nThis harms the people.\nThus, virtue/power returns to its source.\n\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages who knew *Heaven’s Harmony*\nWith a single, steadfast heart\nNourished the world without action—\nAnd the world found harmony and joy.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**\nThis chapter from *The Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* speaks:\nIn the Warring States era, the public lords and marquises treated a single state as their own,\nTheir *qi* was abundant yet their resolve was strong,\nThe powerful used arms to invade the weak,\nThe weak defied and undermined the strong,\nClinging to their weapons with rigid resolve,\nCreating strife and fostering resentment,\nFor long they did not achieve harmony—\nAnd the world fell into great disorder.\n\nThus, when states are bound in harmony and stillness,\nAnd arms are laid down without contention,\nThe world attains great peace.\n\nGreat states are the lowly flow of the world—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nHence, the Dao does not triumph through rigid strength,\nNor does it gain through greedy competition.\nVictory lies in the world’s spontaneous submission,\nGain lies in the world’s accord with you.\nSoftness and weakness bring victory,\nRen and righteousness bring gain.\nThe world’s receptive feminine—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages acted as the world’s receptive feminine,\nThus they could endure long.\n\nThe receptive feminine constantly triumphs through stillness over the masculine—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe Dao of victory through arms\nAwaits disorder with governance,\nAwaits motion with stillness,\nAwaits the masculine with the receptive feminine—\nOne must not act first.\nStillness is the lowly way—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThus the sages grasp the feminine and receptive,\nAnd so can establish their masculine and strong.\nAdvancing with the receptive feminine,\nTheir virtue/power and deeds do not decline—\nThis is the way of heaven.\n\nGuard the Dao of stillness,\nRestrain the feminine’s resolve,\nWith softness and weakness, find peace in stillness.\nThus, great states submit to small states and take them—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nTo govern with greatness over smallness,\nThis is called *altering humanity*.\nSmall states submit to great states and take them—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nTo offend with smallness against greatness,\nThis is called *defying heaven*.\n\nThus, sometimes one submits to take—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe small and weak have the Dao,\nThey gain without contention.\nSometimes one submits and takes—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe strong and great have the Dao,\nThey conquer without battle.\n\nGreat states seek only to nurture and embrace others—\n*The *Vacuous and Pure Communiqué* says:\nSmall states I will cherish,\nIf they rely on arms and authority,\nTheir extinction is imminent.\n\nSmall states seek only to serve others—\n*The *Vacuous and Pure Communiqué* says:\nGreat states I will serve—\nThis is the path to seeking peace.\nBoth find what they desire—\n*The *South华经* says:\n\nTo renew the world, to disband armies and rest the soldiers,\nto cherish and nourish all kin,\nand to share in ancestral sacrifices—\nthis is the conduct of the Sage and worthy scholar,\nand the longing of all under heaven.\n\nThus, the great should act as the humble.\n\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe Sages of ancient times, who were lowly, modest, and pure,\nsaw what was beneath them.\nBy seeing what was beneath them, they could uphold their loftiness,\nwhile the proud could not stand.\nThe Dao/Way is the deepest mystery of all things—**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nThis chapter of *The South华经* speaks: The governance of the ancient Sages\nwas always external before internal.\nWithout action, they were clear and tranquil,\nthey aligned themselves and then acted,\nand firmly accomplished their tasks—\nthat was all.\n\nLater generations of rulers\nestablished laws and standards by which to judge others,\nwho dared not disobey and thus transform themselves—\nthis was to deceive virtue/power.\n\nIn governing the world,\nit is like crossing the sea or digging rivers\nand commanding mosquitoes to carry mountains—\nlaboring without gain,\nnot as good as the Three Sovereigns* following the Way of non-action,\nwhich governs without labor.\nAdvancing the Dao/Way requires no labor.\n\nThe Dao/Way,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\ngives birth to all things,\nrests in yin and yang,\ntransforms into the four seasons,\ndivides into the five phases,*\nand each finds its place—\nthis is called the Dao/Way.\nThe deepest mystery of all things,\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe Dao/Way is the source from which all things arise.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\n*The *South华经* says:\nMoreover, the Dao/Way—\nthose who lose it perish,\nthose who act against it fail.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nNothing is easier under heaven than doing good.\nWhat is called doing good\nis to remain still and without action,\nto follow one’s nature and discard excess,\nto avoid all enticements and temptations,\nto follow one’s nature and preserve truth,\nto undergo no change within oneself—\nthus, doing good is easy.\n\nThe safeguard of the unvirtuous,\n*The *South华经* says:\nMoreover, the Dao/Way—\nthose who lose it die,\nthose who act against it fail.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nNothing is harder under heaven than doing evil.\nWhat is called doing evil\nis to be turbulent, obscuring, and deceitful,\nto be restless and greedy,\ncontrary to human nature—\nthus, it is said that doing evil is hard.\n\nPersuasive words can be sold,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nFirst teach with the Dao/Way,\nthen guide with virtue/power,\nto entice the good.\nNoble conduct can elevate others.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nIf simple exhortation is not heeded,\nthen apply authority and punishment.\nWhy should the unvirtuous be abandoned?\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nWith such strict warnings,\nhow could there be any unvirtuous?\n\nHumans do not abandon humans,\nthings do not abandon things.\nThus, establishing the Son of Heaven,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients established the Son of Heaven\nto uphold the Dao/Way of governing the world,\nto return to the root of non-action,\nand to transform through emptiness and tranquility.\n\nThe ancients did not establish emperors and kings\nto indulge their desires,\nnor did the Sages ascend the throne\nto enjoy leisure at their ease.\nThey made the world’s people strong to protect the weak,\nmany to guard the few,\nthe cunning to deceive the simple,\nthe brave to overwhelm the timid—\nyet they also did not teach the clever with their cleverness,\nnor distribute wealth with their wealth.\nThus, the Son of Heaven was established to harmonize them.\n\nSetting up the Three Ministers and Nine Officials,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe wisdom of one person could not encompass all within the Four Seas,\nso the Three Ministers and Nine Officials were appointed to assist and support them.\n\nFor isolated states and diverse customs that could not be reached by virtue/power,\nthe feudal lords were also established to teach and guide them.\n\nEven with treasures of jade and rare tributes,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nauthority and influence are the chariots of the ruler.\nYu* was lean and emaciated,\nShun* was dark and withered,\nYu* had calloused hands and feet—\nnot that they desired wealth or craved position,\nbut they sought to awaken the world’s benefit\nand remove the harm of all people.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven down to the common folk,\nno one’s thoughts were burdened—\nthus, there were none who sought sustenance without labor.\n\nThe leading four horses,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\ngreat ministers are the leading four horses of the ruler.\nYi Yin carried a cauldron to serve Tang*,\nLu Wang wielded an axe to enter Zhou*,\nBai Li Xi sold himself into slavery,\nGuan Zhong was bound with ropes,\nMo Zi had no warm seat,\nand Confucius had no heated席—\ntheir bodies were not weary.\nThus, there were none who sought sustenance without labor.\n\nBetter to sit and advance this Dao/Way.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients of the Three Sovereigns*\ntaught without descending from their halls,\nyet their transformations reached the Four Seas.\nThey spoke no words yet moved all under heaven,\naltered customs and habits,\nand people transformed and became virtuous—\nas if they were born that way.\nCriminal punishments were insufficient to change customs,\nslaughter was insufficient to stop deceit—\nonly divine transformation is precious.\n\nWhy was this Dao/Way so esteemed in antiquity?\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients, both ruler and subject,\nengaged in few and simple matters above,\nand followed easy and natural functions below—\nruler and subject did not weary of each other,\nand this way endured for ages.\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Pure* says:\nIf the ruler clears his heart and reduces his tasks,\nand the subjects revere and uphold their duties,\nthen Great Peace will naturally arise.\n\nNot seeking daily to obtain,\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancients who were good at ruling\nmodeled themselves after the rivers and seas.\nRivers and seas act without effort,\nyet can draw all streams to themselves.\nThey do not seek yet gain,\nthey do not act yet succeed—\nthe Dao/Way of heaven and earth,\ncomplete without action,\nobtained without seeking.\n\nDoes this mean crimes are pardoned?\n*The *South华经* says:\nIn ancient times, the states that established virtue/power,\ntheir people were simple and unrefined—\nyet they governed themselves.\nThus, they were esteemed under heaven.\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancients valued non-action,\nnon-action above,\nand non-action below as well.\n**Chapter Sixty-Three on Non-Action**\n\nThis chapter of *The South华经* speaks: In response to the Son of Heaven’s governance of non-action,\nthe House of You* did not compare to the House of Tai*.\nThe House of Tai* practiced non-action,\ntheir sleep was slow and deep,\nwithout dreams,\ntheir waking was clear and bright,\nwithout thought or deliberation.\nTheir wisdom was pure and trustworthy, not deceitful,\ntheir virtue/power was thoroughly true, not false—\nthey had never yet allowed the Dao/Way to enter into inhumanity.\n\nThe House of You had action,\nyet it still relied on reducing benevolence and righteousness to coerce the people’s hearts toward goodness—\nyet it still gained the people’s deceit and falsehood,\nand never truly cultivated a benevolent heart beyond humanity.\n\nThe ancient sages could practice the Dao/Way of non-action,\nfor non-action was not difficult—\nnon-action, *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nNon-action is non-action—\n*The South华经* says:\nAdrift in non-action.\n\nNon-action in affairs is non-action—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nNon-action in affairs is knowing the unknown—\n*The South华经* says:\nAdrift in the business of non-affairs.\n\nNon-action in taste is non-taste—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancients savored the Dao without abandoning it,\nwhile modern men abandon the Dao without savoring it.\n\nGreat and small—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth,\ngreatness rooted in the small,\nthe Dao great in its completion through the small.\nThe ancient sages modeled Heaven’s non-action,\nsoftness, weakness, subtlety, and mystery—\nthis was seeing the small.\nSeeing the small, thus they could achieve the great.\n\nMuch and little—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nabundance rooted in scarcity,\nthe Dao abundant in its completion through the little.\nThe ancient sages modeled Heaven’s non-action,\ngoverning the world with the Dao,\ndiminishing their brilliance—\nthis was seeing the little.\nSeeing the little, thus they could achieve the beautiful.\n\nRepaying resentment with virtue/power—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe thicker the giving, the finer the return,\nthe greater the resentment, the deeper the calamity.\nSparse giving with great expectations,\nnurturing resentment without calamity—\nthis has never existed.\n\nObserve how they proceed,\nand you shall know how they arrived.\n\nPlanning difficulties in their ease—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancients used upright teachings,\neasy and thus certain to succeed,\nwhile later generations used perverse teachings,\ndifficult and thus certain to fail.\n\nDoing greatness in their minutiae—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nSome things are easy to do but difficult to complete,\nothers difficult to complete but easy to ruin.\nEasy to do but difficult to complete—these are affairs.\nDifficult to complete but easy to ruin—these are words.\n\nThe world’s difficult matters must begin in ease—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMen all know to discard the useless for the useful,\nyet their daily lives are insufficient to complete the Dao.\n\nThe world’s great matters must begin in the small—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nOn days of gambling and games, they inquire about the Dao,\nyet their hearing and seeing are profound.\n\nEasy yet not difficult,\nsmall yet not great—\nThus the sages—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThey speak without being believed,\nact without benevolence,\ngovern without order,\nachieve without doing—\nthus the heart of Heaven moves with sincere teaching,\nthe Three Sovereigns practiced non-action.\nThey never sought greatness,\nand thus achieved the great.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient wise rulers modeled the rivers and seas.\nThe rivers and seas practice non-action,\nyet nothing is beyond their greatness—\nall streams flow to them,\nthus they achieve the great.\n\nLight promises must be few in truth—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nSpeaking without truth,\nacting without benevolence,\ngoverning without order,\ndoing without achievement—\nthus the superficial pretenders,\nthe Five Emperors and Three Kings did not sincerely adhere to the Dao.\n\nMany easinesses bring many difficulties—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nLater generations, lacking the roots of governance and teaching,\nyet desiring to rule over the myriad people—\nthis is difficult.\n\nThus the sages—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nAffairs are difficult to complete but easy to ruin,\nwords are difficult to establish but easy to abandon—\nthus the sages focused their hearts on the Dao,\nthe enlightened saw uniquely in non-action.\n\nYet difficulties remain,\nand thus they are ultimately without difficulty.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four on Ease in Holding Firm*\n\n*This chapter of The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* speaks:\nThe people of the end times indulge in perverse desires and lose their nature—\ntheir movements are never upright.\nGovernance brings chaos,\nself-cultivation brings falsehood.\nThose who do not hear the Dao cannot return to rectitude,\nthose who do not understand virtue/power cannot achieve tranquility.\n\nHuman nature is originally without perversity,\nyet prolonged indulgence in perversity\nmakes the easy seem easy and forgets its root—\nthus they cling to perversity.\nWater’s nature desires clarity,\nyet sand and soil defile it;\nhuman nature desires rectitude,\nyet perverse speech harms it.\n\nKnowing their own deceit is useless,\neven the greedy will reject it,\nyet not knowing their own desires are useless,\neven the virtuous cannot relinquish them.\n\nThus men lose their states and die by others’ hands,\nbecoming the world’s laughter—\nthey have never failed to indulge their own desires,\nthus those who act bring ruin,\nthose who grasp lose.\n\nKnowing winter fans and summer furs are useless to them,\nall things turn to dust and filth—\nuseless.\n\nThus it is said:\nNon-action, hence no ruin,\nnon-grasping, hence no loss.\n\nIts ease is easy to hold—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nWisdom discerning right and wrong\nis the gateway to calamity and fortune.\n\nIts unmanifested is easy to plan—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMovement and stillness, public and private—\nthe pivot of gain and harm.\n\nIts fragile is easy to break—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nCalamity’s arrival—\nmen themselves generate it;\nfortune’s coming—\nmen themselves complete it.\n\nIts subtle is easy to disperse—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nAccumulating rectitude brings fortune,\naccumulating perversity brings calamity.\n\nDoing it before it arises—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMen all neglect minor harms,\neasy trivial matters,\nuntil great calamities arrive—\none must be cautious.\n\nLater men know to respond to calamities after they arise,\nyet do not know to be cautious in the subtle to prevent calamities from forming.\nPreventing calamities from arising is easy,\nyet applying remedies after calamities form is difficult.\n\nCuring it before chaos—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao is cautious in the small and subtle,\ngreat calamities do not flourish.\nYet modern men do not strive to be cautious in the subtle to prevent calamities,\nbut instead wait for calamities to form before applying remedies—\neven the divine cannot act.\n\nTrace calamities and misfortunes to their origins—\nten thousandfold the Dao’s methods,\nyet no fixed remedy exists.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a hair’s end;\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nA ten-foot girth begins with a handful,\nfrom a hair’s end it grows gradually,\nsmall things accumulate into great.\n\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a clod of earth;\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nA hundred-zhang tower begins below,\nlayered earth becomes a mountain,\nsubtle things accumulate into vastness.\n\nA thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nA lame tortoise travels a thousand li,\none halting step at a time,\nnear things accumulate into far.\n\nThose who pursue ruin themselves—\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nThose who love white things\nconsider blackness filth.\n\nThose who love wealth excessively\ndo not see other things worth loving;\nthose who love perversity excessively\ndo not see the Dao’s worth.\n\nMen of the latter age who die young\nare not without arts—\ntheir cunning is extreme,\nyet the more they scheme, the shorter their lives.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThose who love affairs never fail to meet ruin,\nthose who love perversity never fail to lose.\nEach pursues what they love\nonly to harm themselves—\nthus it is said: *those who act bring ruin upon themselves.*\n\nThose who grasp lose.\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nThose who love black things\nconsider whiteness filth.\n\nThose who love horses excessively\ndo not see other things worth loving;\nthose who love ghosts excessively\ndo not see the divine’s worth.\n\nIn the latter age, those whose spirits grow wrathful\nare not without reverence for the gods—\ntheir licentious rites prevail,\nand the gods grow ever angrier.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe reason men lose their states,\ndie in disgrace,\nand become objects of scorn for all under heaven,\nis never without their love of desires—\nthus it is said: *those who grasp lose.*\n\nTherefore, the Sage of old, as *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says,\n*\"If the people of this age are perverse toward gods and spirits,\nwho can set them right?\"*\n\nGovernance lies in the Dao, not in craft;\nthe gentleman cultivates upright qi,\nthe petty man cultivates perverse qi—\nhence, the Sage acts without doing,\nand so meets no ruin.\nHe does not grasp,\nand so meets no loss.\nAct without doing,\nand so meet no ruin—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThose who delight in licentious rites,\nheedless of future calamity,\nare perverse qi—\nthus it is said: *without doing, there is no ruin.*\nDo not grasp,\nand so meet no loss—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn the latter age, those who cling to ghosts and gods,\nheedless of future calamity,\nare perverse qi—\nthus it is said: *without grasping, there is no loss.*\n\nThe people’s undertakings\noften falter just as they near completion.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe origins of calamity and fortune are subtle and unseen;\nthe petty man does not know the gates of misfortune—\nhe stirs and falls into guilt,\nunmindful of his subtle desires.\nTo be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nthen there will be no ruined undertakings.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious*—*Chapter of the Talisman*—says:\nStates fall from losing their governance,\nfilial piety wanes from lacking completion,\nmisfortune arises from grasping action,\nillness stems from carelessness—\nthus, to be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, as *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says,\n*\"The Sage perceives their beginning and end—\nit cannot be neglected.\"*\n\nDesire not what should not be desired.\n*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:\nAncient men desired,\nbut desired what they could not desire—\ntheir desire reached the Dao itself.\nThey did not prize hard-to-obtain wealth;\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nAncient men did not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nnor value useless things.\n\nStudy not what should not be studied.\n*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:\nAncient scholars studied,\nbut studied what they could not study—\ntheir study reached the Dao itself.\n\nReturn to the faults of the common people.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn ancient times, toward virtue,\nthey did not slight the small and so failed to practice it;\ntoward faults,\nthey did not overlook the subtle and so failed to correct them.\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nAncient Sages of old\nwere in nature aligned with the Dao—\nthey knew without study,\nsaw without looking,\nheard without listening—\nthe natural Way itself.\nYet they did not dare to act.\n*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:\nIn ancient times, above and below alike,\nthere was no doing.\n\n*The Classic of the Dao and Virtue*—*Four Children’s Commentary on the Ancient Way*—Volume Eight concludes.\nVolume Nine begins.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: Ancient Virtue in the Dao**\n\nIn the age of ancient great virtue and supreme Dao,\n*The Southern Flower* speaks:\nThe Sage did not exalt the worthy,\nnor employ the capable.\nAbove, like pruning branches,\nthe people were wild as deer.\n\nRectitude was natural—no need to call it *yi* (righteousness),\nmutual love—no need to call it *ren* (benevolence),\nsincerity—no need to call it *zhong* (loyalty),\ntruthfulness—no need to call it *xin* (faithfulness).\nThey moved clumsily yet guided one another—no need to call it a blessing.\nThus, they acted without leaving traces,\naccomplished deeds without leaving records—\nthe people were simple and easy to govern.\n\nThose ancient masters of the Dao—\n*The Southern Flower* says:\nThe Sovereigns of the Mysterious Age\ngoverned with *wuwei* (non-action),\nmerely embodying Heaven’s virtue.\n\nNot to enlighten the people,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nSupreme loyalty restored simplicity—\nthe people harbored no deceit or concealment.\nRather, they sought to befuddle them.\n\n*The Southern Flower* says:\nIn the southern lands, there was a village\nnamed *Jiàn Dé* (Established Virtue),\nits people simple and unrefined—\nthus, they were easy to govern.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people—\n*The Southern Flower* says:\nNow, the Zhou promote cleverness, skill, and ornamental culture—\ninsufficient to stabilize the realm.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their intelligence is excessive.\n\n*The Southern Flower* says:\nIf the ruler sincerely favors cleverness yet lacks the Dao,\nthe world falls into great disorder.\nThus, Jie and Zhou each brought chaos—\ntheir crime lay in their love of cleverness.\nNow, the people are difficult to govern\nbecause their intelligence is excessive.\n\nThus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThose who govern with cleverness\nrely on one man’s talent—\nhard to sustain the state.\nIf they favor clever stratagems,\nthey breed deceit and corruption—\nthe winds that destroy nations.\nThus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.\nNot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Original Dao]* says:\nAncients did not govern with cleverness—\nthe state’s blessing.\n\nTo know these two truths—\n*The Southern Flower* says:\nAbandon petty cleverness, and great wisdom shines forth.\nThis is the model.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThose who govern with literary cleverness\nlabor in vain with weary hearts.\nRelying solely on cleverness,\nfailures multiply.\nTo love cleverness is to exhaust artifice—\ncleverness breeds calamity.\nTo counter cleverness with cleverness\nis like stirring water to seek clarity—\ndifficult indeed.\n\nThose who know the root of governance\nabandon artifice and cleverness,\nletting *wuwei* transform naturally.\nAlways hold to the model—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nNow, if one seeks to learn the Dao\nwithout attaining the pure, luminous, and sacred,\nmerely clinging to texts,\nthey cannot govern at all.\nThis is called *xuán dé* (Mysterious Virtue).\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nAncient Sages held *xuán dé* in their hearts,\nand their transformations moved like spirits.\nOnly those who harmonize with the Great Unity\nand naturally respond can govern—\nthis is called *xuán dé*.\nMysterious Virtue is profound and vast—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Dao]* says:\nAncient Sages preserved themselves with Heaven and Earth,\nupright in cultivating the Dao.\nThe deeper the human path, the deeper the virtue;\nthe deeper the virtue, the more complete the achievements—\nthis is called *xuán dé*, profound and vast.\nThey inverted with things—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTheir inversion with things was complete.\n\nThe Commentary says:\n*\"Long处* (prolonged) yet not *zhì* (wise/knowing), hence it is called *fǎn* (inversion).\nThen it reaches *Dà Shùn* (Great Harmony).\n\n*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:\nWhen harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, their unity is seamless,\nlike the simplicity of the foolish and the dimness of the ignorant—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*, in accord with *Great Harmony*.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi as King)**\nThis chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:\nIn the ancient times, the Sage-Kings governed through the Dao/Way,\nretiring yet without absence, modeling themselves after the rivers and seas—\nnot claiming greatness for themselves, their virtue naturally manifesting,\nso they could establish their kingship.\n\nHuman nature and disposition\nsubmit to virtue, not to force.\nVirtue lies in yielding, not in contention—\nthus the ancient Sage-Kings,\nwho wished to be honored by others, first honored others themselves;\nwho wished to be revered by others, first revered others;\nwho wished to overcome others, first made themselves weak;\nwho wished to be humble before others, first humbled themselves.\n\nThus high and low, reverence and humility,\nthe Dao/Way governs them—\nspeaking gently to others while placing themselves last,\nso the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,\nand in bearing them without resentment—\nthis is virtue abundant and *qi* in harmony.\n\nThus knowing to yield is to take,\nand to retreat is to lead—\nthis is near to the Dao/Way.\n\nVirtue bestowed upon the world,\npreserved through yielding,\nwas how the ancient Kings maintained the world—\nthus they could endure long.\nThis is the virtue of the Sea yielding kingship.\n\n**Why the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys,**\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue/Compendium]* says:\nThe rivers and seas are low and humble,\nyet all streams flow into them—\nthus they achieve vastness.\nBecause they excel in yielding,\nthey can be kings of all valleys.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe rivers and seas yield because they are low,\nthe Heavenly Pool is the *Yuān Dé* (Abyssal Virtue),\nand fish and turtles gather there.\nThus the sea does not contend with the eastward flow—\nthis is the utmost greatness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage-Kings\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe rivers and seas occupy the Earth’s deficiencies,\nso the world submits to and venerates them.\nThe Sage-Kings who practice humility, modesty, and yielding words—\nthis is seen as yielding.\nSeen as yielding, thus they attain their loftiness;\nthe arrogant cannot stand.\n\n*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:\nOnce upon a time, Yao and Shun yielded yet became emperors,\nTang and Wu contended yet became kings,\nand the Duke of Bai contended yet perished.\nTo ascend over others, one must speak gently to them,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Virtue/Compendium]* says:\nTo ascend over others,\none must necessarily speak gently to them.\nThe world must imitate their joy and love,\nall must promote and yield.\n\nTo lead others, one must place oneself last,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo lead others,\none must necessarily place oneself last.\nThe world advances their benevolence and righteousness,\nand there is no harsh *qi*.\nThus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Dao/Way Origins]* says:\nThus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,\nand though they stand foremost, others do not harm them—\nthe world submits to them, and the wicked fear them.\nThough they stand foremost, others do not harm them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo occupy the highest position while the people do not resent,\nand to stand foremost while others do not harm—\neven in distant lands and alien customs,\nwhere maggots fly and worms writhe,\nall are drawn to love them.\nThus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,\nwithout them, nothing is left undone,\nwithout their leading, nothing fails to succeed—\nhence they are held in highest esteem by the world.\nBecause they do not contend,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue]* says:\nThe ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—\nlow and yielding, not contending.\nAll streams flow into them,\nso none can contend with them.\nThus the Dao/Way does not stand upon strength and arms,\nbut upon the world’s promotion of them—\nnot upon their own seizing.\nBecause they do not contend,\nnone can contend with them.\nThus the world cannot contend with them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Way of ordinary people is many and does not unite,\nthe Way of the Sage-Kings is humble yet none can surpass it.\nBecause they do not contend with all things,\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n\n**The World All Praises (Chapter 67)**\nThis chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:\nThe Dao/Way is simple yet expansive,\nmysterious yet luminous,\nsoft yet strong—\ncontaining yin and emitting yang,\nand thus manifesting the three brilliances.\n\nThe sun and moon move through it,\nmountains rise through it,\nthe abyss deepens through it,\nbirds fly through it,\nbeasts run through it,\nthe qilin roams through it,\nand the phoenix soars through it.\n\nTo take reverence through humility,\nto take survival through extinction,\nto take precedence through retreat.\n\nThe first is *cí* (compassion),\nthe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nthe third is not daring to lead the world.\n\nThe ancient Sage-Kings preserved softness and did not grow rigid,\nretired yet were not absent,\ndid not dare to be proud or extravagant—\ntheir virtue naturally transformed,\nso they could establish their kingship.\nThey could endure long,\nand their three treasures were vast and expansive.\n\nThe world all praises my Dao/Way as great,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy Dao/Way is *wu wéi* (non-action),\nand I do not privately receive what is unworthy.\nIt seems not to conform.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy virtue contains simplicity,\nyet it tolerates the unworthy.\nOnly because it is great,\ndoes it seem not to conform.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—\n*wu wéi* (non-action), occupying unworthy positions,\nso they became kings of the world.\nIf conformity were long sustained,\nits subtlety would be lost.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient Sage-Kings were clear-sighted, wise, and benevolent,\nyet they preserved themselves in simplicity,\npracticing non-action while the world was governed.\nI possess three treasures,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy Dao/Way has three treasures—\nto take reverence through humility,\nto take vastness through frugality,\nto take precedence through retreat.\nPreserving and holding them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way is preserved through them.\n\nThe first is compassion,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\ngreat yet rooted in the small,\nhumble yet self-guarding.\n\nThe second is frugality,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nabundant yet beginning with the few,\nfrugal yet self-fortifying.\n\nThe third is not daring to lead the world,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nleading through retreat as its principle,\nretiring to yield.\n\nThus, compassion brings forth courage—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient sages followed the Dao’s humility,\nso as to place themselves below others.\nHumility yields honor—\nthis is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.\n\nFrugality brings forth vastness—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient sages followed the Dao’s frugality,\nso as to begin with little.\nFrugality yields abundance—\nthis is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.\n\nNot daring to lead the world,\nthus one attains the completion of great instruments and long reigns—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient sages followed the Dao’s retreat,\nso as to place themselves behind others.\nRetreat yields precedence—\nthis is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.\n\nNow, abandoning compassion and courage—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMen of the latter age love strength and hate weakness,\nyet they do not know their loss—\nthe overbearing perish.\n\nAbandoning frugality and vastness—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMen of the latter age love extravagance and hate frugality,\nyet they do not know their loss—\nthe proud and wasteful perish.\n\nAbandoning retreat and precedence—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMen of the latter age love to lead and hate to follow,\nyet they do not know their loss—\nthose who contend for precedence are undone.\nDeath is near—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe root of reckless strength lies in humility and weakness;\nthe root of vast utility lies in frugality and restraint;\nthe root of striving for precedence lies in modesty and retreat.\nWhen these three are lost, states perish and fall.\n\nCompassion—\nin war, it brings victory—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao does not conquer through strength,\nbut through the world’s spontaneous submission,\nnot through self-assertion.\nSoftness and weakness prevail.\n\nIn defense, it makes firm—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nHigh walls and deep moats are insufficient for true defense.\nThe skillful guardian needs no walls.\nHeaven will protect it—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nHeaven’s Way diminishes the full and benefits the few.\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nWhen virtue and Dao flourish, spirits and gods assist—\nthis is the mark of the virtuous.\n\nCompassion guards it—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn times of order, righteousness guards the body;\nin times of chaos, the body guards righteousness.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Warrior**\nThis chapter from *The South Flower Scripture* recounts:\nWei Wu Hou asked Xu Wu Gui:\n*\"I wish to love the people and practice righteousness while laying down arms—is this possible?\"*\nXu Wu Gui replied:\n*\"Your armies stand like cranes at the ornate gate,\nyour formations do not rely on swift horses at the hallowed hall—\nhow can this be called laying down arms?\nIn ancient times, there was no storing of weapons for gain,\nno outwitting others through cleverness,\nno defeating others through schemes,\nno conquering others through war.\nNow, those who slaughter the people and seize their lands,\nto nourish their own harmony and spirits—\nwho among them knows the art of war?\nWhere lies victory?\nIf you cannot cease, then cultivate sincerity within your breast,\nresponding to Heaven and Earth’s effortless nature without resistance.\nWhen the people die, they are already freed—\nwhat use is there in laying down arms?\nThe ancient virtuous warriors were not martial,\nthe skilled fighters did not rage.\nUsing the worthy without contention,\nthe world attains great peace.\n\nThe virtuous warrior is not martial—\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nArmor and weapons are insufficient for strength.\n\nThe skilled fighter does not rage—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient masters of war stored their anger;\nwhen anger was stored, their威 *wei* could be established.\n\nThe one who bests enemies does not contend—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe skilled warrior fights no one,\nbut rides the currents of time and follows the people’s desires—\nand the world submits.\n\nThe master of men serves below—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient masters of men were like the many feet of a centipede,\neach aiding without harming,\nor like the tongue and teeth—\nfirm and yielding, grinding without destruction.\n\nThough the summer jade may have flaws,\nand the moon’s pearl may bear blemishes,\nyet the world treasures them—\nthe worthy do not let minor faults obscure great beauty.\nTo fixate on others’ shortcomings,\nforgetting their virtues,\nand yet seek the worthy in the world—\nthis is difficult indeed.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThose who win the hearts of men must first win themselves;\nthose who win themselves must be soft and weak.\nThose who achieve hegemony and kingship must first be conquerors;\nthose who conquer must be virtuous.\n\nThis is called the power of using men—\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo love the worthy is benevolence;\nto respect the worthy is ritual.\n\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nthe ancient ultimate.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nA thousand-chariot state practicing cultural virtue becomes king;\na ten-thousand-chariot state fond of war perishes.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Five Kinds of War**\nThis chapter from *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThere are five kinds of war:\nThere is the righteous war,\nthere is the responsive war,\nthere is the wrathful war,\nthere is the greedy war,\nand there is the arrogant war.\n\nTo punish tyranny and rescue the weak—this is the righteous war.\nWhen an enemy attacks and there is no alternative—this is the responsive war.\nTo quarrel over trifles, unable to master one’s own heart—this is the wrathful war.\nTo covet another’s land, to desire another’s wealth—this is the greedy war.\nTo boast of one’s state’s grandeur and people’s multitude,\nand to seek superiority over enemy states—this is the arrogant war.\n\nThe righteous war brings kingship,\nthe responsive war brings victory,\nthe wrathful war brings defeat,\nthe greedy war brings death,\nthe arrogant war brings annihilation—\nthis is Heaven’s Way.\n\nNow, the warring states’ rebellious ministers and traitors\nuse war lightly against enemies,\nambush the unprepared,\nand first invite disaster—\nno calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy.\n\nThere is a saying about war:\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Upper Section on Rites]* says:\nTo use the unusual in war,\nthe unusual becomes weary as if labored,\nthe unusual becomes hungry as if starved,\nthe unusual becomes restless as if disturbed,\nthe unusual becomes chaotic as if disordered,\nthe unusual becomes forward as if retreating.\nWhere does one go without victory?\nThe latter prevails.\n\nI dare not act as master.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe one who strikes first is on the path to exhaustion.\n\nYet as a guest, *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe one who moves last is the source of establishment.\n\nI dare not advance even an inch,\nbut retreat a foot.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo bend an inch to extend a foot—this is the way of the virtuous.\n\nThis is called \"action without action,\"\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nRaising an army for others brings their aid;\nraising an army for oneself brings their departure.\n\nThere is no arm to ward off,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nWhere the multitude aids, though weak, it must grow strong.\n\nThere is no enemy to oppose,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nWhere the multitude departs, though great, it must stand firm.\n\nThere is no weapon to grasp.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancients held victory and triumph in not waging war while yet disbanding armies—when lords and vassals were in submission, this was the highest use of war.\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe bold and courageous die by their reckless strength;\nthe eloquent and clever are constrained by their own cleverness.\nOne who knows victory through cleverness is capable;\none who does not know defeat through cleverness is not.\n\nBrave in one act, discerning in one word,\none may be persuaded by subtle arguments,\nbut not yet trusted to broad application.\n\nLightly underestimating the enemy almost loses one’s treasure.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious • Upper Virtue Section* says:\nLaozi observed shadows to know the principle of yielding last—\nthe one who moves last never fails in propriety.\n\nHence the Sage says:\n\"Do not follow convention;\nalways yield last and never strike first.\nLike stacking firewood,\nthe last is the highest.\n\nThus when armies clash,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIf one hears that a sovereign of an enemy state is oppressing his people with cruelty,\nhe should raise his army and approach its borders.\nWhen the enemy is ready to engage and meet in battle,\nthe one who yields last will prevail.\nThe compassionate will prevail.\"\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe so-called \"one who yields last\"\nis the Sage who guards the Dao of stillness,\nrestrains the feminine principle,\nfollows convention while responding to change,\nalways yields last and never strikes first—\nhis great achievements are without rigidity,\nand he cannot be contested.\nThe one who yields last will prevail.\n\nMy words are found in *The Chapter of Easy Knowing*, the seventy-first chapter.\nThis chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:\nThe商太宰 saw Confucius and said:\n\"Is Master Kong a Sage?\"\nConfucius replied:\n\"A Sage? How dare I claim such a title! Yet I am one who studies widely and knows much.\"\n\nThe商太宰 said:\n\"Are the Three Kings Sages?\"\nConfucius replied:\n\"The Three Kings were skilled in employing those of wisdom and courage—\nwhether they were Sages, I do not know.\"\n\nThe商太宰 said:\n\"Are the Five Emperors Sages?\"\nConfucius replied:\n\"The Five Emperors were skilled in employing those of virtue and righteousness—\nwhether they were Sages, I do not know.\"\n\nThe商太宰 said:\n\"Are the Three Sovereigns Sages?\"\nConfucius replied:\n\"The Three Sovereigns were skilled in adapting to the times—\nwhether they were Sages, I do not know.\"\n\nThe商太宰 was greatly startled and said:\n\"Then who is truly a Sage?\"\nConfucius, moved in expression, replied:\n\"In the Western Zhou, there was the Grand Historian Lao Dan, who may be called a Sage—\nwithout governing yet without chaos,\nwithout speaking yet self-assured,\nwithout transforming yet self-directed,\nhe drifts among the people who cannot name him.\nHe may be called a great Sage indeed.\"\n\nHence the Old Sage said:\n\"My words speak of the Great Dao,\nthe transformation of non-action.\"\n\nMy words,\n*The Southern Flower Canon* says:\n\"Lao Dan was clear about the virtue/power of Heaven and Earth,\ntheir non-action, and their simplicity—\nthis is called the Great Ancestor, the Great Root,\nthe Great Master.\"\n\nEasy to know,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo govern a great state, the Dao cannot be slighted.\nWhen the land is vast, the measures cannot be narrow.\nWhen the king’s position is exalted, the affairs cannot be burdensome.\nWhen the people are many, the teachings cannot be harsh.\nBurdensome affairs are difficult to govern,\nharsh laws are difficult to enforce,\nscant resources are hard to sustain—\nthis is where cleverness may be of little use,\nand subtle arguments cannot bring order.\n\nHence what is not beneficial to governance,\nwhat is beneficial yet causes disorder—\nthe Sage does not do this.\n\nWhat is not beneficial to war,\nwhat is beneficial yet causes waste—\nthe wise do not employ this.\n\nThus, achievements are not weary of being frugal,\naffairs are not weary of being simplified,\ndemands are not weary of being few.\nFrugal achievements are easy to complete,\nsimplified affairs are easy to govern,\nfew demands are easy to sustain—\nthis is easy to practice.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe River flows with winding ease, hence it can reach far;\nThe Mountain rises with gradual ascent, hence it can stand high;\nThe Dao proceeds with gentle leisure, hence it can transform.\n\nHe who is skilled in one technique,\nproficient in one matter,\ndiscerning in one ability—\nmay be persuaded by subtle arguments,\nbut cannot yet be broadly applied to governance.\n\nThe words of the Dao say:\nVague and indistinct,\nit harmonizes with Heaven’s qi.\nHe who harmonizes with qi becomes an Emperor,\nhe who harmonizes with virtue becomes a King,\nhe who harmonizes with power becomes a Conqueror,\nhe who lacks any of these will perish.\n\nThus, without words yet governance is achieved,\nwithout affairs yet transformation is complete—\nthis is why the heart of Heaven moves and transforms through non-action.\n\nHence, with the Dao to govern,\nfew affairs suffice for governance;\nwithout the Dao to govern,\nmany affairs suffice only to bring disorder.\n\nIn the end times,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe people of the world are overly constrained by petty pleasures\nand obstructed by the Great Dao,\nunable to know or practice it.\nNone can know,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn the end times, petty learning obscures virtue,\nand none can know it.\n\n*The Southern Flower Canon* says:\nIn ancient times, virtue was not slighted by petty knowledge;\nin later times, petty knowledge injured virtue,\nand none could know it.\n\nNone can practice.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn the end times, petty goodness blocks the Dao,\nand none can practice it.\n\n*The Southern Flower Canon* says:\nIn ancient times, the Dao was not slighted by petty practice;\nin later times, petty practice injured the Dao,\nand none could practice it.\n\nWords have a root,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* [• *Clarifying the Mysterious Section*] says:\nWords have a root,\naffairs have a master—\nthe highest words transcend words.\nAffairs have a master,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* [• *Sincere Integrity Section*] says:\nWords have a root,\naffairs have a foundation—\nthe highest practice transcends practice.\n\nHe who lacks knowledge alone,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn the end times, petty learning—\nthose who vie for fish are drenched,\nthose who chase beasts are exhausted,\nthe shallow concerns of the vulgar—\nthese are the ends of things.\nHe who lacks knowledge alone.\"\n\nThus, none truly know me.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn the end times, petty Dao is abandoned,\nits root and foundation lost.\nThough skills may be many,\nthey are shallow, muddled, and dry—\nbetter to speak little.\nTo harm the multitude by burdening them with tasks\nand then sever their fingers to demonstrate\nthat great skill cannot be forced—\nthus, none truly know me.\n\nFew know me,\n*The Scripture of the Void and Emptiness* says:\nIn the Western Zhou, the Grand Historian Lao Dan was a sage—\nhe ruled without governing, spoke without persuading,\ntransformed without teaching,\nand drifted effortlessly, beyond the people’s naming.\nTruly, he was a great sage.\n\nThose who follow me are honored.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nIn silent repose, in profound stillness,\ngoverning through non-action,\nunaware of doing yet deeds accomplished—\nthis is the sage.\nWhat is honored in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation,\nfor divine transformation alone is noble.\n\nThus, the sage,\n*The Scripture of the South* says:\nDoes not stray from the root—\nthis is the Heavenly Human.\nTaking Heaven as root,\nvirtue as foundation,\nthe Dao as gate,\nmanifesting in transformation—\nthis is the sage.\nClad in coarse robes yet holding jade.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nJade in the mountains makes grasses flourish,\npearls in the depths keep shores from withering,\nthe Dao within brings form to self-regulation.\n\n**Chapter 71: \"Knowing the Unknown\"**\nThis chapter of *The True Scripture of the South* speaks:\nThe Dao does not desire mixture.\nScholars of many schools abound;\nmany, they disturb;\ndisturbed, they are disordered;\ndisorder brings sorrow and calamity.\nSorrowed, they cannot be saved.\n\nTheir books teach the virtuous:\nto level instruction, to rectify lawsuits.\nThe worthy govern, the capable serve—\nbenevolence spreads below, and the people cherish virtue.\nBut when it decays,\ncliques form, each promoting their own,\nabandoning the public for private gain,\ninner and outer factions rise,\nthe deceitful take office, the worthy hide away.\n\nIn ancient times, the Dao and virtue were obscured\nin the books of the Hundred Schools.\nThe Confucians—Hui Shi and Du Shi—\ntheir writings filled five chariots,\ntheir teachings contradictory and tangled,\ntheir words chaotic and useless.\nThe Mohists—Mo Di and Jin Hui—\ndid not align with the ancient kings,\nabolishing the rites and music of old,\nMo Zi extolling Yu’s Way,\nforcing his followers into laborious toil.\n\nThe Logicians—Sun Pin and Yin Wen—\ncrafted the *Hua Mountain Cap* to display themselves,\nclaiming it benefited nothing in the world.\nThe Legalists—Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao—\ntheir teachings did not suit the living,\nbut only the logic of the dead.\nThe Sophists—Gongsun Long and his disciples—\ncould persuade with words but not with truth,\nall teaching cleverness and deceit,\nindulging in perverse and licentious ways,\nthen abandoning them to law, following with punishment.\nThough they ravaged the world, they could not curb their treachery.\n\nSkill alone is perilous,\nand when lost, it multiplies.\nTo love knowledge and exhaust technique—\nto govern with knowledge is to ruin the state.\n\nMountains yield gold, stones yield jade,\nyet they erode each other;\ntrees breed worms, which devour them;\nhumans study, yet only bring chaos.\nThe more the ruler studies, the more the people labor;\nthe more the ruler acts, the more the people are troubled.\n\nThus, to stop the boiling with firewood only makes the boiling worse—\none who knows the principle of *wuwei* governance knows to remove the fire alone.\n*Wuwei* naturally aligns itself.\n\nNow, the teachings of the various schools—perverse doctrines and deceitful words—\nare the very obstructions that bring chaos to the world.\n\nTo know what one does not know—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing*[*Symptoms of the Mysterious*] says:\n*\"The ancient sages who skillfully employed the Dao\nlet *wuwei* transform itself naturally,\nand thus never caused harm.\nTherefore it is said: To know what one does not know—*shàng* [superior].\"*\n\nTo not know what one knows—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Now, those who do not know the Dao\nactively interfere, bringing self-ruin.\nFortune becomes misfortune.\nTherefore it is said: To not know what one knows—*disease*.\"*\n\nOnly the diseased who recognize their disease—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The common people and lesser scholars all indulge in book-learning for profit,\nprofiting from learning while unaware that their disease is their disease.\"*\n\nThus, they are not truly diseased—\nthe *Nanhua Jing*[*Southern Flower Sutra*] says:\n*\"Nan Rong Zhi said: When a villager falls ill,\nand others ask about it, the sick person can name their ailment—\nhow could they not be ill?\nThe Sage is not ill,\nyet those who recognize their disease—\neven they are not truly ill.\nFor by recognizing their disease,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nas if Zhi had drunk medicine to worsen his illness—\nthey can remove the disease of being diseased,\nand thus are not ill.\nTherefore, they are not ill.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Only the ancient sages knew that the disease of disease is no disease.\nThe people do not fear coercive laws—\nthis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient sages governed with the Dao,\nmaintaining softness without force,\nallowing virtue to transform naturally,\nand thus achieved their kingship.\nHuman nature responds to virtue, not to force.\nVirtue comes from within—\nself-love enables nobility,\nand love for the people brings kingship,\nso all under heaven return.\nWhen the people do not fear coercion,\ntrue awe naturally arises.\nThe *Chongxu Jing*[*Sutra of the Void*] says:\nYet to desire others to revere you—\nthis is impossible to attain through the Dao.\nIf others do not revere you,\nhow can danger or humiliation reach you?\n\nDo not narrow your dwelling—\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nThe enclosures of the Weishi clan,\nthe hunting grounds of the Yellow Emperor,\nthe palaces of Tang and Yu,\nthe halls of Tang and Wu—\nas virtue declines, their dwellings grow ever narrower.\n\nDo not exhaust what sustains you—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"To govern a great state, the Dao must not be constrained.\nThe broader the land, the broader the governance must be.\nAn emperor who cannot win the people cannot achieve the world;\none who wins the people but loses the Dao cannot retain it.\nOnly the unbounded remains unbounded.\"\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says:\n*\"Laws and measures are within oneself;\nexamination lies with the people.\nIf the people love me, I must love them in return;\nif the people hate me, I must hate them in return.\nThus, the Sage—\nthe *Chongxu Jing* says:\nTang and Wu loved the world, so they ruled;\nJie and Zhou hated the world, so they perished.\n\nSelf-knowledge—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"The foundation of winning the people lies in self-knowledge.\nWhen one blames others for their faults,\ndoes one truly know oneself?\nNot seeing oneself—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThus, the Sage does not force,\nand so achieves kingship.\nSelf-love—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"No virtue surpasses loving others;\nto love others is to have no grievance with punishment.\"\nNot esteeming oneself—\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*\"Thus, the Sage loves themselves,\nand so achieves nobility.\nTherefore, abandon that and take this.\nHeaven’s calamities do not arise—\nthose who attain this are blessed.\nForgotten is that,\nand guilt departs while fortune arrives.\"*\n\n「**Chapter 73: The Bold in Daring Bring Death**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks of: Seven states waging war, slaying the innocent, nourishing the unrighteous, and causing harm beyond measure. Indulging one’s private desires while ignoring the calamities within the realm—this is what Heaven detests, and what the people resent, and what Heaven punishes. Thus, the bold in daring bring death; what Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, yet it does not fail to ensnare. The bold in daring bring death, but the *Tongxuan Jing˙Dao De* says: In the latter days of the Warring States, men have hearts of profit and loss, and from the outset, they harbor murderous intent. Thus, the bold in daring bring death, while the bold in restraint bring life.\n\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Those who practice the Dao make others so that though they be bold enough to strike, the strike will not take hold; though they be clever enough to attack, the attack will not find its mark. Though they strike and do not take hold, though they attack and do not find their mark, yet they still bring shame—how much less so than the ancient Sages, who made others so that though they be bold, they dare not strike, and though they be clever, they dare not attack! Those who dare not strike are not without murderous intent, but how much less so than the Sages, who from the outset have no murderous intent at all! Those who have no murderous intent at all have not yet cultivated a heart of love and benefit. Thus, they make all men and women under Heaven—without exception—rejoice and willingly embrace love and benefit, yet they dare not kill. If such is the case, without murderous intent, there is no place where they are not rulers, no office where they are not leaders. All under Heaven willingly embrace peace and benefit, and so the bold in restraint bring life.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles—one brings benefit, the other harm. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: To love daring is the Dao of peril and ruin; the bold and daring die by force and tyranny. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason? The *Chongxu Jing* says: Laozi spoke to Guan Yin: *\"What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\"* Therefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nUnder Heaven, nothing is easier than doing good; what is meant by doing good is to remain still and take no action, and so doing good is easy. Under Heaven, nothing is harder than doing evil; what is meant by doing evil is usurpation and regicide, deceit and falsehood, which go against human nature, and so doing evil is hard. The Dao of Heaven, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the few; the Dao of ghosts and spirits is proud and overflowing, not to be shared.\n\nWithout contention yet achieving victory, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those with hidden virtue must have manifest reward; those with secret deeds must have clear response. The sower of millet does not reap grain; the planter of evil does not receive virtue in return. Without speech yet responding well, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: To do evil in the light of day, men may punish you; to do evil in darkness, ghosts may punish you.\n\nWithout summoning yet they come, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven is the sun of winter and the shade of summer; all things return to it, yet none compel them. It reaches the utmost of natural and refined influence—coming without summoning, departing without being driven away. Thus, it is effortless yet good at planning.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao is broad and open; to abandon the self is not far. If one turns toward good, even if they err, there will be no resentment. If one does not turn toward good, even if they are loyal, they will bring misfortune. The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, and the *Dongling Jing* says: *\"If the prohibitive nets are sparse and wide, they are easy to evade yet hard to violate.\"* The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, sparse yet never failing. Sparse yet never failing. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the Warring States, those who dare to fight kill the innocent; the people resent them, and Heaven punishes them.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Normally Fear Death**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks of: The Five Hegemons suddenly speaking of punishments and rewards, yet how can they govern the people? This is merely knowing the tools of governance, not the essential Dao of governance. One may use the tools of governance throughout the realm, but this is not enough to apply the Dao of governance throughout the realm.\n\nThe laws of the latter days set high standards yet fail to reach the guilty; impose heavy burdens yet punishments do not overcome them; create great difficulties yet executions are not dared. The people are burdened by these three evils, adorned with cleverness and deceiving their superiors, committing wickedness and courting danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nWild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant. Thus, the Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty, and the rulers demand much while the people resent much. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.\n\nAnd so, to stop the boiling by adding more fire—though it seems a strange remedy—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The essential principle of governance is to remove the fire itself. To be clear and still, to return to rectitude.\n\nThus, the Five Hegemons cruelly punish, taking the guilty into their own hands and killing them. Those who substitute for the officials in killing are rare indeed who do not soil their hands. The people do not normally fear death, and the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments are not enough to instill awe; killing the innocent is not enough to suppress deceit. How can you rely on death to instill fear?\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those who carve laws and impose executions are not the work of an Emperor or King; those who frequently use rods and whips are not the measures of one who seeks the distant. If you wish to make the people fear death, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty; the more the rulers demand, the more the people contend below. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.\n\nAnd yet, there are those who are strange, the *Tongxuan Jing□Xia De* says: The people of the latter days adorn themselves with cleverness and deceive their superiors, commit wickedness and court danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit. Wild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant.\n\nI seize them and kill them, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Ancient rulers who governed well accumulated their virtue; accumulating virtue, the people could be transformed. Today’s rulers who govern by cruelty and violence breed chaos, and chaos is the wind of ruined states. Who dares?」\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation.\nWith laws broad and punishments lenient, the prisons stand empty, and the realm unified in custom—none harbor deceitful hearts. This is the benevolence of the Sage.\n\nLet those who hold office kill when they must. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, lest they act without restraint. The establishment of rulers was to control these officials, lest they act unilaterally. Laws, measures, and Daoist arts were to restrain the ruler, lest he act arbitrarily.\n\nTo take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [in the *Shangren* section] says: A whale cast upon dry land is dominated by an ant. When a ruler abandons his proper role and contests matters with his ministers, he is dominated by his officials. Ministers hoard their wisdom and do not employ it, yet instead usurp authority from above.\n\nIf a ruler does not entrust capable men but insists on acting himself, his wisdom grows ever more constrained while his burdens increase. When cornered by his subordinates, he cannot rectify matters. His wisdom proves insufficient for governance, his authority inadequate for enforcing law—thus he cannot engage with the realm.\n\nTo take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe. And he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When a ruler’s joys and angers manifest in his heart, and his desires are visible without, those who guard their posts abandon principle to curry favor, and officials pervert the law to follow the wind. Rewards fail to match merit, punishments fail to fit crimes—thus superior and subordinate grow estranged, ruler and minister harbor grudges, officials grow chaotic, and wisdom cannot resolve slander while clarity cannot illuminate one’s own faults. Instead, they blame themselves, and so the sovereign grows ever more weary while his ministers grow ever more insolent.\n\nThus, he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.\n\n**On the People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states: When learning is prized for cleverness but lacks the Dao, the world falls into chaos. How do we know this is so?\n\nWhen the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps abounds, the birds grow disordered above. When the cunning of hooks, baits, nets, and weirs abounds, the fish grow disordered in the waters. When the cunning of traps, snares, and pitfalls abounds, the beasts grow disordered in the marshes. When the cunning of deceit, poison, sophistry, and debates over *jiehua* (contradictions), *jianhua* (subtleties), *firmness*, *whiteness*, *freshness*, *filth*, and distinctions abounds, then customs grow disordered in argumentation.\n\nFrom ancient times to today, tyrants like Jie and Zhou have repeatedly plunged the world into great chaos, and the fault lies in their love of cleverness. Now, the people of Zhou are skilled yet difficult to govern, and so this chapter is composed.\n\n**On the People’s Hunger**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the people show signs of hunger, it is not by fate that they perish young or die of starvation. It is because of the heavy taxes imposed upon them.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Moreover, in sustaining life, one man plows and does not increase ten *mu* of land. Even in a middle-quality field, the harvest does not exceed four *dan*. His wife, children, and aged dependents rely on this for sustenance. At times, there are calamities of flood or drought. When tribute is demanded, the ruler may pity them—but still, they hunger.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the latter days, greedy tyrants drain their people like fish to satisfy their boundless desires, and so the common folk do not receive the harmonies of Heaven or the virtues of Earth. Thus, the people hunger.\n\n**On the Difficulty of Governing the People**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In later ages, when rulers act, they exhaust the world’s resources yet fail to govern. When superiors desire much, inferiors suffer much. When superiors engage in many affairs, inferiors adopt many guises. To teach the people and then expect them to cease their ways is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn—it is difficult.\n\nThus, to stop boiling by adding more water only makes it worse. Those who know the root of governance know to remove the fire. Hence, they are difficult to govern.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When superiors act, inferiors also act.\n\n**On the Corruption of Learning and the Lightness of Death**\n\nScholarly learning opens the door to deceit among the people, yet when their licentious and perverse ways are unleashed, they are abandoned to the law and pursued by punishment—though this only ravages the world. Unable to curb their deceit, they are thus difficult to govern.\n\n**On the Lightness of Death**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the people grow light in death, they perish not by fate but by their own indulgence, ever seeking without restraint, ever desiring without end—until punishment kills them.\n\nBecause their craving for life is excessive,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the latter ages, dim-witted rulers take from the people without measure, demand of them without limit, so that men and women cannot tend to farming and weaving. Their days are numbered, yet they labor endlessly to serve their superiors, their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted—thus they grow light in death.\n\nThus, the people grow light in death.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When superiors indulge in boundless taking, inferiors become avaricious without restraint. The people, impoverished and suffering, give rise to strife—thus they grow light in death.\n\nThose who do not value life above all,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, rulers prized life, and prizing life, they held gain in light regard. In later ages, when wealth is scarce, theft arises—yet whom can one blame for this? Blame the rulers who value gain over life.\n\nThis is wiser than valuing life.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Nine Guardians Chapter] says: Only those who do not value life above all can attain true longevity.\n\n**On the People’s Lifespan (Chapter Seventy-Six)**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: In the Warring States, warfare drained the world’s resources to satisfy one man’s desires—what greater calamity could there be? To indulge one man’s desires is to prolong the suffering of the land, a transgression against Heaven’s order, a grievance of the people, a sin inviting Heaven’s retribution. Thus, the strong in arms perish, for the overmighty are doomed to destruction—how could they not perish?\n\nThe people’s birth is gentle and weak,\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: Human life is the gathering of harmonious *qi*.\nTheir death is rigid and strong.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: Human death is the scattering of *qi*—when *qi* scatters, death comes.\n\nAll things—grasses and trees—are gentle and tender in life,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In their birth, plants flourish in bloom.\nBut rigid and withered in death.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In their death, plants wither and decay.\n\nThus, the rigid and strong are doomed to death,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Dao Yuan Chapter] says: The rigid and strong are doomed to death.\nThe gentle and weak are destined to life.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The gentle and weak are destined to life.\n\nThus, the strong in arms cannot prevail,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those who seek rigidity must guard with gentleness;\nThose who seek strength must guard with weakness.\nAccumulated gentleness becomes rigidity,\nAccumulated weakness becomes strength.\nObserve what they accumulate to know their fate—\nThus, the strong in arms perish.\n\nThe rigid tree snaps,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The rigid tree breaks, the rigid hide splits.\nThe mighty fall from their height,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n\n**Chapter on Supreme Virtue (上德篇)**\n\nThe *Laozi* looked upward at the trees in the eaves, then gazed at the rivers below. The strong and rigid trees dwell in the lower eaves, the great in stature occupy the lower branches. The gentle and weak rise above.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The small and slender trees dwell in the higher eaves, the weak and slight occupy the upper branches—like stacking firewood, the smallest is placed on top.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: In ancient times, enlightened rulers governed with moderation, nurtured themselves with restraint, and calculated harvests according to the seasons. They measured the people’s stored provisions, knowing the surplus and deficit, then took only what was needed. Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed and avoided the suffering of hunger and cold.\n\nWhen the people were distressed—those who starved ate food without relish, those who froze endured winter without furs—rulers shared in their hardships. Thus, there were no grieving subjects under Heaven.\n\nIn later ages, who could use their surplus to nourish the world? Only the ancient Dao-bearing rulers could sustain the widows, orphans, and the lonely, following Heaven’s way to aid the people.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the scarce. Is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: A bow is drawn for shooting, yet without a string, it cannot release. Heaven’s shooting requires no bow—it strikes true.\n\nThe high are humbled,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Guard Weakness Section] says: The Dao of Heaven humbles the high.\nThe low are raised;\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven raises the low.\nThe excessive are diminished,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive.\nThe deficient are supplemented.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive to nourish the deficient.\nThe Dao of Earth diminishes the high and benefits the low.\nBut the Dao of humanity is otherwise,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of the ruler is otherwise, differing from Heaven’s diminishing and benefiting.\n\nIt diminishes the deficient,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Yet the people, in their tilling, rely on their wives, children, aged, and weak for sustenance. Facing floods, droughts, and heavy taxes, they struggle to provide.\nTo nourish the excessive.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ruler takes from the people to serve above, seeking only the surplus.\n\nWho can use their surplus to nourish the world?\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, greedy tyrants drain their people to satisfy boundless desires, leaving the masses hungry and cold. Who can nourish the deficient?\n\nOnly the Dao-bearing ones.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The ancient sages took care of the old, weak, orphans, and widows, ensuring all were provided for.\nThus, the sages\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The ancients were complete—they nurtured all things, and their benevolence extended to the people.\n\nThey act without claiming merit,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things rely on it for existence, yet none know its virtue.\nTheir work accomplished, they take no credit,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things complete their work without dwelling on it, yet none know its virtue.\nThey do not seek to be seen as virtuous.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The sage is empty of self, seeing only insufficiency. Seeing insufficiency, they achieve true virtue.\n\n**Chapter 78: The Gentle and Weak of the World**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: The sea does not reject the smallest streams to become great; the forests do not reject the crooked and bent to flourish. The sage does not reject humble words to broaden their name. If speech is true, even a common laborer’s words should not be discarded. If speech is false, even the ruler’s ministers should not be heeded. Right and wrong cannot be judged by rank or status.\n\nWhen the people drown and the ruler does not grieve, he is not a virtuous sovereign. To guard one’s post and die in battle is the duty of a subject. In later ages, few ministers offer sincere loyalty, risking their lives. Those who exhaust their strength and loyalty go unheard.\n\nThus, the ancient sages modeled themselves after water’s gentleness—enduring shame, accepting criticism, and receiving insults. Rulers should emulate water in receiving defilement.\n\nNothing in the world is as gentle and weak as water,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Dao Yuan Section] says: Nothing is as gentle and weak as water.\nYet it conquers the rigid and strong,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—it pierces metal and stone, its strength flows through the world.\nAnd none can overcome it,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped.\nNothing can replace it.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—struck, it leaves no wound; pierced, it suffers no harm; cut, it is not severed; burned, it is not scorched. It flows smoothly, never dispersing.\n\nThus, the gentle overcomes the rigid,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Supreme Virtue Section] says: The *Laozi* saw the tongue and guarded gentleness. Though teeth are firmer than the tongue, they decay first.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Accumulated gentleness becomes rigidity; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Without accumulation, this cannot be.\n\nThe world\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, human nature favors strength and rejects weakness, rigidity and rejects gentleness, yet they do not know their loss and cannot embrace gentleness.\n\nNone know,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The virtuous discern truth and do not trust slander.\nNone can practice it.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: If counsel is ignored, the ruler is unenlightened.\n\nThus, the sage\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after water’s gentleness.\n\nGentleness and frailty, though subtle and seemingly insignificant, thus attain their lofty heights—virtue and renown arise naturally. It says: *\"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the sovereign of the ancestral altars;\"* the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *\"The ancient sages did not seek deeds that might be criticized, nor did they resent others’ censure of themselves. Though the world condemns them, they do not falter.\"*\n\n*\"To bear the state’s calamities is to be called the king of the world.\"* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"In ancient times, the sages allowed those who slandered them to do so, for it was their own fault.\"* Words once spoken cannot be recalled by others; actions begun nearby cannot be restrained from afar. Straight speech seems like perversion. The *Tongxuan Jing˙Upper Virtue Chapter* declares: *\"In later ages, those who speak are silenced by words, those who advise are executed by law—yet such rulers still hope to preserve harmony across all lands. How far they are from wisdom!\"*\n\n**Chapter on Reconciling Great Grievances (79)**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *\"To reconcile great grievances will inevitably leave lingering resentment—how can this be called good?\"* In ancient times, the near were drawn close not by words, the distant not by words; the near were made content, the distant were made to come. To share desires with the people brings harmony; to share their defenses brings stability; to share their thoughts brings understanding; to gain their strength brings wealth; to gain their praise brings renown. In the later ages, actions invite bandits, words invite disaster—no one speaks first, yet others have already conspired behind them. Rumors spreading a thousand miles are a calamity. The tongue is a trigger: once words are spoken, they cannot be recalled, even by four swift horses.\n\nThis exhorts the Warring States to reconcile their grievances, to cease hostilities and not contend, thus achieving universal peace—now that is good. To reconcile great grievances, the *Tongxuan Jing˙Subtle Brilliance Chapter* says: *\"The ancient sages reconciled the world’s grievances, their virtue acting as the binding contract—non-contention was their goodness.\"* There must be lingering resentment—how can this be called good? The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The Warring States lacked the Dao; their conflicts bred resentment—there must be lingering resentment. How can this be called not good?\"* Thus, the sage—\n\nthe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"The ancient sages were fully prepared: to harmonize the world.\"* Holding the left contract, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Yin harms things; yang transforms them.\"* The sage’s Dao follows the brilliance of yang to harmonize the world, follows the darkness of yin to reconcile its grievances and ill-will, yet holds no blame toward others. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The greater the resentment, the deeper the calamity.\"* To harbor resentment without resolution is unheard of. Hence, virtue acts as the binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Accumulated virtue becomes kingship; accumulated stone becomes mountains.\"* Without accumulation, this cannot be. Without virtue, there is no binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Accumulated resentment brings ruin; accumulated water becomes rivers.\"* Without accumulation, this cannot be.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none, always aiding the virtuous. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The Dao of Heaven favors none, only virtue is rewarded.\"*\n\n**Chapter on Small States and Few People (80)**\nThis chapter of the *Zhuangzi* (in the *Inner Chamber of the Chest* section) states: *\"In the ancient age of supreme virtue, the clans of Róngchéng, Dàtíng, Bóhuáng, Zhōngyāng, Lìlù, Líxù, Hèxiū, Zūnlú, Zhùróng, Fúxī, Shénnóng, and Xuānyuán ruled. At that time, the people tied knots in cords for use, relished their food, adorned their dress, found comfort in their dwellings, and delighted in their customs. Neighboring states could see one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs mingled in the air—yet the people lived until old age and death without visiting one another.\"* Such a time, when knots were tied in simplicity and the people were unadorned, universal peace meant supreme governance.\n\nSmall states, few people—the *Tongxuan Jing˙Symbolic Speech Chapter* says: *\"To command ten thousand soldiers is not as good as to hear a single apt word; to possess the pearl of Duke Hòu is not as good as to grasp the proper means of governance; to hold the jade of Héshì is not as good as to align with the fitting course of affairs.\"* Though the world be vast, those who delight in war perish; though the state be stable, those who love contention are in peril. Thus, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them.\n\nThough they possess myriad implements, they do not use them—the *Dònglíng Jing* says: *\"The ancient sage-kings flourished by encouraging agriculture and teaching the people to till the land, to make death weighty and not wander far.\"* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"When Fúxī ruled the world, his virtue gave life without taking it.\"* At that time, there was no heart of profit or harm; the world was at peace. Though there were boats and carriages, there was no need to ride them—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In the age of Shénnóng, when resting he slept soundly, when moving he walked leisurely, the people knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived with deer and elk without malice. This was the peak of supreme virtue.\"*\n\nThough there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Huángdì’s governance of the world refined the essence of sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, balanced the rhythms of the four seasons, established the laws of music and the calendar, distinguished male and female, clarified high and low. Farmers yielded the edges of their fields, and travelers did not pick up lost goods.\"* The people once again tied knots in cords for use—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In the upper antiquity of supreme virtue, there was no action—yet the world was governed with ease, and both ruler and ruled were without strife.\"* The ruler did not act; the people did not act. They relished their food—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The ancient people gathered acorns and chestnuts by day, and found their food sweet—thus they were called the people who knew life.\"* They adorned their dress—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The ancient people did not know clothing, yet in summer they piled firewood, and in winter they burned it—thus their dress was beautiful, and they were called the people who knew life.\"*\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, their clothing was warm yet undecorated. They settled comfortably in their dwellings—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people lived in nests and caves, resting in trees at dusk, finding comfort in their homes, thus they were called the people of the *Youchao Clan*.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times of great peace, neither soldiers nor horses crossed the borders of neighboring states, nor did armored chariot tracks extend beyond a thousand miles—all found comfort in their dwellings. They delighted in their customs—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people delighted in their customs.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, deceit did not arise; they lived in ease without strife, the world at harmony, their customs joyful.\n\nNeighboring states lay in sight—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, neighboring states lay in sight, yet mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no bridges or ferries.\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, the sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another, all creatures thrived in groups, bound to their lands.\nThe people lived until old age—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, the people lived until old age.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not harm the few, so the people preserved their lives and did not die young.\n\nThey did not interact with one another—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people lived alongside deer, hunted for food, and knew how to clothe themselves, with no intent to harm one another. They did not interact—this was the height of virtue.\n\n*\"True words are not ornate\"*—Chapter Eighty-One of *Nanhua Zhenjing* speaks of the ancient Dao/Way and its techniques, which lay in *wuwei* (non-action). Laozi heard its teachings and rejoiced. He established it with the constant *wu* (non-being), governed it with *Taiyi* (Supreme Oneness), taking gentleness, humility, and yielding as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of all things as its substance.\n\nLaozi said: *\"While others take what comes first, I take what comes last—thus I bear the world’s impurities. While others take what is solid, I take what is empty—thus I have no hoarding, and so I have abundance. While others seek fortune, I preserve myself—thus I avoid blame. I root myself in depth, bind myself with restraint, saying: ‘The rigid is destroyed, the sharp is blunted.’ In non-action, I laugh at cleverness, always yielding to things, never harming others—this is the utmost extreme.\"*\n\nLaozi—truly the ancient sage of vast truth!\n\n*\"True words are not ornate,\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the Great Dao was loyal yet simple, and the people had no deceit.\n*\"Ornate words are not true.\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew contracts yet trust declined; they knew machinery yet substance declined. Minor cleverness breaks the Dao, harshness injures virtue.\n\n*\"The good do not argue,\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the Dao was upright, non-action was not perilous, so the people easily followed.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: Knowing without arguing is called the Dao; the Dao brings peace to the people.\n*\"Those who argue are not good.\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew writing yet the Dao declined; minor arguments harmed the upright.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: Knowing and then arguing is called discernment, used to govern people.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: Yet argument is never beneficial.\n\n*\"The wise are not all-knowing,\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times of perfect governance, there was no labor, all were at ease, so the common people were not harmed.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew calculations yet benevolence declined; minor achievements harmed governance.\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: Yet knowledge without breadth is not wisdom.\n\n*\"The sage does not accumulate,\"*\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The sage’s Dao flows without hoarding, thus all under heaven submitted.\nClear in Heaven, harmonious with the sage, with six penetrations and non-action, four openings in emptiness and stillness—those who embody the virtue of the sovereign—things act of themselves. In darkness, there is nothing that is not still.\n\n*\"To accumulate is insufficient; to hoard is to lack.\"*\nThe sage is cautious in what is accumulated.\nHaving given to others—\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: Having given to others, the self becomes ever more abundant.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: If kings and nobles uphold the Yang Dao, all things flourish; if they uphold the Yin Dao, the world perishes. If Yang does not descend to Yin, all things cannot form; if the ruler does not descend to the subject, virtue cannot spread.\n\n*\"The self becomes ever more abundant,\"*\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Yao governed the world, wandering in broad streets, hearing children’s songs:\n*\"Establish our boiling people,\nNone but you are supreme.\"*\nNot knowing, not knowing—\nFollowing the Emperor’s way.\nHaving given to others...\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: Having given to others, the self grows ever more abundant.\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says: Kings and nobles dwell above the people, illuminating virtue and Dao. The noble withdraws from vice and embraces goodness, and the people do not stray far. Thus, the people have choices to depart or remain—when faults are severe, departures increase; when goodness prevails, those who stay grow ever more abundant.\n\n*The Chongxu Jing* says: Yao rejoiced and asked the children, *\"Who taught you to speak thus?\"* The children replied, *\"It is an ancient poem, and all the people sing with full bellies.\"* The Way of Heaven—\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The Heavenly Dao moves without accumulation, and thus all things flourish. It benefits without harming.\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says: The sun rises from the earth, and all things thrive. When thunder moves, all things awaken; when rain nourishes, all things are refreshed.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao—\n\n*The Nanhua Jing* says: The Imperial Dao moves without accumulation, and thus the world unites. The Sage’s mind is still, a mirror of Heaven and Earth, a reflection of all things. The world is at peace. Acting without contention.\n\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says: The noble’s actions resemble the Dao. The movement of Yin and Yang follows fixed rhythms; the noble’s actions do not exhaust things. The wind does not stir without cause, fire does not flare without fuel. The noble does not speak, and the petty cannot fabricate. When fire emerges, it must await kindling; when the noble speaks, it must be true. With truth and sincerity, what cannot be accomplished?\n\n*The Daoist Virtue and Power Classic: Four Masters’ Ancient Dao Exegesis* concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "**The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Preface)**\n\n**Title:** *The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the Dao De Jing*.\n**Author:** Ke Houcai, a man of humble talent.\n**Volume:** Ten.\n**Source of the base text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Tongshen Bu* (洞神部), *Yujue Leisure* (玉诀类).\n**Collated edition:** *Wuqiu Beiqing* (无求备斋) shadow-printed *Daozang Jiyao* (道藏辑要) from Qing Jiang Yutang’s publication (hereafter referred to as the *Qingkan Ben* 清刊本).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\nI, your servant, am a nameless rustic from the marshes, one who has never sought advancement nor cared for worldly gain.\nUpon reaching adulthood, I became deeply enamored with the pleasures of tranquility and simplicity, delving into the arts of *Dan Jing* (内丹经, Inner Alchemy) and divination.\nIn my later years, I read the works of ancient scholars, pored over the teachings of the *Zi* (诸子, Hundred Schools), and probed the profound mysteries of *Zhuangzi’s* (庄子) *Dao*, finding meaning in every passage—truly profound and far-reaching.\n\nObserving the interpretations and annotations of other schools, I found their words often frivolous and extravagant, giving rise to conflicting doctrines, where red and purple (orthodox and heterodox) are indiscriminately mingled. Alas, they stray so far from the original Dao of antiquity, losing its true essence—how lamentable!\n\nOnly the works of the four masters—*Zhuangzi* (庄), *Liezi* (列), *Wenzi* (文), and *Gengzi* (庚)—are the true teachings of the *Five Thousand Words* (五千言), passed down directly by *Laozi’s* (老氏) disciples, each expounding upon the same Dao with consistent intent.\nThe other commentaries, though numerous and verbose, merely rely on ink and speech for their claims, offering no substance, no grounding in truth—how can they compare with the four masters?\n\nIn my youth, I once followed the court and wandered the capital, where I had the fortune to encounter the lofty Dao.\nThe lecturers there touched lightly upon the *玄关* (Xuan Guan, Mystic Pass), yet spoke only of emptiness and voidness, unable to convey even a fragment of the true Dao.\nReflecting inwardly, I felt no guilt, for my own understanding of the Dao was deep and self-attained.\nI wished to rescue the multitude from their manifold obstructions, to mourn the Way’s failure to prevail, yet feared that those ensnared in doubt and confusion might rise in noisy contention.\nThus, I gathered the four masters’ works, cited the authentic *Jing* (经), and compiled them into one volume—ten in total—\nto dismantle the redundant claims of others, and named it *The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary*.\n\nI also wrote *Ten Volumes of Commentary on the Classics and Histories* (述经史疏十卷) to serve as its counterpart.\nNow, by fortune, this discourse is complete.\nI do not presume to rely solely on my own conjectures,\nbut hope it may benefit both those of my own time and as a lesson for all ages.\nMay those of goodwill not scorn it,\nand in moments of rest, take up their brushes and record it directly.\n\nComposed on the first day of the Year of *Jǐhài* (己亥, 1915) in the *Dàdìng* (大定) era,\nby **Ke Houcai** (古襄寇才质), with reverence.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of\" (道可道)**\n\nThis chapter in the *Nanhua Jing* (南华经, *Zhuangzi*) states:\n*\"The silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth—without action—are what the ancients held in highest regard,\nand what the Three Sovereigns (三皇) shared in common.\"*\n\nWhat did the ancient rulers of the world do?\nThey simply followed *Heaven and Earth’s* (天地) Dao of non-action.\n\nIn antiquity, the *Great Dao* (大道) was not named, and great eloquence was not spoken of.\nThe *Great Dao* was manifest yet not proclaimed,\nand words were eloquent yet did not reach their full extent.\nWho in later ages understood the unspoken teaching and the unspeakable Dao?\nIf any could grasp it, then this is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao of non-action,\nand the silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven’s nature is without desire,\nand non-action brings forth transformation naturally—\nno teaching, no speech.\nThe Dao that can be spoken of—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经, *Dao Yuan* 道原篇) says:\n*\"The affairs of benevolence and righteousness arise from human contrivance,\nresponding to changes and moving with the times—\nchanges that come from the seasons, where nothing is constant.\nThus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\"*\n\nNot the constant Dao—\n*The Dongling Jing* (洞灵经) says:\n*\"The later ages’ Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, and human affairs—\nthe so-called ‘teaching that can be spoken of’—\nis merely an adornment of words and a failure of governance,\nnot the constant Dao.\"*\n\nThe name that can be named—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The study of books arises from human speech,\nwhich comes from wisdom—\nyet wisdom is deceitful and false,\nknowing nothing of the Dao.*\nThose words inscribed on bamboo and silk,\nor carved into metal and stone,\nthat can be passed down to others—\nthese are not the true treasures of the Dao.\nThus, the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"*\n\nNot the constant name—\n*The Dongling Zhenjing* (洞灵真经) says:\n*\"In later ages, many recite medical texts,\nor study arts and crafts,\ncalling their spoken explanations ‘words that can be spoken of’—\nmere clever embellishments, not the true words.\"*\n\nWithout name, there is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Without name, there is no form,\nand the Great Dao without form is stillness and non-action.*\nThe Dao of constancy, the unspeakable Dao—\nvast and profound indeed!\nThis is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao without teaching.\"*\n\nWith name, there is the mother of all things—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"With name, there is form,\nand Heaven and Earth with form are stillness yet without speech.*\nThe constant speech, the unspeakable words—\nvast and profound indeed!\nThis is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Heaven and Earth without speech.\"*\n\nConstantly without desire, one may observe its mysteries—\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"There is the Dao of Heaven,\nwhich is honored through non-action.*\nHeaven and Earth possess great wisdom,\nyet remain detached and effortless.\nThe Great Dao is non-action,\nits mysteries unfolding naturally.\"*\n\nConstantly with desire, one may observe its perils—\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"There is the Dao of humanity,\nwhich is humbled through action.*\nHumans cultivate petty wisdom,\nyet remain detached and effortful.\nThe Dao of humanity is action,\nits perils born of contrivance.*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Action leads to harm and peril—\nthis is the end of contrivance.\"*\n\nThese two Dao—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"Following Heaven is playing with the Dao,\nwhile following humanity is mere worldly learning.*\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity—\nhow distant they are!\nOne must not fail to discern them.\"*\n\n**Shared Origin—**\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Unite differences to form the same.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Sage engages in teaching,\nuniting hearts and aligning paths.\"*\n\n**Yet with Different Names—**\n*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:\n*\"Dissolve the same to form differences.\"*\n*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:\n*\"The Five Emperors and Three Kings of later ages pursued different affairs and divergent paths,\nthe Five Emperors differing in Dao yet bringing ruin to the world,\nthe Three Kings differing in affairs yet adapting to the times and changing their words.\"*",

*Mati* [or *Mashui*] says:\nIn my view, the ancients who governed well did not rely on fixed rules.\nThe people of old had natural inclinations—\nthey wove and clothed themselves,\nthey tilled and fed themselves—\nthis was called harmony of virtue.\nUnified yet without factions,\nthis was called Heaven’s release—\nthe people were pure and simple, without artifice or craft.\nLater generations, the potters said:\n“I excel in shaping clay—\nround forms conform to the compass,\nsquare forms to the square.”\nThe carpenters said:\n“I excel in working wood—\ncurved forms fit the hook,\nstraight forms align with the plumb.”\nYet clay and wood by nature do not seek to conform to compass, square, hook, or plumb—\nand yet ages praise them as “the potter and carpenter excel in shaping clay and wood.”\nThus, they fostered artifice and deceit—\nthis too is how later rulers, teaching the crafts of earth and wood,\nexceeded in artifice and deceit.\nIn ancient times, white jade was left uncarved—\nwho would make it into *gui* or *zhang*?\nPure simplicity was left unbroken—\nwho would carve it into sacrificial vessels?\nThus, to ruin simplicity for tools—\nthis was the excess of later artisans’ craft.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the age of perfect governance,\nplain and undyed carriages and garments made people envious,\ndesires were sparse and light—\npeople took joy in their labor and service.\nThis was the foundation of governing the state.\nIn the decadent later ages,\nornate and elaborate carriages and garments made the vulgar emulate them—\npeople lost sincerity and purity, shaming simplicity while valuing extravagance.\nTo shame simplicity and value extravagance—\nthis is called the *fufu* (floating and insubstantial),\nthe ladder to a state’s ruin.\nThus, in later ages, the Five Emperors introduced carriages, dwellings, and the three implements—\nthey shamed simplicity and valued extravagance.\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\n*The Tongxuan Jing*

use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater artisans indulged in elaborate craft—\ncarriages became extravagantly carved,\ntaking years to complete,\nbenefiting expense more than use.\nTo mold clay into vessels,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient governance, artisans did not indulge in excess craft—\ntheir vessels were plain and undecorated.\nWhen their essence was absent,\nthe vessel’s use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater artisans indulged in elaborate craft—\nvessels became excessively carved and inlaid,\ntaking years to complete,\nbenefiting expense more than use.\nTo pierce doors and windows for dwellings,\n*The Nanhuajing* says:\nAnciently, they dwelled in nests and caves—\ncalled the *Youcang* (Nest-Dwelling) clan,\neating acorns and chestnuts by day,\nsheltering in trees by night.\nWhen their essence was absent,\nthe dwelling’s use emerged.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nLater, under a single ruler’s authority,\nthey exhausted the people’s strength to indulge the senses—\ntheir ambitions fixed on palaces, pavilions, ponds, and enclosures.\n*The Dongling Jing* says:\nTo seize control of affairs through earthworks—\nthis is called great calamity.\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nQi and Lu abounded in ingenuity,\nwith masters of earth and wood.\nThus, they took what was present as profit—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nNow, shaped tools serve their purposes.\nTo serve purposes is to complete tools.\nThus, labor yields profit,\nbut useful tools destroy the Way.\nTo take what is absent as use—\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient Way was formless—\nthis was the beginning.\nThe beginning was simplicity.\nThus, the unnamed was taken as use—\nto use simplicity is to avoid tools.\n\n**The Chapter of the Five Colors (Chapter Twelve)**\nThis chapter from the *Nanhuajing* says:\nIn ancient times, perfect joy lay in preserving life,\nmerely by preserving non-action.\nBut people of the later ages—\nwho among them could attain non-action?\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue.\nWhat they delight in are bodily ease, rich flavors,\nfine garments, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds.\nWhat they despise are poverty, lowliness, and evil.\nWhat they suffer are:\nthe body not at ease,\nthe mouth not tasting rich flavors,\nthe form not adorned in fine garments,\nthe eyes not feasting on beautiful colors,\nthe ears not hearing

      "translated_text": "**Volume III, *The Essence of the Dao and Upholding Non-Action*: *Ancient Shang’s Talent and Quality***\n\n**Chapter Seventeen of the *Tao/Way*’s Supreme Perfection**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings addressed flaws and reformed institutions,\ncompleted matters and then altered their approach;\ntheir excellence lay in harmony,\ntheir shortcoming in *authoritative measures* (权).\nLater generations’ Dao says:\nWithout laws, governance cannot be established;\nwithout knowing *rites and moral principles* (礼义), laws cannot be formed.\nLaws can kill the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\ncan punish thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above,\nthey clearly showed what was good and evil,\nguided the people with *non-punitive* (经非誉) instruction,\nadvanced the worthy and virtuous,\nrelegated the unworthy and base,\nand laid aside punishments, never using them.\nThe Three Kings made the world fear punishments and dare not steal or plunder—\nhow could this compare to the ancient Dao’s simplicity and purity,\nwhere there was no thievish heart at all?\nTeaching should not be harsh;\nremoving harshness brings self-regulation.\nIf one does not know the principle of *non-action* (无为) for the individual,\nbut instead relies on *punishments and governance* (刑政) as a remedy,\nthis is no different from\ndigging a channel to stop water,\nembracing firewood to extinguish flames—\nthe more you add, the more it overflows;\nthus, *stirring to calm* (扬止沸) only makes the disturbance worse.\nThose who know the principle of *non-action* governance\nneed only remove the fire.\nHence it is said:\n*I uphold non-action and the people transform themselves,*\n*I love stillness and the people become upright.*\nThe Supreme Perfection—\nthe people below know its existence.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing*’s *Natural Chapter* (□自然篇) says:\nThe Supreme Perfection is *spontaneous transformation* (神化);\nin ancient times, the Three Sovereigns (三皇) nurtured this transformation,\nissuing no commands yet the people followed.\nWhen the sage-kings ruled above,\nthey clearly showed what was good and evil,\nlaid aside punishments, never using them—\nthis was the foundation of governance.\nCourts were uncluttered, with no litigious disputes,\nfields were cultivated, with no pretense of martial tools;\nthus, the Supreme Perfection—\nthe people below know its existence.\n\n**The Next Level:**\nThey were close to them and praised them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe next level was the Five Emperors (五帝), who issued commands,\npreventing wrongdoing but without rewards or punishments.\nThe next level:\nThey were feared and reviled by them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe next level was the Three Kings (三王), who relied on punishments and rewards,\nlevying punishments to suppress violence,\ngranting rewards to encourage virtue.\nThe people feared punishments and dared not act wrongly—\nthis was not *law and order* (法令) being upright above,\nbut the people below submitting in fear;\nthis was the end of governance.\n*Trust was insufficient,*\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*When words are the same, trust lies in their sincerity—*\n*sincerity precedes words;*\n*when commands are the same, obedience lies in their truth—*\n*truth lies beyond the commands.*\nThe Xia ruler did not break his word,\nthe Shang people swore oaths,\nthe Zhou people made alliances.\nYet there were still cases of dishonesty.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nThis shows that the world’s dishonesty\ncomes from rulers not being diligent and clear.\n*It was because they valued words.*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*When the ruler speaks, the subjects act;*\n*when the subjects speak, the ruler acts.*\n*When the ruler speaks, it is always applied;*\n*when the subjects speak, it is applied contingently.*\nAncient sage-kings knew how to use *contingent measures* (权),\nso when they spoke, it must be believed,\nand their words must always be fulfilled.\nWhen their deeds were accomplished and their purposes realized,\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*Ancient sage-kings*\n*refined themselves inwardly*\n*and governed the people outwardly;*\n*when their deeds were accomplished and their purposes established,*\n*they dwelled beside Heaven,*\n*upholding non-action yet achieving all things.*\nThe people said they acted *spontaneously*.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*Sincerity is the word of the virtuous;*\n*loyalty is the intention of the virtuous.*\nWhen loyalty and sincerity manifest inwardly,\nthey move and respond outwardly—\nthis is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:\nIn ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,\nthe time of *He Xiu* (赫胥氏),\nthe people did not know what to do,\ntheir actions had no fixed direction;\nthey carried their food in their mouths and walked joyfully,\nthey drummed their bellies and wandered at ease.\nThe people could thus remain pure and simple,\npossessing loyalty and filial piety.\nWhen the Three Kings (三王) suspended *benevolence and righteousness* (仁义) to soothe the world’s hearts,\nthe Great Dao declined, yet *benevolence and righteousness* arose,\nand the six relationships (六亲) became discordant.\nThen the Five Hegemons (五霸) bent and twisted *rites and music* (礼乐) to rectify the world’s punishments,\nand *wisdom* emerged, bringing great *deceit* (伪).\nStates became chaotic and confused,\nand the people began to strain for cleverness,\ncompeting to gather *skillful advantages* (巧利),\nunable to be restrained.\nThis was also the fault of the Three Kings’ *benevolence and righteousness*—\nthough they achieved minor success,\ntheir teaching of cleverness and wisdom bred *thieves and deceit* (贼诈) among the people.\nThe Three Kings relied on *punishments and governance* (刑政) under the pretense of the Dao,\nand took shelter in *righteousness* (义).\n*Benevolence and righteousness* were the Three Kings’ *temporary dwelling* (蓬庐),\nsufficient only for a night’s stay,\nnot for long-term residence—\nthey were not the enduring Dao.\nWhen the Great Dao declined,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*rectitude was natural, yet they did not call it benevolence;*\n*mutual love was natural, yet they did not call it righteousness.*\n*Following one’s nature was called the Dao;*\n*attaining one’s natural endowment was called virtue/power (德).*\nThus, the Five Emperors’ Dao dispersed into human virtue/power (德).\n*Benevolence and righteousness* arose;\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Three Kings’ virtue overflowed into *benevolence and righteousness*,\nand when *benevolence and righteousness* were established,\nthe Dao and its virtue/power (德) declined.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The Three Kings’ governance of the world*\n*was called \"benevolence and righteousness through action,\"*\n*and their governance brought the greatest chaos.*\nWhen *benevolence and righteousness* advanced the worthy,\nthe people turned to *mutual deceit* (相贼),\ninsufficient to enrich the people—\nsons began to kill their fathers.\n\nWhen *wisdom* emerged,\nthe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\n*The Five Hegemons’ Dao narrowed,*\n*later relying on rites and wisdom.*\nThose who relied on wisdom\nbrought disorder to the hearts of the people;\nthe wise produced *fraudulence* (奸),\nand *fraudulent customs* (奸俗) became the wind of *state collapse* (亡国).\n*Great deceit* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*When the Five Hegemons’ rites and music spread widely,*\n*the seven states waged war with their armies,*\n*and the world fell into chaos.*\nWhen rites and music relied on wisdom,\nthe people turned to *mutual deceit* (相盗),\ninsufficient to enrich the people—\nsubjects began to kill their rulers.\n\nWhen the six relationships (六亲) became discordant,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The six relationships were discordant,*\n*the old and young lacked order—*\n*this was the concern of the common people.*\n*Filial piety and kindness* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*filial sons did not flatter their parents—*\n*this was the height of a son’s virtue;*\n*serving one’s parents brought kindness and filial piety.*\n\nWhen states became chaotic and confused,\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*The court lacked loyal ministers—*\n*this was the concern of chaotic states and the lords.*\n*Loyal ministers* arose;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*\n*loyal ministers did not flatter their rulers—*\n*this was the height of a minister’s virtue;*\n*serving one’s ruler brought loyalty and steadfastness.*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Nineteen: \"Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom\"**\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sages established teachings and governed by first examining their ultimate outcomes, seeing how they fostered virtue. In later ages, when the people knew scriptures, the Dao declined; when they knew calculations, virtue declined; when they knew contracts, trust declined; when they knew mechanical arts, substance declined.\n\nMinor cleverness harms the true; minor skill harms the Way; petty debate ruins governance; harshness injures virtue. In ancient times, the Great Way was unobstructed and straightforward, so the people were easily guided. In the age of perfect governance, all were at ease, so the lower ranks did not harm the higher. In the age of supreme loyalty, they returned to simplicity, and the people had no deceit or concealment.\n\nWhen they composed written records, it was to oversee and manage all affairs—so the simple remembered, and the wise recorded events. But when [governance] declined, they used deceitful writings to exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent.\n\nThose who scrutinize the traces of ink and parchment do not know the principle of non-action as the root of order and chaos. Cunning and deceit took root, thieves and bandits multiplied, and the more the ruler desired, the more the people schemed.\n\nTo use writing and cleverness to generate solutions is like stirring water and hoping for clarity—it is difficult. Thus, to stop the boiling, one removes the fire. Those who know the principle of non-action as the root of governance say: *\"I take no action, yet the people govern themselves.\"*\n\n**Discard the Sage, abandon wisdom.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in the sage? That aids the people’s artifices.\nDo you delight in wisdom? That aids the people’s flaws.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Discard the sage, abandon wisdom, and the world will flourish greatly. The people’s benefit will be a hundredfold.\"*\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nScholars of writing are the source of speech. Speech arises from wisdom, and the clever, though skilled in deceit, do not know the Dao. The people become chaotic through falsehood.\n\n**Discard benevolence, abandon righteousness.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in benevolence? That disrupts the people’s virtue.\nDo you delight in righteousness? That contradicts the people’s natural order.\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAbandoning benevolence and righteousness, the people revert to filial piety and kindness, and thus the world’s virtue begins to harmonize in its primal unity. When people embrace their inherent virtue, the world becomes unerring.\n\n**Discard cleverness, abandon profit.**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nAnd yet, do you delight in ritual? That aids the people’s artifices.\nDo you delight in music? That aids the people’s excesses.\nDo you delight in sharp hearing? That makes the people indulge in sound.\nDo you delight in bright vision? That makes the people indulge in color.\nThen thieves and bandits will cease.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—selecting the worthy and employing the wise—are insufficient to enrich the people. The people are overly eager for profit, stealing even in broad daylight, digging through walls at noon. Thus it is said: *\"Discard cleverness, abandon profit, and great thefts will cease.\"*\n\nThese three [principles]—\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nWhen the people’s strength and wisdom are exhausted, they rely on deceit. The more they scheme, the more falsehood spreads, and how can the common people avoid it? When strength is insufficient, they resort to deceit; when wisdom is insufficient, they resort to cunning. If deceit and falsehood prevail, whom can one blame? Blame the ruler’s fondness for cleverness and wisdom.\n\nThey say: *\"The written word is insufficient,\"*\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nTo value ornate language, to discard substance, to drown in cleverness—this is when the people begin to be confused by superficiality. Without returning to their true nature, it is insufficient to enrich the people.\nThus, this is what is said today.",

them with due timing and reverence,\nAs if standing at the edge of a deep abyss,\nAs if walking on thin ice.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nThe good are my nurtured kin,\nThe unrighteous are my

Common Folk Rejoice**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, when rulers employ people,\nThey value those whose ears hear well,\nWhose eyes see clearly,\nWhose words can be spoken—\nThus, the people compete to gain praise,\nAdorning their speech to be heard—\nGovernance fails.\n\n**Like Feasting on the Grand Sacrifice**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□Ji Cheng] says:\nThrough diligent and laborious cultivation,\nTen days without food,\nYet it is like feasting on the grand sacrifice—\nLearning without satiety,\nThis is how one sustains oneself.\n\n**Like Ascending Spring Terrace**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn the latter ages, when rulers employ people,\nThey value those whose ears hear well—\nThen the people transport goods for profit,\nCompeting for praise.\nThey value those whose eyes see clearly—\nThen the people display their forms and skills,\nStriving to advance.\nThey value those whose words can be spoken—\nThen the people practice flattery,\nAdorning their speech.\n\n**I Alone Fear**\nThe *Dongling Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings employed people\nWho were valued not for what their ears heard,\nNot for what their eyes saw,\nNot for what their mouths could speak—\nYet the people acted effortlessly and naturally.\n\n---\n**Its Onset Unseen**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\nScholars learn what they should not learn—\nUntil they attain the Dao—\nLike an infant before it knows harm.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says:\nA three-month-old infant,\nUnknowing of gain or loss,\nUnspeaking yet transformative—\nHow vast is this change!",

gate,\nGain and harm reverse each other—\nOne must not fail to discern them.\nSome advance, some follow,\n*The Chongxu Jing* says:\nSome are long, some are short.\nSome warm, some chill,\n*The Chongxu

grow strong,\nAnd so can complete his kingship,\nAnd Heaven under Heaven endures long.\n\nAvoiding extravagance,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of moderation lies in rejecting excess,\nThus the Sage rejects extravagance and luxury,\nDares not be proud or wasteful,\nAnd so can endure long.\n\nAvoiding arrogance.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe root of avoiding arrogance lies in emptiness and nothingness,\nThus the Sage rejects arrogance and excess,\nDares not be proud or overflowing,\nAnd so can endure long.\n\n---\n**Chapter 30: \"Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way\"**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:\nThe ministers of the Seven Kingdoms raised unrighteous arms,\nUntil corpses lay piled and blood flowed,\nClashing before one another.\nWhere wars arise, Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder—\nThe path of loving valor leads to peril and ruin.\n\nArms are cruel instruments.\nWarfare is a perilous affair.\nRinging bells to destroy oneself,\nBurning candles to scorch oneself—\nThe brave perish by their strength,\nThe eloquent perish by their cleverness.\nMen die violently, not by fate,\nCrushing few against many,\nWeak against strong—\nArms kill them together.\nThe path of loving war leads to peril and ruin.\n\nNow the Seven Kingdoms’ rebellious ministers love war and battle,\nAnd Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder.\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, ministers governed the state,\nRuled within their borders,\nPracticed **virtue/power** and morality,\nSpread benevolence and bestow favors—\nThis was the highest path.\nThey did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, deceit did not arise,\nPeace and ease knew no strife,\nHeaven under Heaven was at peace,\nThe wise had no place to display their cleverness,\nThe brave had no place to wield their might—\nThey did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven.\nTheir affairs returned to goodness.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Warring States resorted to arms for self-preservation,\nDeceitful men flattered and schemed in secret,\nHastily provoking the ruler to use their #1,\nAnd the chaotic aided their schemes.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe Seven Kingdoms raised arms in difficulty,\nNo leisurely steps on the road,\nNo standing crops in the fields,\nThorns and brambles grow.\nAfter a great army passes, there will surely be years of famine.\n*The Tongxuan Jing [Weiming Section]* says:\nRaising ten thousand soldiers costs a thousand gold daily,\nAfter the army’s departure, there will surely be years of famine.\n\nThus the virtuous are resolute yet yield,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe advantage of arms is not sufficient to rely upon for strength.\nThey dare not take strength from it.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, the brave dared not act recklessly and thus lived.\nResolute yet not boastful,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness\nDared not rely on strength,\nThus they could boast.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nThe ancient brave did not use force violently,\nThis may be called being one with the Dao/Way.\nResolute yet unavoidable,\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nWhen the enemy attacks and one is forced to act.\nThis is resolute yet not strong.\n*The Tongxuan Jing* says:\nIn ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness\nWere the living—\nHeaven under Heaven

*Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\ntheir actions were measured and deliberate,\ntheir enlightenment effortless and natural.\nThus, the true gentleman—\n\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThus, the true gentleman remains serene without thought,\nunconcerned without care,\nwalks where no path exists,\nwanders without weariness,\nexits without gates,\nenters without

the Dao’s virtue.\n\nThe Master said:\nTo act in benevolence is to govern through human sorrow and joy,\nto act in righteousness is to take and give based on human affairs.\nYet sorrow and joy cannot spread universally,\nand exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the extravagance of all people.\nThus, knowing is inferior to practicing the Dao and embodying virtue,\naligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth—\nall things will then self-regulate,\nand the world will be sustained.\nBenevolence and righteousness cling to human sentiment,\nso they are thin—\nhence the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in ornament.\n\nHe abides in truth, not in its trappings.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng*—Wénzǐ asked the Master:\nWhy do later ages use benevolence, righteousness, and ritual to justify war and punishment?\nBecause they are thin compared to the Dao’s virtue.\n\nThe Master said:\nAncient times followed nature’s course, calling it the Dao,\nand realized its inherent nature, calling it virtue.\nWhen virtue and the Dao were pure and profound,\nwar and punishment were unnecessary.\nIn later ages, virtue and nature were lost,\nso benevolence and righteousness were employed—\nbut when these were shallow and insubstantial,\nwar and punishment were resorted to.\nThus, the true gentleman abides in truth, not in its trappings.\nHence, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nHence, he discards the latter and embraces the former,\nand Heaven’s calamities do not arise.\nHe who gains this forgets the other,\nand thus misfortune departs, blessings come.\n\nThe chapter *\"Obtaining the One\"* (39th):\nThis chapter of the *Tōng Xuān Jīng* speaks:\nIn the most ancient age, the sage cultivated virtue beyond praise,\nnot seeking others’ praise,\nbut what he used to win the world—\nit was not about occupying power or bearing noble titles,\nbut about mastering the heart’s governance over the world,\nand harnessing its natural force.\nLater ages had the name \"ruler,\" yet lacked even one man’s praise,\nand thus lost the world.\nJié and Zhòu did not rule as kings,\nShāng and Wǔ did not act as rebels.\nIn ancient times, the sage received countless praises of the world,\nyet it did not make him better—\ntrue praise is no praise,\nand he grasped the essence of the Dao.\nWithout praise, he embodied Heaven’s will,\nand thus the world endured long.\n\nThe chapter *\"Obtaining the One\"*:\nThe *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:\nThe Dao has no form or boundary,\none *qi* transforms into nine variations,\nwhich then return to one.\nThis One—\nthe origin of all transformations in Heaven, Earth, and beings.\nHeaven obtains the One to remain clear.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nHeaven acts without doing, and thus remains clear.\n\nEarth obtains the One to remain tranquil.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nEarth acts without doing, and thus remains tranquil.\n\nThe spirit obtains the One to become responsive.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nHe who is serene, unadorned, still, and without action—\nthis is the way to nourish the spirit,\nso that worries cannot intrude,\nand malevolent *qi* cannot assail,\nand longevity is attained.\nOnce, Guāngchéngzǐ attained this from the Dao,\nand lived a thousand two hundred years without aging.\n\nThe valley obtains the One to remain full.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nA hundred rivers flow together,\nyet if they do not empty into the sea, they are not valleys.\nThe source of rivers and seas is deep,\nflowing without ceasing.\nAll things obtain the One to flourish.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nAll things cannot but thrive—\nis this not their Dao?\n\nRulers obtain the One to govern the world.\nThe *Dònglíng Jīng* says:\nAncient rulers did not prize their ceremonies,\nnor did they seek praise—\nthese were truly discerning.\nTheir governance—\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nWhen governance is unified, it is not divided.\nHeaven, without remaining clear, would fear fragmentation.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* is divided, it forms a rainbow,\nand the sun cannot endure.\nWinter and summer alternate,\nmoons forget their days,\nsuns forget their nights.\n\nEarth, without remaining tranquil, would fear upheaval.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen Earth’s *qi* is divided, it leaks and conceals,\nand the moon cannot endure.\n\nThe spirit, without remaining responsive, would fear exhaustion.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen a man’s *qi* is divided, he falls ill—\nhis body labors without rest, and thus exhausts,\nhis spirit is used without cessation, and thus perishes.\nThe spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, and overthinking—\nwhen the spirit is spent, the body dies.\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\nWhen the body labors without rest, it becomes worn,\nwhen the spirit is used without cessation, it becomes strained—\nstrain leads to depletion,\nand depletion leads to extinction.\n\nThe valley, without remaining full, would fear drying up.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nDitches and ponds overflow in floods,\nand wither in drought—\nwhen rivers dry, valleys become empty,\nand hills level while depths are sealed.\n\nAll things, without flourishing, would fear annihilation.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nWhen things thrive, they bear flowers and fruit—\nwhen things die, they wither and decay.\n\nRulers, without attaining true elevation, would fear decline.\nThe *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:\nThose in high station must not be arrogant—\nelevated yet not precarious,\nfull yet not overflowing—\nthis is how one endures wealth and honor.\nIf precarious, elevated, full, yet overflowing,\nthey cannot endure long.\n\nThus, elevation is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on

principles?\n\nThe waters of the world are none greater than the sea—\nall streams flow into it,\nyet it does not know when to stop and overflows not;\nits ebb drains it,\nyet it does not know when to cease and empties not.\nSpring and autumn remain unchanged,\nand it knows not drought or flood.\nIts currents surpass the rivers and seas—\nthis cannot be measured.\n\nYet I have never boasted of this,\nfor I compare my form to heaven and earth,\nand receive my *qi* from yin and yang.\nI exist between heaven and earth,\nlike a small stone or small tree in a great mountain.\nWhile my existence is visible,\nmy understanding is limited—\nhow dare I boast?\n\nConsidering the vastness of the four seas within heaven and earth,\nit is not like stacked emptiness in the great marshes—\nhow could it be vast?\nConsidering the multitude of China within the sea,\nit is not like scattered grains in the great granary—\nhow could it be many?\nConsidering the abundance of people and things in the nine regions,\nit is not like hairs and fur on a horse’s body—\nhow could it be abundant?\n\nThe five Emperors’ dominions,\nthe three Kings’ struggles,\nthe benevolent’s worries,\nthe capable’s labors—\nall are bounded by greatness and smallness.\n\nSeeking the utmost greatness with their utmost smallness,\nthey are thus confused and cannot find themselves.\nFrom this perspective,\nhow can they know that heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the utmost greatness?\nThe one who views greatness from the small\nbecomes lost in himself—\nnot laughing is not enough to be the Dao.\n\nThe *Nán Huá Jīng* recounts how the debater Gōngsūn Lóng questioned Prince Móu of Wèi:\n“I was young when I learned my Master’s Dao,\nand grew long in understanding the practice of benevolence and righteousness.\nI harmonize what is same,\nseparate what is different,\nand exhaust the arguments of all mouths—\nthus I laugh at Zhūangzǐ’s words,\nwhich seem vague and contradictory.”\n\nPrince Móu reclined, sighed deeply,\nand laughed toward heaven:\n“Have you not heard of the frog of a well?\nTo the turtle of the Eastern Sea, I say:\n‘I delight in the great and boundless—\nwhy does my Master not come to observe it?’\n\nBefore the Eastern Sea turtle’s left foot had entered,\nits right knee was already bound—\nthus it hesitated and withdrew,\ntelling the frog of its sea:\n‘A distance of a thousand *lǐ*,\nis not enough to display its greatness;\na height of a thousand *rèn*,\nis not enough to exhaust its depth.’\n\nThe frog of the well, hearing this,\nwas startled and lost in confusion.\n\nObserving Zhūangzǐ’s most wondrous words,\nyou are content with a moment’s gain—\nare you not the frog of the well?\n\nYou now seek it with careful scrutiny,\nand probe it with argumentative skill—\nthis is truly like using a tube to view heaven,\nor a needle to point at earth—\nis it not small?\n\n#2 Away you go!\n\nGōngsūn Lóng’s mouth gaped but could not close,\nhis tongue rose but could not descend—\nthus he faltered and fled.",

      "translated_text": "Zhì Zhī spoke thus:\n\n*\"The* South Flower Sutra *records: Zhī Zhī said to Confucius: ‘I have heard that in antiquity, men tilled to eat and wove to clothe, with no hearts of mutual harm or slaughter—this was the height of virtue’s flourishing, the world at great peace. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not attain this virtue, and fought with Xiōng Yóu at Zhúlù’s wilds, staining the earth a hundred *lǐ* with blood. The Tang and Yú ruled, established ministers, the Shāng king was overthrown, the Wǔ king slew Jié. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, the many tyrannized the few. The kings of Shāng and Zhōu onward were but agents of chaos—how could they be worthy of veneration?\n\nNow you, refining the ways of the martial and the literary, wielding the world’s arguments to teach posterity—your robes are patched, your sash frayed, your conduct thin and insincere. You have lost the ancient simplicity, and the world is in disarray.\n\n**Clarity of the Way seems obscured.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies aligned their inner selves with the Dao, doing good without contrivance, and took Heaven as their companion. The worthies of today, though outwardly conforming to rites and respectful in action, take humanity as their companion.\n\n**Advancing the Way seems like retreat.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies cultivated non-action within, yet did not contrive without. The worthies of today contrive without, yet do not cultivate non-action within.\n\n**The Way’s rectitude seems crooked.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancients transformed outwardly yet remained untransformed within—they guarded their inner purity without contriving for the outer world. The worthies of today are transformed within yet untransformed without—they guard the outer world with contrivance, yet neglect their inner selves.\n\n**Great virtue seems like a valley.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient worthies savored the Dao without abandoning it. The worthies of today abandon the Dao without savoring it. To forsake the Way and rely on learning is perilous; to discard virtue and employ talent is to invite ruin.\n\n**Pure white seems like shame.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, though pure and unadorned, were called ‘great white’ as if shamed. They returned to simplicity, their essence unspoiled. The worthies of later ages, treating cleverness as governance, labor their minds yet fail to enlighten; those who rely on wit, though they strain their hearts, achieve nothing.\n\n**Ample virtue seems insufficient.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity had virtue so vast it seemed lacking. *The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The superior worthies had virtue so broad it seemed insufficient. Yet today’s worthies, though they master a single learning or refine a single skill, can only offer partial explanations—unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.\n\n**Great sound is rare in voice.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose Dao was most vast, had no sound or voice—they returned to simplicity at their end, and the people acted without guile. The worthies of later ages, though they excel in minor arts, break harmony; those skilled in trifles lose their naturalness. To debate a single phrase, to master a single technique—though one may speak eloquently, it is unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.\n\n**Great form has no shape.**\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose simplicity was most vast, had no fixed form. Their eyes, though clear, did not see; their ears, though still, did not hear. Their mouths, though closed, did not speak; their hearts, though at rest, did not scheme. They abandoned cleverness, returned to the uncarved block, preserved their spirit, discarded knowledge—neither liking nor disliking—this is called Great Harmony. The Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\n*The* South Flower Sutra *says: To revere antiquity while belittling the present is the way of the shallow scholar. Yet if one views the present through the lens of the Jié Wéi lineage, who could avoid eccentric learning? Only the truly wise, with profound virtue and perfect humanity, can wander the world in the Dao without eccentricity, follow humanity with non-action without losing their true nature. They do not teach through cleverness, nor do they cling to learning—they receive meaning from the Dao, not from study.\n\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: To dwell in obscurity, speak in silence, govern with non-action, yet see deeds accomplished without knowing how—this is the Dao of the Sage.\n\nFor only the Dao—\n*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient true worthies were those whose nature aligned with the Dao. They cultivated within yet did not contrive without, wandering the roots of Heaven and Earth. Unconcerned with the dust of the world, they roamed freely in the business of non-doing. Mechanical cleverness did not burden their minds; they knew without learning, saw without looking, achieved without action, spoke eloquently without effort—adrift in non-action. The world transformed of itself; this was the true worthies’ pure wandering in the uncarved Dao.\n\n**Generosity in lending, yet completion is assured.**\n*The* South Flower Sutra *records: Lǎo Dān said to Yáng Zǐ Jū: ‘The governance of the enlightened king covers the world yet seems not of his own doing. He transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely on him. He has no ostentatious name, yet things take joy in him. He stands firm yet unobtrusive, wandering in the Dao—he is nonexistent.’\"*",

      "translated_text": "The ancient **true worthies** stood in the realm of **non-lending** (*bù dài*), adrift in non-action. **Non-lending** means no excess—nothing is thrust upon things. The *Chapter of the Dao’s Generation* (Fourth Twenty-Two) of the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (*Tōng Xuán Jīng*) states: The Dao’s generation begins with the **origin** (*yuán*) and **production** (*chǎn*), having no beginning. It begins with **softness and weakness** (*róuruò*), yet completes as **firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*). Those who seek **firmness** must guard it with **weakness**, accumulating weakness to achieve strength. Observing what they accumulate reveals the Dao of **preservation and decay** (*cúnwáng*).\n\nIn the **Great Ancient Age**, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) used the Dao to **settle** (*zhèn*) it and **reduce** (*sǔn*) the **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), guarding softness without forcing strength. By **transforming** (*huà*) himself through **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), he thus achieved his kingship.\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guarding Chapters*) says: Before Heaven and Earth took form, they were **dim and indistinct**, **mysterious and unified** (*yǎoyǎo mínghún ér wéi yī*), **silent and lucid** (*jìrán chéngqīng*)—this was the Dao. The Dao generates **One** (*yī*), which is Heaven (*tiān*); **One** generates **Two** (*èr*), which is Earth (*dì*), **pure and refined** (*qīngwēi*) for Heaven, **dense and turbid** (*chóngzhuó*) for Earth. **Two** generates **Three** (*sān*), which is **Human** (*rén*), with **vital essence and qi** (*jīngqì*) as the human form. **Three** generates **ten thousand things** (*wànwù*), with **coarse qi** (*cūqì*) forming insects. **Firmness and softness** (*gāngróu xiāngchéng*) intermingle, and thus ten thousand things are born.\n\nAll things **carry yin** (*fù yīn*) and **embrace yang** (*bào yáng*), hence **wood fruits** (*mùshí*) grow from the **heart** (*xīn*), and **grass fruits** (*cǎoshí*) from the **flower** (*yīng*). The **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*), and **balance** (*hé*) resides at the **center** (*zhōngyāng*), hence **embryonic and oviparous** (*tāiluǎn*) beings are born from the center. The *South Flower Sutra* says: All things generate from **form** (*xíng*). Those with **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiàng*) are born from the **embryo** (*tāi*), those with **eight orifices** (*bāqiàng*) from the **egg** (*luǎn*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Void* (*Chōng Xū Jīng*) says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) in **harmony** (*hé*) forms the human.\n\nWhat people abhor, the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **petty man’s** (*xiǎorén*) emotional nature loves **strength** (*qiáng*) and abhors **weakness** (*ruò*), loves **firmness** (*gāng*) and abhors **softness** (*róu*), yet knows not the **loss** (*shī*). Only the **lonely, widowed, and childless** (*gūguǎ bùgǔ*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Dao’s Origin*) says: **Kings and nobles** (*wánggōng*) possess **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), while the lonely, widowed, and childless lack it. They guard **humility** (*qiān*) and **reduce** (*sǔn*), yet kings and nobles take this as their **standard** (*chēng*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: In ancient times, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) daily **reduced** (*sǔn*) his **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), never daring to **be self-satisfied** (*zì mǎn*), daily advancing through **humility** (*qiān*). His **virtue and power** (*dé*) did not **decay** (*cuì*), for this was the **Way of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Symbols*) says: Those with **little virtue yet much favor** (*dé shǎo ér chǒng duō*) are **mocked** (*jī*), those with **low talent yet high station** (*cái xià ér wèi gāo*) are **in peril** (*wēi*), and those with **no great merit yet thick rewards** (*hòu lù*) are **humiliated** (*wēi*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **No greater blessing** (*fú*) than **no calamity** (*wú huò*), **no greater advantage** (*lì*) than **no loss** (*bù sǎng*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).\n\nWhat people teach, the *South Flower Sutra* says: **Confucian scholars** (*rú*) **adjust** (*qū*) the **rites** (*lǐ*), teaching **respect** (*jìng*) and **humility** (*qiān*). I also teach this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are the **companions of life** (*shēngzhī tú*). **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are **supreme** (*shàng*). **Harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) cannot **attain their end** (*bù dé qí sǐ*), for in the **end times** (*mòshì*), those who **harbor harsh and rigid qi** (*bào qiángliáng zhī qì*) cannot endure long—**harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) lead to **death** (*sǐ*). I will take this as my **teacher** (*jiào fù*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are the **companions of death** (*sǐ zhī tú*). **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are **inferior** (*xià*). The **Supreme Softness of the World** (Chapter Forty-Three) of the *South Flower Sutra* (□ *Chapter of the Way of Heaven*) states: **Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and ease** (*xūjìng tiándàn*), **silent, empty, and non-acting** (*jìmò wúwéi*), **pure and uncarved** (*chúncuì sūpǔ*)—this is the **balance of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì zhī píng*) and the **supreme Dao of virtue** (*Dàodé zhī zhì*), the **root of ten thousand things** (*wànwù zhī běn*).\n\nTo **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while ruling as **sovereign** (*jūn*), **Emperor Yao** (*Táo Tāng*) was a **lord** (*wáng*). To **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while serving as **subject** (*chén*), **Emperor Shun** (*Yú Shùn*) was a **minister** (*shì*). The **sage-king** (*shèngwáng*) **dwells** (*chǔ*) in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) at the **ruling position** (*jūnshàng*), a **virtue of emperors and kings** (*Dìshǐng Tiānzǐ zhī dé*). **Lǎo Dān** stood in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) as a **subject**, the **Dao of the Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng sūwáng zhī dào*).\n\nThe **recluse** (*yìshì*) **retired** (*tuìjū*) in this **vacuity and stillness** (*xūjìng*), wandering freely in the **rivers and seas** (*Jiānghǎi*), and the **mountain and forest dwellers** (*shānlín zhī shì*) **submitted** (*fú*).

Above, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) prevails; below, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) also prevails. The **world** (*tiānxià*) rarely attains this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **root of benefit** (*yǒuyì zhī běn*) lies in **non-benefit** (*wúyì*). Thus, **non-benefit** (*wúyì*) is harmful to governance, yet **beneficial to chaos** (*yǒuyì yú luàn*), and the **Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng*) does not act. **Chapter of Name and Body** (*Míng yǔ shēn zhāng*) **Forty-Fourth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: **The unbenevolent** (*bùrén*) yet greedy for **wealth, honor, fame, and profit** (*fùguì mínglì zhī huì*), in turn harm their **body** (*shēn*). The **King of Chu** (*Chǔ wēiwáng*) heard of **Zhuang Zhou’s** (*Zhuāng Zhōu*) virtue (*xián*), sent envoys with **rich gifts** (*hòubì zhī*), offering him the position of **prime minister** (*xiàng*), and **Zhuang Zhou** told the **Chu envoy** (*Chǔ shǐ*): \"A thousand **gold** (*jīn*), heavy **profit** (*zhònglì*); **prime minister** (*xiàng*), an **exalted position** (*zūnwèi*). Have you not seen the **sacrificial ox** (*xīniú*) of the **autumnal sacrifice** (*jiāojì*)? Nurtured and fed for **many years** (*shùsuì*), adorned with **embroidered patterns** (*wénxiù*), given **grain and beans** (*chúshū*), until it is led into the **grand temple** (*tàimiào*), even if it wished to be a **lonely calf** (*gǔdú*), could it obtain this? I hasten to depart, lest I be **defiled** (*wū*). **Rulers** (*yǒuguó zhě*) are **captured** (*jī*), yet **Zhuang Zhou** served none his whole life, **self-contented** (*zìkuài*) in the **Dao of non-action** (*wúwéi zhī dào*).\n\nThe **Lord of Lu** (*Lǔ jūn*) heard that **Yan He** (*Yán Huò*) was a **man of the Dao** (*dézhī rén*), sent envoys with **gifts** (*bì*) first. **Yan He** did not accept them, truly **hating wealth and honor** (*zēn wù fùguì*). Hence it is said: The **true Dao** (*dàozhī zhēn*) is used to **cultivate the body** (*zhìshēn*), its **leftover threads** (*xùyú*) for **states**, its **coarse husks** (*tǔjū*) to **govern the world** (*zhìtiānxìa*). Observed thus, the **functions of emperors and kings** (*dìwáng zhī gōng*) are the **leftover tasks** (*shèngrén zhī yúshì*) of the **Sages**, not what is used to **perfect the body and nurture life** (*wánshēn yǎngshēng*). Today’s **common scholars** (*jūnzǐ*) often **endanger their body and abandon life** (*wēishēn qìshēng*) to **sacrifice themselves for things** (*xùnwù*) in **name and profit** (*mínglì*). Is this not tragic?\n\nNow, there is a man here who uses the **Sui Hou’s jade** (*Suìhóu zhī zhū*) to shoot a **thousand-ren high bird** (*qiān rèn zhī què*). The **world** (*shì*) would surely **mock him** (*xiào*), why? Because what he **employs** (*suǒyòng*) is **heavy** (*zhòng*), yet what he **desires** (*suǒyào*) is **light** (*qīng*). Life (*shēng*) is not merely the **weight** (*zhòng*) of **Sui Hou’s jade**—**name and profit** (*mínglì*) destroy the **body** (*shēn*). **Knowing sufficiency** (*zhīzú*) prevents **humiliation** (*rǔ*), **knowing restraint** (*zhīzhǐ*) avoids **peril** (*dài*).

The *South Flower Sutra* says: In ancient times, **Jie** (*Jié*) killed **Guan Longfeng** (*Guān Lóngfēng*), **Zhou** (*Zhòu*) killed **Wang Zi Biduan** (*Wáng Zǐ Bǐgān*), hence **Guan Longfeng** was **beheaded** (*zhǎn*), **Wang Zi Biduan** was **flayed** (*pōu*), **Peng Hong** was **castrated** (*jiāng*), and **Zi Yu** was **minced** (*mí*). These four **virtuous men** (*xiánzhě*) were **greedy for fame and profit** (*hǎomínglì zhě*), yet their **bodies** (*shēn*) were not spared from **slaughter** (*lù*).\n\n**Gain and loss** (*dé yǔ wáng*), which brings more **suffering** (*bìng*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: These are the **kindred** (*shǔlèi*) of **Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Wang Zi Biduan, and Zi Yu** (*Bó Yí, Shū Qí, Bǐgān, Zǐ Yú*). Thus, it **discourses the Dao** (*lùndào*) of **long life, bodily safety, and joyful intent** (*chángshēng āntǐ lèyì zhī dào*), is it not **far removed** (*bù yì yuǎn*)?\n\nHence, **excessive love** (*shèn ài*) brings **great expenditure** (*dàfèi*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **patterns of tigers and leopards** (*hǔbào zhī wén*) come to be **shot** (*shè*), the **agility of monkeys and barbarians** (*yóudí zhī jié*) comes to be **trapped** (*gé*). **Chimes** (*míngzhuó*) are **self-destructive** (*zìhuǐ*) by **sound** (*shēng*), **oils and candles** (*gāojìng*) are **self-consumed** (*zìjiān*) by **brightness** (*míng*). **Martial prowess** (*wǔyǒng*) perishes from **strength and force** (*yīnqiángliáng*), **eloquent scholars** (*biànshì*) perish from **ability** (*yīnnéng*). **Excessive hoarding** (*duōzàng*) leads to **great loss** (*hòuwáng*).\n\nThe *South Flower Sutra* says: **Forest trees** (*shān mù*) **self-destroy** (*zìkòu*), **oils and candles** (*gāohuǒ*) **self-cook** (*zìjiān*). **Sweet osmanthus** (*guì*) can be **eaten** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **peeled** (*bō*), **lacquer** (*qī*) can be **used** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **cut** (*gē*).

This is called **conforming to the people** (*shùnmín*). The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Name and profit** (*mínglì èr zhě*), **agitate the spirit** (*bózhì*). **Not stirring the heart** (*bùdòng xīnzhōng*) is **upright** (*zhèng*), **upright** (*zhèng*) is **void and tranquil** (*xūjìng wúwéi*) yet **non-doing** (*wúwéi*), and thus **nothing remains undone** (*wú bùwéi*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).\n\nThe *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Jade and jade-like vessels** (*bìyàn zhī qì*), the **craft of carving** (*zhuāngyǒu zhī gōng*); **knives and hatchets** (*liàngzhǐ duànlì*), the **strength of whetstones** (*dǐlì zhī lì*). **Cunning hares die, yet hounds are boiled** (*jiǎotù sǐ ér lièquǎn pēng*), **high fowl are exhausted, yet fine bows are stored** (*gāoqín jìn ér liánggōng cáng*), **enemy states are annihilated, yet scheming ministers perish** (*dígú miè ér móuchén wáng*). **When the task is complete, withdraw** (*gōngsuì shēntuì*), such is **Heaven’s Dao** (*Tiāndào*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).\n\n**Chapter of Great Achievement as if Deficient** (*Dàchéng ruò quē zhāng*) **Forty-Fifth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: Though **Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndì*) are vast, their **transformations** (*huà*) are **uniform** (*jūn*). Though **all things** (*wànwù*) are numerous, their **governance** (*zhì*) is **one** (*yī*). Though **people** (*réncú*) are many, their **master** (*zhǔ*) is **only the lord** (*wéijūn*). The lord **originates from virtue** (*yuán yú dé*) yet **achieves through Heaven** (*chéng yú tiān*), hence it is said: The **Mysterious Ancient Lord** (*Xuán gǔ zhī jūn*), in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) ruled the **world** (*tiānxìa*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*Tiāndé*) was all. Thus, the **Sages of High Antiquity** (*dàgǔ shèngrén*) were **greatly skilled yet seemingly clumsy** (*dàqiǎo ruò zhuō*), **greatly eloquent yet seemingly tongue-tied** (*dàbiàn ruò nè*). **Embodying the Dao** (*tǐdào*), they were **void and tranquil** (*qīngjìng wúwéi*), **the rectifiers of the world** (*tiānxià zhī zhèng*), **teaching the use of the inexhaustible** (*jiào qí yòng wúqióng*). Thus they could **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*), hence this chapter was composed.\n\n**Great achievement as if deficient** (*dàchéng ruò quē*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Heaven’s roundness** (*Tiān yuán*) does not **conform to compasses** (*zhōng guī*), **Earth’s square** (*dìfāng*) does not **conform to rulers** (*zhōng jǔ*).

says:\nWhen **yang-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yin**,\nthus **skill cannot be overfilled.**\n\n**Tranquility Overcomes Heat**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nWhen **yin-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yang**,\nthus **eloquence cannot be pushed to extremes.**\n\n**Pure Tranquility as the World’s Rectitude**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages, who practiced **non-action**,\nguarded **stillness**—\nguarding stillness could rectify the world.\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\nThis chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Upper Virtue Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, those who wielded arms did not covet lands or riches,\nbut acted when danger loomed, pacifying chaos and removing harm for the people—\nthus turning peril into security.\nThe **Red Sovereign** brought great calamity,\nso the **Yellow Emperor** subdued him.\n**Gonggong** caused the flood disaster,\nso **Zhuànxū** executed him.\nNow the Seven States are without the Dao—\ngreedy, covetous men ravage the world,\nthe people restless, finding no peace.\nWhen the Dao is absent, arms are used—\nwarhorses roam the suburbs,\nthe world descends into great disorder.\n\n**When the World Has the Dao**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, those who summoned the distant\nlet them act in **non-action**,\nand those nearby\nwere told to do nothing—\nonly those who walked secretly in the Dao\ncould truly possess it.\n\n**Turning Warhorses to Manure**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nTurning warhorses to manure,\ntheir tracks do not reach beyond the farthest lands—\nthis is called **sitting while galloping, floating while submerged.**\n\n**When the World Lacks the Dao**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, when the world lacked the Dao,\nwar became the master of chaos.\nWarhorses roamed the suburbs.\n*The Sutra of the Cavern Spirit* says:\nNow, in the Spring and Autumn era, few rulers had the Dao,\nwhile many lacked it—\none cannot abandon the root for the branches,\nnor use war as the primary means.\n\n**No Greater Crime Than Covetousness**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater crime than lacking the Dao.**\nFighting over trivial matters, unable to restrain the heart—\nthis is **the army of rage**, and thus it fails.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**No Greater Calamity Than Insatiability**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater calamity than lacking virtue.**\nTaking others’ lands, desiring their wealth—\nthis is **the army of greed**, and thus it perishes.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**No Greater Blame Than Desiring More**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**No greater blame than lacking virtue.**\nRelying on the greatness of one’s state,\nboasting of one’s people’s multitude,\nand seeking to surpass enemy nations—\nthis is **the army of arrogance**, and thus it is destroyed.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThus, **knowing sufficiency is sufficiency itself.**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, those who nurtured life knew sufficiency—\nthus crime did not burden them.\n\n---\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nThis chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nIn ancient times, rulers taught without leaving their doors,\nknowing thus the governance of the world—\nobserving things through things,\nknowing people through people.\nFirst cultivating oneself, then one could govern the people.\nOrdering the home and managing affairs,\nonly then could one extend to officials and the world—\nthus the world was governed.\n\nLater generations issued ever-farther decrees,\nbringing chaos and confusion,\nwhile those who knew governance grew fewer—\nfor they did not cultivate their own roots.\n\nThus the ancient sages practiced **non-action**,\nrectifying themselves,\nand without commands, their virtue took hold;\nwithout movement, their wisdom was known;\nwithout being seen, their names were honored;\nwithout action, their deeds were complete—\nthe world self-governed.\n\n**Not Leaving the Door, Knowing the World**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:\nIn ancient times, teaching did not leave the door\nto know the world’s governance—\nthis speaks of **precision and sincerity in non-action**, emanating from within.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nThe ancients governed their inner selves by the Dao,\nand did not govern the outer.\n\n**Without Gazing Through the Window, Seeing the Dao of Heaven**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nNot gazing through the window to see the Dao of Heaven—\nthis speaks of **spirit and qi**, pure and tranquil, moving with Heaven.\n\n**The Farther One Goes, the Less One Knows**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guardians Section*) says:\nThe farther one’s actions extend,\nthe less one knows—\nthis speaks of **spirit and vitality** in **action**,\nwhich must not be allowed to stray outward.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nNow people govern the outer while neglecting the inner.\n\n**The Less One Knows**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nWhen **precision and sincerity** stray outward,\nand **thought and calculation** scatter inward,\none cannot govern.\nWhen the **form and spirit** are used far,\nwhat is neglected grows near—\nthus one knows less.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\nNow people guard the outer while neglecting the inner.\n\nThus the sage,\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\n**The root of no-command lies in rectifying oneself.**\n\n**Without Movement, Knowing**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\ntheir bodies issued no commands yet restrained,\nthey did not act yet were benevolent,\nthey did not move yet were wise.\n\n**Without Being Seen, Named**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\ntheir eyes did not gaze yet were clear,\ntheir ears did not listen yet were sharp,\nthey were not seen yet their names were honored.\n\n**Without Action, Achieved**\n*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sages cultivated the root—\nthey did not speak yet were trusted,\nthey did not seek yet obtained,\nthey did not act yet succeeded.\n\n---\n**Chapter 48: Daily Learning Increases**\nThis chapter from *The Zhuangzi* says:\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns—\nthe people used knotted cords and had no writing,\nand in such times, the world was at **great peace**—\nthis was the governance of the Dao.\n\nNow it has come to this:\npeople

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: In later ages, those who promulgated laws and offered rewards yet failed to transform customs and mores did so because their governance and punishments did not align with the Dao. In ancient times, the sage listened to the people’s music and knew their customs; observed their rituals and knew their mores; saw their mores and understood their transformation. Knowing the Dao’s unity, though he spoke not a word, all under heaven and the myriad people were transformed by him. This was because he sought only one thing: sincere adherence to the Dao—the supreme virtue of divine transformation.\n\nThus it is said: The sage has no fixed heart; he takes the people’s heart as his own. Nurturing the people as an infant, all under heaven will return to him.\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage’s heart, night and day, never forgot benefiting the people. His virtue extended far, reaching the four seas.\n\nTaking the people’s heart as his own.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the sage is above, the realm is governed; when below, the people emulate his intentions.\n\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage saw virtue as if he could not attain it himself; saw vice as if it were an omen. Teaching without descending from his hall, he rectified all under heaven. The people transformed and turned toward goodness—this was because he sought only his own virtue.\n\nTo the wicked, I am also virtuous.\nVirtue is power.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw gains as belonging to the people, losses as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.\n\nTo the trustworthy, I trust them.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Trust is the noble’s word; loyalty, the noble’s intent. When loyalty and trust manifest within, they resonate without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nTo the untrustworthy, I also trust them.\nVirtue is trust.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw righteousness as belonging to the people, perversity as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.\n\nThe sage in all under heaven.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The fundamental duty of governing is to secure the people.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw one person lose their form and in retreat blamed themselves.\n\nDiligent, for all under heaven.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient perfect ones refined their sincerity within, their virtue flowing to the four quarters. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoiced yet did not forget; seeing harm for all under heaven, they grieved as if in mourning.\n\nUnified in heart.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven, to grieve with all under heaven—yet never failing to rule—is without precedent.\n\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: He who grieves with the people’s grief, the people also grieve his grief; he who rejoices with the people’s joy, the people also rejoice his joy.\n\nThe sage treats them all as children.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Above views below as children, below views above as father; above views below as younger siblings, below views above as elder brothers. Viewing below as children—thus ruling all under heaven; viewing above as father—thus rectifying all under heaven; viewing below as younger siblings—thus not causing their deaths through hardship.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**\n\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: Today, the seven kingdoms’ lords and ministers engage in birth-and-death struggles—knowing the suitability of lands, mastering the advantages of rugged terrain, discerning the shifts of oppressive governance, and probing military formations. Blades clash, arrows fly, the wounded are carried, blood flows for thousands of *li*, bones litter the wilds. Victory and defeat both bring ruin, and war becomes the realm of death—not the way of those who truly nurture life.\n\nTruly, those ancient masters who skillfully governed their troops avoided the death-ground of arms—this was excellence. Now, the seven kingdoms’ arms have become that death-ground.\n\nBirth and death.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: There is one who, in war, can revive the dead. Used well, it brings fortune; used poorly, it brings calamity.\n\nThe living, thirteen in number.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: There are those who die unnaturally, not by fate. The few attack the many; the weak assault the strong—soldiers kill them.\n\nThe dead, thirteen in number.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Skilled warriors kill, each according to their desires, only to harm themselves in return. Killing ten thousand, they lose three thousand of their own.\n\nHuman life.\nThe *Dongling Jing* says: Human nature desires life and abhors death.\n\nDriven to the death-ground.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Upper Virtue Section*] says: War kills and wounds—thus it is called the death-ground.\nAlso thirteen in number.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: War is the death-ground, yet half who fight die in it.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Nine Guards*] says: Why do the people of the seven kingdoms not complete their natural years? It is because of war’s slaughter.\n\nBecause of their thick accumulation of life.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, because of their thick accumulation of life.\n\nTruly, those who nurture life well.\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Even those who seek to nurture life do not rely on beasts—bears, tigers, leopards, and panthers serve as their banners, yet outwit them.\n\nTraveling by land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: To traverse water without fearing dragons is the fisherman’s courage; to travel land without fearing rhinoceroses and tigers is the hunter’s courage.\n\nEntering battle, they do not don armor.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: When blades clash before them and they regard death as life, this is the warrior’s courage.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, beasts gathered in herds—thus they could be tethered and led without harming people.\n\nThe tiger has no place to strike with its claws.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, men dwelled with beasts—thus they could climb and peer among them without danger.",

sage-king arises, he prioritizes agriculture.\nIf a king does not prioritize agriculture,\nHe abandons the people—\nWhat kingdom can he then rule?\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe sage-king enriches his people,\nThe conqueror enriches his land,\nThe endangered state enriches its historians,\nThe well-governed state finds sufficiency,\nThe doomed state suffers from empty granaries—\nThus it is said: *When the ruler has no burdens, the people prosper naturally.*\n\nThe foundation of sufficiency lies in not seizing the seasons.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) states:*\nIn the latter age, what the people delight in\nAre fine garments and beautiful colors,\nWhich confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—\nThis is called chaos.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nTo teach the people’s customs,\nClothing should be plain, belts simple—\nModest and unadorned.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) recounts how Zhuangzi admonished King Zhao of Yan for his love of swords:*\nZhuangzi said: *I have three swords—\nOne for the Son of Heaven, one for the feudal lords, one for the commoner.*\nThe king said: *I wish to hear of these three swords.*\nZhuangzi replied: *There is the sword of the Son of Heaven,\nThe sword of the feudal lords,\nAnd the sword of the commoner.*\n*Now, Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven,\nYet you delight in the sword of the commoner—\nI humbly fear this for Your Majesty.*\nThe king then had the swords drawn and presented to him,\nAnd the royal attendants served him food three times.\nZhuangzi said: *Your Majesty, remain seated and composed—\nThe matter of the swords is now complete.*\nThus, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months,\nAnd all the swordsmasters perished in their homes.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nIn the latter age, what the people delight in\nAre rich flavors and music,\nWhich confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—\nThis is called chaos.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nTo hoard wealth and take comfort in it,\nTo covet power and exhaust it,\nTo accumulate goods and seek profit—\nThis is called thievish arrogance.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nAll these seven evils\nAre the world’s greatest harms.\nYet people forget them and fail to discern—\nTheir desires sever from their bodies, yet they still covet—\nIs this not delusion?\n\n*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*\nWhen teaching is clear above and transformation spreads below,\nThe people have a sense of shame—\nWhy would there be thieves?\nThus, when governance aligns with the natural order,\nBandits flee and hide.\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*\nThe foundation of pure transformation lies in rejecting artifice.\n\n*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*\nCunning, extravagance, and superficiality\nAre insufficient to stabilize the world—\nThis is not the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Unshakable Builder**\n\n*—The *Tongxuan Jing* records Wenzi asking:*\nMaster, your words say that without virtue and the Dao,\nOne cannot govern the world.\nYet in ancient times, kings inherited their predecessors’ legacies—\nSome ruled without virtue, yet their ages endured without calamity.\nHow is this possible?\n\nLaozi replied:\nFrom the Son of Heaven down to the commoner,\nEach lives their own life—\nYet life varies in depth.\nThe world at times sees ruined families and fallen states,\nAll due to the absence of virtue and the Dao.\n\nIf one remains ever vigilant, day and night,\nStriving with fear and caution,\nGuarding diligently without fail—\nThen disaster is averted.\n\nBut if one indulges in desires and neglects duty,\nUnable to guard diligently,\nThen ruin comes without warning.\n\nIf Jie and Zhou had followed the Dao and cultivated virtue,\nEven if Tang and Wu were wise,\nThey would have had no means to establish their deeds.\n\nIn ancient times, those who built well were unshaken,\nThose who guarded well were unlost—\nThus their descendants continued sacrifices without interruption,\nTheir virtue never severed,\nAnd the world endured for generations.",

darkness or light.\n\nIn that time, birds and beasts gathered in flocks,\nGrasses and trees grew in abundance—\nThus, birds and beasts could be tethered and led about,\nYet they did not harm people;\nThe nests of crows and magpies could be climbed and observed,\nYet they did not injure people.\n\nBeasts could not prey upon them,\nNot because their virtue was thin—\nRather, they discerned

Five Hegemons’ reliance on arms and punishments bred bandits and chaos.\n\n**Governing by the Dao,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* (□ *On Rites Above*) states:\nTo govern by the Dao, first establish policies that cannot be overcome,\nThen seek victory over adversaries.\nTo attack a disordered state before it is pacified\nIs like responding to fire with fire or water with water—\nOpposites cannot govern one another;\nThis is called *increasing disorder*.\n\n**Employing the Unconventional in Warfare,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nTo employ the unconventional in warfare,\nOne must make the strange appear strange.\nThe unconventional in stillness appears agitated,\nThe unconventional in order appears chaotic,\nThe unconventional in abundance appears starved,\nThe unconventional in ease appears labored.\n\nThe interplay of the unconventional and the conventional\nIs like the clash of water, fire, metal, and wood—\nWherever it turns, it prevails.\n\n**Conquering the World Without Conflict,**\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nThe ancient sage-rulers conquered the world without conflict.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:\nExcessive affairs are difficult to govern,\nHarsh laws are difficult to enforce.\nWhen taboos proliferate,\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit*

Sovereigns relied on hooks and cords, rules and measures, to straighten what was already straight—\nThis was to chisel away at their natural uprightness.\nThey bound with cords and sealed with glue to solidify what was already firm—\nThis was to encroach upon their innate virtue.\n\nThey bent and folded rites and music,\nThey stifled and smothered benevolence and righteousness,\nTo pacify the world’s hearts—\nThis was to lose their natural order.\n\nWhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary;\nIn ancient times, the world had its natural order:\nThe crooked were not straightened with hooks,\nThe straight were not measured with cords,\nThe round were not circumscribed with compasses,\nThe square were not checked with rulers,\nThe separated were not glued together,\nThe bound were not restrained with ropes.\n\nThus the world spontaneously gave birth to all things, yet knew not how it came to be;\nAll things naturally attained their place, yet knew not how it happened.\n\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure.\nThis principle is unchanging from ancient to modern—\nIt cannot be diminished.\nThen why do benevolence and righteousness cling so

Harmony*\nHave no human censure.\n\nWith the Dao to govern the world—\n*The *South华经* says:\nThe ancient sages’ life was in accord with heaven’s movement,\nTheir death was in accord with nature’s

to invade the weak,\nThe weak defied and undermined the strong,\nClinging to their weapons with rigid resolve,\nCreating strife and fostering resentment,\nFor long they did not achieve harmony—\nAnd the world fell into great disorder.\n\nThus, when states are bound in harmony and stillness,\nAnd arms are laid down without contention,\nThe world attains great peace.\n\nGreat states are the lowly flow of the world—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nHence, the Dao does not triumph through rigid strength,\nNor does it gain through greedy competition.\nVictory lies in the world’s spontaneous submission,\nGain lies in the world’s accord with you.\nSoftness and weakness bring victory,\nRen and righteousness bring gain.\nThe world’s receptive feminine—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe ancient sages acted as the world’s receptive feminine,\nThus they could endure long.\n\nThe receptive feminine constantly triumphs through stillness over the masculine—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThe Dao of victory through arms\nAwaits disorder with governance,\nAwaits motion with stillness,\nAwaits the masculine with the receptive feminine—\nOne must not act first.\nStillness is the lowly way—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:\nThus the sages grasp the feminine and receptive,\nAnd so can establish their masculine and strong.\nAdvancing with the receptive feminine,\nTheir virtue/power and deeds do not decline—\nThis is the way of heaven.\n\nGuard the Dao of stillness,\nRestrain the feminine’s resolve,\nWith softness and weakness, find peace in stillness.\nThus, great states submit to small states and take them—\n*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and

      "translated_text": "The Commentary says:\n*\"Long处* (prolonged) yet not *zhì* (wise/knowing), hence it is called *fǎn* (inversion).\nThen it reaches *Dà Shùn* (Great Harmony).\n\n*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:\nWhen harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, their unity is seamless,\nlike the simplicity of the foolish and the dimness of the ignorant—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*, in accord with *Great Harmony*.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi as King)**\nThis chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:\nIn the ancient times, the Sage-Kings governed through the Dao/Way,\nretiring yet without absence, modeling themselves after the rivers and seas—\nnot claiming greatness for themselves, their virtue naturally manifesting,\nso they could establish their kingship.\n\nHuman nature and disposition\nsubmit to virtue, not to force.\nVirtue lies in yielding, not in contention—\nthus the ancient Sage-Kings,\nwho wished to be honored by others, first honored others themselves;\nwho wished to be revered by others, first revered others;\nwho wished to overcome others, first made themselves weak;\nwho wished to be humble before others, first humbled themselves.\n\nThus high and low, reverence and humility,\nthe Dao/Way governs them—\nspeaking gently to others while placing themselves last,\nso the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,\nand in bearing them without resentment—\nthis is virtue abundant and *qi* in harmony.\n\nThus knowing to yield is to take,\nand to retreat is to lead—\nthis is near to the Dao/Way.\n\nVirtue bestowed upon the world,\npreserved through yielding,\nwas how the ancient Kings maintained the world—\nthus they could endure long.\nThis is the virtue of the Sea yielding kingship.\n\n**Why the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys,**\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue/Compendium]* says:\nThe rivers and seas are low and humble,\nyet all streams flow into them—\nthus they achieve vastness.\nBecause they excel in yielding,\nthey can be kings of all valleys.\n\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe rivers and seas yield because they are low,\nthe Heavenly Pool is the *Yuān Dé* (Abyssal Virtue),\nand fish and turtles gather there.\nThus the sea does not contend with the eastward flow—\nthis is the utmost greatness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage-Kings\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe rivers and seas occupy the Earth’s deficiencies,\nso the world submits to and venerates them.\nThe Sage-Kings who practice humility, modesty, and yielding words—\nthis is seen as yielding.\nSeen as yielding, thus they attain their loftiness;\nthe arrogant cannot stand.\n\n*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:\nOnce upon a time, Yao and Shun yielded yet became emperors,\nTang and Wu contended yet became kings,\nand the Duke of Bai contended yet perished.\nTo ascend over others, one must speak gently to them,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Virtue/Compendium]* says:\nTo ascend over others,\none must necessarily speak gently to them.\nThe world must imitate their joy and love,\nall must promote and yield.\n\nTo lead others, one must place oneself last,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo lead others,\none must necessarily place oneself last.\nThe world advances their benevolence and righteousness,\nand there is no harsh *qi*.\nThus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Dao/Way Origins]* says:\nThus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,\nand though they stand foremost, others do not harm them—\nthe world submits to them, and the wicked fear them.\nThough they stand foremost, others do not harm them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nTo occupy the highest position while the people do not resent,\nand to stand foremost while others do not harm—\neven in distant lands and alien customs,\nwhere maggots fly and worms writhe,\nall are drawn to love them.\nThus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,\nwithout them, nothing is left undone,\nwithout their leading, nothing fails to succeed—\nhence they are held in highest esteem by the world.\nBecause they do not contend,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue]* says:\nThe ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—\nlow and yielding, not contending.\nAll streams flow into them,\nso none can contend with them.\nThus the Dao/Way does not stand upon strength and arms,\nbut upon the world’s promotion of them—\nnot upon their own seizing.\nBecause they do not contend,\nnone can contend with them.\nThus the world cannot contend with them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Way of ordinary people is many and does not unite,\nthe Way of the Sage-Kings is humble yet none can surpass it.\nBecause they do not contend with all things,\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n\n**The World All Praises (Chapter 67)**\nThis chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:\nThe Dao/Way is simple yet expansive,\nmysterious yet luminous,\nsoft yet strong—\ncontaining yin and emitting yang,\nand thus manifesting the three brilliances.\n\nThe sun and moon move through it,\nmountains rise through it,\nthe abyss deepens through it,\nbirds fly through it,\nbeasts run through it,\nthe qilin roams through it,\nand the phoenix soars through it.\n\nTo take reverence through humility,\nto take survival through extinction,\nto take precedence through retreat.\n\nThe first is *cí* (compassion),\nthe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nthe third is not daring to lead the world.\n\nThe ancient Sage-Kings preserved softness and did not grow rigid,\nretired yet were not absent,\ndid not dare to be proud or extravagant—\ntheir virtue naturally transformed,\nso they could establish their kingship.\nThey could endure long,\nand their three treasures were vast and expansive.\n\nThe world all praises my Dao/Way as great,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy Dao/Way is *wu wéi* (non-action),\nand I do not privately receive what is unworthy.\nIt seems not to conform.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy virtue contains simplicity,\nyet it tolerates the unworthy.\nOnly because it is great,\ndoes it seem not to conform.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—\n*wu wéi* (non-action), occupying unworthy positions,\nso they became kings of the world.\nIf conformity were long sustained,\nits subtlety would be lost.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe ancient Sage-Kings were clear-sighted, wise, and benevolent,\nyet they preserved themselves in simplicity,\npracticing non-action while the world was governed.\nI possess three treasures,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nMy Dao/Way has three treasures—\nto take reverence through humility,\nto take vastness through frugality,\nto take precedence through retreat.\nPreserving and holding them.\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way is preserved through them.\n\nThe first is compassion,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\ngreat yet rooted in the small,\nhumble yet self-guarding.\n\nThe second is frugality,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nabundant yet beginning with the few,\nfrugal yet self-fortifying.\n\nThe third is not daring to lead the world,\n*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:\nThe

      "translated_text": "「**Chapter 73: The Bold in Daring Bring Death**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks of: Seven states waging war, slaying the innocent, nourishing the unrighteous, and causing harm beyond measure. Indulging one’s private desires while ignoring the calamities within the realm—this is what Heaven detests, and what the people resent, and what Heaven punishes. Thus, the bold in daring bring death; what Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, yet it does not fail to ensnare. The bold in daring bring death, but the *Tongxuan Jing˙Dao De* says: In the latter days of the Warring States, men have hearts of profit and loss, and from the outset, they harbor murderous intent. Thus, the bold in daring bring death, while the bold in restraint bring life.\n\nThe *Chongxu Jing* says: Those who practice the Dao make others so that though they be bold enough to strike, the strike will not take hold; though they be clever enough to attack, the attack will not find its mark. Though they strike and do not take hold, though they attack and do not find their mark, yet they still bring shame—how much less so than the ancient Sages, who made others so that though they be bold, they dare not strike, and though they be clever, they dare not attack! Those who dare not strike are not without murderous intent, but how much less so than the Sages, who from the outset have no murderous intent at all! Those who have no murderous intent at all have not yet cultivated a heart of love and benefit. Thus, they make all men and women under Heaven—without exception—rejoice and willingly embrace love and benefit, yet they dare not kill. If such is the case, without murderous intent, there is no place where they are not rulers, no office where they are not leaders. All under Heaven willingly embrace peace and benefit, and so the bold in restraint bring life.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles—one brings benefit, the other harm. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: To love daring is the Dao of peril and ruin; the bold and daring die by force and tyranny. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason? The *Chongxu Jing* says: Laozi spoke to Guan Yin: *\"What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\"* Therefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nUnder Heaven, nothing is easier than doing good; what is meant by doing good is to remain still and take no action, and so doing good is easy. Under Heaven, nothing is harder than doing evil; what is meant by doing evil is usurpation and regicide, deceit and falsehood, which go against human nature, and so doing evil is hard. The Dao of Heaven, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the few; the Dao of ghosts and spirits is proud and overflowing, not to be shared.\n\nWithout contention yet achieving victory, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those with hidden virtue must have manifest reward; those with secret deeds must have clear response. The sower of millet does not reap grain; the planter of evil does not receive virtue in return. Without speech yet responding well, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: To do evil in the light of day, men may punish you; to do evil in darkness, ghosts may punish you.\n\nWithout summoning yet they come, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven is the sun of winter and the shade of summer; all things return to it, yet none compel them. It reaches the utmost of natural and refined influence—coming without summoning, departing without being driven away. Thus, it is effortless yet good at planning.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao is broad and open; to abandon the self is not far. If one turns toward good, even if they err, there will be no resentment. If one does not turn toward good, even if they are loyal, they will bring misfortune. The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, and the *Dongling Jing* says: *\"If the prohibitive nets are sparse and wide, they are easy to evade yet hard to violate.\"* The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, sparse yet never failing. Sparse yet never failing. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the Warring States, those who dare to fight kill the innocent; the people resent them, and Heaven punishes them.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Normally Fear Death**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks of: The Five Hegemons suddenly speaking of punishments and rewards, yet how can they govern the people? This is merely knowing the tools of governance, not the essential Dao of governance. One may use the tools of governance throughout the realm, but this is not enough to apply the Dao of governance throughout the realm.\n\nThe laws of the latter days set high standards yet fail to reach the guilty; impose heavy burdens yet punishments do not overcome them; create great difficulties yet executions are not dared. The people are burdened by these three evils, adorned with cleverness and deceiving their superiors, committing wickedness and courting danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit.\n\nWild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant. Thus, the Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty, and the rulers demand much while the people resent much. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.\n\nAnd so, to stop the boiling by adding more fire—though it seems a strange remedy—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The essential principle of governance is to remove the fire itself. To be clear and still, to return to rectitude.\n\nThus, the Five Hegemons cruelly punish, taking the guilty into their own hands and killing them. Those who substitute for the officials in killing are rare indeed who do not soil their hands. The people do not normally fear death, and the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments are not enough to instill awe; killing the innocent is not enough to suppress deceit. How can you rely on death to instill fear?\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those who carve laws and impose executions are not the work of an Emperor or King; those who frequently use rods and whips are not the measures of one who seeks the distant. If you wish to make the people fear death, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty; the more the rulers demand, the more the people contend below. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.\n\nAnd yet, there are those who are strange, the *Tongxuan Jing□Xia De* says: The people of the latter days adorn themselves with cleverness and deceive their superiors, commit wickedness and court danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit. Wild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant.\n\nI seize them and kill them, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Ancient rulers who governed well accumulated their virtue; accumulating virtue, the people could be transformed. Today’s rulers who govern by cruelty and violence breed chaos, and chaos is the wind of ruined states. Who dares?」",

      "translated_text": "The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation.\nWith laws broad and punishments lenient, the prisons stand empty, and the realm unified in custom—none harbor deceitful hearts. This is the benevolence of the Sage.\n\nLet those who hold office kill when they must. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, lest they act without restraint. The establishment of rulers was to control these officials, lest they act unilaterally. Laws, measures, and Daoist arts were to restrain the ruler, lest he act arbitrarily.\n\nTo take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [in the *Shangren* section] says: A whale cast upon dry land is dominated by an ant. When a ruler abandons his proper role and contests matters with his ministers, he is dominated by his officials. Ministers hoard their wisdom and do not employ it, yet instead usurp authority from above.\n\nIf a ruler does not entrust capable men but insists on acting himself, his wisdom grows ever more constrained while his burdens increase. When cornered by his subordinates, he cannot rectify matters. His wisdom proves insufficient for governance, his authority inadequate for enforcing law—thus he cannot engage with the realm.\n\nTo take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe. And he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When a ruler’s joys and angers manifest in his heart, and his desires are visible without, those who guard their posts abandon principle to curry favor, and officials pervert the law to follow the wind. Rewards fail to match merit, punishments fail to fit crimes—thus superior and subordinate grow estranged, ruler and minister harbor grudges, officials grow chaotic, and wisdom cannot resolve slander while clarity cannot illuminate one’s own faults. Instead, they blame themselves, and so the sovereign grows ever more weary while his ministers grow ever more insolent.\n\nThus, he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.\n\n**On the People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**\nThis chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states: When learning is prized for cleverness but lacks the Dao, the world falls into chaos. How do we know this is so?\n\nWhen the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps abounds, the birds grow disordered above. When the cunning of hooks, baits, nets, and weirs abounds, the fish grow disordered in the waters. When the cunning of traps, snares, and pitfalls abounds, the beasts grow disordered in the marshes. When the cunning of deceit, poison, sophistry, and debates over *jiehua* (contradictions), *jianhua* (subtleties), *firmness*, *whiteness*, *freshness*, *filth*, and distinctions abounds, then customs grow disordered in argumentation.\n\nFrom ancient times to today, tyrants like Jie and Zhou have repeatedly plunged the world into great chaos, and the fault lies in their love of cleverness. Now, the people of Zhou are skilled yet difficult to govern, and so this chapter is composed.\n\n**On the People’s Hunger**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the people show signs of hunger, it is not by fate that they perish young or die of starvation. It is because of the heavy taxes imposed upon them.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Moreover, in sustaining life, one man plows and does not increase ten *mu* of land. Even in a middle-quality field, the harvest does not exceed four *dan*. His wife, children, and aged dependents rely on this for sustenance. At times, there are calamities of flood or drought. When tribute is demanded, the ruler may pity them—but still, they hunger.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the latter days, greedy tyrants drain their people like fish to satisfy their boundless desires, and so the common folk do not receive the harmonies of Heaven or the virtues of Earth. Thus, the people hunger.\n\n**On the Difficulty of Governing the People**\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says: The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In later ages, when rulers act, they exhaust the world’s resources yet fail to govern. When superiors desire much, inferiors suffer much. When superiors engage in many affairs, inferiors adopt many guises. To teach the people and then expect them to cease their ways is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn—it is difficult.\n\nThus, to stop boiling by adding more water only makes it worse.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Supreme Virtue (上德篇)**\n\nThe *Laozi* looked upward at the trees in the eaves, then gazed at the rivers below. The strong and rigid trees dwell in the lower eaves, the great in stature occupy the lower branches. The gentle and weak rise above.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The small and slender trees dwell in the higher eaves, the weak and slight occupy the upper branches—like stacking firewood, the smallest is placed on top.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: In ancient times, enlightened rulers governed with moderation, nurtured themselves with restraint, and calculated harvests according to the seasons. They measured the people’s stored provisions, knowing the surplus and deficit, then took only what was needed. Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed and avoided the suffering of hunger and cold.\n\nWhen the people were distressed—those who starved ate food without relish, those who froze endured winter without furs—rulers shared in their hardships. Thus, there were no grieving subjects under Heaven.\n\nIn later ages, who could use their surplus to nourish the world? Only the ancient Dao-bearing rulers could sustain the widows, orphans, and the lonely, following Heaven’s way to aid the people.\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the scarce. Is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: A bow is drawn for shooting, yet without a string, it cannot release. Heaven’s shooting requires no bow—it strikes true.\n\nThe high are humbled,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Guard Weakness Section] says: The Dao of Heaven humbles the high.\nThe low are raised;\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven raises the low.\nThe excessive are diminished,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive.\nThe deficient are supplemented.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive to nourish the deficient.\nThe Dao of Earth diminishes the high and benefits the low.\nBut the Dao of humanity is otherwise,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of the ruler is otherwise, differing from Heaven’s diminishing and benefiting.\n\nIt diminishes the deficient,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Yet the people, in their tilling, rely on their wives, children, aged, and weak for sustenance. Facing floods, droughts, and heavy taxes, they struggle to provide.\nTo nourish the excessive.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ruler takes from the people to serve above, seeking only the surplus.\n\nWho can use their surplus to nourish the world?\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, greedy tyrants drain their people to satisfy boundless desires, leaving the masses hungry and cold. Who can nourish the deficient?\n\nOnly the Dao-bearing ones.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The ancient sages took care of the old, weak, orphans, and widows, ensuring all were provided for.\nThus, the sages\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The ancients were complete—they nurtured all things, and their benevolence extended to the people.\n\nThey act without claiming merit,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things rely on it for existence, yet none know its virtue.\nTheir work accomplished, they take no credit,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things complete their work without dwelling on it, yet none know its virtue.\nThey do not seek to be seen as virtuous.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The sage is empty of self, seeing only insufficiency. Seeing insufficiency, they achieve true virtue.\n\n**Chapter 78: The Gentle and Weak of the World**\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: The sea does not reject the smallest streams to become great; the forests do not reject the crooked and bent to flourish. The sage does not reject humble words to broaden their name. If speech is true, even a common laborer’s words should not be discarded. If speech is false, even the ruler’s ministers should not be heeded. Right and wrong cannot be judged by rank or status.\n\nWhen the people drown and the ruler does not grieve, he is not a virtuous sovereign. To guard one’s post and die in battle is the duty of a subject. In later ages, few ministers offer sincere loyalty, risking their lives. Those who exhaust their strength and loyalty go unheard.\n\nThus, the ancient sages modeled themselves after water’s gentleness—enduring shame, accepting criticism, and receiving insults. Rulers should emulate water in receiving defilement.\n\nNothing in the world is as gentle and weak as water,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Dao Yuan Section] says: Nothing is as gentle and weak as water.\nYet it conquers the rigid and strong,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—it pierces metal and stone, its strength flows through the world.\nAnd none can overcome it,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped.\nNothing can replace it.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—struck, it leaves no wound; pierced, it suffers no harm; cut, it is not severed; burned, it is not scorched. It flows smoothly, never dispersing.\n\nThus, the gentle overcomes the rigid,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* [Supreme Virtue Section] says: The *Laozi* saw the tongue and guarded gentleness. Though teeth are firmer than the tongue, they decay first.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: Accumulated gentleness becomes rigidity; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Without accumulation, this cannot be.\n\nThe world\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, human nature favors strength and rejects weakness, rigidity and rejects gentleness, yet they do not know their loss and cannot embrace gentleness.\n\nNone know,\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The virtuous discern truth and do not trust slander.\nNone can practice it.\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: If counsel is ignored, the ruler is unenlightened.\n\nThus, the sage\nThe *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after water’s gentleness.",

      "translated_text": "Gentleness and frailty, though subtle and seemingly insignificant, thus attain their lofty heights—virtue and renown arise naturally. It says: *\"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the sovereign of the ancestral altars;\"* the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *\"The ancient sages did not seek deeds that might be criticized, nor did they resent others’ censure of themselves. Though the world condemns them, they do not falter.\"*\n\n*\"To bear the state’s calamities is to be called the king of the world.\"* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"In ancient times, the sages allowed those who slandered them to do so, for it was their own fault.\"* Words once spoken cannot be recalled by others; actions begun nearby cannot be restrained from afar. Straight speech seems like perversion. The *Tongxuan Jing˙Upper Virtue Chapter* declares: *\"In later ages, those who speak are silenced by words, those who advise are executed by law—yet such rulers still hope to preserve harmony across all lands. How far they are from wisdom!\"*\n\n**Chapter on Reconciling Great Grievances (79)**\nThis chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *\"To reconcile great grievances will inevitably leave lingering resentment—how can this be called good?\"* In ancient times, the near were drawn close not by words, the distant not by words; the near were made content, the distant were made to come. To share desires with the people brings harmony; to share their defenses brings stability; to share their thoughts brings understanding; to gain their strength brings wealth; to gain their praise brings renown. In the later ages, actions invite bandits, words invite disaster—no one speaks first, yet others have already conspired behind them. Rumors spreading a thousand miles are a calamity. The tongue is a trigger: once words are spoken, they cannot be recalled, even by four swift horses.\n\nThis exhorts the Warring States to reconcile their grievances, to cease hostilities and not contend, thus achieving universal peace—now that is good. To reconcile great grievances, the *Tongxuan Jing˙Subtle Brilliance Chapter* says: *\"The ancient sages reconciled the world’s grievances, their virtue acting as the binding contract—non-contention was their goodness.\"* There must be lingering resentment—how can this be called good? The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The Warring States lacked the Dao; their conflicts bred resentment—there must be lingering resentment. How can this be called not good?\"* Thus, the sage—\n\nthe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"The ancient sages were fully prepared: to harmonize the world.\"* Holding the left contract, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Yin harms things; yang transforms them.\"* The sage’s Dao follows the brilliance of yang to harmonize the world, follows the darkness of yin to reconcile its grievances and ill-will, yet holds no blame toward others. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The greater the resentment, the deeper the calamity.\"* To harbor resentment without resolution is unheard of. Hence, virtue acts as the binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Accumulated virtue becomes kingship; accumulated stone becomes mountains.\"* Without accumulation, this cannot be. Without virtue, there is no binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Accumulated resentment brings ruin; accumulated water becomes rivers.\"* Without accumulation, this cannot be.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none, always aiding the virtuous. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"The Dao of Heaven favors none, only virtue is rewarded.\"*\n\n**Chapter on Small States and Few People (80)**\nThis chapter of the *Zhuangzi* (in the *Inner Chamber of the Chest* section) states: *\"In the ancient age of supreme virtue, the clans of Róngchéng, Dàtíng, Bóhuáng, Zhōngyāng, Lìlù, Líxù, Hèxiū, Zūnlú, Zhùróng, Fúxī, Shénnóng, and Xuānyuán ruled. At that time, the people tied knots in cords for use, relished their food, adorned their dress, found comfort in their dwellings, and delighted in their customs. Neighboring states could see one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs mingled in the air—yet the people lived until old age and death without visiting one another.\"* Such a time, when knots were tied in simplicity and the people were unadorned, universal peace meant supreme governance.\n\nSmall states, few people—the *Tongxuan Jing˙Symbolic Speech Chapter* says: *\"To command ten thousand soldiers is not as good as to hear a single apt word; to possess the pearl of Duke Hòu is not as good as to grasp the proper means of governance; to hold the jade of Héshì is not as good as to align with the fitting course of affairs.\"* Though the world be vast, those who delight in war perish; though the state be stable, those who love contention are in peril. Thus, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them.\n\nThough they possess myriad implements, they do not use them—the *Dònglíng Jing* says: *\"The ancient sage-kings flourished by encouraging agriculture and teaching the people to till the land, to make death weighty and not wander far.\"* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"When Fúxī ruled the world, his virtue gave life without taking it.\"* At that time, there was no heart of profit or harm; the world was at peace. Though there were boats and carriages, there was no need to ride them—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In the age of Shénnóng, when resting he slept soundly, when moving he walked leisurely, the people knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived with deer and elk without malice. This was the peak of supreme virtue.\"*\n\nThough there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *\"Huángdì’s governance of the world refined the essence of sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, balanced the rhythms of the four seasons, established the laws of music and the calendar, distinguished male and female, clarified high and low. Farmers yielded the edges of their fields, and travelers did not pick up lost goods.\"* The people once again tied knots in cords for use—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In the upper antiquity of supreme virtue, there was no action—yet the world was governed with ease, and both ruler and ruled were without strife.\"* The ruler did not act; the people did not act. They relished their food—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The ancient people gathered acorns and chestnuts by day, and found their food sweet—thus they were called the people who knew life.\"* They adorned their dress—the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The ancient people did not know clothing, yet in summer they piled firewood, and in winter they burned it—thus their dress was beautiful, and they were called the people who knew life.\"*",
