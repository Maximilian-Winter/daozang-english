  "full_translation": "**\"The Direct Explanation of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic: A Commentary by the Song Scholar Shao Ruoyu**\n\n**Title:** *The Direct Explanation of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic*\n**Attributed to:** Shao Ruoyu of the Song Dynasty\n**Volume:** Four scrolls\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dongshen* (Cavernly Divine) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Direct Explanation of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic***\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Shiji*), it is briefly recorded that Laozi served as the Keeper of the Archives. As the Zhou Dynasty declined, he departed. The Prefect of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: *\"Master, you are about to withdraw into seclusion. Please, for my sake, compose a book.\"* Thus, he wrote the *Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* in two sections—upper and lower—speaking of the meaning of Dao/Way and virtue in over five thousand words before departing. No one knew his end.\n\nBecause the historical record mentions \"upper and lower sections,\" later scholars followed this division, treating the first scroll as expounding the *Dao/Way* and the second as expounding *virtue*. However, upon rational examination, the text discusses Dao/Way and virtue as an undivided whole, with no true upper or lower sections. This is merely a misinterpretation in the historical account, and I have removed it.\n\nAgain, some unknown scholar, failing to grasp the original intent of the text, arbitrarily divided it into eighty-one chapters, merely pursuing superficial ornamentation and aligning with yang numerology—this is mere frivolous speculation, offering no benefit to humanity. I have also removed this division.\n\nFurthermore, such scholars invented chapter titles, confining the text’s meaning within narrow interpretations, distorting its principles. I have also discarded these additions.\n\nThis text’s meaning is not continuous, for the Prefect of the Pass did not fully comprehend Laozi’s teachings when he requested them. Laozi thus spoke of his own matters, sometimes citing the words of ancient sages, which is why the text’s flow is disjointed and its language repetitive—like a parent’s tender, earnest instruction to their child.\n\nWhere the text touches on state affairs, it reflects Laozi’s lament over the prevailing winds of his time, matters pertaining to the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nWhere taboo terms appear, if altered, the original intent might be lost over time. Following the conventions of ancient scriptures and histories, I have left them unmodified, even if the characters are incomplete in transmission.\n\nMany have annotated this text, yet though they claim mastery of its principles, they fail to grasp them, and though they debate its details, they lack proper method. For instance, some annotate *xuān pò* (玄牝) as \"mouth and nose\"—this is a failure to understand its true meaning. Others render *sǐ zhī tú* (死之徒) as the Pali/Sanskrit *niēpán* (涅盘), mistranslating it as \"Xin’s ‘wuwei’ (無為)\"—this is a failure in historical accuracy.\n\nSuch conjectural annotations, scattering the original intent, are too numerous to list. Their error stems from not attaining the Dao/Way itself.\n\nThe Sage Confucius aspired to the Dao/Way, yet since the Dao is formless, he grounded himself in the virtue/power of form to establish its foundation. Once the foundation is set, the Dao arises—gradually, not abruptly. How then could one indulge in virtue/power without advancing toward the Dao? This is what is meant by passing its gate without entering its hall.\n\nTo aspire to the Six Arts while floating in virtue/power, treating techniques as the Dao, mistaking filth for essence, dullness for simplicity, pace for nature, stillness for *wuwei*, abstaining from flavors as tranquility, coming and going as spontaneity, and divorcing one’s wife while sleeping alone as serenity—such people cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao.\n\nAs the *Baopuzi* states in its eighth volume: Though the Five Thousand Words originate from Laozi, they are merely broad and superficial discussions. Within them, he does not fully expound beginning to end—what then is there to follow or verify? Indeed, many speak of chamber arts and alchemical elixirs, clinging to *youwei* (有為) as their practice, indulging in greed and lust, measuring the Dao of *wuwei* with shallow calculations. Thus, they fail to grasp its entirety—how much less can those inferior to him?\n\nMoreover, they rank the reckless as superior and those cultivating virtue/power as secondary. To conceal one’s body and alter appearances, transforming the forms of things, is to invite demonic suspicion. Confucius did not speak of strange powers or chaotic spirits, for they yield no benefit.\n\nLaozi’s writings emphasize longevity and clear vision, focusing on advancing the Dao rather than fixating on single outcomes. Even the immortals dwell on the Three Mountains, never leaving the earth, yet they ride phoenixes and attend the Emperor, never leaving heaven. Dwelling between heaven and earth, they endure for ten thousand years. Though they temporarily extend life, they must still return to death—if one does not advance the Dao, what differs from the great *chun* tree?\n\nThis is not a debate on right and wrong, but a warning against indulging in immortality techniques while neglecting the Dao. Among all beings, humans are most noble, yet they praise food and clothing above all. Only humans can comprehend life and death; they must not be ensnared by mundane attachments, lest death come suddenly. This is not a matter of timing—if one is lost along the way, it may take countless eons to encounter such a chance again.\n\nTo attain this wisdom is no easy feat; after twenty years of diligent study, one may finally awaken to its original truth. Yet the great Dao is beyond words—words are merely a vessel to reveal it. Once the intent is grasped, words are forgotten. Even with perception and cognition, true understanding remains elusive.\n\nNow residing in Hangzhou, I met by chance the Qinghe Master, with whom I shared mutual resonance. Discussing this scripture, I found it the supreme opportunity within the teaching. Those who annotate it with verbose erudition only obscure its meaning for the common reader, making its essence difficult to grasp.\n\nThe Dao and virtue/power are not about excessive elaboration. If annotations are straightforward and direct, one should instantly perceive their meaning upon hearing, awakening to virtue/power and thus seeing the Dao. Persisting in this way is to repay one’s ancestors.\n\nIn seeking the original text, I obtained three versions, now adopting the Song-dynasty *Yulan* edition as standard.\n\nIn my annotations, wherever *de* (德) is mentioned, it pertains to Confucian teachings on the great Dao’s emptiness and stillness, aligning with Buddhist principles. I merge the teachings of Confucianism and Buddhism to verify the Dao and virtue/power as one, fearing my dull roots and meager merit may fail to uphold their essence.\n\nThis book contains techniques for preserving form, prolonging life, and ensuring longevity; methods for safeguarding the state and family; and supreme mysteries for transcending birth and death. I fear that if unseen, they will go unapplied.\n\nThis body is no different from that of ancient sages—only through such practice does one attain their likeness.\n\nIn our present sage ruler, reverence for the Dao and virtue/power manifests as filial piety and benevolence, embodying the virtues of compassion and frugality. Following ancient precedents, his governance brings peace and prosperity, harmonizing with the people. Thus, those who observe him remain steadfast in their duties to serve the state and honor their parents, ever mindful of desirelessness. Over time, the people flourish, and the ruler ascends beyond Yao and Shun.\n\nBy spreading these teachings, we repay the nation’s grace.\n\n**On the Stages of Dao and Virtue/Power**\nThe Dao reveals reality through *wuwei*, while *youwei* relies on force. Illuminating the void dispels ignorance—this is the principle. Virtue/power embodies the Dao as a method applied to affairs—this is practice.\n\nThe terms *Dao* and *virtue/power* encompass all things without exclusion. Their stages must be clearly delineated, for the Dao has depths and virtue/power has inner and outer layers. Without understanding these stages, mutual slander arises.\n\nThe supreme Dao is absolute stillness, formless and nameless, beyond expression. Its scripture cannot be recorded, hence it is called *Taiyi* (太易). Its sound is also inexpressible.\n\n*Taiyi* is the state before *qi* manifests. When *Taiyi* moves, the initial *qi* appears, hence *Taiyi* (太初). This is also *Taiji* (太极) and *Taiyi* (太一). Laozi names the singular *qi* as the Dao, while Confucius defines the Dao as that which is above form. The Buddhist exposition of the Four Noble Truths also calls it the Dao—thus, the three teachings collectively encompass all existence.\n\nWithout beginning with the manifest, how could one comprehend the void? By knowing the manifest, one grasps the void. Hence, the Dao has depths.\n\n*Taiyi* is emptiness. Movement gives rise to the initial manifestation of form, hence *Taiyi* (太初). The emergence of *qi* marks the beginning of form, hence *Taishi* (太始). When *qi* and form coalesce, yielding firm and yielding qualities, it is called *Taosu* (太素). Before their separation, this state is named *Hun Dun* (浑沌).\n\nOnce *Hun Dun* divides, yin and yang interact, with *qi* residing centrally, giving birth to all things. Thus, Laozi says: *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.*\n\nTherefore, the sage observes above and below, honoring heaven’s elevation and earth’s humility. Applied, this becomes governance and the enlightened Way of kingship, establishing the Five Constants and a hundred virtues to rectify the relationships of ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, and thus govern and harmonize humanity.\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless and leaves no trace,\nneither death nor birth it knows.\nThrough countless eons it endures unchanging,\nexalted above all, ineffable in mystery.\n\nThe highest virtue embodies *wuwei* in action,\ntaking *One* as the law to govern the world.\nThings arise without claim,\nlife unfolds without possession,\naction is taken without reliance,\nachievement is completed without dwelling.\nThough others recognize its work,\nno merit is seen—\nand all things transform spontaneously.\n\nThus, there is no failure, no loss,\nfor *wuwei* alone ensures all is rectified.\nYet if lost, one clings to *One* while indulging in *youwei*,\nbecoming *internal virtue*.\n\nThe lesser virtue embodies *One* in action,\nusing yin and yang as the law to govern the world.\nThus, Confucius said, *\"One thread runs through all\"*—\nthose who establish *One* as the standard\nsee all things submit naturally.\nIf *One* is lost, then the Five Constants and hundred virtues\nare pursued in deeds,\nbecoming *external virtue*.\n\n*Internal virtue* is to embrace *One*.\nFor *One* is the mother of the state,\nthe root of life.\nClinging to *One* without separation,\nroots grow deep and foundations firm—\nthis is the Way of eternal life and long vision.\nConfucius called it supreme virtue,\ngrounded in the Dao.\n\nWhat is also called *the Middle Way*:\nbefore joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise,\nthe heart abides in the balance of yin and yang.\nThe *Release School* calls this *the Middle Path*.\nIf the Mysterious School loses this,\nit indulges in hidden yin-yang movements,\nturning them into techniques.\n\n*External virtue* comes from cultivating\nthe Five Constants and hundred virtues in conduct.\nConfucius called this *sensitive virtue*,\nrooted in action.\nTo dwell in gentleness, non-contention,\nlike water eroding the rigid—\nas in kindness, frugality, seeming clumsiness—\nthis is its form.\nIf lost, it becomes cleverness, superficiality,\nboastful strength, reckless hunting,\nand the love of wealth,\ndwelling in honor and disgrace.\n\nThe Dao is very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice,\nyet people prefer shortcuts,\nso the farther they stray,\nthe less they understand.\nThe Great Dao is plain and easy,\nyet its power lies in *wuwei*—\nachieving without action.\n\nIn brief, all return to *wuwei*,\n*wuwei* through stillness,\nand stillness as the natural order of the world.\n\nLaozi spoke neither of elixirs,\nnor of immortals ascending in daylight—\nonly of *Dao* and *virtue*,\nnot of techniques.\n\n---\n**The Stages of Dao and Virtue**\nThe Dao has two paths,\nvirtue has three forms.\nThe first is the Dao of *emptiness* and *wuwei*.\nThe second is the Dao of *One-qi* in action.\nThus, the Dao has two paths,\ndiffering in depth.\nThe Dao of *One-qi* is also called supreme virtue.\nFrom supreme virtue downward,\nall belong to *youwei*,\nhence the three virtues—\ndistinguishing internal and external—\nthese are all the orthodox gates of the Dao.\n\nDao, virtue, yin-yang,\nand human affairs—\nthese four merge into one family.\nIf not harmonized,\nobstacles arise at every turn.\nStudents must examine them carefully.\n\n---\n*Recorded by Japanese monk Jipang Lai Zi*\n*on the Qingming Festival, Year *ji*mǎo of the Song Shaoxing era.*\n#1: The upper and lower sections likely omit the phrase *\"Laozi thus wrote the book.\"*\n\n---\n**Direct Exegesis of the *Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One**\nOriginally explained by Master Shao Ruoyu.\n\nThe Qinghe Resident Zhang Zhixin annotated:\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without desire, to observe its mystery;\nEver with desire, to observe its shallowness.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—\nboth called *Xuan* (the Profound).\n\n*Xuan* beyond *Xuan*, the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe Great Dao is supreme emptiness and supreme stillness,\nformless, nameless—\nnot to be sought through sight or hearing,\nnot to be grasped by thought or reasoning,\nnot to be reached by speech or language.\nIt is the Dao without beginning or end,\neternally present, unchanging.\n\nFrom the void’s beginning, *qi* arises as One,\nleaving traces of its movement—\nthus it can be spoken of.\nSince it can be spoken of, it is not the eternal Dao.\nSince it has the name *qi*, it is not the eternal Name.\n\nBefore *One-qi* manifested, in formlessness and namelessness,\nthis is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—\nthe Dao that cannot be spoken of.\nBecause of *One-qi*’s name, it becomes the mother of all things—\nthe Dao that can be spoken of.\n\nThus, one knows the body arises from *One-qi*;\nif one takes *One-qi* as the law,\nand awakens to it, one sees the Great Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is the true mind of humanity.\n*One-qi* is the desire born of the mind.\n\nThe true mind is originally empty and still,\nwithout birth or death.\nWhen the true mind stirs, desire arises—\nthis is called *desire*.\nThought, wisdom, intuition, cognition—\nbecause desire arises from the mind,\none follows desire and receives life.\n\nAfter birth, one accepts and rejects pleasures and aversions,\nclings to sights and sounds,\nrelies on strength and status,\ndwells in honor and humiliation,\nloses oneself in delusion—\nthus one clings to deluded mind.\nCovering the One-mind,\none fails to grasp the Dao of *One-qi*.\nIf one abandons delusion and clings to desire,\nthis is the One-mind.\n\nWhen held, it becomes upright;\nwhen attained, it becomes numinous—\nthe mother of all things,\nthe root of birth and death.\nBecause desire persists,\nthe true mind is obscured—\nthus there is birth and death.\n\nIf one has no desire,\nno desire means emptiness and stillness—\nthus one aligns with the Nameless Beginning\nand escapes birth and death.\nHence Laozi says:\n*\"Ever without desire, to observe its Heaven-Earth Beginning—*\nthis is the mystery of escaping birth and death.\"\nAgain:\n*\"Ever with desire, to observe its *One-qi* Dao—*\nthus it becomes shallow.\"\n*Shallow*—boundary, the meaning of *shallow*.\n\nDo not seek the mind with the mind as desire;\ndo not extinguish the mind with the mind as no-desire.\nThese two—having and not-having—\nare united as One.\nBecause of speech as teaching,\nthey are divided by the names *having* and *not-having*.\nWhen having and not-having merge, it is called *Xuan*.\nThe Buddhist School calls it the *Non-dual Dharma Gate*,\nalso the *Middle Way*.\nThe gate of *Xuan* takes the Middle as its law—\nlike a net’s mesh.\nYet law arises from the mind;\nonce arising in the mind,\nit clings to the Middle—\nthus it is not empty and still.\nLaozi feared the Middle Way’s law would bind,\npreventing one from abandoning the net—\nthus he explained it again with *Xuan* beyond *Xuan*.\n\nStudents, if they do not cling to having or not-having,\nnor dwell in the *Xuan* of the Middle Way,\nbut in actuality abide in the ground of reality,\nuntainted by a single dust-mote,\nthen the mind is empty and still—\nthis is *wuwei* (non-action),\nthus no need for seeking.\nBecause of no attainment,\nonly then is desire truly absent.\nThus, not a speck of dust arises—\nhence it is called *qingjing* (pure and clear).\nNo action at all—\nhence it is called *wuwei*.\nNo cultivation, no realization—\nhence it is called *ziran* (self-so).\nNo thing at all—\nhence it is called *xujing* (empty and still).\nUnconstrained and free—\nhence it is called *xiaoyaoyao* (effortless wandering).\nPerfectly ordinary—\nhence it is called *tianran* (natural ease).\n\nThus, without desire, one transcends all distinctions;\ntranscending distinctions, one has no affliction.\nThe mind without desire meets all things without self—\nwithout self, there is no strife—\nthus no blame.\nThe mind without desire transcends all good and evil;\ntranscending good and evil,\none is unbound by cause and effect.\nThe mind without desire does not cling to all things;\nnot clinging to all things,\nthere is no birth—\nno birth, no death.\n\nHe whose mind is ever without desire\nenters the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nAll under Heaven know *beauty* as *beauty*—\nthen *ugly* already exists.\nAll know *good* as *good*—\nthen *not-good* already exists.\n\nThus, having and not-having give rise to each other,\ndifficult and easy complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low contrast each other,\nsounds harmonize each other,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,\nconducts *wuwei* teaching without speech.\nAll things act without resistance,\nare born without possession,\nact without reliance,\ncomplete deeds without claiming them.\nBecause they do not claim,\nthey do not depart.\nThey do not exalt the worthy,\nso the people do not contend;\nthey do not prize rare goods,\nso the people do not steal;\nthey do not display what is desirable,\nso the mind does not stray.\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nempties the mind,\nfills the belly,\nweakens the will,\nstrengthens the bones.\nEver keeps the people ignorant,\nkeeps desires unaroused—\nso those who know and desire dare not act.\nActing in *wuwei*,\nnothing remains untreated.\n\nAll under Heaven know *beauty* as *beauty*—\nif one imitates it as *beauty*,\nthen *ugly* should cease.\nAll know *good* as *good*—\nif one imitates it as *good*,\nthen *not-good* should cease.\nWhy?\nBecause one observes:\nhaving and not-having generate each other,\ndifficult and easy complete each other,\nlong and short contrast each other,\nhigh and low incline each other,\nsounds and oppositions harmonize each other,\nbefore and after follow each other.\nPeople, clinging to beauty and goodness,\nobstruct the true mind,\nchase after phenomena as reality—\nthus arise the eighty-four thousand afflictions.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei* for the sake of things,\nthus harmonizing all things.\nConducting *wuwei* governance,\nteaching without speech to all under Heaven.\n\n「Moreover, all things arise together in their natural course, yet the Sage does not distinguish them with words, lest the people develop preferences and aversions, which would benefit neither the Sage nor the people.\n\nThe Sage governs by *wuwei* (無為) to ensure the people’s peace, so that the people are born without knowing the transformations of the ruler. Though the Sage may be their ruler and father, they do not rely on this position—this is the display of all virtues. When deeds are accomplished, the Sage does not claim the name—this is the concealment of all uses.\n\nOnly by not dwelling in traces does virtue endure and not depart.\n\nIf one does not exalt the wise and capable, it is lest people boast of their cleverness.\n\nWhat the ruler favors is called *feng* (風), and what the people delight in following is called *su* (俗). When the ruler exalts the wise and capable, the people below will surely vie to compete. If the Sage does not exalt the wise, it is so that the people do not contend for their names—thus, the names are not contended for.\n\nFood and wealth should be provided for sustenance and care, not for treasured rarities that are hard to obtain. If one treasures what is hard to obtain, the people will hide it deeply. Human nature is such: if given, they do not value it; if hidden, they will steal to take it.\n\nGovernance in a harmonious age is not without the use of wealth, but it does not treasure wealth that is rare and hard to obtain, lest the people become thieves. If the lower people do not see that names and profits are desirable, their hearts will not be troubled, and they will govern themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\ndoes not exalt the wise, so the people have no cleverness—no cleverness means their hearts are naturally empty, and empty hearts can contain all things, hence the saying, *“fill their bellies”*.\ndoes not treasure wealth, so the people have no desires—no desires mean their resolve is naturally weak, and weak resolve does not follow the world’s shifts, hence the saying, *“strengthen their bones”*.\nConfucius sighed over those whose roots were not firm—this is the case.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people without cleverness, their hearts become empty; if one constantly makes them without desires, they forget the world. When both heart and world are forgotten, there is nothing to cling to, and all affairs cease. Thus, even the clever dare not act.\n\nBecause the Sage acts in *wuwei* (無心) for the sake of things, all under Heaven will be without disorder.\n\nThe Dao is vast and yet finds use—\nthough it may not overflow,\nprofound it seems like the origin of all things.\nIt dulls sharpness,\nunravels entanglement,\nsoftens brightness,\nunifies dust—\nserene it seems, yet also as if it exists.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the Sovereign as the model.\n\nThe boundless Great Dao,\ntransforming and generating *yīqì* (一氣),\n*Yīqì* divides into yin and yang,\nyin and yang transform and generate,\nreceiving *yīqì* as their essence,\nthus knowing *yīqì* dwells within yin and yang—\nhence the saying, *“vast qi”*.\n\nThe Great Dao, through its vastness within yin and yang,\nfinds use like the heavens covering the earth,\nthe sun shining and the moon overseeing,\nwinter’s cold and summer’s heat,\nspring’s birth and autumn’s harvest—\nall are the uses of vast qi.\n\nVast qi:\nhas form yet is formless,\nis formless yet has essence—\nbetween heaven and earth,\nneither overflowing nor deficient,\nprofound it seems like the origin of all things.\n\nThose who study wish to see vast qi:\nthey must dull their heart’s sharpness—\nwhen sharpness ceases, their resolve rests,\nand they can unravel the entanglements of myriad affairs.\nWith idle resolve and few desires,\nthey harmonize brightness without contention,\nalign with dust without strife—\nwithin and without, unstained,\nserene it seems, yet only one heart remains.\nThough its traces are unseen,\nit also seems to exist.\n\nThe *Shìjīa* (釋家) likens it to the wisdom-lamp illuminating the moon,\nthe *Yǎnjīa* (衍家) calls it the Great Elixir of gold,\nMencius names it *hàorán zhī qì* (浩然之氣).\nIt is spoken of as the greatest and most unyielding—\nnurtured uprightly yet without harm,\nfilling the space between heaven and earth,\nthis *qi* is paired with virtue and the Dao.\n\nWhen Laozi points to the serene as if it exists,\nit is the *yīqì* (一氣) transformed by the Great Dao—\n“I do not know whose child it is,”\nthis is the model of all things as the Sovereign before yin and yang.\n\nHeaven and earth are not virtuous—\nthey regard all things as *chúgǒu* (刍狗), all cut and used alike.\nThe Sage is not virtuous—\nthey regard the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nHeaven and earth follow the Dao of nature—this is called supreme virtue. If not supreme virtue, then there is partiality.\n\nSpring’s birth is not virtue—\nautumn’s killing is not non-transformation—\nthey discard or employ things according to the season,\nregarding all things as *chúgǒu* (cutting grass for sacrifice).\n\n*Súgǒu* (刍狗) is like the straw-dragon of today—\nused in sacrifices.\nAt first, it is stored in a red lacquered box,\ncovered with an embroidered cloth,\nbut after the sacrifice, it is discarded and unused.\n\nThe Sage, with one heart as their virtue,\nthus takes the people’s hearts as their own.\nRewarding the good is not virtue—\npunishing the evil is not non-virtue—\nthey follow the people’s needs and circumstances,\nrewarding and punishing according to the times,\nthus using the metaphor of the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nZhuangzi says:\nSupreme virtue has no favorites,\ngreat virtue is non-virtue.\n\nOnly by being non-virtuous\nis one truly great in virtue.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it like the *tújué* (橐鞬)?\n\nEmpty yet not bending,\nmoving yet ever emerging.\n\nMany words and frequent sounds exhaust the essence—\nit is better to hold to the center.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nmeaning the four directions and above and below,\nis it like the *tújué*—\nthe bellows and the reed-pipes?\n\nThe *tújué* is empty within,\nits use lies in the formless—\nthus it is not burdened.\n\nThe bellows inflates the wind,\nthe reed-pipes direct the breath—\nmoving yet ever overflowing,\nlike the opening and closing of *qiánkūn* (乾坤),\nreleasing and containing things.\n\nLaozi wished to speak broadly and frequently,\nyet his essence is better preserved by holding to the center.\n\nThe center is emptiness.\nWith the heart dwelling in emptiness,\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *gǔshén* (谷神) does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuāntà* (玄牝).\n\nThe *Xuāntà*’s gate,\nthe root of heaven and earth.\n\nEnduring as if it exists,\nyet when used, it remains undisturbed.\n\n*Gǔ* (谷) is used to signify emptiness—\nemptiness is the Dao.\n*Shén* (神) is the *yīqì* transformed by the Dao—\nit is the having within the non-having.\n\nThe *Shìjīa* (釋家) calls this emptiness *shíxiàng* (實相),\ntaking its unbreakable nature as its meaning.\n\nThe *gǔshén* is formless,\nborn from non-birth yet also non-death,\nhence the saying, *“the valley spirit does not die”*.\n\nThe valley is the origin of birth—\ncalled *Xuān* (玄).\nThe spirit is the primal element of transformation—\ncalled *Tà* (牝).\n\nThus, *gǔshén* is called *Xuāntà*.\nAll things emerge from the *Xuāntà*’s gate,\nand what emerges is called *mén*—\nthis is called birth:\n*Yáng* (天) and *Yīn* (地) are its roots.」\n\n「To observe the *gǔshén*’s enduring flow—\nits ceaseless, ceaseless continuation—\nis to find the having within the seeming non-having, as if it exists,\nyet when it exists, it is the non-having within the seeming having.\n\nThose who act through it unite *shén* with emptiness,\nyet do not rely on exertion, contrivance, or striving in effort.\n\nHeaven endures long, Earth persists vast—\nthe reason Heaven and Earth endure long and vast\nis that they do not generate themselves;\nthus, they attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore, the sage follows this principle:\nhe places himself last, yet his body is first,\nhe sets himself aside, yet his body remains.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nHence, he fulfills his own virtue.\n\nLiezi says:\nAll things with form, appearance, sound, and color—\nthese are all *wù* (物).\nPeople see Heaven’s enduring and Earth’s vastness yet do not comprehend.\n\nRainbows and mirages, clouds and mists,\nwinds and rains in their seasons—\n*qì* accumulates to form Heaven.\n\nMountains and rivers, seas and valleys,\nmetals and stones, grasses and trees—\nforms accumulate to create Earth.\n\nThings with form—\nhow could they not decay?\n\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure long and vast\nlies in the *Sìjì* (四时) revolving,\ninheriting the Dao as the master of birth and transformation—\nHeaven and Earth, by not generating themselves,\nthus attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore, the sage emulates this:\ndwelling in humility, never daring to exalt himself,\nplacing himself last, yet his body is before others—\nfirst in time, last in rank—\nfor all worldly gains are but external to his body;\nby treating them as external, he avoids being burdened by them,\nand thus his body remains preserved for long.\n\nThe sage, by placing himself last and setting himself aside,\nis it not because he has no selfishness?\nHe imitates Heaven and Earth’s *wéiwéi* (無為),\nthus fulfilling his own virtue—\nthe highest virtue, like water:\nwater benefits all things without striving,\ndwells where others abhor,\nand thus nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nResiding in a virtuous land,\nheart like a deep pool—\ngenerosity like benevolence,\nspeech like trust—\ngovernance like harmony,\nactions like capability,\nmovements like timing.\n\nOnly by not striving,\nis there no blame.\n\nPeople love strife,\nyet Laozi holds that not striving is the highest virtue—\nhis parable is like water.\n\nWater has no *xīn* (心),\nyet desires to benefit all things without striving—\nthis is why it dwells where others abhor,\nfor water’s *dé* (德) nearly aligns with the Dao.\n\nStrife arises from the *xīn*;\nwithout the *xīn*, one is good at not striving.\nBy taking non-*xīn* as the principle,\none benefits all things—\nthus, residing without *xīn* makes one good at his land,\nheart without *xīn* makes one good at his depth,\ngiving without *xīn* makes one good at his generosity,\nspeaking without *xīn* makes one good at his trust,\ngoverning without *xīn* makes one good at his harmony,\nacting without *xīn* makes one good at his capability,\nmoving without *xīn* makes one good at his timing.\n\nOnly by not striving,\nis there no blame to encounter.\n\nTo grasp and fill,\nis not as good as letting it be.\nTo hoard at the start and then sharpen,\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade filling the hall,\nnone can guard them;\nwealth and honor with arrogance,\none invites his own calamity.\n\nWhen virtue is complete, name is fulfilled,\nretire the body—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nTo dwell in high status and great name,\nyet fear the weight of gain,\nis like holding a vessel full to overflowing—\never dreading it will tip and spill—\nnot as good as letting it be,\nand thus avoiding great fault.\nTo measure and then sharpen one’s blade,\nor to wield power with force,\ncannot be long preserved—\ngold and jade filling the hall,\nnone can guard them;\nit is because of wealth and honor that arrogance arises,\narrogance breeds excess,\nand this is not Heaven’s retribution—\none invites his own misfortune.\n\nYet how does one escape this fate?\nTherefore, the sage observes the revolutions of the *Sìjì*,\nlike the spring’s birth and transformation—\nwhen virtue is complete and name is fulfilled,\nat the height of summer, he retires his body,\nnever lingering—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*Zhíjiě* (直解) of the *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* (道德真经), Volume II, ends here.\n\n#1  *Yǐ* (已) also emulates this as beauty: [\"beauty\" likely means \"virtue\"]\n#2  *Míng* (名) does not contend for its name: this sentence is likely interpolated.\n\n*Zhíjiě* of the *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, Volume II, begins here with *Běnlái* (本来) by Zǐ Shào (子邵), as if he were a simpleton.»\n\n「Master Zhang Zhixin of Qinghe, in his annotated version, asks:\nCan one who nurtures the *Yíngpò* (营魄) and embraces the *Yī* (一) remain undivided?\n\nCan one who focuses his *qì* (气) to achieve supreme softness attain the state of an infant?\n\nCan one who purifies and contemplates the *Xuánlǎn* (玄览) remain free from flaws, as if a jade without blemish?\n\nCan one who loves the people and governs the state act without doing?\n\nCan one who opens and closes the *Tiānmén* (天门) act as the receptive *fēi* (雌)?\n\nCan one who is clear and boundless in all directions remain without knowledge?\n\nTo give birth and to rear—\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto act yet not claim credit,\nto grow yet not dominate—\nthis is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).\n\nThe mind has no fixed name,\nbut stands in accordance with its place.\n\nWhen the mind moves, it attaches to things;\nattaching to things reveals the mind.\n\nWhen the mind moves, it belongs to *yáng* (阳),\nand its name is *shén* (神), also called the mind.\n\nWhen the mind is still, it belongs to *yīn* (阴),\nand its name is *jīng* (精), focused unity, also called *xìng* (性).\n\nWhen the mind turns outward,\nit becomes sight and hearing,\nand its name is *hún* (魂), also called *qíng* (情).\n\nWhen the mind turns inward,\nit withdraws sight and reverses hearing,\nand its name is *pò* (魄), also called *yì* (意).\n\nAll these names arise from their respective places,\nyet collectively are called the mind.\n\nThus it is known:\nThe mind is the *Zǎichéng* (载乘) of the body,\nits sovereign, never ceasing to govern.\n\nNow, speaking of *pò* (魄),\nit is said that *pò* belongs to *yīn* (阴),\nand *yīn* is governed by stillness.\n\nWhen the mind is inwardly still,\nthe *jīng* (精) and *pò* (魄) reside;\nwhen *jīng* and *pò* reside,\nthe *shén* (神) and *hún* (魂) reside.\n\n*Yáng* (阳) is suppressed by *yīn* (阴),\nand the male is governed by the female.\n\nWhen *shén* (神), *hún* (魂), *jīng* (精), and *pò* (魄) blend harmoniously into one,\nthis is called *Bàoshǒu* (抱守) as *yī* (一).\n\nThough one who embraces *Yī* (一) may follow the *Èrqì* (二气) along the Yellow Dao,\nmeet the *Sānxìng* (三性) in the Primordial Palace,\npenetrate the *Wǔxíng* (五行), and harmonize the *Sìxiàng* (四象),\nthis is but the technique of longevity,\nnot yet attaining the Dao/Way.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) sighed:\n\"Can one remain undivided?\"\nTo separate and enter, to withdraw and return—\nonly when the mind is hollowed out and cleansed in stillness\ndoes one attain *Wúwéi* (无为),\nthis being the true mind,\nthe great Dao/Way.\n\nAs for focusing *qì* (气) to achieve softness,\nonce one speaks of focusing *qì*,\nit is already the use of the mind;\nhaving the mind means one cannot achieve true softness.\nCan one compare it to the infant’s mind,\nwhich knows no separation?\n\nIf one purifies and removes all phenomena,\nand holds the mind in supreme stillness—\nlike a jade without flaw,\ncan one remain free from attachment,\nand thus be without blemish?\n\nThe mind of loving the people and governing the state\nis the essence of governing the world;\nits deeds are manifest in traces,\nand traces bring worry.\nYet can one display the virtues of *rén* (仁),\nconceal the applications of *shī* (施),\nand remain without doing?\n\nThe natural opening and closing of the *Tiānmén* (天门),\nthe mind is its gate.\nWhen opened and closed in response to affairs,\ncan one follow and yield to the emotions of things\nand act as the receptive *fēi* (雌)?\n\nThe mind is originally still, clear, and pure,\nboundless in all directions.\nYet through attachment and entanglement,\nknowledge and perception arise,\nand understanding becomes obstructed.\nCan one remain without knowledge?\n\nFor the *Yī* (一) is the root of grasping and attachment,\nthe origin of birth and death.\n\nOnce one clings to *Yī*,\nit is no longer the Dao/Way of *Wúwéi* (无为).\nOnly when one departs from the traces of embracing *Yī*\ndoes one align with the *Xuán Dào* (玄道) of *Dé* (德).\n\nThe *Xuán Dé* (玄德) is to give birth and to rear—\nthe Dao/Way gives birth yet does not possess,\n*Dé* (德) acts yet does not claim credit,\nand when it reaches full growth,\nit does not dominate.\nThis is called *Xuán Dé*.\n\nTherefore, *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) said:\n\"To be in accord with the *Yī* (一),\nall affairs are complete—\nas if without a mind,\nyet the ghosts and spirits submit.\nThis is what is meant.\"」\n\nThe thirty spokes converge at the single hub,\nyet it is their emptiness that makes the carriage useful.\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nyet it is their emptiness that makes them functional.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms,\nyet it is their emptiness that makes them livable.\n\nThus, what is *yǒu* (有) is for utility,\nwhile what is *wú* (无) is for use.\n\nLaozi illustrates with carriages, vessels, and rooms\nthe principles of things—\nhow *yǒu* (有) brings convenience,\nwhile within *wú* (无) lies the boundless, wondrous use.\n\nTake the carriage: today’s eighteen spokes,\nancient thirty spokes—\nall converging at the single hub to form the wheel.\nThe wheel itself is a tangible benefit,\nyet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of motion.\nThus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the carriage.\n\n*Yáo* (埏) is blending, *zhì* (埴) is clay—\nshaped into vessels, like pots and jars.\nThe vessel is a tangible benefit,\nyet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of containment.\nThus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the vessel.\n\nAncient dwellings were dug from earth,\ndoors and windows carved for entry and sight—\nthen arranged into halls for rulers, parents, and ancestral rites.\nThe room is a tangible benefit,\nyet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of habitation.\nThus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the room.\n\nTherefore, the Sage values *yǒu* (有) for its convenience,\nbut *wú* (无) for its profound use.\nHence, the Sage employs the illusory body for utility,\nand the mind without mind for function,\nteaching disciples to grasp the principles of *yǒu* and *wú*\nand perceive the Dao’s true utility.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nhunting and chasing drive the mind to madness,\nrare treasures disrupt conduct.\n\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes.\nHe discards the former to embrace the latter.\n\nLaozi says the five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate—\nblindness, deafness, and loss of taste\nare all excesses of sensory indulgence,\nclouding the true mind\nand preventing perception of the Great Dao.\n\nAs for hunting and chasing,\nindulging in unrestrained pleasures,\nit drives the mind to madness.\nIf one covets rare treasures,\nattachment and greed disrupt conduct.\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly—\nable to contain all things—\nand does not indulge the desires of the ears and eyes.\nOnly by abandoning false attachments\ncan one truly attain real perception.\n\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden shocks,\nwealth and great misfortune are like the body itself.\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*?\nHonor is lowly—\ngaining it is like a shock,\nlosing it is like a shock.\nThis is called *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*.\n\nWhat is meant by *wealth and great misfortune as the body itself*?\nMy great misfortune arises because I have a body.\nIf I had no body, what misfortune would I have?\nThus, to value the body as the world—\nif one can entrust the world to it—\nto love the body as the world—\nif one can commit the world to it.\n\nHonor and disgrace are sudden shocks,\nwealth is a great misfortune—\nall because of the body.\n\nLaozi asks: What are honor and disgrace?\nHonor is gained, disgrace is lost.\nCold begets heat, honor begets disgrace—\nthus, honor is lowly.\nPeople cling to wealth and love for the body,\nso gaining it fears loss—\nhence the shock—\nlosing it brings sorrow and regret—\nhence the shock.\nThis is called *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*.\n\nLaozi asks: What is *wealth and great misfortune as the body itself*?\nLaozi says: My great misfortune arises because I receive wealth and love for my body.\nIf I no longer receive wealth and love for my body,\nthen what misfortune would I have?\nThus, if one values the body as the world,\none must invite disgrace—\nif one can entrust the world to it.\nIf one loves the body as the world,\none must invite misfortune—\nif one can commit the world to it.\n\nIt cannot be seen—*yí* (夷).\nIt cannot be heard—*xī* (希).\nIt cannot be grasped—*wēi* (微).\nThese three are beyond examination,\nthus they merge into *hún* (混) as *yī* (一).\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright—*jiǎo* (皦),\nits lower depths are not dark—*mèi* (昧).\n*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) yet nameless,\nit returns to *wúwù* (无物).\n\nThis is called the *zhuàng* (状) without *zhuàng*,\nthe *xiàng* (象) without *wù* (物)—\nthis is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).\n\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nfollow it, and you see no tail.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nto govern the present *yǒu* (有).\nTo know the ancient beginning\nis called the *jì* (纪) of the Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is empty and formless,\nthus it cannot be seen—\nits intent is vast and distant, hence called *yí*.\nThe Great Dao is soundless,\nthus it cannot be heard—\nits intent is subtle and expansive, hence called *xī*.\nThe Great Dao is shapeless,\nthus it cannot be grasped—\nits intent is minute, hence called *wēi*.\n\nWithout form, without sound, without shape—\nthese three cannot be examined in detail.\nThus, they merge as *hún* (混) into *yī qì* (一气).\n\nOne aspect governs above,\nmoving sun, moon, wind, and rain without brightness—*jiǎo*.\nOne aspect sustains below,\nnurturing all things without obscurity—*mèi*.\n\n*Shéngshéng* (绳绳)—\nspeaking of the continuous flow of *yī qì*,\nunbroken from above to below.\n\nIt can be yin, it can be yang,\nit can be round, it can be square,\nit can be green, it can be yellow—\nits marvelous uses are unfathomable,\nthus it cannot be named,\nreturning to the *wú* within *wù* (物).\n\nThus, the human mind itself\nis the *húnyuán yī qì* (混元一气).\nThis is called the *zhuàng* within *wú zhuàng*,\nthe *xiàng* within *wú wù* (物).\n*Zhuàng* and *xiàng* share the same meaning—\ntwo phrases stating the same truth.\n\nThis is called *huǎng* (恍)—\nseemingly having yet not having—\nand *hū* (惚)—\nseemingly not having yet having.\n*Huǎnghū* speaks of the indeterminate nature of having and not having,\nthus approaching it reveals no head,\nfollowing it reveals no tail.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nto govern the present *yǒu* (有).\nTo know the ancient beginning\nis called the *jì* (纪) of the Dao.\n\nWith one mind, one advances along the Dao—\nthe *Shì* (释) School calls this mind *bōrě* (般若),\nrelying on one mind to attain the other shore.\n\nThis is called the **framework of the Great Dao**.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way were subtle and profound, their depths unfathomable.\nBecause they were unfathomable, they were compelled to describe them in metaphor:\n*Yǔ* (豫) as if crossing a river in winter,\n*Yóu* (犹) as if fearing the four neighbors—\nsolemn and dignified, yet yielding like *róng* (容),\ndissolving like ice about to thaw—\n*dūn* (敦) as if upright like uncarved wood,\n*kuàng* (旷) as if vast like a valley,\n*hún* (浑) as if muddied like turbid water.\n\nWho can, within the turbid, still it to reveal gradual clarity?\nWho can, within the tranquil, move it to reveal gradual life?\n\nThose who uphold this Dao do not seek fullness.\nBecause they do not seek fullness,\nthey can expose the hidden without daily renewal to attain the Way.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* says that the ancient masters who excelled in the Way were subtle and profound,\ntheir deep principles unfathomable.\nBecause these principles are unfathomable,\nthey are provisionally described in metaphor,\nand the meaning of *yǔ* (豫) is further clarified.\n\n*Yǔ* (豫) as if crossing a river in winter—\nto walk alone through water is called *shè* (涉).\nA confluence of streams is called *chuān* (川).\nThis speaks of the meaning of reluctantly responding to affairs out of necessity.\n\n*Yóu* (犹) as if fearing the four neighbors—\nthis speaks of the meaning of one’s nature not extending outward.\n\nSolemn and dignified, yet yielding like *róng* (容)—\nthis speaks of the meaning of maintaining a composed demeanor to awaken insight.\n\nDissolving like ice about to thaw—\nthis speaks of the meaning of the mind, like ice, gradually dissolving and dispersing.\n\n*Dūn* (敦) as if upright like uncarved wood—\n*kuàng* (旷) as if vast like a valley—\n*hún* (浑) as if muddied like turbid water.\n\nWho can, within the turbid and muddied, perceive the gradual clarity of stillness,\nas if fearing the four neighbors?\n\nWho can, within the tranquil and still, perceive the gradual emergence of movement,\nas if crossing a river in winter?\n\nThose who uphold this subtle and profound Dao do not desire to hold fullness.\n*Mǎn* (满) means fullness.\nBecause they do not seek fullness,\nthey remain constantly empty and tranquil—\nempty and tranquil, thus able to expose the hidden without daily renewal\nand attain the Way.\n\nTo attain emptiness to its utmost,\nto uphold stillness with sincerity—\nwhen all things arise together,\nI observe their return.\n\nFor things are myriad and myriad,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called *jìng* (静),\nand *jìng* is the daily restoration of *mìng* (命).\nRestoration of *mìng* is called *cháng* (常),\nand knowing *cháng* is called *míng* (明).\nNot knowing *cháng* leads to reckless action—*xiōng* (凶).\nKnowing *cháng* allows for *róng* (容),\nand *róng* becomes *gōng* (公),\n*gōng* becomes *wáng* (王),\n*wáng* becomes *tiān* (天),\n*tiān* becomes *Dào* (道),\nand *Dào* endures forever—\nthus, one’s life does not perish.\n\nThose who revere the Dao must attain emptiness to its utmost\nand uphold stillness with sincerity.\nFor all things arise together,\nand from emptiness, *mìng* (命) transforms into *shénhuà* (神化),\n*shénhuà* into *yīnyáng qì* (阴阳气),\n*qì* into form,\nand form returns to emptiness—\nclearly seeing that emptiness is the root.\nThus, *Lǎozǐ* says, \"I observe their return.\"\n\nFor things are myriad and myriad,\nfrom small to great,\nfrom great to old—\neach returns to its root.\nStudents who wish to understand the method of returning to the root say that the heart must be still.\n*Jìng* (静) means the cessation of both inner and outer activity.\n\nAgain, it is said that *jìng* is the restoration of *mìng*—\nnot that within stillness there is some restoration seen,\nbut that by restoring the heart to stillness,\none attains its emptiness—\nthus, it is called *xūjìng* (虚静).\n\nThen governance becomes sincere and steadfast—\nthis principle cannot be spoken or proclaimed,\nfor it is the original *mìng* of the Great Dao bestowed upon us.\nThus, it is called *mìng* (命).\n\nThis *mìng* transcends *yīn* and *yáng*,\nfor it is the emptiness of the Great Dao.\nThe world speaks of life and death determined by *mìng*—\nthis refers to *yīn* and *yáng*.\n\nThe *mìng* that gives us form\ndwells within *yīn* and *yáng*—\nthus, blessings and misfortunes,\nlongevity and early death,\nare all visible in their unfolding.\n\nThis *mìng* has neither birth nor death,\npersisting eternally across the ten thousand ages—\nthus, it is called *cháng* (常).\nThose who know this eternal principle are called *míng* (明).\nNot knowing the eternal principle leads to reckless action—\n*xiōng* (凶) is near to disaster.\n\nKnowing this eternal principle,\none’s heart becomes empty and tranquil,\nand only then can one embrace all phenomena.\n\nEmpty and tranquil, one attains *gōngzhèng* (公正),\nwhich is the *wángdé* (王德) of kingship.\nA king governs the realm with emptiness and tranquility—\nthis is called *wúwéi* (无为),\nand it aligns with *tiān* (天).\n\nThe emptiness and tranquility of *tiān* align with *Dào* (道).\nHumans who align with the emptiness and tranquility of *Dào*\nendure forever—\nthus, one’s life does not perish.\n\nReturning to the root and restoring *mìng*,\nthe eternal Dao has no end.\n\nThe highest level: the people below do not know of its existence;\nThe next level: they cherish and praise it;\nThe next level: they fear and revile it.\nThus, when trust is insufficient,\nthere are those who do not believe.\n\n*Yóu* (犹) is the value of speech.\nWhen the work is accomplished and the affair fulfilled,\nthe people all say, \"This is natural.\"\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nthere arises *rényì* (仁义);\nWhen wisdom emerges,\nthere arises great *wěi* (伪);\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nthere arises filial孝 and kindness慈;\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nthere arise loyal ministers.\n\nTo abandon the Sage and discard wisdom,\nthe people benefit a hundredfold;\nTo abandon *rén* (仁) and discard *yì* (义),\nthe people return to filial孝 and kindness慈;\nTo abandon cleverness and discard profit,\nthieves and robbers cease to exist.\n\nThis triad—*rényì* (仁义), *zhìhuì* (智慧), and *qiǎolì* (巧利)—\nis insufficient to suffice as the Way’s essence,\nso the Sage established *shǔyīn* (属音) and *shùzhú* (烛) as their counterparts.\n\nTo behold the undyed and embrace the uncarved,\nto minimize private desires and reduce cravings—\nthis was the age of the Most High in ancient times,\nwhen the Way of *wúwéi* (无为) transformed the world,\nand the common folk knew only of the Sage’s transformation,\nyet saw no trace of it.\n\nIn the next age, down to Yao and Shun,\npurity and simplicity began to disperse,\nand though they taught through *yǒuwéi* (有为),\nthey sought to restore the Way of *wúwéi*,\nyet by manifesting the traces of *rén* (仁) and *yì* (义),\nthe people vied to honor them,\nand moved by the Sage’s wise governance,\nthey praised it joyfully.\nFrom then on, *rén* and *yì* altered human nature,\nand the Way of *wúwéi* was lost.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Since the House of Yu took the Seven Codes to disrupt the world.\"*\n\nIn the next age, down to the Three Kings,\nvirtue declined and righteousness thinned,\nso they employed punishments to make the people fear them,\nand thus conform to *rén* and *yì*.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"When it reached the Three Kings, the world was in great alarm.\"*\n\nIn the next age, down to the Five Hegemons,\ngreat *wěi* (伪) flourished,\nand cunning schemes were imposed upon the people,\nwhile the lowly defied the high,\nand punishments proved insufficient to deter them.\n\nAs Mencius said:\n*\"The Five Hegemons were but pretenders.\"*\n\n*Rén* and *yì* were but expedients to save the age,\nrooted in sincerity,\nso when trust was insufficient,\nthere arose those who did not trust.\n\nIn the age of the Most High,\nthey acted in *wúwéi*,\nvaluing speech as *yóu* (犹),\nand when deeds were done and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people said, *\"This is natural.\"*\nYet their governance was not displayed.\n\nWhen the Great Dao was abandoned,\nthe traces of *yǐ* (迹) and *yì* (义) became manifest.\nWith wisdom’s emergence,\ngreat *wěi* arose—\nfor wisdom is the mind’s delusive thought,\nand discriminating consciousness cannot unify the world.\n\nIn the age of the Most High,\nsubjects were naturally loyal and children naturally filial,\nyet when the six relations were not in harmony,\nit was because filial piety and kindness were now displayed,\nand when the state was in chaos,\nit was because loyal ministers were now displayed—\nall because of pride in cleverness,\nand the loss of spontaneity.\n\nIf one abandons the Sage and discards wisdom,\nand governs through *wúwéi*,\nthe people benefit a hundredfold.\nIf one abandons *rén* and discards *yì*,\nwithout altering human nature,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nIf one abandons cleverness and discards profit,\nwithout seeing desire,\nthen thieves and robbers cease to exist.\n\nThe Sage, wisdom, *rén*, *yì*, cleverness, and profit—\nthese three pairs are the adornments of civilization,\nso in governed ages, there are deficiencies.\nThus, Laozi established their counterparts.\n\nTo make people see their original, undyed nature,\nif they can preserve it,\nthis is called *bàopǔ* (抱朴).\n*Pǔ* (朴) is the Dao’s singular *qi*,\nin humans called *xìng* (性)—\nthe mind’s singular essence.\nTo take purity and simplicity as its meaning,\nand this as the standard—\n\nWorldly folk, clinging to desires and entangled in objects,\ngenerate private attachments,\nand thus defile their original nature.\nHow then can they see the undyed?\nOnly by minimizing private desires.\n\nWhat is minimizing private desires?\nIt is reducing cravings.\n\nThe One—\nthe true heart’s movement and also a kind of private desire—\nLaozi does not say to eliminate desire entirely,\nbut to reduce it,\nfor the Way of governance takes the One as its standard.\n\nWhen the people uphold the Way of reducing cravings,\nthis is called *dé* (德).\n*Nurturing all things is called *rén* (仁);\n*Rén* rescues safety and peril, called *yì* (义);\n*Yì* has approaches and withdrawals, called *lǐ* (礼);\n*Lǐ* adapts to change, called *zhì* (智);\n*Zhì* is sincere and real, called *xìn* (信).\n\nIf the people embrace the Dao,\nthen the Five Constants and myriad virtues arise naturally,\nand with the heart’s cravings reduced,\nthere is no capacity for artificiality.\n\nGreat is Laozi—\nhe makes the people return to their root,\nand from there flow naturally,\nteaching the world the Way of spontaneity.\n\n*\"Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\"*\n\nHow far apart is the *yī* (唯) of assent\nand the *ā* (阿) of dissent?\nHow different are good and evil?\nWhat the people fear,\none must also fear.\n\nVast and boundless—\nthe hearts of the common folk,\nrejoicing as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,\nascending the Spring Terrace in delight.\nI alone am silent, my virtue not yet manifest,\nlike an infant before it smiles,\n*chèngchéng* (乘乘), as if without destination.\n\nThe common folk all have excess,\nwhile I alone seem bereft.\nI, the heart of the foolish,\npure and unadorned.\n\nThe vulgar are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone seem dim.\nThe vulgar are keen and sharp,\nwhile I alone am muddled and still.\n\nThe gentle flow of water—\nits motion like the sea,\nthe gusting wind—\nlike an unending breath.\n\nThe common folk all have means,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet value seeking nourishment from the Mother.\n\nAll suffering arises from delusion,\nso Laozi teaches to abandon delusive thought as learning,\nthus there is no sorrow.\n\nYet to abandon delusion and return to the true,\nor to abandon the true and chase delusion—\nthis is like the *yī* (唯) of assent\nand the *ā* (阿) of dissent,\nboth emerging from the same heart,\nhow far apart are they?\n\nGood and evil,\nboth emerging from the same nature,\nhow different are they?\n\nWhat the people fear—\nthe galloping of delusive thought—\none must also fear.\n\nLaozi sighed at the hearts of people,\nendless and boundless—\nobserving the common folk’s joyful demeanor,\nas if feasting on the grand sacrifice—\nthe grand sacrifice, an ox,\nthe offering to Heaven.\nAs if ascending the Spring Terrace in delight.\n\nLaozi reiterated the intent of *\"Abandon learning\"*:\n*\"I alone am silent, my virtue not yet manifest,\nlike an infant before it smiles,\nchèngchéng (乘乘)—\neffortless and heartless,\nas if without destination.\"*\n\nThe common folk’s thoughts never cease,\nall in excess—\nLaozi said, *\"My heart alone seems bereft.\"*\nAgain he released it, saying:\n*\"I, the heart of the foolish,\nwithout wisdom or gain,\nonly pure and unadorned.\"*\n\nThe vulgar deem brightness as clarity,\nwhile Laozi said, *\"I alone seem dim,\"*\nfor my heart relies on nothing.\n\nThe vulgar deem sharpness as wisdom,\nwhile Laozi said, *\"I alone am muddled,\"*\nwith no attachment to things.\n\nThe gentle flow of water—\nits motion like the sea,\nspeaking of a heart unseen.\nThe gusting wind—\nlike an unending breath,\nas wind moves through empty space,\nwith nowhere to rest.\n\nThe common folk all have means—\nattached to things, generating thought.\nLaozi said, *\"I alone am stubborn and coarse,\"*\nnot swayed by external objects.\n\nLaozi said, *\"I alone differ from others in that my heart aligns with the Void,\nand I cherish seeking nourishment from the Mother.*\n\n*The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nonly vague, only obscure.\nObscure and vague—\nwithin it, there are forms;\nVague and obscure—\nwithin it, there are things.\nMysterious and dark—\nwithin it, there is essence,\nits essence most true,\nwithin it, there is verity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\nto measure all beginnings.*\n\n*How do I know all beginnings are thus?\nBy this.*\n\nLaozi speaks of the emptiness, the void—\nthe bearing of virtue is but one *qi*.\nThus it is said, *\"only\"* (as an interjection),\n*\"follows the Dao.\"*\n\nThe bearing of empty virtue—\nthis is the Dao’s transformation as a thing.\nIts thingness is only vague,\nits totality only vague—\nvague as light and clarity, thus seeming to exist.\nObscure as having yet to manifest, thus seeming nonexistent.\nThis is so.\n\nSpeaking finely,\nobscure and vague—\nseeming nonexistent, seeming to exist—\nwithin it, there are forms;\nvague and obscure—\nseeming to exist, seeming nonexistent—\nwithin it, there are things.\nThe words *thing* and *form* share a meaning,\nnot fixed in speech—\nemptiness within existence,\nexistence within emptiness,\nthus they are spoken in repetition.\nVague-obscure is the thing,\nthe thing is vague-obscure.\n\nAs earlier stated:\n*The formless form, the shapeless shape—\nthis is called vague-obscure.*\nVague-obscure is the undifferentiated *yuan-qi*,\nthe very heart of humanity.\nWhen the heart clings, vague-obscure arises;\nwhen the heart clings to nothing, it is mysterious and dark.\n\nLaozi first speaks of the realm of the heart with attachment,\nthen clarifies the Dao without attachment.\nMysterious and dark—\nthe intent of *mysterious*,\nthe intent of *dark*—\nwithin it, there is essence.\nNot that within mysterious-darkness another essence exists,\nbut that mysterious-darkness itself *is* the essence.\nZhang Pingzhu said:\n*\"Mysterious-darkness, unfathomable—this is true essence.\"*\n\nIts essence’s principle is most true—\nspeaking of its authenticity.\nThe vulgar take filth as essence—\nthis is the language of the artisans.\nFrom the interplay of yin and yang,\nblood and *qi* transform into whiteness,\nlike milk or curdled fluids.\nThis substance, shaped by sensation, has no fixed place—\nin the body, it is sweat;\nin the eyes, tears;\nin the nose, mucus;\nin the spleen, saliva;\nin the kidneys, semen—\nall generated by the heart’s attachment,\nyet not true essence.\n\nAgain it is said, *\"within it, there is verity\"*—\nfrom ancient times to now,\nits name remains unlost,\ncan be used to measure,\nto gauge all beginnings.\nLaozi said, *\"How do I know all beginnings are thus?\"*\nBy this mysterious-dark Dao.\n\n*What is bent becomes whole,\nwhat is crooked becomes straight.\nWhat is hollowed is filled,\nwhat is worn becomes renewed.\nWhat is little gains,\nwhat is much confuses.*\n\nThus the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.\nNot self-illuminating, hence clear;\nnot self-righteous, hence manifest;\nnot self-praising, hence has merit;\nnot self-glorifying, hence endures.\n\nOnly by not contending\ndoes Heaven and Earth not dare to act against it.\nWas the ancient saying *\"what is bent becomes whole\"*\nmere empty words?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to it.\n\n*What is bent becomes whole,\nwhat is crooked becomes straight—*\nhow so?\nTo dwell in lowliness is to preserve fullness;\nto be hidden is to endure.\nIts virtue then endures anew.\nFor the Daoist,\nto seek little is to gain,\nto seek much is to err.\n\nThus the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the pattern for all under Heaven.\nAs in:\nNot self-illuminating, hence clear;\nnot self-righteous, hence manifest;\nnot self-praising, hence has merit;\nnot self-glorifying, hence endures.\nThough appearing roundabout and crooked in straightness,\nit is by not contending.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes Heaven and Earth not dare to act against it.\n\nLaozi cites antiquity as proof—\nthe ancient saying *\"what is bent becomes whole\"*\nwas not idle speech.\nTruly, it preserves the self and virtue returns to it.\n\nFew words, yet natural—\ngales do not last a morning,\nsudden rains do not last a day.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth, though unable to endure,\nhow much less humanity?\n\nThe Dao is a rare cessation—\nspeaking of naturalness.\nNot natural, then affairs belong to contrivance,\nthus gales and whirlwinds do not last a morning,\nsudden and swift rains do not last a day.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth, though they act,\ncannot endure—\nhow much less humanity?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao:\nthose aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao;\nthose aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue;\nthose aligned with loss are aligned with loss.\nAligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;\naligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;\naligned with loss, loss is obtained.\nFaith insufficient, there is doubt.\nThus those who follow the Dao:\nthe Daoist’s heart ever empty and still,\nthus aligned with the Dao.\nThose who follow virtue:\nwith one heart,\nthus aligned with virtue.\nIf one focuses solely on benevolence and righteousness,\nlosing morality and virtue,\nthey align with the common loss.\nThose aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao;\nthose aligned with virtue obtain virtue;\nas for those aligned with loss—\nrelying on the Five Constants and a hundred virtues,\nexternal virtue cultivates the self,\nthus it is said even loss is obtained.\nThose who lose morality and virtue\ndo so because their faith is insufficient.\nThose who lose yet still claim virtue\nare deceived by doubt.\nThe benevolent and righteous are the foolish vulgar.\n\n*Those who stand on one leg cannot stand,\nthose who straddle cannot walk.*\nThe self-illuminating are not clear,\nthe self-righteous are not manifest,\nthe self-praising have no merit,\nthe self-glorifying do not endure.\n\nAs for the Dao:\n*Excessive food and superfluous actions—*\nthings may hate it,\nthus the Daoist does not dwell there.*\n\n*Standing on one leg* refers to the heel not touching the ground—\nthe foot cannot long endure.\n*Straddling* refers to riding—\nthings cannot long endure.\nThus the self-illuminating are not clear,\nthe self-righteous are not manifest,\nthe self-praising have no merit,\nthe self-glorifying do not endure.\n\n「When the mind is applied to affairs,\nit still cannot endure for long—\nhow much less when applied to the Dao?\n\nIf the mind clings to the Dao,\nthe Dao departs from the mind,\nand where there is mind, there is obstruction.\n\nIt is like grasping food to achieve satiety—\nonce sated, one must depart from food,\nyet it is said: *Excessive food and superfluous actions*\nhinder one’s progress.\nEven ordinary actions may be resented—\nhow much more so when applied to the Dao?\n\nThus, the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\nThere is a primal substance (*mixed and unified*),\nborn before heaven and earth,\nsilent and vast,\nstanding alone yet unchanging,\ncirculating endlessly yet never exhausted.\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it *Dao* and boldly name it *Great*.\n*Great* is passing,\npassing is distant,\ndistant is returning.\nHence, the Dao is Great,\nheaven is Great,\nearth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\n\nWithin the realm of the four Great ones,\nthe Sage-King occupies one.\nHumans follow earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows the Dao,\nand the Dao follows the natural.\n\nThe Great Dao is *empty and void*.\n*Empty and void* is without substance,\nyet naturally gives birth to being.\nAll things under heaven,\nfrom the myriad species to heaven and earth,\nare born from the unified *qi* before the formation of yin and yang.\n\n*Silent* means without sound,\n*vast* means without form.\nIt stands above all things yet does not alter,\ncirculates through the six directions yet never ceases.\nAll things arise from this One—\nit may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nThough it is said to have substance,\n*silent* and *vast* are names without designation.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"I do not know its name,\nso I call it Dao and boldly name it Great.\"*\nExtending the logic of *Great*,\none arrives at *passing*,\nthus it is said: *passing away*.\nPassing through the four directions and above and below,\nits principle grows ever more distant,\nthus it is said: *distant*.\nWhen distant, it cannot be extended further,\nso it returns to the One,\nthus it is said: *returning*.\n\nSince all things arise from this One,\nthe Dao is Great.\nAll things take form through yin and yang’s transformations,\nthus heaven is Great and earth is Great.\nIt is also said that the Sage-King is Great—\nmeaning that *empty and void* is his domain,\nand within this domain are the four Great ones,\nwhile the Sage-King governs all under heaven through the Dao,\noccupying one place.\n\nHumans cultivate virtue through the Five Constants and myriad conducts,\nyet they follow humility and modesty,\ntaking earth as their model.\nEarth’s nurturing follows heaven,\nheaven’s movement follows the Dao of unified *qi*,\nand the Dao of unified *qi* follows the *empty and void* of nature.\n\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the master of agitation.\nThus the Sage-King never strays from his burdens,\nthough he enjoys splendor and comfort,\nhe rests in serene detachment.\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nconsider himself lighter than the world?\nLightness will lose his ministers,\nagitation will lose his rule.\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the master of agitation.\n\nSpeaking of governance,\nthe Sage-King who moves daily\ndoes not abandon the weight of his supplies.\nThough he enjoys splendor and comfort,\nhe depends on stillness to rest in harmony,\ndetached yet visible.\nLight does not depart from heavy,\naction does not depart from stillness,\nthe ruler does not depart from the people.\nHow can one sigh over the burdens of ruling\nwhile holding oneself above the world?\nLightness toward the world will lose his ministers,\nagitation of the people will lose his rule.\n\nThe virtuous walk without leaving tracks,\nthe virtuous speak without blemish,\nthe virtuous plan without calculation,\nthe virtuous close without locks yet cannot be opened,\nthe virtuous bind without cords yet cannot be undone.\nThus the Sage-King always practices these virtues to rescue people,\nand there are none he abandons;\nalways practices these virtues to rescue all things,\nand there are none he discards.\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nHence, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,\nand the unvirtuous are the resources of the virtuous.\nIf one does not honor their teachers,\nnor cherish their resources,\neven if their wisdom is vast,\nthey are like great confusion.\nThis is called *essential subtlety*.\n\nThose who walk the Dao virtuously leave no tracks—\nthis is called *walking without walking*,\nwalking, yet leaving no tracks.\nThose who speak the Dao virtuously leave no flaws—\nthis is called *speaking without speaking*,\nspeaking, yet leaving no flaws.\nThose who plan the Dao virtuously have no scheming thoughts,\nthus they do not use calculations.\nThose who close the Dao virtuously have no desires in their hearts,\nso nothing can enter.\nThough there are no locks or bolts,\nit cannot be opened.\nThose who bind the Dao virtuously understand\nthat the Dao is within the heart,\nthus though there are no cords or constraints,\nit cannot be undone.\nHence the Sage-King always uses these virtues to rescue people,\nand there are none he abandons;\nalways uses these virtues universally to rescue all things,\nand there are none he discards.\nThus, in self-benefit and benefit to others,\nit is called *clinging to clarity*.\nTherefore, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,\nand the unvirtuous gain from the resources of the virtuous.\nYet if one does not honor their teachers,\nnor cherish their resources,\neven if they are clever and resourceful,\nthey cling to confusion like the greatest delusion.\nWithout wisdom and without attainment,\nthis is called *essential subtlety*.\n\nKnow its masculine,\nguard its feminine,\nand you become the *crevice* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *crevice* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue never departs,\nand it returns to the *baby*.\nKnow its white,\nguard its black,\nand you become the *model* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *model* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is never forceful,\nand it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.\nKnow its glory,\nguard its humiliation,\nand you become the *valley* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *valley* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is complete,\nand it returns to *primordial simplicity*.\n\nThose who study the Dao\ncannot yet fully grasp the *mindless* Dao—\nthey only know its masculine strength\nand fail to guard its feminine softness.\nThe *Laozi* likens this to the *crevice* of all under heaven,\nmeaning to dwell low and not contend.\nIf one can become the *crevice* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue never strays,\nand in time it returns to the *baby*.\nThe *baby* refers to\none who, upon seeing the world,\nhas no thoughts in their mind,\nyet understands clearly of its own accord.\nGuard its black and silent Dao,\nand you may become the *model* of all under heaven.\n*Model* also means\nto conceal light and hide virtue.\nIf one can become the *model* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is never errant,\nand in time it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.\n\nTo know its glory yet not rejoice,\nto guard its humiliation yet not grieve,\nis like being the *empty valley* of all under heaven—\nmeaning to be void yet able to contain.\n」\n\n「能为天下谷，常保其德，乃具足，久则复归於朴。\nTo become the *receptive valley* of all under heaven,\never preserving one’s virtue,\nis to attain fullness—\nin time it returns to the *Uncarved Block* (朴).\n\n朴散则为器，圣人用之则为官长，音掌。\nWhen the Uncarved Block disperses, it becomes *vessels* (器).\nThe sage employs it as *rulers and officials* (官长),\nto govern with authority.\n\n故大制不割。\nThus, the grandest institutions are not *severed* (割).\n\n夫朴者，大道化生一熙也，散则为阴阳。\nFor the Uncarved Block is the single

uniting,\ndescending sweet rain and dew,\nspreading universally—\nno one commands it,\nyet all is evenly nourished.\n\nThe **Great Dao**, through **primordial simplicity**, first established institutions and gave names.\nNames having been given,\none must also know when to stop.\nIf one does not stop,\none will lose their **primordial simplicity**.\nKnowing when to stop\nis how one avoids ruin and endures.\n\nThe **Dao** in the world\nis like rivers and valleys flowing toward the sea.\nTo know others is wisdom,\nbut to know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength,\nbut to overcome oneself is power.\nTo know contentment is wealth,\nbut to act with resolve is to have purpose.\nTo lose one’s proper place is to perish early,\nbut to die without losing one’s nature is longevity.\n\nThe **Dao** in the world\nis like rivers and valleys—\nall waters flow toward the sea.\nThis illustrates how all things under heaven\nultimately return to the **Dao**.\n\nTo observe its methods,\nto examine its path,\nto discern its rest—\nthose who know others do so through wisdom,\nbut people mistake wisdom for enlightenment.\nInstead, one should turn wisdom inward\nand know oneself.\nTo know oneself and govern oneself—\nthis is called enlightenment.\n\nTo overcome others is to rely on strength,\nstrategy, wealth, and sharp influence—\nbut this is not true power.\nInstead, one should still the force,\ncultivate the heart,\nand remain unmoved by all circumstances—\nthis is called power.\n\nThe world considers wealth as riches,\nyet riches are finite.\nBut if one knows the heart’s original sufficiency—\nits inexhaustible use—\nthis is called true wealth.\n\nWorldly pursuits are all small ambitions,\nbut to act resolutely in the **Dao**\nis to have true purpose.\nConfucius had purpose in the **Dao**.\n\nAll actions aligned with the **Dao**\nare thus enduring.\nThough the body may die,\nthe nature does not perish.\nTo dwell in the realm of non-birth-and-death,\nenduring through countless kalpas—\nthis is called longevity.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is vast,\nand may be turned left or right.\nAll things depend on it for life,\nyet it does not claim them.\nWhen its work is done, it does not dwell on it.\nIt clothes all things yet does not rule them.\nThus, it is always without desire—\nit may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it does not know itself as master—\nit may be called *great*.\nTherefore, the sage can accomplish the great\nbecause they do not consider themselves great.\n\nHold fast to this **Great Image**,\nand all under heaven will come.\nThey come without harm,\nand the world is at peace.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is vast—\nit has no fixed position,\nfor it may be great or small,\nand thus may be turned left or right.\n\nWhat is meant by *small*?\nThe **Dao**—\nall things depend on it for life,\nyet it does not claim them.\nLike spring’s work fully realized,\nby summer, spring’s influence has faded.\nIn spring, all things are nourished,\nyet it does not rule them.\nThus, the **Dao** is always without desire for things—\nit may be called *small*.\n\nWhat is meant by *great*?\nAll things return to the **Dao**,\nyet it does not know itself as master—\nit may be called *great*.\nTherefore, the sage can accomplish the great\nbecause they do not trace their actions to themselves.\nTheir work done, they do not dwell on it.\nBecause they do not claim greatness,\nthey achieve true greatness.\n\nHold this **Great Image** to govern,\nand all under heaven will come.\nThe people come because they come without harm—\nthus the world is at peace and harmonious.\n\nMusic and food are like bait for passing guests.\nWhen the **Dao** is spoken of,\nit is bland, without taste.\nTo see it, it is insufficient;\nto hear it, it is inaudible.\nTo use it, it is inexhaustible.\n\nThe world indulges in the five tones of music\nand the allurements of food,\nyet in a hundred years, it is like waiting for a passing guest to stop.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is spoken of,\nit is bland, without taste.\nYet to see it, it is insufficient;\nto hear it, it is inaudible.\nTo apply it in governing the state,\nthe family,\nthe self—\nbefore birth, after death—\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\nIf one would draw in the breath,\none must first exhale fully;\n---\n\nThe one who would weaken it must first strengthen it;\nThe one who would discard it must first exalt it;\nThe one who would take from it must first give to it.\nThis is called **subtle luminosity**.\n\nThe yielding overcomes the rigid;\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\n\nFish cannot be lifted from the depths;\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\nThe one who would gather must first disperse;\nThe one who would weaken must first strengthen;\nThe one who would discard must first exalt;\nThe one who would take must first give.\n\nYin takes root in yang—\nthis is the inevitable order.\n\nThose who grasp the logic of things\nare said to possess **subtle luminosity**,\nand thus know that yielding overcomes rigidity,\nthat weakness overcomes strength.\n\nFish cannot be separated from the depths—\njust as the state’s sharpest tools,\nonce revealed, are like fish out of water.\n\nWhen seals and decrees are issued,\nwhen measures and scales are standardized,\nthese are the state’s useful tools.\nYet if one seeks to remedy flaws,\none must first allow corruption to flourish,\nfor failing to perceive the principle of **subtle luminosity**.\n\nThe **Dao** acts without action yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to action,\nI shall govern it with the **nameless Primordial**.\nThe **nameless Primordial** also desires nothing.\n\nWithout desire, all things settle—\nand the world will align itself.\n\nTo govern the world,\none must act without acting,\nand yet nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold non-action,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\nBut if transformation gives rise to restless desire,\nI shall steady it with the **nameless Primordial**.\nThe **nameless Primordial** also desires nothing.\n\nWithout desire, all things grow still—\nand the hearts of the people will align themselves.\n\nThe highest virtue does not cling to virtue,\nand thus has virtue.\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus lacks virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without acting,\nthe lower virtue acts with effort.\nThe highest benevolence acts without effort,\nthe highest righteousness acts with effort.\nThe highest propriety acts with effort,\nyet when none respond,\nit resorts to force and compulsion.\n\nThus, when the **Dao** is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is the thinning of sincerity and trust—\nthe beginning of chaos.\n\nPremature wisdom is the flourish of the **Dao**,\nthe start of folly.\n\nThus, the superior person dwells in its depth,\nnot its shallowness;\nin its reality,\nnot its flourish.\nHence, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\nIn the age of antiquity,\nthe highest virtue did not display its virtue,\nand thus had virtue.\nBy the time of Fu Xi,\nwriting and marriage laws were established,\nand virtue was made manifest—\nthus becoming lower virtue.\nThough it did not lose virtue,\nit bore the traces of deliberate action,\nand thus lacked virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue governs through non-action,\nthe lower virtue governs through deliberate teaching.\nIn the age of Yao and Shun,\nthe highest virtue loved people and benefited all,\nacting as a benevolent ruler without effort.\nIn the age of the Three Kings,\nthe highest virtue established right and wrong,\ndistinguishing and acting—\nthus with effort.\nIn the age of the Five Hegemons,\nthe highest virtue upheld ritual propriety in governance,\nyet when ritual produced deceit and the people did not respond,\nlaws were enacted to make them fear punishment\nand follow righteousness—\nthus resorting to force and compulsion.\n\nThus, when the **Dao** is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\n\nFor propriety is a method to save the world,\nrooted in sincerity,\nyet arising from the thinning of trust—\nthe origin of chaos.\n\nThose who prematurely display wisdom\nare but the flourish of the **Dao**,\nnot its substance,\nand thus their adherence to its flourish\nmarks the beginning of folly among the people.\n\nHence, the superior person dwells in the depth of sincerity,\nnot its shallowness;\nin the reality of the **Dao**,\nnot its flourish.\nThus, they discard the shallow and the flourish,\nand embrace the deep and the real.\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—\nHeaven attained **Oneness** and became clear,\nEarth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil,\nThe spirit attained **Oneness** and became responsive,\nThe valleys attained **Oneness** and became full,\nAll things attained **Oneness** and flourished,\nAnd the lords and kings attained **Oneness**\nto govern the world aright.\n\nYet if **Oneness** were lost—\nHeaven, without **Oneness**, would fear fracturing,\nEarth, without **Oneness**, would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit, without **Oneness**, would fear stagnation,\nThe valleys, without **Oneness**, would fear exhaustion,\nAll things, without **Oneness**, would fear extinction,\nAnd lords and kings, without **Oneness**,\nrelying on their noble height,\nwould fear their position toppling.\n\nThus, nobility finds its foundation in humility,\nand height finds its base in lowliness.\nHence, lords and kings call themselves \"lonely, few, and unworthy\"—\nis this not their grounding in humility?\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, true praise is without praise,\nnot like jade clinking or stone clattering.\n**Oneness** is the mother of all things;\nall things arise from **Oneness**.\nThus, to attain **Oneness** is to flourish,\nto lose **Oneness** is to perish.\n\nThe **Laozi** speaks:\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—\nHeaven attained **Oneness** and became clear, covering all;\nEarth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil, bearing all;\nThe human spirit attained **Oneness** and became responsive;\nThe valleys attained **Oneness** and became full;\nAll things attained **Oneness** and flourished;\nAnd lords and kings, attaining **Oneness**,\ngoverned the world aright.\n\nYet if **Oneness** were lost—\nHeaven, without **Oneness**, would fear shattering,\nEarth, without **Oneness**, would fear eruption,\nThe spirit, without **Oneness**, would fear fading,\nThe valleys, without **Oneness**, would fear depletion,\nAll things, without **Oneness**, would fear annihilation,\nAnd lords and kings, without **Oneness**,\nrelying on their noble height,\nlosing reverence and humility,\nwould fear their position collapsing.\n\nThe noble, though in high estate, takes humility as root;\nThe exalted, though in lofty place, takes lowliness as foundation.\nThus do lords and kings—\nCalling themselves \"orphaned\" when fatherless,\n\"widowed\" when husbandless,\n\"without grain\" when lacking sustenance—\nAll to descend to the lowly.\nIs this not taking humility as root?\nOr is it that, recognizing their noble height,\nThey thus invite the loss of **Oneness** through excessive praise?\n\nPraise, when excessive, becomes blame;\nA foundation without praise is better.\nThus, one does not seek the **tinkling** of jade-like praise,\nNor the **clattering** of stone-like censure.\n\nThe **Dao** moves through inversion;\nThe **weak** is the **Dao**’s operation.\nAll things arise from **Being**, yet **Being** arises from **Non-Being**.\nHe who gallops his mind outward\nFinds nothing compared to turning it inward—\nThus, inversion is the **Dao**’s motion.\n\nMotion, when returned to **Non-Being**, is called **weak**—\nThe **weak** is the **Dao**’s operation.\n\nThe world knows only that all things arise from **Being**,\nYet does not know that **Being** arises from **Non-Being**—\nThus, the **Non-Being** is the **Dao**’s operation.\n\nThe **Superior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nDiligently practices it;\nThe **Middle Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nHolds it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nThe **Inferior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nLaughs at it—\nAnd if he does not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.\n\nThe **Superior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nGenerates true faith and acts upon it—\nThus he is called **Superior**.\nThe **Middle Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nHas no resolve within—\nHolding it as if it exists, as if it does not—\nThus he is called **Middle**.\nThe **Inferior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,\nBurdened by dust and deep in deeds,\nHearing its teaching, does not adhere to any single principle,\nYet, full of virtue and **power**,\nHe laughs at it.\nThe **Inferior Man** who does not laugh at the **Dao**\nMust be clinging to strange, contrived, artificial methods—\nThis is not the **Dao**.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe **Dao**, though bright, seems dim;\nThe **Dao**, though smooth, seems rough;\nAdvancing the **Dao** seems like retreat;\n**Virtue** at its height seems like a valley;\nGreat **whiteness** seems like shame;\nAmple **virtue** seems insufficient;\nEstablished **virtue** seems like theft;\nTrue **simplicity** seems corrupt;\nThe greatest **rectitude** has no corners;\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned last;\nThe greatest music is without sound;\nThe greatest form is without shape—\nThe **Dao** is hidden, nameless.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe **Dao**, though bright, seems dim—\nFor enlightenment brings no gain, thus it seems obscured.\nThe **Dao**, though smooth, seems rough—\nFor the great **Way** is plain and unadorned, requiring no cultivation or proof.\nAdvancing the **Dao** seems like retreat—\nFor it requires no contrivance of the mind.\n**Virtue** at its height seems like a valley—\nFor the heart, vast as emptiness, contains all things.\nGreat **whiteness** seems like shame—\nFor action without effort appears as disgrace.\nAmple **virtue** seems insufficient—\nFor the virtuous, perfect in all deeds, yet appear lacking.\nEstablished **virtue** seems like theft—\nFor its actions leave no trace.\nTrue **simplicity** seems corrupt—\n*Semü*—change. The mind, serene and still,\nAdapts to all things without resistance—\nThus it seems transformed.\nThe greatest **rectitude** has no corners—\nFor brothels and taverns become **Dao**’s sanctuaries.\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned last—\nFor only through diligent, sincere practice does one attain fulfillment.\nThe greatest music is without sound—\nFor supreme harmony is self-evident.\nThe above eleven lines speak of the **Dao**’s hidden, nameless nature—\nThus, the **Dao** is formless, beyond name.\n\nOnly the **Dao**,\nLends itself to **sound** and **completion**.\nThe **Dao** generates **Oneness**,\n**Oneness** generates **Twoness**,\n**Twoness** generates **Threeness**,\n**Threeness** generates all things.\nAll things bear **yin** while embracing **yang**,\nAnd through **suong-qi** achieve harmony.\nOnly the **Dao**,\nLends itself to **borrowing**—*dài*—\n**Yin** and **yang** generate and transform,\nYet ultimately return to the **Dao**.\nFrom the **Dao** arises **One Qi**,\n**One Qi** divides to form **Two Principles**,\n**Two Principles** generate and transform,\nWith **One Qi** as master,\n**One** merging with **Two**—\nThus **Threeness**.\n**One Qi** dwells within **yin** and **yang**,\nHence called **suong-qi**.\nThrough **Threeness**, all things arise—\nThus all things bear **yin** on their backs\nAnd embrace **yang** toward their fronts,\nAll relying on **suong-qi** for harmony—\nHarmony is the root of life.\n\nWhat men detest—\nOrphaned, widowed, without grain—\nYet kings and lords adopt as titles,\nThus things may be lost to gain,\nOr gained to lose.\nWhat men teach,\nI also teach as **right**.\nThe **strong and violent** do not meet a natural end—\nI shall take this as my lesson.\n\nWhy do men detest orphaned, widowed, without grain,\nYet kings and lords adopt such titles?\nThe **Way** of governing the world\nTakes humility as law—\nThus things may be lost to gain,\nOr gained to lose,\nAnd one knows that the humble receive benefit—\nThis was the teaching of the ancients.\n\nThe **Master** said:\nI too teach humility as **right**—\nWhy?\nFor those who rely on strength and violence\nDo not fulfill their governance and perish.\n\nThe **Master** said:\nI shall teach the **Way** of humility,\nTaking this as my father’s lesson.\n\nThe **softest** in the world\nOvercomes the **hardest** in the world—\nNothing enters where there are no gaps.\nThus one knows the benefit of **Non-Action**.\n\nThe teaching of **Non-Speech**,\nThe benefit of **Non-Action**—\nFew in the world attain it.\n\nThe **softest** in the world\nIs the **heart without heart**—\nYet deeper still is **Xuan**.\nIf one can wield this **softness**,\nIt becomes the **hardest** in the world—\nUnbreakable.\n\nThe ancient hymn says:\n*\"No head to see, no hands to hold—*\n*When the world’s foundation is laid, it knows no decay.\"*\nThrough **Non-Being** as **Being**,\nOne enters the realm of **Non-Birth-and-Death**,\nEternally enduring, without interruption—\nThus one knows the benefit of **Non-Action**.\nThis is a teaching beyond words—\nThe **Master** sighed:\nThe benefit of **Non-Action**—\nFew in the world attain it.\n\nWhich is more intimate—**name** or **body**?\nWhich is more abundant—**body** or **wealth**?\nWhich brings greater harm—**gain** or **loss**?\nThus, the more one loves excessively, the greater the expenditure;\nThe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no shame;\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\nWhich is more intimate—**high name** or **body**?\nWhich is more abundant—**body** or **wealth**?\nGain and loss arise from **name** and **profit—**\nWhich brings greater harm?\n\nThus, the one who loves **name** excessively will inevitably incur great costs when **name** grows vast;\nThe one who hoards **wealth** will surely suffer great loss when **wealth** becomes abundant.\nTo dwell in **name** yet know sufficiency brings no shame,\nTo dwell in **wealth** yet know when to stop brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\nThe great completion seems incomplete,\nYet its use is never exhausted.\nThe great fullness seems empty,\nYet its use is never depleted.\nThe great uprightness seems crooked,\nThe great cleverness seems clumsy,\nThe great eloquence seems tongue-tied.\n\n**Yang** overcomes **cold** (by its vigor),\n**Yin** overcomes **heat** (by its stillness),\n**Qingjing** (purity and tranquility) is the **Dao** of the world.\n\nGreat completion is like inversion—\nThus it seems as if it were not fully realized,\nYet its use is never exhausted.\n**Defeat** is like great fullness—\nThus it seems as if it were empty,\nYet its use is never depleted.\n\nGreat uprightness does not assert itself—\nThus it seems like crookedness;\nGreat cleverness conceals its wisdom—\nThus it seems like clumsiness;\nGreat eloquence does not speak—\nThus it seems like tongue-tiedness.\n\nHence, incompleteness can overcome completion,\nemptiness can overcome fullness,\ncrookedness can overcome uprightness.\nClumsiness overcomes cleverness,\ntongue-tiedness overcomes eloquence—\nJust as **Yang** overcomes **cold** (when active),\n**Yin** overcomes **heat** (when still).\nThis is like medicine countering illness,\nand only **purity, tranquility, and Non-Action** can void all **realms** and achieve absolute cure—\nThus it is the **Dao** of the world.\n\nWhen the **Dao** prevails in the world,\nwarhorses are turned back to till the fields;\nWhen the **Dao** is absent from the world,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than **desire** for what is **obtainable**,\nNo calamity is greater than **greed** for what is **unknowable**,\nNo fault is greater than **covetousness** for what is **acquired**.\n\nHence, one who truly knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\nThe ancient **army** was the **peasantry**,\nAnd the **peasantry** was the **army**—\nWhen there was conflict, they fought;\nWhen there was peace, they cultivated.\nWhen the **Dao** prevails in the world,\nthe people each settle into their occupations,\nand warhorses are turned back to till the fields.\nSoldiers use their **excrement** to fertilize the fields,\nand they attend to agricultural matters.\n\nWhen the **Dao** is absent from the world,\nwarhorses multiply in the suburbs—\nThirty **li** from the royal **city** is the near suburb,\nSixty **li** from the royal **city** is the far suburb.\nThe cause of the absence of the **Dao** is this:\n\nNo crime is greater than indulging the **heart** in **desire** for what is **obtainable**,\nNo calamity is greater than gluttony of the **heart** in **unknowing** sufficiency,\nNo fault is greater than fixating the **heart** on **covetousness** for what is **acquired**.\n\nIndeed, crimes, calamities, and faults all arise from **desire**.\nIf the **heart** is without **desire**,\nThen one can know sufficiency—\nIts sufficiency is always sufficient,\nWhatever it encounters.\nCalamities and faults are thus removed—\nWhat crimes can there be?\n\nWithout stepping outside the door,\nOne knows the world;\nWithout peering through the window,\nOne sees the **Dao** of Heaven.\n\nThe more one strays far from it, the less one knows of it.\nHence, the Sage does not act yet knows,\nDoes not see yet names,\nDoes not do yet accomplishes.\n\nThe **Dao** uniformly permeates all things,\nYet its knowing lies within oneself.\nTo seek the **Dao**, one need not step outside the door—\nOnly reflect upon the mind,\nFor its essence is one with all things,\nThus one knows all things under Heaven.\n\nIf one can further abandon the traces of reflection,\nWith the mind free from attachments,\nThen one need not peer through the window—\nEven without outward gaze,\nOne sees the **Dao** of Heaven.\n\nBut if one seeks the **Dao** through calculations,\nThrough **yin-yang** [阴阳],\nThrough human affairs,\nThe farther one strays,\nThe less one knows.\n\nHence, the Sage does not act yet knows the nature of all things,\nDoes not see yet names what Heaven creates,\nAnd remains without doing yet accomplishes all.\n\nIn learning, one gains incrementally;\nIn the **Dao**, one diminishes daily.\nDiminish again and again,\nUntil one reaches **wuwei** [无为],\n**Wuwei** yet accomplishes all.\n\nTherefore, those who take all under Heaven,\nAlways act with **wuwei** [无事],\nYet when they must act,\nTheir actions are insufficient to take all under Heaven.\n\nFor those who learn, daily they strive for increase—\nFor those who seek the **Dao**, daily they diminish all entanglements.\n\nNow, those who seek learning through increase have two afflictions:\nThe first is reading, reciting, and copying,\nHolding onto many teachings—\nThis is called **fixation on things** [名着事].\n\nThe second is probing into textual meanings,\nExhaustively examining words and logic—\nThis is called **fixation on principles** [名着理].\n\nThese are all cases where the mind has attachments,\nThus they must be diminished.\n\nThose who seek the **Dao** through diminishing also have two afflictions:\nThe first is severing delusive thoughts,\nSeeking stillness outside the mind—\nThis is called **grasping at nothingness** [名执无].\n\nThe second is rejecting all dusty entanglements,\nExclusively guarding the mind—\nThis is called **grasping at somethingness** [名执有].\n\nThese are all cases where the mind clings,\nThus they must be diminished again.\n\nDiminish the mind of learning and the mind of seeking the **Dao**,\nAbandon attachments and clinging,\nUntil one reaches the **Dao** of **wuwei** [无为之道].\n**Wuwei** is acting without a fixed mind.\nNot without a mind—\nIt means the mind is devoid of all thoughts,\nCalled **wuxin** [无心].\n\nActing without a mind,\nNaturally the senses are empty,\nListening and observing freely,\nSpontaneously removing poverty and wealth,\nLiking and disliking,\nThe toil of **yunshui** [运水], **banchaishu** [般柴役],\nMoving through the world without encumbrance,\nThus **wuwei** yet accomplishes all things.\n\nHence, those who take and govern all under Heaven with the **Dao**,\nAlways act with **wuwei** [无事],\nYet when they must act,\nTheir actions are insufficient to take and govern all under Heaven.\n\nThe Sage has no fixed mind,\nTaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous—\nThe not virtuous, I also treat as virtuous,\nThus **virtue** is accomplished.\nThe trustworthy, I trust—\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust,\nThus **virtue** is trustworthy.\n\nThe Sage’s presence in all under Heaven,\nIs like the sound of **\"hunxin\"** [浑心],\nFor the people are all focused on their ears and eyes,\nWhile the Sage nurtures them like children.\n\nThe Sage acts with **wuwei** [无为], **wuwei** [无为],\nWithout fixed intentions in their actions,\nYet responds to affairs with the people’s hearts—\nAs the *Jiyu* [《击辞》] says:\n*\"Silent and unmoving, yet responsive—*\n*Thus they naturally harmonize with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nTheir **virtue** is revealed through the affairs they encounter.\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous—\nIf there are the not virtuous,\nThe Sage does not distinguish,\nYet I also treat them as virtuous,\nThus **virtue** transforms the people into goodness.\n\nThe trustworthy, I trust—\nIf there are the untrustworthy,\nThe Sage does not distinguish,\nYet I also trust them,\nThus **virtue** transforms the people into trustworthiness.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s presence in all under Heaven:\nIf they doubt not the things,\nThen all under Heaven’s things become trustworthy;\nIf they favor not the things,\nThen all under Heaven’s things become public;\nIf they prize not the treasures,\nThen all under Heaven will not gluttonously consume;\nIf they indulge not in excess,\nThen all under Heaven will naturally follow frugality;\nIf they use what is true,\nThen all under Heaven will not feign falsity;\nIf they exalt the humble,\nThen all under Heaven will not contend.\n\nThus, the Sage’s **\"hunxin\"** [浑心] nurtures all under Heaven,\nAnd the people all focus their **virtue** on their ears and eyes,\nWhile the Sage remains in **wuwei** [无心] toward affairs,\nNurturing them like children.\n\nBirth and death,\nThose who live, thirteen in ten,\nThose who die, thirteen in ten,\nEven the people’s movement from life to death is thirteen in ten.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.\n\nThe Master of Life Cultivation\n\nIt is said that those skilled in nurturing life\nwalk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battle yet are unharmed by weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they dwell in no place of death.\n\nSome in the world direct their minds outward,\ntaking Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang as their model,\npracticing visualization, gargling, and breath control—\nmethods like *tuna* and *panrun*—\nin their pursuit of longevity.\nOthers direct their minds inward,\nsinking into emptiness and stillness,\nbecoming dim and lifeless as death itself.\n\nLaozi spoke of ten parts as his standard:\nOf those who live, three parts perish;\nof those who die, three parts perish#1,\nand of the people, some say \"all beings.\"\nThe Confucian says: \"The people are the sprouts of the myriad things.\"\nYet even among those who seek to nurture life,\nthree parts perish in the realm of death.\nLaozi himself asked: If people nourish life with food and clothing,\nwhy do they perish in the realm of death?\nBecause they cling excessively to the act of living itself.\n\nThree threes make nine—\nall who do not transcend:\nthose who live cling to being,\nthose who die cling to non-being,\nand the people cling to phenomena.\nThese three cling to something with their minds,\nall dwelling in the realm of life and death.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in transcending life\ndetach from external phenomena,\navoid the two extremes,\nand have no attachment at all.\nThey do not fixate in the mind,\nseeing as though not seeing,\ncoming as though not coming.\nBody and mind are as one,\nand thus they walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battle yet are unharmed by weapons.\nThe rhinoceros—like an ox, blue in color, weighing a thousand *jin*—\nhas no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nThus, fierce beasts and weapons cannot harm them.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their minds are unattached,\nand in sitting, standing, moving, or resting,\ntheir minds remain ever empty and still.\nEmpty means without form,\nstill means without birth.\nBecause they are without birth,\nthey dwell in no place of death.\n\nThe Dao gives birth,\nvirtue nurtures,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nThe Dao’s eminence,\nvirtue’s nobility—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they remain ever natural.\n\nThe Dao gives birth and nurtures,\nlengthens and matures,\ncompletes and ripens,\nnourishes and shelters.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\nlengthens yet does not rule—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nAll things arise from the Dao and are nurtured by virtue,\ntheir forms shaped by the interplay of giving birth and nurturing,\nand thus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nMoreover, the Dao’s eminence,\nvirtue’s nobility—\ntheir essence cannot be conferred by rank,\nyet they remain ever natural.\n\nThus, all things are born, nurtured, matured,\ncompleted, ripened, nourished, and sheltered by the Dao.\nThey arise from the Dao yet are not possessed by it,\nare nurtured by virtue yet do not rely upon it,\nare lengthened yet are not ruled—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they remain ever natural.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nUnder Heaven, there is a beginning,\nwhich is the mother of all things.\nHaving obtained the mother,\none knows her children.\nHaving known the children,\none returns to guard the mother.\nThus, one’s life will not perish.\n\nLiezi said:\n\"All that has form arises from the formless.\"\nThus, the beginning of all things under Heaven is the formless,\nand the formless is the mother of all things.\nHaving obtained the emptiness of the formless as mother,\none knows all things as her children.\nHaving known the children,\none must return to guard the mother.\nIf a person can harmonize their mind with the formless,\nas a child returns to its mother,\nthen their life will not perish.\n\nClose the orifices,\nshut the gates,\nand one will labor no more their whole life.\nOpen the orifices,\npursue affairs,\nand one will never be saved their whole life.\n\nTo see small is clarity,\nto hold fast to softness is strength.\nTo use its light,\nand return to its clarity—\nthis leaves no calamity for the body,\nand is called \"following the constant.\"\n\nThe eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—\nthese are called the six gates.\nThrough the six gates, delusive afflictions arise,\nand become the door to calamity.\nLaozi taught to close the orifices—\nthe gates are the openings—\nand shut the six gates’ doors.\nWhen greed and delusion cease,\none labors no more their whole life.\nIf one opens the orifices,\npursues affairs,\nand admits delusive afflictions,\none will never be saved their whole life.\n\nThe six gates take the mind as their root.\nIf the root is removed,\nthe phenomena will vanish on their own.\nThus, Laozi said:\n\"To see small is clarity\"—\nconstantly without desire,\none may be called 'small.'\nTo hold fast to softness is strength.\nThe utmost softness under Heaven\nresponds to things and conforms to customs,\nthus using its light.\nWithin, the mind is empty and still,\nand thus returns to its clarity.\n'To see small is clarity'—\nclarity is like a lamp’s flame,\nwhile light is its outward radiance.\nTo constrain it is called 'no loss of speech,'\nto lose it brings calamity to the body.\nNot losing speech is called 'following the constant.'\n\nThe Dao makes me distinctly aware—\n*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—\nand aligns me with the Great Dao,\nonly to fear its application.\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nyet people prefer narrow paths.\nThe court is excessively cleared,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries are empty,\ngarments are adorned with embroidery,\nbelts are girded with sharp blades,\nfeasts gluttonously indulge,\nwealth is hoarded in excess—\nthis is called boasting of the Dao,\nyet it is not the Dao at all.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n\"The Dao cannot be questioned,\nand questions have no answer.\"\nThus, the Great Dao transcends speech\nand cannot be sought through sight or hearing,\ncannot be known through thought or discourse,\ncannot be reached through language.\nIf one applies knowledge, conduct, or speech to the Dao,\nthen one may truly fear it.\n\nThus, Laozi said:\n\"The Dao makes me distinctly aware—\n*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—\nand aligns me with the Great Dao,\nonly to fear its application.\"\nTruly, I tell you:\nThe Great Dao is most level—\nplain and without action—\nyet people pursue clever shortcuts,\nstriving for immediate results.\nWhat of the times when courts vaunt cleverness and favor techniques,\nwhen the Dao is neglected,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries are empty,\npeople compete in ornate attire—\ngarments embroidered with green and white—\nand gird themselves with symbols of power like sharp blades,\nindulge in gluttonous feasts,\nand hoard wealth for surplus—\nthis is called boasting of the Dao,\nyet it is not the Dao at all.\n\nObserving the Way of the age and applying these words—\nthus it is worthy of fear.\n\nWhat is well-established cannot be uprooted,\nwhat is well-embraced cannot be abandoned.\nDescendants continue through sacrifice without ceasing.\n\nWhen cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true;\nwhen cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows;\nwhen cultivated in the neighborhood, its virtue extends;\nwhen cultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes;\nwhen cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, one observes the self through the self,\nthe family through the family,\nthe neighborhood through the neighborhood,\nthe state through the state,\nthe world through the world.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nWhat is well-established in virtue is used without depletion,\nwhat is well-guarded in virtue is held without loss.\nLike descendants transmitting sacrifices without end.\n\nWhen cultivated in the self, its virtue is true;\nwhen cultivated in the family—if all in the family cultivate—its virtue overflows;\nwhen cultivated in the neighborhood—if all in the neighborhood cultivate—its virtue extends;\nwhen cultivated in the state—if all in the state cultivate—its virtue flourishes;\nwhen cultivated in the world—if all in the world cultivate—its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, one observes the self through the virtue of self-cultivation,\nthe family through the virtue of family-cultivation,\nthe neighborhood through the virtue of neighborhood-cultivation,\nthe state through the virtue of state-cultivation,\nthe world through the virtue of world-cultivation,\ntransmitting virtue endlessly,\nusing it without depletion,\nlike descendants passing on sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nLaozi said:\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this virtue of self-cultivation.\n\n*The True Scripture of Dao and Virtue: Direct Explanation, Scroll Three, completed.*\n\n*The True Scripture of Dao and Virtue: Direct Explanation, Scroll Four*\n\n**#1**

snatch—*its grasp is firm and unyielding*.\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its hold is strong;\nIt knows not the union of male and female—*yet its essence is supreme*.\nIt cries all day without its voice breaking—*its harmony is perfect*.\nTo know harmony is to know constancy,\nTo know constancy is to know clarity.\n\nTo augment life is to bring auspiciousness,\nTo strain the *qi* by force is to make the body temporarily strong.\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called *not-Dao/Way*,\nAnd *not-Dao/Way* should be abandoned early.\n\nThe virtue/power of embracing and nurturing—\nWhen its cultivation is profound,\nIts conduct may be likened to that of an infant.\nThe infant, externally, has no attachments to things,\nInternally, has no fixed desires.\nWithout desires, things cannot sway it—\nThus, venomous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize it,\nAnd birds of prey do not snatch its grasp.\n\nThe infant’s bones are weak, its sinews soft,\nYet it holds objects firmly with its hands;\nIt knows not the union of male and female—*yet its vital essence is supreme*.\nIt cries all day without its voice breaking—*its harmony is perfect*.\nTo know the infant’s state of no desires,\nIts supreme essence, and its perfect harmony—\nThis is to know constancy,\nAnd knowing constancy is to know clarity.\n\nTo fail to grasp this constancy,\nTo multiply means of augmenting life—\nThis is called *auspicious calamity*.\nOr, to strain the *qi* by force,\nTo make the body temporarily strong—\nThis is a contrived method,\nNot the true Dao/Way.\n\nWhen the body is strong and the *qi* is strained,\nIt is like things relying on their vigor—\nVigor peaks, then decay follows—\nThis is called *not-Dao/Way*.\nNot being the Dao/Way,\nIt should be abandoned early.\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak are not wise.\nClose its *yue* [\"cheek/jaw\" — *metaphor for excessiveness*],\nShut its door,\nDull its sharpness,\nUnravel its entanglements,\nBlend its radiance,\nEqualize its dust—\nThis is called *mysterious unity*.\n\nIt cannot be drawn near nor kept distant,\nCannot be used for gain nor for harm,\nCannot be exalted nor debased—\nThus, it is held in highest esteem by all under heaven.\n\nThose who awaken to this themselves cannot speak of it;\nIf they indulge in speech, they do not know it.\nTo seek the Dao/Way that cannot be spoken,\nOne must merely close its *yue*,\nShut its door,\nDull the mind’s sharpness,\nUnravel the world’s entanglements.\nIn action, blend its radiance,\nIn life, equalize its dust—\nConstantly responding, yet constantly still—\nThis is called *mysterious unity of nature*.\n\nWithout hatred nor love,\nNearness and distance are naturally balanced,\nGain and harm are naturally removed,\nExaltation and debasement are naturally extinguished—\nThus, all things cannot be drawn near nor kept distant,\nCannot be used for gain nor for harm,\nCannot be exalted nor debased.\nAll causes cease,\nEmotional perceptions are severed,\nAnd it stands effortlessly alone—\nTranscending all laws,\nThus it is held in highest esteem by all under heaven.\n\nGovern the state with rectitude,\nEmploy the *Dao/Way*’s subtlety in warfare—*alternative reading: \"strange/uncanny\"*,\nGain the world through non-action.\nHow do I know this to be true?\nUnder heaven, many taboos exist,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nMany sharp tools are wielded,\nYet the state grows ever more corrupt;\nMany clever artifices are employed,\nYet strange/uncanny deeds multiply;\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nYet thieves and bandits proliferate.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves,\nI love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude,\nI claim no action, yet the people grow rich,\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.*\nIts governance is veiled and indistinct,\nYet its people are pure and unadulterated;\nIts governance is scrutinized and rigid,\nYet its people grow weary and rebellious.\nCalamity, ah! is the reverse of fortune,\nFortune, ah! is the foundation of calamity.\nWho can know their ultimate limits?\nIs it not that they lack rectitude?\"*\n\nThe rectitude becomes again the uncanonical and the strange,\nThe good reverts to the demonic.\n\nThe people’s confusion—\nits duration has long since been established.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nhonest yet does not sever,\nupright yet does not overstep,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nRectitude is singularity.\nWhen kings and lords attain singularity, they become the rectitude of the world—\nthus it is said: *\"With rectitude, one governs the world.\"*\n\nFortune, misfortune, regret, and blame arise from action,\nbut singularity alone can conquer and prevail—\nthus it is said: *\"With the uncanonical and singular, one subdues the world through warfare.\"*\n\nSunzi said: *\"Thus, one takes the world with non-action.\"*\n\nLaozi asked: *\"How do I know this is so?\"*\n\nIn the Zhou era, the world was rife with taboos,\npeople dared not speak of maladies below,\nyet the people grew ever poorer;\nmany sharp tools were wielded for convenience,\nand the virtue of the worthy was prized for cleverness—\nthus the state grew ever more corrupt;\nmany clever artifices were employed,\nyet useless excesses flourished—\nthus strange and uncanny deeds multiplied;\nlaws and decrees grew ever more explicit,\nyet virtue and moral cultivation were neglected—\nthe people knew no shame,\nthus thieves and bandits proliferated.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves,\nI love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude,\nI claim no action, yet the people grow rich,\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThus, to govern the world with non-action,\nthough its governance is veiled and indistinct,\nit does not display its rule—\nyet its people are pure and unadulterated, transforming themselves.\n\nIf one governs the world with action,\nthough its governance is scrutinized and rigid,\ndisplaying its rule—\nits people grow weary and rebellious, incomplete and unfulfilled.\n\nTo save the world with action,\nis like the King Tang treating scabies—\ntemporarily a blessing,\nyet scabies thrives because of the poultice.\n\nIndeed, calamity is the reverse of fortune,\nand fortune is the foundation of calamity.\nWho can know the ultimate logic of their extremes?\n\n「Indeed, those who govern the realm—do they lack rectitude?\nNowadays, the upright are deemed strange, while the perverse are praised as virtuous;\nthe people are long ensnared in confusion.\nThus, the Sage acts broadly without division,\npure and serene without harshness,\npunishes wrongs directly yet does not indulge in retaliation,\nand conceals brilliance without ostentation—\nall these stem from the state of non-action.\n\nIn managing both human affairs and the Dao of Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nFrugality is the essence of *early-complex*—\nthus, *early-complex* is born.\n*Early-complex* is called the profound embodiment of virtue and the accumulation of *power*—\naccumulating *power* ensures nothing is unconquered.\nIf nothing is unconquered,\nyet none know its limit,\nthen one can establish a state.\nA state with such foundation\ncan endure long.\nThis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nlong life and enduring vision.\n\nIf one governs with wisdom and discernment,\none loses the proper way—\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nTo possess yet not use is called frugality.\nFrugality is the origin of *early-complex* and rectitude—\nthus, *early-complex* is born.\n*Early-complex* is called the accumulation of supreme virtue.\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"Moderation (中庸), as a virtue, is it not supreme?\"*\nThe people have long been few in virtue.\nAccumulating supreme virtue ensures no task is unconquered.\nTo conquer all without haste,\nyet none know its limit,\nthen one can establish a state.\nRectitude is the foundation of a state;\na state with such foundation\ncan endure long—\nthis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nthe roots and foundation of wood,\nwhich brings long life and enduring vision.\n\nAs for governing one’s own person,\none must embrace unity.\nUnity is the origin of form—\nthis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nlong life, abiding in the world,\npreserving form, and enduring vision.\nBut if one takes unity as the law,\nthen no task is unconquered.\n\nTo govern a great state,\none must treat it as if boiling a small fish—\n*[i.e., with gentle, non-intrusive care]*.\nThose who govern the world with the Dao of non-action\nhave no fearsome ghosts.\nNot that their ghosts are not fearsome,\nbut that their fearsome nature does not harm people;\nnot that their fearsome nature does not harm people,\nbut that the Sage also does not harm people.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nthen virtue returns in harmony.\nTo govern a great state as if boiling a small fish\nmeans one must not disturb it.\nDisturbing it harms the fish,\nso those who govern with the Dao of non-action\ndo not harm the people.\nAs for ghosts and spirits harming people—\nnot only do the ghosts not harm them,\nbut the Heavenly spirits also do not bring pestilence, famine, or drought to harm them.\nWhen spirits and ghosts do not harm people,\nit is because the Sage governs with the Dao of non-action\nand thus does not harm people either.\nFor when human and spiritual realms—\nboth hidden and manifest—\ndo not harm each other,\nthen non-action aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth,\nghosts and spirits—\nvirtue converges and returns in harmony.\n\nThus, those who govern the world with non-action\nface no Heavenly resentment,\nno human criticism,\nno ghostly reproach.\nA great state is the confluence of all lands,\nthe gathering of the world,\nthe receptive feminine principle of the world.\nThe feminine principle is ever victorious over the masculine through stillness,\nand stillness is the yielding, receptive way.\nThus, a great state yields to small states,\nand the small states submit to it;\na small state yields to great states,\nand the great states embrace it.\nHence, sometimes yielding brings conquest,\nsometimes yielding brings submission.\nA great state seeks only to nurture and shelter its people—\nthis is the joy of Heaven.\nA small state seeks only to serve and submit to others—\nthis is the fear of Heaven.\nMencius said:\n*\"Those who take joy in Heaven preserve the world,\nthose who fear Heaven preserve their own state.\"*\nBoth attain their desires—\nthus, those in great states must not rely on strength,\nbut rather on yielding.\n\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nand the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold like goods in the market,\nand noble deeds can be bestowed like the *xing* [杏] fruit.\nIf people are unvirtuous,\nwhy would one abandon them?\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven,\nand appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,\neven if one is offered a jade tablet with a bow\nor four horses in advance,\nit is not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nWas it not because they sought it to obtain,\nor pardoned crimes to escape?\nThus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things.\nThe virtuous cherish the Dao as a treasure,\nwhile the unvirtuous rely on virtue as their refuge.\nThus, honoring the Dao as fine words,\nfollowing it can be as effortless as selling in the market;\nvirtue as noble deeds,\ncan be bestowed upon people.\nIf people do not embrace virtue and the Dao,\nwhy would one abandon them?\nThus, like Yao yielding the throne to Xu You,\nand setting him as Son of Heaven,\nor Chu appointing Zhuang Zhou as Three Exalted Minister,\nthough invited with jade tablets and noble gifts,\nthough given carriages of ministers and the honor of horses,\nthey declined and withdrew—\nthis was not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.\n\nBut why did the ancients esteem this Dao?\nWhat was the reason they esteemed this Dao?\nThe reason they esteemed it\nwas that the heart harbors no desires.\nThey viewed honor and splendor as dust and filth,\nand did not say,\n*\"I seek it to obtain,\"*\nor *\"I cling to it to escape crime.\"*\nThus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.\n\nTo act without acting,\nto do without doing,\nto savor without savoring—\ngreat or small, many or few,\nrepaying resentment with virtue.\nThe Sage acts without acting,\ndwelling in the realm of doing nothing—\nthis is the virtue of serenity and ease,\nits flavor without savoring.»\n\nThe great and the small—\nspeaking of their forms, many and few,\nspeaking of their numbers—\nwhen clinging to dust and illusory attachments,\none can become the object of resentment.\nThus, acting with no mind,\nit is said one repays resentment with virtue.\n\nTo tackle difficulty in its ease,\nto achieve greatness in its smallness—\nthe difficult matters of the world must begin in ease,\nthe great undertakings of the world must begin in smallness.\nThus, the Sage never acts in greatness,\nand so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\nThose who seek to tackle difficulty\nmust first attend to its ease.\nThose who seek to achieve greatness\nmust first attend to its smallness.\n\nThe world’s difficult matters must be done in ease,\nthe world’s great matters must be done in smallness—\nthus, the Sage does nothing,\nnever acts in greatness,\nand so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany easinesses bring many difficulties—\nthus, the Sage proceeds with difficulty,\nand so in the end encounters no difficulty.\n\nLight promises, once given, are seldom kept.\nFrom many easinesses come many difficulties—\nthus, the Sage responds to the world\nby embracing difficulty,\nand so in the end encounters no difficulty.\n\nWhat is stable is easy to hold,\nwhat is yet unmanifest is easy to plan,\nwhat is fragile is easy to shatter,\nwhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\n\nAct before it exists,\ngovern before it is disordered.\nA tree thick enough to embrace\nbegins as a sprout;\na nine-tiered tower\nbegins with a clod of earth;\na thousand-li journey\nbegins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings about failure,\nthe grasper brings about loss—\nthus, the Sage acts without acting,\nand so knows no failure;\nholds without grasping,\nand so knows no loss.\n\nTherefore, when the people engage in affairs,\nthey often ruin them when nearly complete.\nIf one treats the end as the beginning,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain treasures;\nlearns without learning,\nto correct the errors of the common folk,\nto assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nand dares not act.\n\nWhat is stable is easy to preserve when perilous,\nwhat is yet unmanifest is easy to plan when already formed,\nwhat is thin and fragile is easy to shatter and disperse—\nfor what is subtle is easily scattered.\n\nAll things must be acted upon before they arise,\ngoverned before they are disordered.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout,\na nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth,\na thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet—\nall things grow from the subtle to the great,\nand must not be neglected.\n\nAll who act bring about failure,\nall who grasp bring about loss—\nthus, the Sage acts without acting,\nand so knows no failure;\nholds without grasping,\nand so knows no loss.\n\nTherefore, when the people engage in affairs,\nthey often ruin them when nearly complete.\n*Ji* is the subtle movement of the heart.\nBefore the heart moves, it dwells in the nameless void;\nwhen *ji* moves, it reveals itself—\nyet it is still not called *ji*.\n*Ji* is when the heart first departs from the void and enters being,\nthe subtle threshold of desire’s beginning,\nthe start of all things.\n\nIf one treats the end as the beginning,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring—\ncautious of the heart’s subtle stirrings.\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain treasures—\ncautious of the world’s subtle movements.\nThus, the Sage’s learning\ndoes not rely on discerning *ji* to learn,\nbut corrects the common folk’s errors,\nassists the natural order of all things,\nand dares not act.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to make them simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is excessive.\nThus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nnot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two is the standard.\nTo always know the standard\nis called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things—\nand only then does one attain the Great Harmony.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao and governed the world\ndid not use cleverness to enlighten the people,\nnor cleverness to rule the world—\nthey sought to make the people simple.\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is excessive.\nThus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nnot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two is the standard.\nTo always know the standard\nis called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe logic of the Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things.\nNot using cleverness to enlighten the people,\nonly then does one attain the Great Harmony of the world.\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of the valleys\nbecause they excel in yielding—\nthus, they become kings of the valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to be above others\nspeaks from below;\nwho wishes to lead others\nplaces himself behind.\n\nThus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not grow weary of him,\nhis voice resounds in front yet they are not harmed by it—\ntherefore, the world gladly follows his Dao and never tires.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone under heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe rivers and seas so become kings of the valleys,\nbecause they excel in dwelling below—\nthus, they become kings of the valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to be above others\nspeaks in humility below;\nwho wishes to lead others\nplaces himself behind, yielding to them.\n\nThus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not grow weary of him,\nand leads yet they are not harmed—\nbecause of his yielding and non-contention with all things,\nnone under heaven can contend with him.\n\nAll under heaven say my Dao is vast,\nyet seems unorthodox.\nOnly because it is vast\ndoes it seem unorthodox.\nIf it seemed orthodox for long,\nthen it would be trifling indeed.\n\nLaozi says: *\"All under heaven say my Dao is vast,\"*\nbecause it does not adhere to forms, names, or measures.\nIf it seems similar,\nit will never truly be so.\n\nIt seems vast only because of the singularity of its *qi*—\nyet when confined to forms, names, and measures,\nit will never truly be so.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Similar is similar, yet it is not the same.\"*\n\nIf it were truly the same,\nit would be long since trivialized.\n\n*夫* (this particle, emphasizing contrast),\nstudents must discern:\nif the heart harbors even a hair’s breadth of attachment,\nthought, or calculation,\nit remains within the realm of forms, names, and measures—\nthus, the cycle of birth and death persists.\nHence, the ancient Sage left this sincere admonition.\n\nI possess three treasures; I hold them fast.\nThe first is *cí* (compassion),\nthe second is *jiǎn* (frugality),\nthe third is *\"not daring to be first under heaven\"* (humility in action).\n\n*Cí* (compassion) brings forth courage;\nfrugality brings forth abundance;\nnot daring to be first under heaven\nallows one to fulfill great tasks and endure.\n\nNow, abandon *cí* and take courage instead—\ncourage harms others.\nAbandon frugality and take abundance instead—\nabundance injures *virtue*.\nAbandon humility and take being first instead—\nothers will resent you.\n\nTo harm others, injure *virtue*, and invite resentment—\nthis is the path of death.\n\nWhen wielding arms,\ncompassion and non-contention are the Way of Heaven.\nTo use compassion in battle is upright;\nto hold firm with compassion is steadfast.\nIf Heaven intends to save them,\nit shields them with compassion.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force,\nthe skilled fighter does not rage,\nthe skilled victor does not contend,\nthe skilled leader places himself below others.\n\nThis is called the *virtue* of non-contention,\nthis is called the power of leading others—\nboth are called *\"harmonizing with Heaven,\"*\nthe ultimate *virtue* of antiquity.\n\nThe ancients spoke of wielding arms:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nnor advance an inch when I must retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called *\"having no path yet following the path,\"*\n*\"brandishing no arms yet defending with arms,\"*\n*\"confronting no enemy yet overcoming them,\"*\n*\"grasping no weapons yet wielding them.\"*\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating an enemy—\nto underestimate an enemy is to risk losing my treasures.\nThus, when two armies clash,\nthe one that shows compassion and pity will prevail.\n\nMy words are easy to know,\neasy to practice.\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\n\nWords have a root,\naffairs have a master.\nOnly because of my lack of adherence,\nnone know my root.\n\nFew know me,\nso I am honored.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse garments while cherishing the precious Dao.\n\nLaozi says:\n*\"My words are simple and direct, easy to know;\nmy actions require no force, easy to practice.*\nYet people, with their attachments and calculations,\nseek to see, hear, do, and gain—\nso none can know, none can practice.\n\nThis book speaks of *virtue* with its root,\ndiscusses affairs with their master.\nOnly because of my lack of adherence to\nthe root of words and the master of affairs,\nLaozi says, *\"Thus, none know my Dao.\"*\n\nFew know my Dao,\nand they sigh: *\"Then my Dao is noble—\nthe most exalted of all.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse garments,\nlike the humble attire of the poor,\nwhile inwardly holding the supreme Dao\nas precious as jade.\n\nLike jade hidden in stone,\nonly its outer form is seen,\nrarely its inner worth.\nTo know what is unknown is noble;\nto not know what is known is ill.\n\nThe Sage’s illness lies in his knowing of illness—\nthus he does not fall ill.\nThe Sage’s freedom from illness comes from his knowing of illness—\nthus he does not fall ill.\n\n*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:\nTo inwardly observe the mind is to know.\nThe mind without its own essence is ignorance.\nTo awaken to the mind’s lack of essence—\nthis is the noble way.\n\nThe Dao is the mind ever without thought or desire,\nsilently unaware of its own dwelling.\nIf one knows this, it is illness.\nOnly by recognizing knowing as illness\ndoes one escape the hindrance of being known—\nthus one does not fall ill.\nThe Sage’s freedom from illness comes from his knowing knowing as illness—\nthus he does not fall ill.\n\nWhen the people do not fear great authority,\ngreat authority arrives.\nDo not confine your dwelling,\ndo not weary of your birth.\nOnly by not wearying\ndoes one not weary.\nThus the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself—\nso he discards the former and takes the latter.\n\nThe people, their hearts empty and still,\nall phenomena naturally vanish—\nthus they do not fear the threats of all things,\nand know that great authority has come.\n\nAdmonish them: Do not cling to petty perceptions,\ndo not narrow your dwelling.\nDo not resent dust and toil,\ndo not weary of your birth.\nOnly by not wearying\ndoes one, though having a body for gain,\nawaken to the truth of emptiness and constancy—\nthus one cherishes oneself and does not weary.\n\nThe ancients said:\nThough the five aggregates remain whole,\nwho knows where to seek the scattered bones afterward?\nThus the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nis humble in love but does not exalt himself—\nfor pride is in self-display and self-exaltation.\nSo he discards that and takes this: self-knowledge and self-love.\n\nTo dare boldly is to court death;\nto dare not to dare is to live.\nThese two—\none brings benefit, one harm.\nWhat the Heaven detests—\nwho knows its reason?\nThus the Sage follows the difficult path.\n\nThe Way of Heaven,\nthough not contending, wins well;\nthough not speaking, responds well;\nthough not summoned, comes of its own accord—\nopen and yet well-plotted.\nThe Heavenly net is vast,\nspread wide yet nothing is lost.\n\nTo dare boldly invites death—harm;\nto dare not to dare brings life—benefit.\nThese two—\none brings benefit, one harm,\nlike what Heaven detests—\nyet who knows its reason?\nThe principle of response and provocation—\nthus the Sage follows the difficult path.\n\nThe Way of Heaven,\nthough not contending, yet wins well;\nthough not speaking, yet responds well;\nthough not summoned, yet comes in reply.\nThe Way of Heaven is open yet as if well-plotted,\nso that good and evil cannot escape—\nlike Heaven’s net, though vast and wide,\npunishes evil and rewards virtue without loss of a hair.\n\nThe people do not ordinarily fear death—\nhow can you use death to frighten them?\nIf you make the people fear death and act strangely,\nI could seize and kill them—who would dare?\nThere are always those charged with killing who kill.\nIf you substitute for those who kill and kill,\nit is like substituting for the master carpenter to hew—\nif you do not substitute for the master carpenter,\nfew will avoid injuring their hands.\n\nThe people’s desires are naturally strange—\nthus they do not ordinarily fear death.\nHow can you, with your lamentations and laws,\nuse death to frighten them?\nIf you make the people forget desire and always fear death,\nand among them there are those who act strangely,\nsaying, *\"I could seize and kill them to warn the crowd—who would dare?\"*\nYet those who act strangely because of their desires\nwill inevitably invite their own calamity.\nThere are always those Heaven has charged with killing who kill—\nwhy must you substitute for Heaven in executing punishment?\nNot only do you harm living beings,\nbut you also disrupt the harmony of Heaven itself.\nTo substitute for those who kill is like substituting for the master carpenter—\nthe carpenter, substituting for the master,\nlabors with axe and adze—\nfew will avoid injuring their hands.\nTo rule the world with punishments alone\nis rare not to stray from the Way.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—\nthus it is difficult to govern the hungry.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ actions—\nthus it is difficult to govern.\nThe people’s recklessness in facing death comes from their rulers’ excessive provision for life—\nthus they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not overindulge in providing for life\nare superior to those who value life above all.\n\nIn the Zhou era, the people’s hunger and insufficiency\ncame from their rulers’ broad consumption,\nnecessitating heavy taxation—\nthus they were hungry.\nThe people’s stubbornness and difficulty in being governed\ncame from their rulers’ actions—\nthus they were difficult to govern.\nThe people’s daring to risk death\ncame from their rulers’ excessive provision for life—\nthus they treated death lightly.\nOnly those who do not overindulge in providing for life\nare superior to those who value all life under Heaven.\n\nLife is soft and weak,\ndeath is hard and strong.\nGrass and trees in life are soft and fragile,\nin death they wither and decay.\nThus, the hard and strong are the companions of death,\nthe soft and weak are the companions of life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nrigid wood is easily split.\nThus, the hard and strong are lowly,\nthe soft and weak are exalted.\n\nThe Way of Heaven—\nis it like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered,\nthe low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished,\nthe insufficient are supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.\nBut the Way of humanity is otherwise:\nit diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can diminish the excessive to serve the insufficient in the world?\nOnly the Dao can do so.\nThus the Sage acts without relying on it,\ncompletes the work without taking credit—\ndoes he not wish to be seen as virtuous?\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient,\nyet the Way of humanity is otherwise—\nit diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can diminish the excessive to serve the insufficient in the world?\nOnly by following the Way of Heaven can this be done.\n\nThus the Sage follows the Way of Heaven,\nacts without relying on it,\ncompletes the work without taking credit—\nis this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?\n\nNothing in the world is softer and weaker than water,\nyet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it—\nfor there is nothing to replace it.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong—\nyet though all know this, none can practice it.\n\nTherefore the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the nation’s defilement is called the Lord of the Soil Altars;\nto bear the nation’s calamities is called the King of the World.\"*\nStraight speech seems contrary.\n\nNothing surpasses the soft and weak like water,\nyet in attacking the hard and strong, none can excel it—\nto replace it is impossible,\nfor there is nothing to replace it.\nThough all know that the soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong,\nyet none can practice it—\nfor they cannot endure humiliation and remain soft.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"When Tang and Wu spoke of the myriad regions as the Lord of the Soil Altars,\nthey alone called themselves ‘Orphaned, Aged, and Unworthy’—\nable to bear the nation’s guilt upon themselves alone.\nTo bear the nation’s defilement is called calamity;\nto bear the nation’s defilement is called the King of the World.\"*\nThis is straight speech aligning with virtue,\nthough the common folk see it as contrary.\n\nTo reconcile great grievances,\nthere must be lingering resentment—\nhow then can it be called good?\nThus the Sage holds only the left contract,\ndemanding nothing from others.\nTherefore, the virtuous keep the left contract,\nthe unvirtuous demand the right.\n\nThe Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nalways aiding those who do good without action.\nTang expelled Jie, Wu Wang attacked Zhou,\nyet in reconciling the world’s great grievances,\nthere would later be retaliatory wars.\nWith lingering resentment, how can it be called good?\nThus the Sage acts in non-action,\nlike holding the left contract—\nthe left contract is held alone,\nthe right contract is given to others.\nThe left and right contracts together form trust,\nyet no demands are made of others.\n\nThe virtuous, like the keeper of the left contract,\nreceive things naturally—this is the Way of Heaven.\nThe unvirtuous, like the keeper of the right contract,\ndemand things to be fulfilled—this is the Way of humanity.\nThe Way of Heaven favors none,\nalways aiding those who act without doing.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nlet the people have ten or a hundredfold tools but not use them,\nlet them value death and not move far.\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them;\nthough there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them;\nlet them return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be simple, their clothing plain,\ntheir customs settled, their work joyful.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters and dogs,\nlet the people live to old age without visiting one another.\n\nThe heart is originally pure and still,\nuntainted by nature.\nWhen desire arises in the heart,\nit clings to the myriad things,\nand once it clings, it gives rise to seeking.\nLaozi wished for the world to have no desires,\nno clinging to the myriad things—\nthus in small states with few people,\nlet the people have tools for tens or hundreds,\nyet those who could govern are not employed.\nIf the people have no songs,\ntheir hearts are tranquil and at ease,\nforgetting all matters of profit and loss,\nthus valuing death and not moving far.\nWithout desire, there is no seeking—\nthough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them.\nWithout desire, there is no strife—\nthough there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them.\nReturning to simplicity, they do not rely on writing or contracts,\nletting the people live as in the age of the Three Sovereigns,\nusing knotted cords once more.\nWithout desire, they do not crave rich flavors yet find their food sweet,\ndo not adorn their clothing yet find it beautiful,\nlive in simplicity and find their customs settled,\ndo not envy others and find their work joyful.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters and dogs,\nwith no desires or seeking,\neven if they meet, the people live to old age without visiting one another.\n\nThe ruler is content and unassuming, doing nothing,\nthe people are sincere and unassuming, doing nothing—\nthen why use tools for tens or hundreds?\nTruthful words are not ornate,\nornate words are not truthful.\nTruthful words lack the beauty of the common tongue,\nornate words are extravagant yet lack truth.\nThe good do not argue,\nthose who argue are not good.\nThe Sage of the Way acts rather than argues—\nthose who delight in argument do not act in goodness.\n\n*The Analects* says:\n*\"The gentleman desires to be slow in speech and swift in action.\"*\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe wise understand the heart’s nature,\nnot in vast knowledge or broad learning.\nThose who pursue broad learning\noften lack true understanding.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Zigong, do you think I am someone who studies much and remembers it?\"*\nZigong replied:\n*\"Yes, is it not so?\"*\nConfucius said:\n*\"No. I have one thread that runs through it all.\"*\n\nThe Sage has no accumulation—\nthe more he gives to others, the more he possesses;\nthe more he gives to others, the broader his Way becomes.\nConfucius said:\n*\"You disciples think I conceal things?\nI conceal nothing from my ears.\"*\n\nThe Sage has no accumulation,\nwishing others to entrust him with care.\nThe more he gives to others, the more he gains;\nthe more he gives to others, the broader his Way becomes—\nthus benefiting others while also benefiting himself.\n\nThe Way of Heaven benefits without harming;\nthe Way of the Sage acts without contending.\n\nThe *Daodejing* concludes with these two lines,\nto complete its virtue.\n\nThe Way of Heaven benefits without harming;\nthe Way of the Sage acts without contending.\n\nWhen Yuan Qing paid homage to Master Benlai, Deng Guang of Wangwu requested this text, wishing to engrave it for the world. Master Benlai said:\n\n*\"This book was written to remind myself of what I might forget. Now, people who read books on Dao and virtue often retreat and humble themselves, fearing they cannot practice it.\"*\n\nGuang said:\n*\"When qi aligns with form and spirit, and one can grasp yin and yang, then life spans with Heaven and Earth—worn yet never ending. This is called the True Person (Zhenren).\n\nIf one takes the One as the principle and applies it to all things, then one may roam between Heaven and Earth, perceiving and hearing beyond the eight directions. This is the manifestation of pure virtue and the preservation of the Way—called the Perfect Person (Zhiren).\n\nThe next level takes yin and yang as the principle, follows the logic of the eight winds, and dwells in the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Within, there are no resentful, angry, or enraged thoughts. Thus, one may adapt to desires in the world and live to a hundred years or more—this is called the Sage.\n\nIf one models oneself after Heaven and Earth, resembles the sun and moon, and arranges the constellations and stars to create celestial texts, records the solar cycles, observes yin and yang’s reversals and compliance, establishes laws and calendars, and distinguishes the four seasons—this is called the Virtuous Person (Xianren).\n\nThe next level conforms to the Five Constants and a hundred virtues—this is called the Gentleman (Junzi).\n\nTo abandon the Gentleman’s conduct is to be a petty person (xiaoren).\n\nFrom the True Person down to the Gentleman, none depart from the One qi, yin and yang, and human affairs—all are called virtue.\n\nIf you speak of the Great Dao of non-action before the One qi to those cultivating virtue, even the Three Worthies and Ten Sages would still harbor doubt—how much more so for petty people?\n\nThe Five Constants and a hundred virtues are already the virtues of human conduct; if people refuse to practice even these, how much more would they shrink from the Great Dao? What is there to fear?\"*\n\nMaster Benlai said:\n*\"There was once a traveler who said: In the past, Wang Xu registered the *Daodejing*, yet died young. His father pursued his spirit and saw him wearing an iron shackle, saying, ‘I should not have registered the *Daodejing*, so I suffer this punishment.’ If this is true, then the book must be difficult to practice.\"*\n\nGuang said:\n*\"Examining Xu’s registration, though it strayed from the Way, it was not entirely without virtue. If people followed its virtue, it could still benefit the world.\n\nFor example, Liu Qi composed musical chapters, collecting phrases from leisurely outings and discarded lines—merely capturing emotions and scenes, leading people to indulge in desires, chase pleasures, and drown in wine and lust, obscuring their true nature and burying morality. When heard in private chambers, it stirs emotions and provokes actions—peeping through cracks, scaling walls to follow one another, corrupting propriety. What difference is there between this and luring people into ravines?\n\nTo hold the office of a layer yet perform the deeds of a clown, claiming to be a scholar yet failing to uphold the Way of the Ancestral Teachers, leaving licentious words in the world to blind the ignorant—this is to invert the Way of the Ancestral Teachers. Moreover, which of these two bears greater guilt?\n\nThose who deceive with false teachings invite slander upon themselves, while true teachings cannot be easily ruined. Why fear their ridicule?\"*\n\nMaster Benlai said:\n*\"Even today, people are still amazed by wonders—like He Shang Gong ascending to Heaven, Liezi riding the wind, turning stones into gold, or going a year without food, with red faces and black hair. Such tales make people gaze in awe.\n\nYet I now live in poverty in a humble lane, my hair streaked with gray, selling medicine in the market, supporting my wife and children—just like everyone else. If I were to show this book to people, it would surely invite slanderous speech.\"*\n\nGuang said:\n*\"The world speaks of Shun dwelling at Lì Shān, where the ox tilled and the birds weeded—this was the virtue/power of the Sage that moved and summoned them. \n\nMaster Lù Guīméng replied:\n*\"This is a strange technique—how can it be called the virtue/power of a Sage?\"\n\nConfucius, recounting the text of Shun, said:\n*\"He expanded wisdom and refined culture—here the virtue/power of the Sage reached its limit. Why speak of such summoning? It is like the Great Achievement (Dàchéng) only after being recommended to Heaven.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Emperor Yáo and Shun were no different from ordinary people, yet those who love sensational tales exaggerate their marvels—this is not the true intent of the Sage. For instance, when Emperor Wén of Hàn encountered He Shang Gong, the Master ascended to Heaven as described, rising a hundred zàng above the earth before speaking with the Emperor. If one could truly do this, it would be a strange technique—yet again, this is the exaggeration of those who love sensational tales.\n\nLiezi could harmonize the Six Qi (liúhé) and merge with the luminous clarity (yījīngmíng), so that his mind became concentrated and his form dissolved, his bones and flesh entirely blending—floating east and west like a dry leaf or husk, yet he never knew whether the wind carried him or he carried the wind. The wind and I both forgot this distinction—how could he truly have walked upon the void and ridden the wind?\"*\n\n「Indeed. To ride the wind and walk upon the void is the art of lightness; to transmute stones into gold is the art of transformation; to abstain from food for years is the art of grain-cutting; to have a red face and black hair is the art of cultivation—all these are mere techniques, not the Dao/Way of virtue/power.\n\nThe true practitioner of the Dao/Way of virtue/power, like Liezi dwelling in Zheng, also had his fields to till. When Master Ziyang left him grain, Liezi refused it. His wife, pressing her heart in sorrow, revealed their poverty—yet he still had a wife and children. For forty years in Zheng, the ruler and ministers treated him like any commoner, indistinguishable from the vulgar masses. Yet the Dao/Way of virtue/power lies not in outward appearance, but in the mind.\n\nThe vulgar only judge by outward circumstances, yet they fail to grasp the heart. For instance, when Zhuangzi hosted Confucius and they encountered the bandit Zhi, Zhi assessed them by worldly affairs, so they could not escape the defamation of the petty.\n\nThe *Southern Blossom Scripture* says: \"To speak of the Dao/Way but not follow its proper order is not the Dao/Way; to speak of the Dao/Way but not grasp its essence is mere idle quotation.\" Now, the Master before you established a ladder of virtue/power to reveal its order, and did not explain the Dao/Way through techniques and spells—this is worthy of attention.\n\nTo expound this *Scripture* directly, its language is plain yet its meaning profound; its examples are clear, its teachings explicit—yet the world has never seen such a work. If one claims to act solely for oneself, how did the Ancestral Teachers benefit others? Let me clarify the essential words: the Master, who sat in silence for long, then spoke: \"Five thousand words, yet their essence lies in the two characters: *no desire* (无欲). The seeker of the Dao/Way must only keep *no desire* in their heart—this is the supreme Dao/Way.\n\nYet the meaning of *no desire* is exceedingly profound. Therefore, Laozi first speaks of *no desire* in his opening chapter; fearing students would cling to the idea of *nothingness*, he then speaks of *desire* (有欲); again fearing they would be ensnared by *desire*, he declares that the union of *having* and *not having* is called *mysterious* (玄); and again fearing they would fixate on *mysterious*, he adds *yet again mysterious* (又玄). Those who brush aside these four stages are said to enter the Dao/Way’s gate.\n\nYet students often cling to one of these stages and thereby fall ill. First, when students hear *no desire*, they seek to sever thoughts in their mind and attain *no desire*, not realizing that severing thoughts *is* desire itself—this clinging to *nothingness* is a sickness. Second, when they seek *desire* in their mind, they believe there exists something separate from the mind called *desire*—yet they fail to know that *desire* is the mind itself, and the mind is *desire*. The moment they hold onto the notion of *desire* within the mind, it becomes desire—this clinging to *having* is also a sickness. Third, when they force their mind to be still and concentrated, like a wooden statue, unmoving and tranquil—this clinging to *mysterious* is called the sickness of *both having and not having*. Fourth, when they brush aside the traces of *mysterious* and act without attachment, dissolving the duality of subject and object in their mind—this clinging to *yet again mysterious* is called the sickness of *neither having nor not having*.\n\nAll these above are entanglements of the mind, and they are all defilements—thus, they are sicknesses. Only when one’s mind is free of these four afflictions can they truly be said to have *no desire*.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao/Way and annotate texts still cannot escape the realm of words, mistaking *mysterious* for the Dao/Way itself, and *yet again mysterious* as the gateway to all wonders—this is truly erroneous. To write of the Dao/Way, one must reveal its true teaching, which lies beyond these four stages. The Dao/Way is the gateway to all wonders, yet texts rely on words to convey it—how can one cling to words and claim to understand?\n\nThe student of the Dao/Way must only abandon the slightest trace of grasping thoughts. Their mind should be as vast as the bright sky, ever dwelling in emptiness, without a speck of dust. Light and clarity permeate all things, and then they respond to affairs as they arise—like clouds forming in the sky, appearing and disappearing without a trace, leaving no mark. Their mind is unattached to anything—this is called *virtue/power* (德).\n\nIt is said: *No taking, no discarding; no mundane, no sage; no single law to cultivate, no action to attain*—thus, it is called *ordinary mind* (平常心). The Dao/Way also says: *A single mind unborn, all dharmas are without blame*.\n\nStudents often doubt this, fearing they will fall into *emptiness*—so they turn back, gazing at the cliff. This is not falling into *emptiness*, but attaining the mind of *no mind* (无心). To truly grasp *no mind*, one is called a Dao/Way person (道人). The Dao/Way person stands above the True Person (真人), for the True Person clings to notions of subject and object in their practice, and thus remains below the Dao/Way person.\n\nAt that time, in the year *Gēnchén* of the *Shaoxing* era, a man from Yǐngchuān named **Chén Yuánqīng** recorded his words and appended them here.」",

As the Zhou Dynasty declined, he departed. The Prefect of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: *\"Master, you are about to withdraw into seclusion. Please, for my sake, compose a book.\"* Thus, he wrote the *Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* in two sections—upper and lower—speaking of the meaning of Dao/Way and virtue in over five thousand words before departing. No one knew his end.\n\nBecause the historical record mentions \"upper and lower sections,\" later scholars followed this division, treating the first scroll as expounding the *Dao/Way* and the second as expounding *virtue*. However, upon rational examination, the text discusses Dao/Way and virtue as an undivided whole, with no true upper or lower sections. This is merely a misinterpretation in the historical account, and I have removed it.\n\nAgain, some unknown scholar, failing to grasp the original intent of the text, arbitrarily divided it into eighty-one chapters, merely pursuing superficial ornamentation and aligning with yang numerology—this is mere frivolous speculation, offering no benefit to humanity. I have also removed this division.\n\nFurthermore, such scholars invented chapter titles, confining the text’s meaning within narrow interpretations, distorting its principles. I have also discarded these additions.\n\nThis text’s meaning is not continuous, for the Prefect of the Pass did not fully comprehend Laozi’s teachings when he requested them. Laozi thus spoke of his own matters, sometimes citing the words of ancient sages, which is why the text’s flow is disjointed and its language repetitive—like a parent’s tender, earnest instruction to their child.\n\nWhere the text touches on state affairs, it reflects Laozi’s lament over the prevailing winds of his time, matters pertaining to the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nWhere taboo terms appear, if altered, the original intent might be lost over time. Following the conventions of ancient scriptures and histories, I have left them unmodified, even if the characters are incomplete in transmission.\n\nMany have annotated this text, yet though they claim mastery of its principles, they fail to grasp them, and though they debate its details, they lack proper method. For instance, some annotate *xuān pò* (玄牝) as \"mouth and nose\"—this is a failure to understand its true meaning. Others render *sǐ zhī tú* (死之徒) as the Pali/Sanskrit *niēpán* (涅盘), mistranslating it as \"Xin’s ‘wuwei’ (無為)\"—this is a failure in historical accuracy.\n\nSuch conjectural annotations, scattering the original intent, are too numerous to list. Their error stems from not attaining the Dao/Way itself.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage Confucius aspired to the Dao/Way, yet since the Dao is formless, he grounded himself in the virtue/power of form to establish its foundation. Once the foundation is set, the Dao arises—gradually, not abruptly. How then could one indulge in virtue/power without advancing toward the Dao? This is what is meant by passing its gate without entering its hall.\n\nTo aspire to the Six Arts while floating in virtue/power, treating techniques as the Dao, mistaking filth for essence, dullness for simplicity, pace for nature, stillness for *wuwei*, abstaining from flavors as tranquility, coming and going as spontaneity, and divorcing one’s wife while sleeping alone as serenity—such people cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao.\n\nAs the *Baopuzi* states in its eighth volume: Though the Five Thousand Words originate from Laozi, they are merely broad and superficial discussions. Within them, he does not fully expound beginning to end—what then is there to follow or verify? Indeed, many speak of chamber arts and alchemical elixirs, clinging to *youwei* (有為) as their practice, indulging in greed and lust, measuring the Dao of *wuwei* with shallow calculations. Thus, they fail to grasp its entirety—how much less can those inferior to him?\n\nMoreover, they rank the reckless as superior and those cultivating virtue/power as secondary. To conceal one’s body and alter appearances, transforming the forms of things, is to invite demonic suspicion. Confucius did not speak of strange powers or chaotic spirits, for they yield no benefit.\n\nLaozi’s writings emphasize longevity and clear vision, focusing on advancing the Dao rather than fixating on single outcomes. Even the immortals dwell on the Three Mountains, never leaving the earth, yet they ride phoenixes and attend the Emperor, never leaving heaven. Dwelling between heaven and earth, they endure for ten thousand years. Though they temporarily extend life, they must still return to death—if one does not advance the Dao, what differs from the great *chun* tree?\n\nThis is not a debate on right and wrong, but a warning against indulging in immortality techniques while neglecting the Dao. Among all beings, humans are most noble, yet they praise food and clothing above all. Only humans can comprehend life and death; they must not be ensnared by mundane attachments, lest death come suddenly. This is not a matter of timing—if one is lost along the way, it may take countless eons to encounter such a chance again.\n\nTo attain this wisdom is no easy feat; after twenty years of diligent study, one may finally awaken to its original truth. Yet the great Dao is beyond words—words are merely a vessel to reveal it. Once the intent is grasped, words are forgotten. Even with perception and cognition, true understanding remains elusive.\n\nNow residing in Hangzhou, I met by chance the Qinghe Master, with whom I shared mutual resonance. Discussing this scripture, I found it the supreme opportunity within the teaching. Those who annotate it with verbose erudition only obscure its meaning for the common reader, making its essence difficult to grasp.\n\nThe Dao and virtue/power are not about excessive elaboration. If annotations are straightforward and direct, one should instantly perceive their meaning upon hearing, awakening to virtue/power and thus seeing the Dao. Persisting in this way is to repay one’s ancestors.\n\nIn seeking the original text, I obtained three versions, now adopting the Song-dynasty *Yulan* edition as standard.\n\nIn my annotations, wherever *de* (德) is mentioned, it pertains to Confucian teachings on the great Dao’s emptiness and stillness, aligning with Buddhist principles. I merge the teachings of Confucianism and Buddhism to verify the Dao and virtue/power as one, fearing my dull roots and meager merit may fail to uphold their essence.\n\nThis book contains techniques for preserving form, prolonging life, and ensuring longevity; methods for safeguarding the state and family; and supreme mysteries for transcending birth and death. I fear that if unseen, they will go unapplied.\n\nThis body is no different from that of ancient sages—only through such practice does one attain their likeness.\n\nIn our present sage ruler, reverence for the Dao and virtue/power manifests as filial piety and benevolence, embodying the virtues of compassion and frugality. Following ancient precedents, his governance brings peace and prosperity, harmonizing with the people. Thus, those who observe him remain steadfast in their duties to serve the state and honor their parents, ever mindful of desirelessness. Over time, the people flourish, and the ruler ascends beyond Yao and Shun.\n\nBy spreading these teachings, we repay the nation’s grace.\n\n**On the Stages of Dao and Virtue/Power**\nThe Dao reveals reality through *wuwei*, while *youwei* relies on force. Illuminating the void dispels ignorance—this is the principle. Virtue/power embodies the Dao as a method applied to affairs—this is practice.\n\nThe terms *Dao* and *virtue/power* encompass all things without exclusion. Their stages must be clearly delineated, for the Dao has depths and virtue/power has inner and outer layers. Without understanding these stages, mutual slander arises.\n\nThe supreme Dao is absolute stillness, formless and nameless, beyond expression. Its scripture cannot be recorded, hence it is called *Taiyi* (太易). Its sound is also inexpressible.\n\n*Taiyi* is the state before *qi* manifests. When *Taiyi* moves, the initial *qi* appears, hence *Taiyi* (太初). This is also *Taiji* (太极) and *Taiyi* (太一). Laozi names the singular *qi* as the Dao, while Confucius defines the Dao as that which is above form. The Buddhist exposition of the Four Noble Truths also calls it the Dao—thus, the three teachings collectively encompass all existence.\n\nWithout beginning with the manifest, how could one comprehend the void? By knowing the manifest, one grasps the void. Hence, the Dao has depths.\n\n*Taiyi* is emptiness. Movement gives rise to the initial manifestation of form, hence *Taiyi* (太初). The emergence of *qi* marks the beginning of form, hence *Taishi* (太始). When *qi* and form coalesce, yielding firm and yielding qualities, it is called *Taosu* (太素). Before their separation, this state is named *Hun Dun* (浑沌).\n\nOnce *Hun Dun* divides, yin and yang interact, with *qi* residing centrally, giving birth to all things. Thus, Laozi says: *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.*\n\nTherefore, the sage observes above and below, honoring heaven’s elevation and earth’s humility. Applied, this becomes governance and the enlightened Way of kingship, establishing the Five Constants and a hundred virtues to rectify the relationships of ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, and thus govern and harmonize humanity.",

Others render *sǐ zhī tú* (死之徒) as the Pali/Sanskrit *niēpán* (涅盘), mistranslating it as \"Xin’s ‘wuwei’ (無為)\"—this is a failure in historical accuracy.\n\nSuch conjectural annotations, scattering the original intent, are too numerous to list. Their error stems from not attaining the Dao/Way itself.",

Though the Sage may be their ruler and father, they do not rely on this position—this is the display of all virtues. When deeds are accomplished, the Sage does not claim the name—this is the concealment of all uses.\n\nOnly by not dwelling in traces does virtue endure and not depart.\n\nIf one does not exalt the wise and capable, it is lest people boast of their cleverness.\n\nWhat the ruler favors is called *feng* (風), and what the people delight in following is called *su* (俗). When the ruler exalts the wise and capable, the people below will surely vie to compete. If the Sage does not exalt the wise, it is so that the people do not contend for their names—thus, the names are not contended for.\n\nFood and wealth should be provided for sustenance and care, not for treasured rarities that are hard to obtain. If one treasures what is hard to obtain, the people will hide it deeply. Human nature is such: if given, they do not value it; if hidden, they will steal to take it.\n\nGovernance in a harmonious age is not without the use of wealth, but it does not treasure wealth that is rare and hard to obtain, lest the people become thieves. If the lower people do not see that names and profits are desirable, their hearts will not be troubled, and they will govern themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\ndoes not exalt the wise, so the people have no cleverness—no cleverness means their hearts are naturally empty, and empty hearts can contain all things, hence the saying, *“fill their bellies”*.\ndoes not treasure wealth, so the people have no desires—no desires mean their resolve is naturally weak, and weak resolve does not follow the world’s shifts, hence the saying, *“strengthen their bones”*.\nConfucius sighed over those whose roots were not firm—this is the case.\n\nIf one constantly makes the people without cleverness, their hearts become empty; if one constantly makes them without desires, they forget the world. When both heart and world are forgotten, there is nothing to cling to, and all affairs cease. Thus, even the clever dare not act.\n\nBecause the Sage acts in *wuwei* (無心) for the sake of things, all under Heaven will be without disorder.\n\nThe Dao is vast and yet finds use—\nthough it may not overflow,\nprofound it seems like the origin of all things.\nIt dulls sharpness,\nunravels entanglement,\nsoftens brightness,\nunifies dust—\nserene it seems, yet also as if it exists.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the Sovereign as the model.\n\nThe boundless Great Dao,\ntransforming and generating *yīqì* (一氣),\n*Yīqì* divides into yin and yang,\nyin and yang transform and generate,\nreceiving *yīqì* as their essence,\nthus knowing *yīqì* dwells within yin and yang—\nhence the saying, *“vast qi”*.\n\nThe Great Dao, through its vastness within yin and yang,\nfinds use like the heavens covering the earth,\nthe sun shining and the moon overseeing,\nwinter’s cold and summer’s heat,\nspring’s birth and autumn’s harvest—\nall are the uses of vast qi.\n\nVast qi:\nhas form yet is formless,\nis formless yet has essence—\nbetween heaven and earth,\nneither overflowing nor deficient,\nprofound it seems like the origin of all things.\n\nThose who study wish to see vast qi:\nthey must dull their heart’s sharpness—\nwhen sharpness ceases, their resolve rests,\nand they can unravel the entanglements of myriad affairs.\nWith idle resolve and few desires,\nthey harmonize brightness without contention,\nalign with dust without strife—\nwithin and without, unstained,\nserene it seems, yet only one heart remains.\nThough its traces are unseen,\nit also seems to exist.\n\nThe *Shìjīa* (釋家) likens it to the wisdom-lamp illuminating the moon,\nthe *Yǎnjīa* (衍家) calls it the Great Elixir of gold,\nMencius names it *hàorán zhī qì* (浩然之氣).\nIt is spoken of as the greatest and most unyielding—\nnurtured uprightly yet without harm,\nfilling the space between heaven and earth,\nthis *qi* is paired with virtue and the Dao.\n\nWhen Laozi points to the serene as if it exists,\nit is the *yīqì* (一氣) transformed by the Great Dao—\n“I do not know whose child it is,”\nthis is the model of all things as the Sovereign before yin and yang.\n\nHeaven and earth are not virtuous—\nthey regard all things as *chúgǒu* (刍狗), all cut and used alike.\nThe Sage is not virtuous—\nthey regard the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nHeaven and earth follow the Dao of nature—this is called supreme virtue. If not supreme virtue, then there is partiality.\n\nSpring’s birth is not virtue—\nautumn’s killing is not non-transformation—\nthey discard or employ things according to the season,\nregarding all things as *chúgǒu* (cutting grass for sacrifice).\n\n*Súgǒu* (刍狗) is like the straw-dragon of today—\nused in sacrifices.\nAt first, it is stored in a red lacquered box,\ncovered with an embroidered cloth,\nbut after the sacrifice, it is discarded and unused.\n\nThe Sage, with one heart as their virtue,\nthus takes the people’s hearts as their own.\nRewarding the good is not virtue—\npunishing the evil is not non-virtue—\nthey follow the people’s needs and circumstances,\nrewarding and punishing according to the times,\nthus using the metaphor of the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nZhuangzi says:\nSupreme virtue has no favorites,\ngreat virtue is non-virtue.\n\nOnly by being non-virtuous\nis one truly great in virtue.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it like the *tújué* (橐鞬)?\n\nEmpty yet not bending,\nmoving yet ever emerging.\n\nMany words and frequent sounds exhaust the essence—\nit is better to hold to the center.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nmeaning the four directions and above and below,\nis it like the *tújué*—\nthe bellows and the reed-pipes?\n\nThe *tújué* is empty within,\nits use lies in the formless—\nthus it is not burdened.\n\nThe bellows inflates the wind,\nthe reed-pipes direct the breath—\nmoving yet ever overflowing,\nlike the opening and closing of *qiánkūn* (乾坤),\nreleasing and containing things.\n\nLaozi wished to speak broadly and frequently,\nyet his essence is better preserved by holding to the center.\n\nThe center is emptiness.\nWith the heart dwelling in emptiness,\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *gǔshén* (谷神) does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuāntà* (玄牝).\n\nThe *Xuāntà*’s gate,\nthe root of heaven and earth.\n\nEnduring as if it exists,\nyet when used, it remains undisturbed.\n\n*Gǔ* (谷) is used to signify emptiness—\nemptiness is the Dao.\n*Shén* (神) is the *yīqì* transformed by the Dao—\nit is the having within the non-having.\n\nThe *Shìjīa* (釋家) calls this emptiness *shíxiàng* (實相),\ntaking its unbreakable nature as its meaning.\n\nThe *gǔshén* is formless,\nborn from non-birth yet also non-death,\nhence the saying, *“the valley spirit does not die”*.\n\nThe valley is the origin of birth—\ncalled *Xuān* (玄).\nThe spirit is the primal element of transformation—\ncalled *Tà* (牝).\n\nThus, *gǔshén* is called *Xuāntà*.\nAll things emerge from the *Xuāntà*’s gate,\nand what emerges is called *mén*—\nthis is called birth:\n*Yáng* (天) and *Yīn* (地) are its roots.」",

counterparts.\n\nTo behold the undyed and embrace the uncarved,\nto minimize private desires and reduce cravings—\nthis was the age of the Most High in ancient times,\nwhen the Way of *wúwéi* (无为) transformed the world,\nand the common folk knew only of the Sage’s transformation,\nyet saw no trace of it.\n\nIn the next age, down to Yao and Shun,\npurity and simplicity began to disperse,\nand though they taught through *yǒuwéi* (有为),\nthey sought to restore the Way of *wúwéi*,\nyet by manifesting the traces of *rén* (仁) and *yì* (义),\nthe people vied to honor them,\nand moved by the Sage’s wise governance,\nthey praised it joyfully.\nFrom then on, *rén* and *yì* altered human nature,\nand the Way of *wúwéi* was lost.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Since the House of Yu took the Seven Codes to disrupt the world.\"*\n\nIn the next age, down to the Three Kings,\nvirtue declined and righteousness thinned,\nso they employed punishments to make the people fear them,\nand thus conform to *rén* and *yì*.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"When it reached the Three Kings, the world was in great alarm.\"*\n\nIn the next age, down to the Five Hegemons,\ngreat *wěi* (伪) flourished,\nand cunning schemes were imposed upon the people,\nwhile the lowly defied the high,\nand punishments proved insufficient to deter them.\n\nAs Mencius said:\n*\"The Five Hegemons were but pretenders.\"*\n\n*Rén* and *yì* were but expedients to save the age,\nrooted in sincerity,\nso when trust was insufficient,\nthere arose those who did not trust.\n\nIn the age of the Most High,\nthey acted in *wúwéi*,\nvaluing speech as *yóu* (犹),\nand when deeds were done and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people said, *\"This is natural.\"*\nYet their governance was not displayed.\n\nWhen the Great Dao was abandoned,\nthe traces of *yǐ* (迹) and *yì* (义) became manifest.\nWith wisdom’s emergence,\ngreat *wěi* arose—\nfor wisdom is the mind’s delusive thought,\nand discriminating consciousness cannot unify the world.\n\nIn the age of the Most High,\nsubjects were naturally loyal and children naturally filial,\nyet when the six relations were not in harmony,\nit was because filial piety and kindness were now displayed,\nand when the state was in chaos,\nit was because loyal ministers were now displayed—\nall because of pride in cleverness,\nand the loss of spontaneity.\n\nIf one abandons the Sage and discards wisdom,\nand governs through *wúwéi*,\nthe people benefit a hundredfold.\nIf one abandons *rén* and discards *yì*,\nwithout altering human nature,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nIf one abandons cleverness and discards profit,\nwithout seeing desire,\nthen thieves and robbers cease to exist.\n\nThe Sage, wisdom, *rén*, *yì*, cleverness, and profit—\nthese three pairs are the adornments of civilization,\nso in governed ages, there are deficiencies.\nThus, Laozi established their counterparts.\n\nTo make people see their original, undyed nature,\nif they can preserve it,\nthis is called *bàopǔ* (抱朴).\n*Pǔ* (朴) is the Dao’s singular *qi*,\nin humans called *xìng* (性)—\nthe mind’s singular essence.\nTo take purity and simplicity as its meaning,\nand this as the standard—\n\nWorldly folk, clinging to desires and entangled in objects,\ngenerate private attachments,\nand thus defile their original nature.\nHow then can they see the undyed?\nOnly by minimizing private desires.\n\nWhat is minimizing private desires?\nIt is reducing cravings.\n\nThe One—\nthe true heart’s movement and also a kind of private desire—\nLaozi does not say to eliminate desire entirely,\nbut to reduce it,\nfor the Way of governance takes the One as its standard.\n\nWhen the people uphold the Way of reducing cravings,\nthis is called *dé* (德).\n*Nurturing all things is called *rén* (仁);\n*Rén* rescues safety and peril, called *yì* (义);\n*Yì* has approaches and withdrawals, called *lǐ* (礼);\n*Lǐ* adapts to change, called *zhì* (智);\n*Zhì* is sincere and real, called *xìn* (信).\n\nIf the people embrace the Dao,\nthen the Five Constants and myriad virtues arise naturally,\nand with the heart’s cravings reduced,\nthere is no capacity for artificiality.\n\nGreat is Laozi—\nhe makes the people return to their root,\nand from there flow naturally,\nteaching the world the Way of spontaneity.\n\n*\"Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow.\"*\n\nHow far apart is the *yī* (唯) of assent\nand the *ā* (阿) of dissent?\nHow different are good and evil?\nWhat the people fear,\none must also fear.\n\nVast and boundless—\nthe hearts of the common folk,\nrejoicing as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,\nascending the Spring Terrace in delight.\nI alone am silent, my virtue not yet manifest,\nlike an infant before it smiles,\n*chèngchéng* (乘乘), as if without destination.\n\nThe common folk all have excess,\nwhile I alone seem bereft.\nI, the heart of the foolish,\npure and unadorned.\n\nThe vulgar are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone seem dim.\nThe vulgar are keen and sharp,\nwhile I alone am muddled and still.\n\nThe gentle flow of water—\nits motion like the sea,\nthe gusting wind—\nlike an unending breath.\n\nThe common folk all have means,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet value seeking nourishment from the Mother.\n\nAll suffering arises from delusion,\nso Laozi teaches to abandon delusive thought as learning,\nthus there is no sorrow.\n\nYet to abandon delusion and return to the true,\nor to abandon the true and chase delusion—\nthis is like the *yī* (唯) of assent\nand the *ā* (阿) of dissent,\nboth emerging from the same heart,\nhow far apart are they?\n\nGood and evil,\nboth emerging from the same nature,\nhow different are they?\n\nWhat the people fear—\nthe galloping of delusive thought—\none must also fear.\n\nLaozi sighed at the hearts of people,\nendless and boundless—\nobserving the common folk’s joyful demeanor,\nas if feasting on the grand sacrifice—\nthe grand sacrifice, an ox,\nthe offering to Heaven.\nAs if ascending the Spring Terrace in delight.\n\nLaozi reiterated the intent of *\"Abandon learning\"*:\n*\"I alone am silent, my virtue not yet

mind,\nand where there is mind, there is obstruction.\n\nIt is like grasping food to achieve satiety—\nonce sated, one must depart from food,\nyet it is said: *Excessive food and superfluous actions*\nhinder one’s progress.\nEven ordinary actions may be resented—\nhow much more so when applied to the Dao?\n\nThus, the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\nThere is a primal substance (*mixed and unified*),\nborn before heaven and earth,\nsilent and vast,\nstanding alone yet unchanging,\ncirculating endlessly yet never exhausted.\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it *Dao* and boldly name it *Great*.\n*Great* is passing,\npassing is distant,\ndistant is returning.\nHence, the Dao is Great,\nheaven is Great,\nearth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\n\nWithin the realm of the four Great ones,\nthe Sage-King occupies one.\nHumans follow earth,\nearth follows heaven,\nheaven follows the Dao,\nand the Dao follows the natural.\n\nThe Great Dao is *empty and void*.\n*Empty and void* is without substance,\nyet naturally gives birth to being.\nAll things under heaven,\nfrom the myriad species to heaven and earth,\nare born from the unified *qi* before the formation of yin and yang.\n\n*Silent* means without sound,\n*vast* means without form.\nIt stands above all things yet does not alter,\ncirculates through the six directions yet never ceases.\nAll things arise from this One—\nit may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nThough it is said to have substance,\n*silent* and *vast* are names without designation.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"I do not know its name,\nso I call it Dao and boldly name it Great.\"*\nExtending the logic of *Great*,\none arrives at *passing*,\nthus it is said: *passing away*.\nPassing through the four directions and above and below,\nits principle grows ever more distant,\nthus it is said: *distant*.\nWhen distant, it cannot be extended further,\nso it returns to the One,\nthus it is said: *returning*.\n\nSince all things arise from this One,\nthe Dao is Great.\nAll things take form through yin and yang’s transformations,\nthus heaven is Great and earth is Great.\nIt is also said that the Sage-King is Great—\nmeaning that *empty and void* is his domain,\nand within this domain are the four Great ones,\nwhile the Sage-King governs all under heaven through the Dao,\noccupying one place.\n\nHumans cultivate virtue through the Five Constants and myriad conducts,\nyet they follow humility and modesty,\ntaking earth as their model.\nEarth’s nurturing follows heaven,\nheaven’s movement follows the Dao of unified *qi*,\nand the Dao of unified *qi* follows the *empty and void* of nature.\n\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the master of agitation.\nThus the Sage-King never strays from his burdens,\nthough he enjoys splendor and comfort,\nhe rests in serene detachment.\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nconsider himself lighter than the world?\nLightness will lose his ministers,\nagitation will lose his rule.\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness is the master of agitation.\n\nSpeaking of governance,\nthe Sage-King who moves daily\ndoes not abandon the weight of his supplies.\nThough he enjoys splendor and comfort,\nhe depends on stillness to rest in harmony,\ndetached yet visible.\nLight does not depart from heavy,\naction does not depart from stillness,\nthe ruler does not depart from the people.\nHow can one sigh over the burdens of ruling\nwhile holding oneself above the world?\nLightness toward the world will lose his ministers,\nagitation of the people will lose his rule.\n\nThe virtuous walk without leaving tracks,\nthe virtuous speak without blemish,\nthe virtuous plan without calculation,\nthe virtuous close without locks yet cannot be opened,\nthe virtuous bind without cords yet cannot be undone.\nThus the Sage-King always practices these virtues to rescue people,\nand there are none he abandons;\nalways practices these virtues to rescue all things,\nand there are none he discards.\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nHence, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,\nand the unvirtuous are the resources of the virtuous.\nIf one does not honor their teachers,\nnor cherish their resources,\neven if their wisdom is vast,\nthey are like great confusion.\nThis is called *essential subtlety*.\n\nThose who walk the Dao virtuously leave no tracks—\nthis is called *walking without walking*,\nwalking, yet leaving no tracks.\nThose who speak the Dao virtuously leave no flaws—\nthis is called *speaking without speaking*,\nspeaking, yet leaving no flaws.\nThose who plan the Dao virtuously have no scheming thoughts,\nthus they do not use calculations.\nThose who close the Dao virtuously have no desires in their hearts,\nso nothing can enter.\nThough there are no locks or bolts,\nit cannot be opened.\nThose who bind the Dao virtuously understand\nthat the Dao is within the heart,\nthus though there are no cords or constraints,\nit cannot be undone.\nHence the Sage-King always uses these virtues to rescue people,\nand there are none he abandons;\nalways uses these virtues universally to rescue all things,\nand there are none he discards.\nThus, in self-benefit and benefit to others,\nit is called *clinging to clarity*.\nTherefore, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,\nand the unvirtuous gain from the resources of the virtuous.\nYet if one does not honor their teachers,\nnor cherish their resources,\neven if they are clever and resourceful,\nthey cling to confusion like the greatest delusion.\nWithout wisdom and without attainment,\nthis is called *essential subtlety*.\n\nKnow its masculine,\nguard its feminine,\nand you become the *crevice* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *crevice* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue never departs,\nand it returns to the *baby*.\nKnow its white,\nguard its black,\nand you become the *model* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *model* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is never forceful,\nand it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.\nKnow its glory,\nguard its humiliation,\nand you become the *valley* of all under heaven.\nTo become the *valley* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is complete,\nand it returns to *primordial simplicity*.\n\nThose who study the Dao\ncannot yet fully grasp the *mindless* Dao—\nthey only know its masculine strength\nand fail to guard its feminine softness.\nThe *Laozi* likens this to the *crevice* of all under heaven,\nmeaning to dwell low and not contend.\nIf one can become the *crevice* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue never strays,\nand in time it returns to the *baby*.\nThe *baby* refers to\none who, upon seeing the world,\nhas no thoughts in their mind,\nyet understands clearly of its own accord.\nGuard its black and silent Dao,\nand you may become the *model* of all under heaven.\n*Model* also means\nto conceal light and hide virtue.\nIf one can become the *model* of all under heaven,\none’s virtue is never errant,\nand in time it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.\n\nTo know its glory yet not rejoice,\nto guard its humiliation yet not grieve,\nis like being the *empty valley* of all under heaven—\nmeaning to be void yet able to contain.\n」",

weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they dwell in no place of death.\n\nSome in the world direct their minds outward,\ntaking Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang as their model,\npracticing visualization, gargling, and breath control—\nmethods like *tuna* and *panrun*—\nin their pursuit of longevity.\nOthers direct their minds inward,\nsinking into emptiness and stillness,\nbecoming dim and lifeless as death itself.\n\nLaozi spoke of ten parts as his standard:\nOf those who live, three parts perish;\nof those who die, three parts perish#1,\nand of the people, some say \"all beings.\"\nThe Confucian says: \"The people are the sprouts of the myriad things.\"\nYet even among those who seek to nurture life,\nthree parts perish in the realm of death.\nLaozi himself asked: If people nourish life with food and clothing,\nwhy do they perish in the realm of death?\nBecause they cling excessively to the act of living itself.\n\nThree threes make nine—\nall who do not transcend:\nthose who live cling to being,\nthose who die cling to non-being,\nand the people cling to phenomena.\nThese three cling to something with their minds,\nall dwelling in the realm of life and death.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in transcending life\ndetach from external phenomena,\navoid the two extremes,\nand have no attachment at all.\nThey do not fixate in the mind,\nseeing as though not seeing,\ncoming as though not coming.\nBody and mind are as one,\nand thus they walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battle yet are unharmed by weapons.\nThe rhinoceros—like an ox, blue in color, weighing a thousand *jin*—\nhas no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nThus, fierce beasts and weapons cannot harm them.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their minds are unattached,\nand in sitting, standing, moving, or resting,\ntheir minds remain ever empty and still.\nEmpty means without form,\nstill means without birth.\nBecause they are without birth,\nthey dwell in no place of death.\n\nThe Dao gives birth,\nvirtue nurtures,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nThe Dao’s eminence,\nvirtue’s nobility—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they remain ever natural.\n\nThe Dao gives birth and nurtures,\nlengthens and matures,\ncompletes and ripens,\nnourishes and shelters.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\nlengthens yet does not rule—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nAll things arise from the Dao and are nurtured by virtue,\ntheir forms shaped by the interplay of giving birth and nurturing,\nand thus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nMoreover, the Dao’s eminence,\nvirtue’s nobility—\ntheir essence cannot be conferred by rank,\nyet they remain ever natural.\n\nThus, all things are born, nurtured, matured,\ncompleted, ripened, nourished, and sheltered by the Dao.\nThey arise from the Dao yet are not possessed by it,\nare nurtured by virtue yet do not rely upon it,\nare lengthened yet are not ruled—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they remain ever natural.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nUnder Heaven, there is a beginning,\nwhich is the mother of all things.\nHaving obtained the mother,\none knows her children.\nHaving known the children,\none returns to guard the mother.\nThus, one’s life will not perish.\n\nLiezi said:\n\"All that has form arises from the formless.\"\nThus, the beginning of all things under Heaven is the formless,\nand the formless is the mother of all things.\nHaving obtained the emptiness of the formless as mother,\none knows all things as her children.\nHaving known the children,\none must return to guard the mother.\nIf a person can harmonize their mind with the formless,\nas a child returns to its mother,\nthen their life will not perish.\n\nClose the orifices,\nshut the gates,\nand one will labor no more their whole life.\nOpen the orifices,\npursue affairs,\nand one will never be saved their whole life.\n\nTo see small is clarity,\nto hold fast to softness is strength.\nTo use its light,\nand return to its clarity—\nthis leaves no calamity for the body,\nand is called \"following the constant.\"\n\nThe eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—\nthese are called the six gates.\nThrough the six gates, delusive afflictions arise,\nand become the door to calamity.\nLaozi taught to close the orifices—\nthe gates are the openings—\nand shut the six gates’ doors.\nWhen greed and delusion cease,\none labors no more their whole life.\nIf one opens the orifices,\npursues affairs,\nand admits delusive afflictions,\none will never be saved their whole life.\n\nThe six gates take the mind as their root.\nIf the root is removed,\nthe phenomena will vanish on their own.\nThus, Laozi said:\n\"To see small is clarity\"—\nconstantly without desire,\none may be called 'small.'\nTo hold fast to softness is strength.\nThe utmost softness under Heaven\nresponds to things and conforms to customs,\nthus using its light.\nWithin, the mind is empty and still,\nand thus returns to its clarity.\n'To see small is clarity'—\nclarity is like a lamp’s flame,\nwhile light is its outward radiance.\nTo constrain it is called 'no loss of speech,'\nto lose it brings calamity to the body.\nNot losing speech is called 'following the constant.'\n\nThe Dao makes me distinctly aware—\n*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—\nand aligns me with the Great Dao,\nonly to fear its application.\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nyet people prefer narrow paths.\nThe court is excessively cleared,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries are empty,\ngarments are adorned with embroidery,\nbelts are girded with sharp blades,\nfeasts gluttonously indulge,\nwealth is hoarded in excess—\nthis is called boasting of the Dao,\nyet it is not the Dao at all.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n\"The Dao cannot be questioned,\nand questions have no answer.\"\nThus, the Great Dao transcends speech\nand cannot be sought through sight or hearing,\ncannot be known through thought or discourse,\ncannot be reached through language.\nIf one applies knowledge, conduct, or speech to the Dao,\nthen one may truly fear it.\n\nThus, Laozi said:\n\"The Dao makes me distinctly aware—\n*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—\nand aligns me with the Great Dao,\nonly to fear its application.\"\nTruly, I tell you:\nThe Great Dao is most level—\nplain and without action—\nyet people pursue clever shortcuts,\nstriving for immediate results.\nWhat of the times when courts vaunt cleverness and favor techniques,\nwhen the Dao is neglected,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries are empty,\npeople compete in ornate attire—\ngarments embroidered with green and white—\nand gird themselves with symbols of power like sharp blades,\nindulge in gluttonous feasts,\nand hoard wealth for surplus—\nthis is called boasting

      "translated_text": "「Indeed, those who govern the realm—do they lack rectitude?\nNowadays, the upright are deemed strange, while the perverse are praised as virtuous;\nthe people are long ensnared in confusion.\nThus, the Sage acts broadly without division,\npure and serene without harshness,\npunishes wrongs directly yet does not indulge in retaliation,\nand conceals brilliance without ostentation—\nall these stem from the state of non-action.\n\nIn managing both human affairs and the Dao of Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nFrugality is the essence of *early-complex*—\nthus, *early-complex* is born.\n*Early-complex* is called the profound embodiment of virtue and the accumulation of *power*—\naccumulating *power* ensures nothing is unconquered.\nIf nothing is unconquered,\nyet none know its limit,\nthen one can establish a state.\nA state with such foundation\ncan endure long.\nThis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nlong life and enduring vision.\n\nIf one governs with wisdom and discernment,\none loses the proper way—\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nTo possess yet not use is called frugality.\nFrugality is the origin of *early-complex* and rectitude—\nthus, *early-complex* is born.\n*Early-complex* is called the accumulation of supreme virtue.\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"Moderation (中庸), as a virtue, is it not supreme?\"*\nThe people have long been few in virtue.\nAccumulating supreme virtue ensures no task is unconquered.\nTo conquer all without haste,\nyet none know its limit,\nthen one can establish a state.\nRectitude is the foundation of a state;\na state with such foundation\ncan endure long—\nthis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nthe roots and foundation of wood,\nwhich brings long life and enduring vision.\n\nAs for governing one’s own person,\none must embrace unity.\nUnity is the origin of form—\nthis is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,\nlong life, abiding in the world,\npreserving form, and enduring vision.\nBut if one takes unity as the law,\nthen no task is unconquered.\n\nTo govern a great state,\none must treat it as if boiling a small fish—\n*[i.e., with gentle, non-intrusive care]*.\nThose who govern the world with the Dao of non-action\nhave no fearsome ghosts.\nNot that their ghosts are not fearsome,\nbut that their fearsome nature does not harm people;\nnot that their fearsome nature does not harm people,\nbut that the Sage also does not harm people.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nthen virtue returns in harmony.\nTo govern a great state as if boiling a small fish\nmeans one must not disturb it.\nDisturbing it harms the fish,\nso those who govern with the Dao of non-action\ndo not harm the people.\nAs for ghosts and spirits harming people—\nnot only do the ghosts not harm them,\nbut the Heavenly spirits also do not bring pestilence, famine, or drought to harm them.\nWhen spirits and ghosts do not harm people,\nit is because the Sage governs with the Dao of non-action\nand thus does not harm people either.\nFor when human and spiritual realms—\nboth hidden and manifest—\ndo not harm each other,\nthen non-action aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth,\nghosts and spirits—\nvirtue converges and returns in harmony.\n\nThus, those who govern the world with non-action\nface no Heavenly resentment,\nno human criticism,\nno ghostly reproach.\nA great state is the confluence of all lands,\nthe gathering of the world,\nthe receptive feminine principle of the world.\nThe feminine principle is ever victorious over the masculine through stillness,\nand stillness is the yielding, receptive way.\nThus, a great state yields to small states,\nand the small states submit to it;\na small state yields to great states,\nand the great states embrace it.\nHence, sometimes yielding brings conquest,\nsometimes yielding brings submission.\nA great state seeks only to nurture and shelter its people—\nthis is the joy of Heaven.\nA small state seeks only to serve and submit to others—\nthis is the fear of Heaven.\nMencius said:\n*\"Those who take joy in Heaven preserve the world,\nthose who fear Heaven preserve their own state.\"*\nBoth attain their desires—\nthus, those in great states must not rely on strength,\nbut rather on yielding.\n\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nand the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold like goods in the market,\nand noble deeds can be bestowed like the *xing* [杏] fruit.\nIf people are unvirtuous,\nwhy would one abandon them?\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven,\nand appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,\neven if one is offered a jade tablet with a bow\nor four horses in advance,\nit is not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nWas it not because they sought it to obtain,\nor pardoned crimes to escape?\nThus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things.\nThe virtuous cherish the Dao as a treasure,\nwhile the unvirtuous rely on virtue as their refuge.\nThus, honoring the Dao as fine words,\nfollowing it can be as effortless as selling in the market;\nvirtue as noble deeds,\ncan be bestowed upon people.\nIf people do not embrace virtue and the Dao,\nwhy would one abandon them?\nThus, like Yao yielding the throne to Xu You,\nand setting him as Son of Heaven,\nor Chu appointing Zhuang Zhou as Three Exalted Minister,\nthough invited with jade tablets and noble gifts,\nthough given carriages of ministers and the honor of horses,\nthey declined and withdrew—\nthis was not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.\n\nBut why did the ancients esteem this Dao?\nWhat was the reason they esteemed this Dao?\nThe reason they esteemed it\nwas that the heart harbors no desires.\nThey viewed honor and splendor as dust and filth,\nand did not say,\n*\"I seek it to obtain,\"*\nor *\"I cling to it to escape crime.\"*\nThus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.\n\nTo act without acting,\nto do without doing,\nto savor without savoring—\ngreat or small, many or few,\nrepaying resentment with virtue.\nThe Sage acts without acting,\ndwelling in the realm of doing nothing—\nthis is the virtue of serenity and ease,\nits flavor without savoring.»",

      "translated_text": "When Yuan Qing paid homage to Master Benlai, Deng Guang of Wangwu requested this text, wishing to engrave it for the world. Master Benlai said:\n\n*\"This book was written to remind myself of what I might forget. Now, people who read books on Dao and virtue often retreat and humble themselves, fearing they cannot practice it.\"*\n\nGuang said:\n*\"When qi aligns with form and spirit, and one can grasp yin and yang, then life spans with Heaven and Earth—worn yet never ending. This is called the True Person (Zhenren).\n\nIf one takes the One as the principle and applies it to all things, then one may roam between Heaven and Earth, perceiving and hearing beyond the eight directions. This is the manifestation of pure virtue and the preservation of the Way—called the Perfect Person (Zhiren).\n\nThe next level takes yin and yang as the principle, follows the logic of the eight winds, and dwells in the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Within, there are no resentful, angry, or enraged thoughts. Thus, one may adapt to desires in the world and live to a hundred years or more—this is called the Sage.\n\nIf one models oneself after Heaven and Earth, resembles the sun and moon, and arranges the constellations and stars to create celestial texts, records the solar cycles, observes yin and yang’s reversals and compliance, establishes laws and calendars, and distinguishes the four seasons—this is called the Virtuous Person (Xianren).\n\nThe next level conforms to the Five Constants and a hundred virtues—this is called the Gentleman (Junzi).\n\nTo abandon the Gentleman’s conduct is to be a petty person (xiaoren).\n\nFrom the True Person down to the Gentleman, none depart from the One qi, yin and yang, and human affairs—all are called virtue.\n\nIf you speak of the Great Dao of non-action before the One qi to those cultivating virtue, even the Three Worthies and Ten Sages would still harbor doubt—how much more so for petty people?\n\nThe Five Constants and a hundred virtues are already the virtues of human conduct; if people refuse to practice even these, how much more would they shrink from the Great Dao? What is there to fear?\"*\n\nMaster Benlai said:\n*\"There was once a traveler who said: In the past, Wang Xu registered the *Daodejing*, yet died young. His father pursued his spirit and saw him wearing an iron shackle, saying, ‘I should not have registered the *Daodejing*, so I suffer this punishment.’ If this is true, then the book must be difficult to practice.\"*\n\nGuang said:\n*\"Examining Xu’s registration, though it strayed from the Way, it was not entirely without virtue. If people followed its virtue, it could still benefit the world.\n\nFor example, Liu Qi composed musical chapters, collecting phrases from leisurely outings and discarded lines—merely capturing emotions and scenes, leading people to indulge in desires, chase pleasures, and drown in wine and lust, obscuring their true nature and burying morality. When heard in private chambers, it stirs emotions and provokes actions—peeping through cracks, scaling walls to follow one another, corrupting propriety. What difference is there between this and luring people into ravines?\n\nTo hold the office of a layer yet perform the deeds of a clown, claiming to be a scholar yet failing to uphold the Way of the Ancestral Teachers, leaving licentious words in the world to blind the ignorant—this is to invert the Way of the Ancestral Teachers. Moreover, which of these two bears greater guilt?\n\nThose who deceive with false teachings invite slander upon themselves, while true teachings cannot be easily ruined. Why fear their ridicule?\"*\n\nMaster Benlai said:\n*\"Even today, people are still amazed by wonders—like He Shang Gong ascending to Heaven, Liezi riding the wind, turning stones into gold, or going a year without food, with red faces and black hair. Such tales make people gaze in awe.\n\nYet I now live in poverty in a humble lane, my hair streaked with gray, selling medicine in the market, supporting my wife and children—just like everyone else.

      "translated_text": "「Indeed. To ride the wind and walk upon the void is the art of lightness; to transmute stones into gold is the art of transformation; to abstain from food for years is the art of grain-cutting; to have a red face and black hair is the art of cultivation—all these are mere techniques, not the Dao/Way of virtue/power.\n\nThe true practitioner of the Dao/Way of virtue/power, like Liezi dwelling in Zheng, also had his fields to till. When Master Ziyang left him grain, Liezi refused it. His wife, pressing her heart in sorrow, revealed their poverty—yet he still had a wife and children. For forty years in Zheng, the ruler and ministers treated him like any commoner, indistinguishable from the vulgar masses. Yet the Dao/Way of virtue/power lies not in outward appearance, but in the mind.\n\nThe vulgar only judge by outward circumstances, yet they fail to grasp the heart. For instance, when Zhuangzi hosted Confucius and they encountered the bandit Zhi, Zhi assessed them by worldly affairs, so they could not escape the defamation of the petty.\n\nThe *Southern Blossom Scripture* says: \"To speak of the Dao/Way but not follow its proper order is not the Dao/Way; to speak of the Dao/Way but not grasp its essence is mere idle quotation.\" Now, the Master before you established a ladder of virtue/power to reveal its order, and did not explain the Dao/Way through techniques and spells—this is worthy of attention.\n\nTo expound this *Scripture* directly, its language is plain yet its meaning profound; its examples are clear, its teachings explicit—yet the world has never seen such a work. If one claims to act solely for oneself, how did the Ancestral Teachers benefit others? Let me clarify the essential words: the Master, who sat in silence for long, then spoke: \"Five thousand words, yet their essence lies in the two characters: *no desire* (无欲). The seeker of the Dao/Way must only keep *no desire* in their heart—this is the supreme Dao/Way.\n\nYet the meaning of *no desire* is exceedingly profound. Therefore, Laozi first speaks of *no desire* in his opening chapter; fearing students would cling to the idea of *nothingness*, he then speaks of *desire* (有欲); again fearing they would be ensnared by *desire*, he declares that the union of *having* and *not having* is called *mysterious* (玄); and again fearing they would fixate on *mysterious*, he adds *yet again mysterious* (又玄). Those who brush aside these four stages are said to enter the Dao/Way’s gate.\n\nYet students often cling to one of these stages and thereby fall ill. First, when students hear *no desire*, they seek to sever thoughts in their mind and attain *no desire*, not realizing that severing thoughts *is* desire itself—this clinging to *nothingness* is a sickness. Second, when they seek *desire* in their mind, they believe there exists something separate from the mind called *desire*—yet they fail to know that *desire* is the mind itself, and the mind is *desire*. The moment they hold onto the notion of *desire* within the mind, it becomes desire—this clinging to *having* is also a sickness. Third, when they force their mind to be still and concentrated, like a wooden statue, unmoving and tranquil—this clinging to *mysterious* is called the sickness of *both having and not having*. Fourth, when they brush aside the traces of *mysterious* and act without attachment, dissolving the duality of subject and object in their mind—this clinging to *yet again mysterious* is called the sickness of *neither having nor not having*.\n\nAll these above are entanglements of the mind, and they are all defilements—thus, they are sicknesses. Only when one’s mind is free of these four afflictions can they truly be said to have *no desire*.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao/Way and annotate texts still cannot escape the realm of words, mistaking *mysterious* for the Dao/Way itself, and *yet again mysterious* as the gateway to all wonders—this is truly erroneous. To write of the Dao/Way, one must reveal its true teaching, which lies beyond these four stages. The Dao/Way is the gateway to all wonders, yet texts rely on words to convey it—how can one cling to words and claim to understand?\n\nThe student of the Dao/Way must only abandon the slightest trace of grasping thoughts. Their mind should be as vast as the bright sky, ever dwelling in emptiness, without a speck of dust. Light and clarity permeate all things, and then they respond to affairs as they arise—like clouds forming in the sky, appearing and disappearing without a trace, leaving no mark. Their mind is unattached to anything—this is called *virtue/power* (德).\n\nIt is said: *No taking, no discarding; no mundane, no sage; no single law to cultivate, no action to attain*—thus, it is called *ordinary mind* (平常心). The Dao/Way also says: *A single mind unborn, all dharmas are without blame*.\n\nStudents often doubt this, fearing they will fall into *emptiness*—so they turn back, gazing at the cliff. This is not falling into *emptiness*, but attaining the mind of *no mind* (无心). To truly grasp *no mind*, one is called a Dao/Way person (道人). The Dao/Way person stands above the True Person (真人), for the True Person clings to notions of subject and object in their practice, and thus remains below the Dao/Way person.\n\nAt that time, in the year *Gēnchén* of the *Shaoxing* era, a man from Yǐngchuān named **Chén Yuánqīng** recorded his words and appended them here.」",
