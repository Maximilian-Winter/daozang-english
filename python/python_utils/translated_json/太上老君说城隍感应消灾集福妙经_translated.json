Falsely attributed to the Supreme Lord Lao, expounding the method of worshipping the City God to dispel disasters. One fascicle. Base text from the* Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Sutra on the City God’s Responsive Dispelling of Disasters and Gathering of Blessings**\n\n**Opening Gatha**\nWith bowed head, I take refuge in the revered City God,\nWhose majestic power illumines heaven and earth.\nProtecting the nation and stabilizing the realm, upholding the altars of state,\nBestowing sweet rains to succor the people.\nCommanding great armies to patrol the world,\nRewarding good and punishing evil, as the sun and moon shine alike.\nUpright and impartial, judging life and death,\nDispelling calamity for the licentious and granting fortune to the virtuous, manifesting divine might.\nWith sincere devotion, I revere and uphold this to dissolve obstacles,\nBringing peace to households and purity to the land.\nNow I recite this true sutra as it is revealed,\nMay boundless grace descend upon all.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, was in the Seven Treasures Palace of the Great Luo Heaven, gathering the hosts of all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, and the officials of the Three Realms, to broadly expound the supreme, most true, mysterious, and primordial Great Dao. Then wondrous flowers bloomed brilliantly, and jade-like incense filled the air with fragrance.\n\nThere was a Perfected One named Vast Benevolence, who held a tablet and knelt in reverence, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “Your servant observes that all sentient beings in the world suffer myriad afflictions. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to show mercy and grant deliverance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy stroked his table and said: “These beings have committed all manner of evil deeds, sinking into the sea of suffering. Greedy and reckless, they act as they please—disloyal, unfilial, unkind, unjust, irreverent toward the Three Treasures, disrespectful to the gods, using false measures and scales, defiling the Five Grains, cursing heaven and earth, resenting wind and rain, slandering the true Dao, wounding others with harsh words, engaging in debauchery, theft, and murder, slaughtering living beings. Thus they incur guilt and forever lose their human form.”\n\nThe Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “The beings of the world suffer such tribulations. By what means may they attain deliverance?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Excellent, excellent! The people below all depend on the City God’s memorials to determine their fate without error. If there are faithful men and women in the world who recite this sutra thirty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand times, they shall immediately dissolve their karmic offenses and enjoy great peace.”\n\nThe Lord Lao said: “This spirit stores the essence of heaven and earth, gathers the beauty of mountains and rivers. His majestic power is resplendent, his sagely Dao lofty and luminous. Impartial and unbiased, upright and just, he responds to all prayers as a shadow follows form. Acting on heaven’s behalf, he governs all things, eradicates evil, and eliminates misfortune. Protecting the nation and safeguarding the realm, his merit extends to the altars of state. He universally bestows sweet rains, universally saves the people. Commanding the Eighteen True Offices and overseeing a million divine generals, through accumulated merit and virtuous conduct, he holds the office of City God, wielding authority over the world and presiding over all nations.”\n\nThe Perfected One, hearing this, bowed his head in reverence.\n\n**The Majestic Spirit of the Capital City God of All Under Heaven**\n**The Gods of the City Gods of the Thirteen Provincial Governments of All Under Heaven**\n**The Gods of the City Gods of All Prefectures, Subprefectures, and Counties of All Under Heaven**\n**The Sacred Assembly of the Eighteen Offices of the Two Side Halls**\n\n**Officials in Charge of:**\n- The Register of Life and Death for All Under Heaven\n- The Register of Longevity and Destiny\n- The Register of Illnesses and Epidemics\n- The Register of Fortune, Prosperity, and Extended Longevity\n- The Register of Offspring and Descendants\n- The Register of Immediate Karmic Retribution\n- The Register of Reciting Sutras and Cultivating Merit\n- The Register of Abstinence and Killing\n- The Register of Summoning and Interrogation\n- The Register of Reviewing Petitions\n- The Register of the Dragon Kings of Wind and Rain\n- The Register of Pursuit and Dispatch\n- The Register of Womb-Born, Egg-Born, Moisture-Born, and Transformation-Born Beings\n- The Register of Malevolent Ghosts and Destitute Spirits\n- The Register of Karmic Retribution for Good and Evil\n- The Register of Hungry Ghosts and Demons from Countless Kalpas\n- The Register of Mountains, Forests, and Regional Divisions\n- The Register of the Six Offices’ Clerks\n\n**The Great Divine Generals of the Golden Armored Attendants, Left and Right**\n**The Divine Martial Generals, Preceding and Following**\n\nThe Banner-Holding Golden Lads and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,\nTogether with all divine soldiers, generals, and officials—\n\nAt this time, the City God, moved by compassion for all beings in the world, whether afflicted by yearly calamities or monthly misfortunes, obstructed fate or entangled in celestial nets, widowed, orphaned, or solitary, stricken by pestilence or plague, sores, scabies, or leprosy, embroiled in legal disputes or verbal conflicts, lacking descendants, threatened by warfare, flood, or fire, beset by bandits or perilous childbirth—all manner of hardships—if they recite this scripture, I shall swiftly dispatch the Pestilence-Dispelling Envoys and the Pestilence-Collecting Saints to expunge their names from the Register of Sins and forever eradicate the roots of evil.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy again, saying: If in the world there are good men and good women who broadly accumulate hidden merit, practice all manner of expedient means, donate wealth to relieve distress, cherish the elderly and pity the poor, revere the Three Treasures, honor and support their parents, remain loyal to their sovereign, value food and clothing, live in harmony with their six relations, refrain from wrongdoing, observe fasts and uphold the Dao, their names shall be inscribed in the Register of Goodness, their virtues recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace, their blessings and longevity increased, their families prosperous and illustrious for generations, their descendants flourishing without end.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: The City God, august deity, wields true and weighty authority, manifesting boundless transformations. When prayers for rain are offered, sweet showers revive the withered and crops ripen; when prayers for sunshine are made, yin transforms into yang, and skies clear at once.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who single-mindedly devote themselves, contemplating the Dao and meditating on the True, and on the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, the birthdays of all divine sages, the new and full moons, or their own propitious birthdays, observe fasts, recite scriptures, and perform all manner of meritorious deeds, they shall attain peace and happiness in this life, their fields of blessing expanded, their gates flourishing and clans noble, their glory resplendent and prosperity secure. Officials shall ascend to loftier ranks, merchants shall amass greater wealth, voyages shall be free from the terror of waves, and journeys on land shall be safe and serene. All within the dusty world shall fall under his governance.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this gatha:\n\nGreat is the City God, truly born of Heaven’s virtue.\nRainbow streams through radiant isles, mountains and peaks bestow their numen.\nReceiving Heaven’s mandate, he governs all states,\npresiding over life and death, his retributions clear and just.\nRewarding good and punishing evil, not erring by a hair’s breadth,\nhis clarity rivals sun and moon, his virtue parallels Heaven and Earth.\nThe imperial capital stands solemn and tranquil, no treachery arises;\nhe averts disasters, resolves hardships, protects the realm and brings peace to the people.\nIn the great capital’s sacred precinct, his temple’s majesty commands reverence.\nThe state honors its rites, rituals refined and precise.\nAll under Heaven revere him, the realm turns to him in devotion.\nWarding off calamities and defending against misfortune, he eternally guards the eight directions.\nMay fragrant offerings endure forever, through countless springs.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy finished this gatha,\nonly then did the dragon chariot and crane carriage appear,\nbearing him back to the azure heavens.\nThe ten thousand sages and thousand perfected each returned within the clouds.\nThe City God, august saint, bowed his head in farewell,\nleaving this true scripture to be transmitted below to the world, circulated and recited.\nShould one follow its teachings, boundless blessings shall be received.\nAll spirits rejoiced, faithfully accepting and upholding it.\n\nThus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the City God’s Response: Dispelling Disasters and Gathering Blessings*, spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.\n\n---\n\n*The True Declaration of the Metropolitan City God*\n\nAncestral spirits of the altars and fields, the rightful gods of all under Heaven,\nthey assess the loyal deeds of states and manifest the benevolence of rewarding good and punishing evil.\nLords of the capital, attendants of all prefectures,\nthey oversee the thirteen provincial administrations and adjudicate the eighteen bureaus.\nTheir temple altars endure for ten thousand years, their grace sustains for countless kalpas,\nwielding the authority to bestow blessings or inflict awe,\nholding the power to inscribe life and death.\nThrough divine might, they shield the royal domain;\nwith yin soldiers, they repel barbarian raiders.\nMost numinous, most sagely, upright and impartial—\nthe Protector King, Guardian of Peace, August Spirit of Response, the Venerable Divine Lord.",
