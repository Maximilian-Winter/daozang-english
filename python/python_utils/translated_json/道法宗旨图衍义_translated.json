  "full_translation": "**Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings**\n*Scripture Title: Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings (Zhou Yan Yi).*\n*Deng Ge (Iron Cliff Master) compiled the illustrations; Zhang Xi’an (Chapter of the Hopeful Sage) extended the meanings.*\n*Two volumes.*\n*Source of the base text: The *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon) in its primary section.*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings***\n\n*\"Nurturing the Way\"* unites the Three Families as one—though the Dao/Way cannot be depicted, if one seeks its essence, the Dao/Way is not distant from mortals; it is attainable through personal cultivation. It is not a matter of guessing the key or hearing the bell to mark the day. Let scholars strive earnestly.\n\nIn the second year of *Zhidà* (Great Virtue), the thirty-eighth Patriarch of the Celestial Masters, Guangwei Zi, inscribed this work.\n\nThe Dao/Way says: *\"I do not know its name; forcefully named, it is called Dao/Way.\"* Since the Dao/Way has no name, how can it be described? If one seeks its essence, even eight thousand volumes would not be excessive.\n\nIron Cliff Master Deng lamented the Dao/Way’s decline and pitied the common folk’s superficial understanding. He compiled all its symbols into *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated*.\n\nAh! How vast his heart was!\n\nWhen the *Longhu* (Dragon Tiger) edition was published, reading it was like gazing into the boundless expanse.\n\nThe Hopeful Sage (Zhang Xi’an) did not shame the common or the wise—he had long aspired to elucidate the subtle teachings of the Three Families. Later, through inquiry and reflection, as if awakened from a distant void, he fulfilled his original intent.\n\nMoreover, since the dawn of antiquity, the true essence has not been revealed, though its symbols exist. Yet its nature and alignment with the cosmic Dao/Way remain beyond mortal comprehension. As Master Su said: *\"The Dao/Way cannot be spoken of; all that can be spoken of are mere semblances.\"* This book is also such a semblance.\n\nThus, the enlightened discern the true essence through its semblances, while the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into deception. I hope those who share my aspiration will likewise recognize the true through the semblances.\n\nThose who seek to illuminate the Dao/Way need not examine this work. But to gaze at empty flowers or grasp at reflections in water—this is not my wish.\n\nOn the *Jǐhài* (Great Virtue) day of the second year of *Zhidà*, Zhang Xi’an of Linchuan inscribed this at the Nurturing the Way Hall.\n\nThe Dao/Way is vast and boundless; its subtleties are profound and replete with mystery. Hence, the Dao/Way is expounded through its laws, the laws are illustrated through images, the images are revealed through visions, the visions are rendered in the mysterious, and the mysterious is further refined—emptiness and marvelousness permeate the One.\n\nZhang Jun of Nurturing the Way, beyond the confines of secular governance, amidst the realms of misty peaks and flowing waters, renews himself through harmony with nature, ever-transforming without limit. Is this not the work of the creative Dao/Way itself, its merit and practice manifesting thus?\n\nNow, to compose this preface, I have taken from the Daoist Canon a single resolution, to verify and praise the sublime mysteries of the high Dao/Way.\n\nIn autumn of the year *Jiāchén* (Jia Chen), Xūngxuán Zi (Empty Mysteries) respectfully inscribed this.\n\n*Xūngxuán Zi* is of the Wang clan, given name *Wànqǐng*, courtesy name *Qīngbó*, a native of Linchuan. Born into a noble household, he took the Daoist path as a *Huángguān* (Yellow Crown), adopting the title *Yàoshān* (Herb Mountain). He consorted with Dao Mountain Master Xu Shùnsūn, traversing sacred peaks, and eventually retired into seclusion beneath the woods.\n\nSometimes he sat atop towering pines, sometimes in modest chambers, while others secretly observed him murmuring to himself—when they left, he ceased. Others sought his writings, and he would speak at length or concisely, yet compose a thousand words in an instant.\n\nDuring the era of *Zhidà*, Dao Mountain Master Xu passed away at the *Longxīng Xiāoshè* (Dragon’s Rest Hermitage) on the 14th day of the 11th month of the year *Dàwùshēn*. His disciples, when summoned by his portrait, composed an elegy and departed. He then revived, sat upright, and wrote: *\"Residing in Herb Mountain’s generosity, emulating the lofty spirit of Dao Mountain.\"* Such was his Dao/Way.\n\nAt the *Língyān* (Nebulous Chamber) records, this was not the true account—his Dao/Way was within himself, a single breath of wind and moon. He cast aside his brush and laughed heartily before departing again.\n\nIn autumn of the year *Zìshùn Gēngwǔ* (Cultivating Virtue Geng Wu), Zhang Línshū of Linchuan said: *\"A humble servant entered Fujian and saw him.\"* Cai Zhìfū of *Shàowǔ* (Shao Wu) also said: *\"A traveler in straw hat and gourd bag spoke of encountering him in Wuyi.\"*\n\nNiè Jìng’ān of *Jiāhé* (Jia He) said: *\"The Dragon Tiger saw the golden *Tuó* (Dharma) head and inquired of him, saying that he would soon appear in Wuyi.\"*\n\nHence, Mencius said: *\"Where he passes, transformation occurs; where he dwells, the divine manifests.\"* This is the very Dao/Way.\n\nAh! Who but a great man could attain this?\n\nZhang Xi’an, who studied in Linchuan, elaborated.\n\n---\n\n**Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings – Volume One**\n\n**Illustrations of the Primordial Dao/Way of the Original Ancestor**\n\nThe Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way (*Yuánshǐ Zǔjié*) gave birth to all the celestial realms. He illuminated the Three Landscapes (*Sǎnjǐng*), which became the celestial foundation (*Tiāngēn*). Extended Meanings:\n\nThe *Taishang Dùrén Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Sage on Deliverance) states: *\"The Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way gave birth to all the celestial realms, illuminated the Three Landscapes, which became the celestial foundation—above him, there was no further ancestor, only the Dao/Way as his form.\"*\n\nThe Daoist texts say: *\"One *qi* divided into three *qi*; the three *qi* each formed a palace.\"* At the dawn of the *Longhàn* (Dragon Han) era, the *Xuánqì* (Mysterious *qi*) coalesced into the *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Chīmíng* (Vermilion Brightness) era, the *Yuánqì* (Primordial *qi*) coalesced into the *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Shànghuáng* (Supreme Sovereign) era, the *Shǐqì* (Original *qi*) coalesced into the *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) Palace.\n\nThe *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Saints (*Jiǔshèng*) dwell. The *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Worthies (*Jiǔzhēn*) reside. The *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Immortals (*Jiǔxiān*) abide. The three heavens governed by the Three Purity realms, comprising thirty-six heavens, are called the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven). These thirty-six heavens are distributed across the Four Extremities (*Sìjí*), each extremity containing nine heavens.\n\nBelow the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) lies the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven). In total, there are four such heavens, and they are categorized into four kinds of celestial beings and heavens.\n\nAbove the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) is the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven), and above the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) are the Three Purity realms. These celestial realms are all from prior *jié* (kalpas/epochs) where beings cultivated the true essence (*xiūzhēn*). When they merged with the Dao/Way in truth, they gathered to form shape and dispersed to become *qi*—naturally merging and dispersing without fixed form or appearance, spanning countless *jié* (kalpas/epochs), never falling back or degenerating.\n\nBelow the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) lies the *Wúsè Jiè* (Formless Realm), beneath which is the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm), and beneath the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm) is the *Yù Jiè* (Desire Realm). The Desire Realm contains six heavens; the Form Realm contains eighteen heavens; the Formless Realm contains four heavens—totaling twenty-eight heavens in the Three Realms (*Sānjiè*).\n\nHumans who accumulate virtuous deeds may be reborn in the Desire Realm heavens, becoming either celestial sovereigns (*Tiānzhǔ*), celestial beings (*Tiānrén*), or celestial multitudes (*Tiānzhòng).*\n\nThe beings of the Desire Realm still harbor desires and thoughts; without desires and thoughts, they ascend to the Form Realm. The beings of the Form Realm still cling to colored perceptions; without colored perceptions, they ascend to the Formless Realm. The beings of the Formless Realm still retain the thought of awareness; without the thought of awareness, they ascend to the Great Dharma Heaven, thus emerging beyond the Three Realms.\n\nThe twenty-eight heavens of the Three Realms dwell in the four directions, each direction containing seven heavens—known as the **Eight Circles** (*Bāyuán*), also called the **Four Great Brahmā Small Rāga Heavens** (*Sìfàn Xiǎoluó Tiān*).\n\nMere mortals with virtuous deeds and high merit may ascend to the Three Realms’ heavens but remain there. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they no longer cultivate virtue, they fall back and degenerate, hence the varying lifespans of each.\n\nWithin the **Six Paths** (*Liùdào*), the **Path of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*) refers to these Three Realms’ heavens. The beings of the Three Realms’ heavens—should even a single thought stray from truth—descend from higher immortals to lower ones, and if lower immortals fail to progress further, they return to the human path, known as **degeneration** (*Tuìduò*).\n\nBefore the **空洞** (*Kōngdòng*, Void of Emptiness), the *qi* mother was in chaotic unity—unforced, it is **truth** (*zhēn*); undual, it is **refinement** (*jīng*); unobscured, it is **awareness** (*jué*); unmeasurable, it is **divinity** (*shén*).\n\nWho is pure, who is turbid? Who is mundane, who is sage? Who is short-lived, who is long? Who is demonic, who is orthodox? The lightest *qi* gives rise to the heavy, and the heavy forms the light; thus, the high and low take shape. The lower ascends, the higher descends, as water and fire transmit essence—so there are sun and moon, and day and night govern the light.\n\nOne and two form the sovereign; three *qi* refine into subtle *qi* (*wéi*), three subtle *qi* coalesce into the **Three Augments** (*Sānhòu*), and three augments establish the **Three Festivals** (*Sānjié*). The Great Bright culminates in the beginning, and five and six cycle eternally. The sun moves from the left, while the stars align from the right, circulating through the **Six Void Points** (*Liùxū*). Thus, new phases arise, yielding and firmness alternate, and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*) are firmly set.\n\nIn the boundless void, the **Three Pure Ones** (*Sānqīng*) dwell. None know its origin, yet they name it **Primordial** (*yuán*). None know its beginning, yet they call it **First** (*shǐ*). None know its vastness, yet they term it **Great** (*tài*). None know its summit, yet they label it **Highest** (*shàng*). Lofty yet without end, it is called **Venerable** (*zūn*). Hosting yet without self, it is called **Lord** (*jūn*).\n\nIt can be empty or full, singular or myriad. It manifests all heavens, completes all worlds. Within it lies the **Mystic Mountain** (*Miàoshān*), called **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*). The four directions are established, the eight directions divided, and the **Thirty-Two Sovereigns** (*Sānshíèr Dì*) reside in the jeweled palaces.\n\nThe **Big Dipper** (*Dǒu*), **Net** (*Jī*), **Horn** (*Jié*), and **Weighing Scale** (*Gé*) align; the **Well** (*Jǐng*), **Parameter** (*Shēn*), **Pivot** (*Kuí*), and **Wall** (*Bì*) form constellations; the **Vanguard** (*Kuí*) upholds the **Pole** (*Gāng*), and the **Five Convergences** (*Wǔhé*) create celestial motion. The finest hairs and smallest particles flow with the Dao, boundless in their vastness. The **Effulgent Minor** (*Tàishǎo*) fills the void, and the **Great Void** (*Hún*) is sealed.\n\nWhen the **perverse *qi*** (*xiéqì*) loses its origin, it scatters into all living beings. Through their **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiào*), emotions and cognition arise. Emotions flow, cognition obscures, and beings twist and turn in confusion. From this flow, **attachment** (*ài*) arises; obscured by attachment, **aversion** (*zēng*) takes form. Aversion and attachment clash, one surges forward while the other lingers behind. Abandoning clarity for darkness, they accumulate darkness into **yin** (*yīn*). Yin congeals into **obscurity** (*yōu*), and entering obscurity, they become **ghosts** (*guǐ*). Extending into human form, branching into other paths—devouring, oppressing, and dominating one another in strength. Their nature cannot be stilled, and their lifespan cannot be prolonged.\n\nThe **Black *qi*** (*hēiqì*) darkens like a shroud, defiling the celestial heights. The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Three Heavenly Sovereigns** (*Sāntiān Dìjūn*), survey from below, and in a single moment of compassion, the **subtle *qi* of mercy** (*miàoshén*) naturally weaves into patterns. The **Spirit Wind** (*Língfēng*) stirs and plays, forming sounds of its own. With boundless compassion, they deliver from suffering; with boundless benevolence, they cherish life. With boundless orthodoxy, they crush evil; with boundless clarity, they break through darkness.\n\nAbove, they arrange the **palaces and offices** (*gōngcáo*); below, they establish the **mountains and altars** (*yuèdú*). The **multitude of immortals** (*Zhōngzhēn*) divide their duties, and the **ranked sages** (*Lièxiān*) manage their affairs. When the **true mechanism** (*zhēnjī*) leaks, the **Jade Scriptures** (*Yùzì*) emerge. Fire refines the **Sun Cavern** (*Dòngyáng*), and the pen records the **Void Blue** (*Kōngqīng*). The **Jade Registers** (*Yùjiǎn*) and **Golden Tablets** (*Jīnbǎn*) inscribe talismans and spells, teaching the **myriad immortals** (*Zhōngxiān*) while commanding the **demonic hosts** (*móqún*). They purify and refine **souls and spirits** (*húnpò*), and summon the **ten thousand spirits** (*wànlíng*).\n\nThe **Mixed Primordial Transformation** (*Húnyuán Huàshēn*)—Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty’s inscription reads:\n*\"Great is the Supreme Dao! Effortless, natural.\nFrom kalpa’s end to its beginning, it precedes earth and heaven.\nEncompassing light in silent stillness, it endures through endless kalpas.\nIn the East, it is taught by Confucius; in the West, it appears as the Golden Sage.\nAll hundred kings take its principles, and all successive sages transmit its mysteries.\nIt is the origin of all teachings, the deepest of the profound.\"*\n\nThe **Praise of Preceptor Yán Rúrú** (*Rúrú Yán Jūshì Yùlù*) says:\n*\"Life begins with no origin, and generations follow the Zhou kings.\nIts transformed body reappears, and Śākyamuni pays homage,\nstill hearing the Master’s voice—\nthe teacher of the eighty-one thousand heavens,\nthe guide of countless kalpas.\"*\n\nThe **Tàixuān Jīng** (*Tàixuān Jīng*) states:\n*\"The Supreme Old Lord possesses myriad transformed bodies,\nsetting teachings according to regions,\nestablishing names by divine opportunity,\nuniversally saving all beings—\neach day descending its traces,\neach age as the sovereign teacher.\"*\n\nThe **Wise Scholar** (*Xīxián*) cites the *Lotus Sutra* (*Fǎhuá Jīng*):\n*\"All Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,\nappear in the world solely for one great matter—\nthe cause and condition of dharma.\nThey share the same Dao.\"*\n\nThe *Family Sayings* (*Jiālǔ*) record:\n*\"Confucius told Nángōng Jìngshū:\n'I have heard that the Old Guest knows the ancient and the present,\ngrasps the origins of rites and music,\nand clarifies the return of virtue and Dao—\nthen he is my teacher. I will go to him now.'\nJìngshū accompanied him to the Zhou.\nAfter asking about rites from the Old Sage,\nthey returned to Lu,\nand the Dao became even more revered.\nEven from distant lands, the disciples who came\nnumbered in the thousands.'*\n\n**Ge Xianshū** (*Gě Xiānshū*)’s preface to the *Daodejing* (*Dàodé Jīng*) says:\n*\"The Old Master embodies the effortless naturalness of the Dao,\nborn before the Great Primordial,\narising from no cause,\npassing through the end and beginning of heaven and earth,\nineffable and beyond description,\nending without end,\nexhausting the boundless,\nreaching the limitless—\nthus, it is the **Limitless** (*Wújí*).'*\n\n**Master Shāng of the Song Mountain School** (*Shāng Shānxiānshì*) in *Zhēngjīn Jí* (*Zhēngjīn Jí*) writes:\n*\"What the Old Master speaks of is the Great Dao.\nThus, Confucius on rites says:\n'I have heard it from the Old Sage.'\nThe *Great Rites* (*Lǐyùn*) state:\n'The Great Dao’s practice aligns with the heroes of the Three Dynasties.\nThough I did not attain it, I aspired to it.'\nThe *Book of Changes* (*Yì*) says:\n'The movement of all under heaven is governed by the **Unchanging One** (*zhēnyī*).'\nYet the *Laozi* (*Lǎozǐ*) says:\n'Kings and lords who grasp the One\nuse it to govern all under heaven.'\nExamining the principle of **non-thought, non-action** (*wú sī wú wéi*)\nand the theory of **yin-yang transformation** (*yīnyáng biànhuà*),\nhow can these two texts not both be true?\nIf one insists the Old Sage is wrong,\nthen the *Yì* and the *Great Rites* must be burned!\"*\n\nThe learned scholars of old who delighted in debate—who could surpass Mencius? In Mencius’ time, Laozi’s text had already been in circulation for over a hundred years. Yet Zhuangzi lived contemporaneously with Mencius, and if his ideas could be refuted, then Mencius had already done so. Why wait for later Confucian scholars to argue it?\n\nSima Qian remarked: \"The Dao of Laozi is concise and easy, requiring little effort yet yielding great results.\" Some Confucians, however, disagreed, criticizing the prioritization of Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings over the Six Classics—this was not his intent. When Sima Qian composed *Records of the Grand Historian*, he gave Confucius a *shìjiā* (biography of his descendants) and Laozi a *lièzhuàn* (separate account). Was this not to honor Laozi? Rather, it was because Laozi’s Dao was the root of Confucianism, and to honor its origin was to exalt its foundation.\n\nThe *Records* further states: \"The Daoist school makes the spirit unified, its movements harmonizing with the formless, its simplicity sufficient for all things.\" The *Book of Han* says: \"The Daoists grasp the essential and hold fast to the root, maintaining purity and emptiness to preserve themselves, adopting humility and weakness to govern—this is the art of the sovereign ruling from the south-facing seat.\"\n\nMaster Chen of Lingxi’s *Guan Shi Ping* notes: \"When Emperor Wu of Han abandoned Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings in favor of Confucianism, he established the Imperial University, conducted sacrifices, standardized calendars and measurements, harmonized music and poetry, and instituted mountain-altar rituals for the gods. The brilliance of his Confucian governance is evident. Yet with so many troubles in the realm, the ruler’s mind unsettled, his relentless reforms exhausted the people—taxation halved the population, wars burned without cease, and filial piety faltered. Though his edicts claimed to stem from *rén* and *yì*, their effects scarcely differed from those of Qin Shihuang. At such times, the land knew no peace, and the people longed for the return of Wen and Jing. Thus, the Yellow Emperor-Laozi principle of *qīngjìng* (tranquility) was hardly detrimental to the realm.\n\nOur Confucian scholars must insist on *this* being right and *that* wrong. Why not, instead of praising Wu and condemning Wen and Jing, take the best from both?\"\n\nHan Yu of Changli’s *Strategic Questions for the Imperial Examination* states: \"Confucius too had a teacher—he inquired about rites from Lao Dan. Today’s people fall far short of Confucius’ wisdom, and worse, they have no teacher. Yet if they do not study, how can their scholarship flourish or their virtue be complete?\" (From *Collected Works*, Volume 14.)\n\nMaster Xie of Die Mountain says: *\"The Dao De Jing* reveals the mind of Heaven above, and its teachings have never been without benefit to the world’s order.\n\nThe *Rei T’ung Tu* (Diagram of Mutual Thunder) depicts the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang—rising and descending, responding in harmony.\n\nThe *Golden Edicts* state: \"Heaven and Earth, pure and turbid, in essence like an egg—one thing within the Great Void. Yang ascends to Heaven, generating yin from the *Tàijí*, which embraces yang and descends in obscurity. Yin descends to Earth, generating yang from the *Tàijí*, which carries yin and ascends in hazy form. This rising and descending aligns with Heaven and Earth’s movement, giving rise to all things.\n\nMaster Zhou of Lúxī says: \"From *wújí* emerges *tàijí*; *tàijí* moves and generates yang. At its peak of motion, it stirs to stillness; at its peak of stillness, it generates yin, then stirs again. This dynamic and static interplay forms their mutual root.\"\n\nMaster Zhu of Huì’ān says: \"Yin takes yang as its substance, yang takes yin as its substance. Water is bright within yet dark without; fire is dark within yet bright without.\" Master Zhang of Hèngqú says: \"The essences of yin and yang interpenetrate their domains—this is the very meaning.\"\n\n*The True Origin* states: \"The rising and falling of yin and yang within Heaven and Earth mirror the interplay of heart and kidney in human physiology.\"\n\n*The Jade Book* says: \"Yang bears yin upward, yin embraces yang downward. This rising and falling circulates through the Dao, ensuring Heaven’s longevity and Earth’s endurance.\"\n\nThe *Rei T’ung Tu* serves as the pivot of Heaven—its nature is benevolent, its domain is life, its essence is yang, its form is yin. Thus, *jiǎ* (甲), *gēng* (庚), *rén* (壬) are yang-thunder. It acts as the mechanism of Earth—its nature is malevolent, its domain is destruction, its essence is yin, its form is yang. Thus, *yǐ* (乙), *xīn* (辛), *dīng* (丁), *guǐ* (癸) are yin-thunder.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"When yin and yang move askew, Heaven and Earth are shaken—thunder and lightning erupt, fire burns within the waters, and the Great Block is consumed.\"\n\n*The Huainanzi* states: \"When yin and yang clash, they generate thunder; when they clash violently, they produce lightning.\"\n\nThe *Golden Edicts* say: \"Within yin, yang is concealed; if yang-qi does not descend, it strikes and produces thunder and lightning.\"\n\nMaster Zhang of Hèngqú says: \"When yin-qi condenses, the enclosed yang cannot escape—it erupts as lightning. When yang-qi is trapped within yin-qi and cannot emerge, it explodes as thunder.\"\n\nMaster Hào of Huánxī’s *Jīnghéng Nèipiān* says: \"Sacrificial thunder is *zhèn* (shaking)—a fixed principle. Yet why does thunder have sound? It is the four lower trigrams of *lǐ* (fire) interacting, and when *lǐ* is superimposed, it becomes *kǎn* (water). Fire entering water creates a violent, resonant sound—considering smaller things first: when fire forges metal, making it transparent, and it is plunged into water, its clamor is still fierce. How much more so with the vast *qi* of *kǎn* and *lǐ*?\n\nThe *Huntian* symbol encompasses Earth, with the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Its light enters the earth, and when Heaven generates water, water is within the earth. The next host rises again in the east, its light emerging above ground. The sun rises from Fushang, truly ascending from the sea, hence the morning sun’s clarity. When it sets, its sound is thunderous and fierce. Thus, the *Yánzhí Tu* (Diagram of the Setting Sun) strikes drums and gongs to blend with it; otherwise, the young and old would be terrified. This is the proof of fire entering water and producing sound.\n\nThus, it is known that the angry *qi* of water and fire, when agitated, forms thunder—and how much more so when *kǎn* (water) generates rain and *lǐ* (fire) generates lightning, each reinforcing the other?\"\n\nThe *Zǐ Zhūzǐ* (Master Zhu’s Sayings) states: \"Though thunder is a manifestation of *qi*, wherever there is *qi*, there is form. For instance, the *lièyǎng* (thunderclouds) are originally but thin rain illuminated by the sun to cast shadows, yet they too possess form and can absorb water and wine.\"\n\n*The Ěryǎ* (Erhya) says: \"Swift thunder is called *tíng* (thunderbolt).\"\n\nThe Diagram of *Sùyào Xuánjī* (Host曜 Mysterious Mechanism) states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: \"The celestial *Dao* revolves to the left, while the sun, moon, and five stars traverse the four and seven [regions] in order, forming the celestial *jīngwěi* (warp and weft). Thus, they give rise to and extinguish the four seasons, nurturing all ten thousand things—all through the function of *fàn* (primordial) *qi*, as the eternal *Dao* of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture for Guiding People) declares: \"It encompasses the ten directions, revolving the Big Dipper through the *lì* (Arrow) and *jì* (Winnowing Basket), returning to the Five Constants—this is its meaning.\"\n\nThe *Hùnyuán Sānqīng Jīng* (Scripture of the Three Pure Ones of the Primordial Chaos) states: \"The *qi* of the *yángjīng* (yang essence) becomes the sun, the *qi* of the *yīnjīng* (yin essence) becomes the moon. The residual *qi* of the sun and moon disperses as stars and constellations, distributed among the Twenty-eight *xiù* (Lunar Mansions).\"\n\nThe *Huángdì Sùwèn Tàishǐ Tiānyuán Yùcè Wén* (Yellow Emperor’s Plain Questions: The Supreme Origin, Heavenly Elements, and Jade Tablet Text) says:\n\n\"The Great Void is vast and boundless,\nIts transformation originates the foundation.\nAll things derive their beginning,\nThe Five *Phases* (运) complete the heavens.\nThe *qi* is spread by the True Spirit,\nOverseeing the *kūn* (Earthly) root.\nNine stars hang resplendent,\nSeven luminaries revolve in cycles.\nYin and yang are named,\nSoftness and hardness are named.\nThe hidden and the manifest take their positions,\nCold and heat relax and expand.\nLife and transformation, life and transformation—\nAll things flourish in harmony.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Three Thunders (雷霆三关图) states:\n- *Zhù* (Incantation) is the Heavenly Gate,\n- *Què* (Formula) is the Human Gate,\n- *Gāng* (Coercive) is the Earthly Gate.\n\nThe *Huángtíng Yùjīng* (Scripture of the Yellow Court) says:\n\"The mouth is the Heavenly Gate of spiritual vitality,\nThe hands are the Human Gate of grasping fortune’s rise and fall,\nThe feet are the Earthly Gate of the life-death threshold.\"\n\nThe *xīxián* (worthy sages) say: \"Mencius taught: ‘Wherever one passes, there is transformation; wherever one remains, there is spirit.’ The *Dao* texts declare: ‘Though the body dies, the yang spirit endures.’ Lü Dongbin’s *Shī Jiě Fùxiàn Shī* (Poem on the Corpse’s Dissolution and Reappearance) states:\n‘Once I left my vermilion robes at the Jade Spring,\nNow I visit the Penglai Isles with a new name.’\n\nThe Diagram of the Big Dipper’s Handle Circumnavigating Heaven states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: \"Heaven uses the Big Dipper as its mechanism, traversing the twelve *chén* (hours/constellations) above, aligning the five stars within the four and seven [regions], and thus transforming to produce all things. If the Dipper’s handle does not revolve, the celestial *wěi* (weft) and *hòu* (candidates) become disordered, then auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise from the *yáo* (line) symbols, the *fǔhuǒ* (auspicious fire) is lost at dawn and dusk, the stars and luminaries are misaligned, the sun and moon diverge, the four seasons are unbalanced, and all things fail to thrive. Thus it is said: ‘The *Kūn* and *Liáng* (Heaven and Earth), sun and moon, do not move of themselves—all are driven by the Dipper’s handle revolving its mechanism.’ When the Dipper’s handle points to the first, second, and third months, it occupies the *yín-wèi-chén* (Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon) positions, nurturing all things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it occupies the *wù-wǔ-wèi* (Snake, Horse, Goat) positions, fostering all things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it occupies the *shǎn-yǒu-xū* (Monkey, Rooster, Dog) positions, ripening all things. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it occupies the *hài-zǐ-chǒu* (Pig, Rat, Ox) positions, storing and preserving all things. When the Dipper’s handle circumnavigates Heaven, the year’s function is complete. Great is the transformation of the *Wu* (non-action)!\"\n\nThe scriptures say: \"Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism, while humans use the heart as theirs. Thus, the celestial mechanism operates through yin and yang, and the human mechanism is perfected through the Great *Dao*. The Dipper’s handle’s mechanism must not be overlooked.\"\n\nShào Kāngjié (Emperor Shao of Song) said: \"The heavens are boundless above and unfathomable, so one observes the Dipper’s numbers to divine celestial movements. Where the Dipper’s handle points, the heavens move accordingly—when the *qiú* (handle) points to *Zǐ* (Rat), it marks the day; when the *sháo* (ladle) points to *Yín* (Tiger), it marks the night.\"\n\nYáng Zhī (Master Yang) said in the *Tàiyuán Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Origin): \"The Dipper’s handle moves southward, leftward in revolution but rightward in rotation.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Four Symbols Returning to the True states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: \"The scriptures teach: ‘The mouth’s relation to taste, the eyes’ to color, the ears’ to sound, the nose’s to odor—these exhaust human *yù* (desires), and extinguish Heaven’s *lǐ* (principle), all stirred by the heart.’ *Zhuāngzi* (Chuang Tzu) says: ‘Those whose desires run deep have shallow celestial *qi*—thus, the sage practices *wu* (non-action).’ Seal the tongue’s breath, contain the eyes’ light, concentrate the ears’ resonance, and regulate the nose’s inhalation. When the four senses harmonize, they return to the *Xūyuán* (Void Origin), still and motionless within the True Self.\"\n\nYán Zǐ (Master Yan), as a fool, attained *mò* (silent) insight through *biān* (wall) meditation, while the Master recognized the *yīguàn* (oneness). Lǎozi (Laozi) embraced the One and guarded the *pǔ* (uncarved block).\n\nMencius said: \"No better cultivation of the heart exists than in desiring little.\"\n\nThe *Dao* teaches: \"One must always dispel desire to achieve a tranquil heart.\"\n\nThe *Sìshíèr Zhāng Jīng* (Scripture of the Forty-Two Chapters) states that the Buddha said:\n\"To distance oneself from desires and keep the mind serene—\nThis is the same realm.\"\n\n*Zhuāngzi* says: \"When the celestial *qi* is not agitated, the five senses are complete.\"\n\n*The Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean) says:\n\"To see without seeing, to hear without hearing,\nTo eat without knowing its taste—\nThis is called rectifying the heart through self-cultivation.\"\n\n*Xúnzǐ* (Hsun Tzu) says:\n\"The eyes do not wish to indulge in vivid colors,\nThe ears do not wish to be startled by sounds,\nThe mouth does not wish to overindulge in flavors,\nThe nose does not wish to be overwhelmed by odors.\nMoreover, the heart dwells in the central void,\nUsing it to govern the five senses—\nThis is called the Heavenly Sovereign.\nThe annotation says: ‘The five senses are the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and body.’\"\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture for Guiding People) declares:\n\"The divine wind is still and silent,\nMountains and seas conceal the clouds.\nThe heavens are free of floating obstructions,\nThe four *qi* are clear and bright.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Mixed Unity of the Three Talents states, as the *Jīnbì Gǔwén Lónghǔ Shàng Jīng* (Ancient Prose of the Golden Pile: The Upper Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger) says:\n\"The chicken’s egg is a metaphor,\nCombining to respond to the Three Talents.\nAgain, the one-inch pearl,\nMerges the Three Talents.\"\n\n*Wén Zhōngzǐ* (Master Wen) says:\n\"'To cease the ceaselessly surging' is its meaning—\nHeaven is not merely the ceaselessly surging.\nEarth is not merely mountains, rivers, hills, and valleys.\nHumans are not merely the head, body, and feet.\nHeaven encompasses the root of the *yuán* (primordial),\nEarth encompasses the form of the *yuán*,\nHumans encompass the cognition of the *yuán*.\"\n\n*Lièzǐ* (Lieh Tzu) says:\n\"The *yuán* *qi* (primordial *qi*) that is light and clear becomes Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid becomes Earth,\nThe balanced and harmonious *qi* becomes humans.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Five Thunders Gathering the Clustering states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said:\n\"The Five *qi* (元) ascend to the primordial,\nUnstained by dust, able to purify and tranquilize—\nThis is called *wú lòu* (leakage-free).\nThe liver is the east spirit’s wood,\nThe lungs are the west soul’s gold,\nThe heart is the south deity’s fire,\nThe kidneys are the north essence’s water,\nThe spleen governs the central earthly palace.\"\n\nThus, the **sage** does not see with the eyes but the **soul** (*hún*) returns to the liver,\nDoes not hear with the ears but the **essence** (*jīng*) resides in the kidneys,\nDoes not speak with the tongue but the **spirit** (*shén*) abides in the heart,\nDoes not smell with the nose but the **vital breath** (*pò*) lies in the lungs,\nDoes not move the limbs yet the **intent** (*yì*) is governed by the spleen.\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"The Five Thunders gather in clusters\"*—the *Yùshūo* (Jade Pivot) states:\n\"The eastern wind-thunder resides in the liver palace,\nThe southern fire-thunder in the heart palace,\nThe western mountain-thunder in the lung palace,\nThe northern water-thunder in the kidney palace,\nThe central earth-thunder in the spleen palace.\nSever the Five Leakages (*wúlòu*).*\n\nTo remain motionless and still,\nIs the **embodiment** (*tǐ*) of the Dao/Way.\nTo respond and flow naturally,\nIs the **application** (*yòng*) of the Dao/Way.\nThis is the marvel of the Five Thunders.\n\nThe Diagram of the Thunderbolt Devouring and Swallowing states:\nThe **worthy sages** (*xīxián*) say:\nHeaven moves, Earth is still,\nHeaven is round, Earth is square.\nThat which moves must be round,\nThat which is still must be square.\nRoundness brings transformation and fluidity,\nSquareness brings steadfastness and fixation.\nSquare as a chariot, round as its wheel—\nWhen the wheel turns, the chariot rolls;\nWhen the inner wheel moves, the outer form responds.\nThus, the marvel of the thunderbolt lies in **sitting cultivation** (*zuòyùn*).\n\nThe *Huángtíng Nèijǐng Yùjīng* (Jade Classic of the Inner Landscape of the Yellow Court) says:\n*\"The outer is square, the inner is round; the spirit dwells in the center.\"*\n\nThe *Wén Zhōngzǐ* (Master Wen of the Middle) says:\n*\"Roundness is movement, squareness is stillness—\nThis reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe *Sūnzǐ* (Sunzi) says:\n*\"Roundness brings motion, squareness brings cessation.\"*\n\nThe **Illustrations of the Daoic Principles and Their Manifestations** conclude in Volume One.\n\nThe **Illustrations of the Daoic Principles and Their Manifestations** begin in Volume Two.\n\nThe Iron Cliff Deng Dan, with orthodox compilation, illustrates the nurturing of my chapter, aspiring to the worthy teacher’s bright exposition.\n\n**The Diagram of the Dao’s Preheavenly Operation:**\nObscure and silent, dim and murky.\nThe *Guangchengzi* says:\n*\"The essence of the Ultimate Dao is dim and murky,\nThe extreme of the Ultimate Dao is obscure and silent.\nWithout sight, without hearing,\nEmbrace the Spirit in stillness—\nThen the form will naturally rectify itself.\nBe ever pure, ever still,\nDo not weary your form,\nDo not exhaust your vital essence—\nThus may you attain longevity.\"*\n\nThe *Yuanshi Shengtian Dedao Jing* says:\n*\"Inner observation of heart and mind,\nTrue qi’s inherent presence.\nPure and still, luminous and bright,\nVoid-white, radiant and dazzling.\nDim and murky, inner and outer undisturbed.\nObscure and silent, perfectly aligned with non-action.\nAncient and eternal, ever-present—\nHold fast to still contemplation.\"*\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"There exists a primal substance,\nMingled and complete, before Heaven and Earth took form.\"*\n\nMaster Fu the Great says:\n*\"A substance before Heaven and Earth,\nFormless, hidden, and tranquil.\nIt governs all phenomena,\nUnbound by the four seasons’ decay.\nThe Diagram of Self-Generated Primordial Spirit:\nNeither like you, nor like others,\nNeither like Spirit, nor like Ghost.\"*\n\nThe *Liji* says:\n*\"Clarity and purity within oneself,\nQi and will as refined as Spirit.\"*\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n*\"Flickering visions in the void we meet,\nDim murk reveals its shifting forms.\nA flash—flame ascends—\nThe True Person emerges anew.\"*\n\nThe Master of Void-Stillness says:\n*\"When the six senses are pure and still,\nThe mind’s measure clears like crystal.\nPractice this long, and you may\nCommand ghosts and gods to serve,\nSummon winds and rains—\nHow could this be trifled with?\"*\n\nThe Resplendent Resident praises:\n*\"Six senses and mind’s measure free of dust,\nLong practice reduces all to one thought’s ash.\nNot like digging a pond to await the moon—\nWhen the pond is formed, the moon comes naturally.\"*\n\nMaster Shao Kangjie says:\n*\"When a person accumulates virtue, yang increases—\nGhosts fear them.\nWhen a person accumulates vice, yin prevails—\nGhosts do not fear them.\nThe Sage harmonizes with ghosts and spirits,\nShaping their fortune or misfortune.\"*\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—\nHow vast it is!\nYou see them, yet they are unseen;\nYou hear them, yet they are unheard—\nBoundless, as if above, as if beside.\"*\n\nYang Zhu’s *Fayan* says:\n*\"The heart-spirit flickers—\nIts threads weave the ten thousand directions.\"*\n\n**The Five-Thunder Fetal Breath Diagram:**\nThe True Person Chenwang’s poem on fetal breath:\n*\"All day long you speak of empty space,\nBetter to return to the womb’s command.\nContinuous breath, the Spirit flows—\nSmoke ascends, clouds descend, misty and vast.\nThe Seven Elders of the Three Origins\nMaster this art—\nMy body neither drifts west nor east.\nOnly return to the end, not to present ruin,\nEver nurturing the subtle wind within.\"*\n\nThe world sees one thing but fails to recognize another—\nOne thought stored, another vanishes into emptiness.\n\nHixian says:\n*\"This poem appears in the Tang collection of Liu Wen’s verse; Iron Cliff Deng mistakenly attributed it to Chenwang.\nAccording to the *Book of Tang*, Liu Wen was a recluse.\nIn youth, he was reckless, a man of daring deeds,\nKilled a man in a drunken rage, fled as an outlaw,\nLater pardoned, reformed, and devoted himself to study.\nHe composed songs and poems but refused to bow to nobles,\nAlways wearing rags.\nHe returned to Qi and Lu, his end unknown.\nTruly, he was one who understood the Dao,\nThus he knew this.\"*\n\nThe world transmits the saying: *\"The Sage departs in the clouds.\"*\n\n*«The Scripture of the Supreme Middle-Yellow True Classic*» states:\n*\"The Dao of self-perfected fetal transcendence lies within—\nThe True Daoists nourish the *qi* through fetal breathing,\nRetaining and closing the True *qi* to forge fetal breath.\nThe thunderous aperture is but one orifice.\"*\n\nMaster *Bao Pu* says:\n*\"The mysterious womb’s single orifice\nIs neither the heart, nor the nose and mouth,\nNor the liver and lungs, nor the alimentary canal,\nNor the bladder, nor the *niwan* [脑海].\nKnowing this one orifice,\nThen winter solstice medicines, fire refining baths,\nAnd shedding the fetal form to solidify the body—\nAll depend upon it.\nThis is the thunderous aperture,\nAnd he who attains it\nNeed not seek the pivot of thunderous transformations elsewhere.\nThe Perfect Man employs this,\nThus he ascends with effortless might.\"*\n\nHixian says:\n*\"○ The paths of the Buddhas and Daoists are one—\nThe Great Dao holds no dual gateway.\n*Kan* [坎] is the root of life,\nWithin yin lies yang,\nAnd the interplay of True Emptiness with Marvelous Existence.\nMarvelous Existence is their essence,\nTrue Emptiness their function.\n\n*Li* [离] is the root of nature,\nWithin yang lies yin,\nAnd the interplay of Marvelous Existence with True Emptiness.\nTrue Emptiness is their essence,\nMarvelous Existence their function.\n\nWithin the Buddha lies the life-force,\nWithin the Dao lies the source of nature.\nNature and life intertwine,\nEmptiness and existence encompass all.\n\nLaozi is Śākyamuni,\nŚākyamuni is Laozi.\nBorn before the Void-age,\nHe is the progenitor of nature and life.\nOnce language arose,\nDistinct teachings emerged.\nThus, those who lean solely toward life-force\nMust fall into emptiness and ruin.\nThose who lean solely toward nature\nMust sink into darkness and decline.\n\nThis leads to divergent paths in the Great Dao,\nAnd competing heresies arise,\nYet none can ultimately grasp\nThe true source of nature and life.\n\nOur Master Confucius says:\n*'Exhaust the principles and perfect the nature,*\n*Then one attains the life-force.*\nThus, under heaven there is but one Dao,\nAnd the Sage holds but a single mind.\nNature and life cannot be parted,\nEven for a moment.'\n\nThe True Person of Jade Creek says:\n*'The ancients said: If you only clarify the True Nature but do not refine the elixir,\nEven ten thousand kalpas you must know transformation is difficult.\nIf you only exhaust the life-force but fail to grasp the True Nature,\nThis is the first illness of cultivation.\nYet once you reach this point,\nDo not hesitate to advance further.\nLike Master Zhang Ziyang’s desire to visit Dao Guang Chan,\nHe instead encountered Shi Xinglin,\nAnd thus attained the One Family of the Mysterious Essence,\nThe Two Marvels of clarity,\nAnd composed the *Restoration of Life-Force* [《复命篇》] for the world.'\n\nIn ancient times, a monk asked Zhimen [智门]:\n*'How is the essence of Prajñā?*\nZhimen replied:\n*'A clam embracing the autumn moon.'\n\n*'How is the function of Prajñā?*\nZhimen replied:\n*'A hare bearing its young.'\n\nLater, Master Xuedou composed a verse:\n*'A single void, congealed yet free of all clinging,\nFrom which all humans and gods perceive birth from emptiness.\nThe clam holds the hare of mystery deep within,\nOnce warring with the Chan school over this truth.'\n\nHan Shan’s verse says:\n*'The heart’s moon shines ever bright,\nWhat can all phenomena compare to?\nTo know the art of the Daoist elixir,\nThe original spirit within the body is the key.'\n\nHan Shan’s verse says:\n*'To benefit, preserve the essence—\nThis is called \"having benefit.\"\nTo transform, alter the form—\nThis is called \"having transformation.\"\nIf one can both benefit and transform,\nThen surely the register of the High Immortals is attained.\nIf neither benefit nor transformation is achieved,\nThen death’s calamity is inevitable.*\n\nMaster Pi Ling’s *Restoration of Life-Force* says:\n*'In my youth, I studied the Dao,\nAnd all my teachers were men of nature’s essence.\nThe Chan school’s highest attainment—\nA single insight directly transcends the Buddha’s realm.\nIf their practice is still incomplete,\nThey remain bound to birth and death.\nAs for seated transcendence or standing death,\nOr seizing the fetus to snatch the shell,\nI have never seen one achieve this in an instant.\nI often pondered how Zhongni [仲尼, Confucius]\nExhausted principles and perfected nature to attain the life-force,\nAnd how the Śākyamuni [释迦] taught\nNeither birth nor annihilation,\nWhile Laozi [老子] spoke of\nAscending and soaring with effortless might.\nThus, the Sage’s intent\nCannot be taken by a single path alone.\n\nThe secret I received from the Perfect Man was:\n*\"The progenitor of the Great Dao\nIs none other than the One *Qi* [一炁],\nFrom which all transformations arise.\"*\nUpon hearing this, I doubted not,\nFollowed the method, and indeed ascended to the Sage’s rank.*\n\nMaster Su of Yingbin says:\n*'The life-force is the marvel of nature.\nNature can still be spoken of,\nBut the life-force cannot be spoken of at all.*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Exhaust the principles and perfect the nature,\nThen one attains the life-force.\"*\nThe Sage’s study of the Dao\nMust begin with exhausting the principles,\nProgress through perfecting the nature,\nAnd culminate in restoring the life-force.\n\nMaster Huai’an Zhuzi [晦庵朱子] read the Daoist texts and composed:\n*\"In the rocky valley, I uphold steadfast virtue,\nAspiring only to the Mysterious and Void.\nOn clear nights, I rest in the hallowed chamber,\nAll day long, I study the Daoist teachings.\nThe body forgets itself, and the *qi* ascends naturally;\nThe nature is realized, and the principles leave no trace.\nThough I have not yet mastered the Dao,\nI escape the shackles of fame and reputation,\nFinding joy in the depths of my mind—\nMountains and waters cannot entertain me.\nI speak to the maddened seeker:\nYour ceaseless striving is in vain.\"*\n\nAgain, in reciting the scriptures, he composed:\n*\"Weary of the dust’s encumbrances,\nI cast them off, embracing the profound Mysterious.\nSilently unfolding the unadorned texts,\nI chant the verses of the Eastern Marvels.\nMorning and evening, a single bow—\nYears pass like a rushing stream.\nThough the world’s chaos remains,\nI rely on this to sever all ties.\"*\n\nAnd during long rains, in secluded meditation while reciting scriptures, he composed:\n*\"Residing alone, I have no affairs,\nCasually unfolding the Śākyamuni’s texts.\nTemporarily releasing the dust’s entanglements,\nI transcend with the Dao as my companion.\nThe gate is shut in the bamboo grove’s seclusion,\nBirds call in the lingering mountain rain.\nHaving grasped the Law of Non-Action,\nBody and mind rest in perfect harmony.\"*\n\n*The three poems above appear in Master Huai’an’s *Complete Works of Zhu Wen Gong* [《朱文公大全文集》].\nThe Master often upheld the orthodoxy,\nAnd benefited the world’s teachings—\nYet when he exhausted the principles and perfected the nature,\nHe was no longer constrained by such norms.\nThe three Sages’ Dao\nDiffers in function yet shares the same essence.\nConfucius taught without intention, necessity, rigidity, or ego,\nThe Śākyamuni taught without duality or exhaustion,\nLaozi taught without thought or action—\nAll three spoke of the same principle.\n\nThe Master’s poems\nDiverge in path yet converge in meaning,\nThus under heaven there is but one Dao.\nWho else but the Master’s poems\nCan both know and condemn me?\nThe diagram of the *Lo Shu* [《纵横雷霆九宫图》] says:\n\nHixian Chen says in *The Dragon Diagram* [《龙图》]:\n*\"Wear the Nine on your head and the One on your feet,\nThree to the left and Seven to the right,\nTwo and Four as shoulders,\nSix and Eight as feet.\"*\n\nHixian says:\n*\"The Nine Palaces of Thunderous Lo Shu\nAre the fifteen numbers of the *Lo Shu* arrangement.\nThe Yellow Emperor observed the River Diagram and drew the trigrams,\nWhich are based on these very numbers.\"*\n\nThe trigrams *Zhèn* (三) and *Duì* (七) combine to form the central palace’s fifty-five numbers.\nThe trigrams *Gèn* (八) and *Kūn* (二) likewise form the central palace’s fifty-five numbers.\n*Qián* (六) and *Xùn* (四) do the same.\n*Kǎn* (一) and *Lí* (九) likewise complete the fifty-five numbers of the central palace.\n\nThe marvelous applications of the *Lo Shu* arrangement all sum to fifteen,\nThus achieving the complete numbers of yin and yang.\nHence, *The Drilling of the Primordial* [《乾凿度》] states:\n*\"The strategy of Old Yang is Nine, the strategy of Old Yin is Six—\nNine and Six are the numbers of fifteen.\"*\n\nThe character *léi* (雷) is composed of fifteen strokes,\nThus it is said: *\"Yin and yang striking and clashing—this is thunder.\"*\n\n**The Diagram of Stealthy Transformation by Wuji and Guiji**\nEstablished by *Jiǎ* (甲) and *Gēng* (庚),\nBy *Bǐng* (丙), *Rén* (壬), and *Mǎo* (卯),\nBy *Zǐ* (子)—\nOnly *Wuji* (戊) and *Guiji* (癸) are included.\n\nHixian says:\n*\"The East belongs to *Jiǎ* (甲), the Wood of *Zhèn* (震),\nWhich is Spring and Thunder, generating and transforming all things.\nThe West belongs to *Gēng* (庚), the Metal of *Duì* (兑),\nWhich is Autumn and Thunderous Peals, austerely killing all things.\nThus, thunder and thunderous peals hold the authority of command,\nSpring generates, Autumn kills—\nThey are the origin of all things.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*'Heaven speaks not, yet all things prosper—\nThe year’s work is complete.'*\n\n*Bǐng* (丙) belongs to *Lí* (离), the Fire that flourishes at *Bǐngwǔ* (丙午).\nThus, it is the convergence of thunder and fire.\nWithin *Lí* (离) is emptiness—\nVague and indistinct, dim and murky.\nThe scripture says:\n*'Vague and indistinct, we meet in illusion,\nDim and murky, transformations arise—\nA flash of fire blazes forth,\nAnd the True Person emerges.'*\n\n*Rén* (壬) is subject to *Qián* (乾), the domain of thunder,\nWhere it lies dormant as the formation of thunder.\n*The Jade Pivot Thunder Scripture* [《玉枢雷书》] says:\n*'The hidden *Qián* (乾) emerges as *Xùn* (巽)—\nThis is the embodiment of the Primordial Worker.'*\n\n*Mǎo* (卯) is *Zhèn* (震), Wood as thunder,\nBorn at *Hài* (亥), flourishing at *Mǎo* (卯).\n*Mǎo* (卯) is the gate of thunder—\nOnly when the month of *Mǎo* (卯) arrives does thunder sound.\n*The Monthly Ordinances* [《月令》] says:\n*'In the second month of Spring, thunder begins to sound.'*\n\n*Zǐ* (子) is the eleventh branch, where Winter Solstice resides.\nIt is the *Earth Thunder Recovering* [《地雷复》] hexagram—\n*Kūn* (坤) above, *Zhèn* (震) below,\nWhere one yang first arises beneath five yin.\nThe yang *qi* is still faint,\nThus the shoulders are closed and still to nurture the yang.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*'The ancient kings, on the Winter Solstice, closed the gates.'*\n\nWuji (戊) and Guiji (癸) transform into fire—not as recorded in the *Five Phases* texts.\n*Kǎn* (坎) is the true essence of Heaven’s One—water.\nWithin *Kǎn* (坎) are Wuji (戊) and Guiji (癸), which generate true fire.\nThe void within governs thunder and fire,\nOverseeing the four seasons and controlling the Five Phases—\nThis is the master of thunder and thunderous peals.\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*'There is thunder and thunderous peals—\nFire within water.'*\n\n**The Diagram of Thunder and Thunderous Peals in Motion**\nThe method of summoning thunder—\nAll know to clench the fists and cover the ears.\nBut why does one clench the fists and cover the ears?\nTo grasp the root of thunder and thunderous peals,\nVigorously moving, entering through its gate,\nAnd thus unleashing wind and rain—\nThunder and lightning arise from this, not from mere exhalations.\nThe seal and flash align with the Primordial Dao’s use.\nThrough this practice, one attains the same as the parents, Zhu Sheng [朱生].\nHow could one dismiss this with ordinary, simplistic explanations?\n\nYang Zhu’s *Law of Speech* [《法言》] says:\n*'The Sage models Heaven and Earth, then applies it to the body.'*\n\nKang Zhi Shao [邵康节] says:\n*'Blowing, puffing, exhaling, and inhaling—\nSummoning wind, rain, clouds, and mist—\nTheir speech resembles thunder.'*\nHe also says:\n*'Clouds move, rain descends, lightning splits, thunder crashes—\nEach follows its kind.'*\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic* [《内经素问》] says:\n*'Wind-*qi *communicates with the liver, thunder-*qi *with the heart, rain-*qi *with the kidneys.\nClear yang is Heaven, turbid yin is Earth.\nEarth-*qi *ascends as clouds, Heaven-*qi *descends as rain.\nRain emerges from Earth-*qi*, clouds from Heaven-*qi*.'*\n\n**The Diagram of the Five Sons Returning to Gēng (庚)**\nThe Most High Sovereign Lord obtained the *Nine-Five* Dao,\nAnd the Emperor of Thunder obtained the *Nine-Five* Dao—\nFrom the North to the East, only *Zǐ* (子) is included,\nAll of which are yang paths.\nThus, it governs Heaven,\nNurtures and withers all things,\nGives rise to and extinguishes the four seasons.\nThe Five Thunder Lords obtain the *Three-Five* Dao,\nWhich does not differ from the *Nine-Five*—\nAll are the Dao of thunder and thunderous peals.\n\nHixian says:\n*'The Five Sons returning to Gēng (庚)—\nOne, Three, Five, Seven, Nine are all yang numbers,\nCombined, they make twenty-five—\nThus the *Classic of Changes* says: \"Heaven’s numbers are twenty-five.\"\nThe Five Sons returning to Gēng (庚) are the sovereign rulers of all things.\nFrom the East, *Rénzǐ* (壬子) returns to Gēng (庚)—\nThis is the Nine number.\nFrom the North, *Bǐngzǐ* (丙子) returns to Gēng (庚)—\nThis is the Five number.\nFrom the South, *Wùzǐ* (戊子) returns to Gēng (庚)—\nThis is the Three number.\nFrom the West, *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) returns to Gēng (庚)—\nThis is the Seven number.\nFrom the Center, *Gēngzǐ* (庚子) returns to Gēng (庚)—\nThis is the One number.\nThus, the true numbers of Heaven are obtained—\nThis is the Dao of thunder and thunderous peals.'*\n\n**The Diagram of the Great Unfolding’s Numbers**\nThunder and thunderous peals obtain the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nThus they are called the Five Thunders.\nThe Dao scriptures say:\n*'East Three, South Two—together they make Five;\nNorth One, West Four—together they make Nine.\nWuji (戊) and Jǐ (己) return to their original generating numbers,\nThe Three Families meet to form the Infant.'*\nOnce the Sacred Embryo is formed,\nIt becomes the Five Thunder Lords.\n\nOne, Three, Five, Seven, Nine—these are the yang odd numbers.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*'Heaven’s numbers are Two, Four, Six, Eight, Ten—\nThe yin even numbers,\nAnd Earth’s numbers are thirty.'*\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five—\nThe complete numbers of yin and yang are achieved.\n\nThe Great Unfolding’s fifty numbers,\nSubtracting Five leaves the Five Phases’ roots.\nTheir use in forty-nine,\nAgain subtracting One symbolizes the immovable *Tai Ji*.\n\nLiu Mu’s *Hooked and Hidden* [《钩隐》] says:\n*'One combined with Five makes Six,\nTwo combined with Five makes Seven,\nThree combined with Five makes Eight,\nFour combined with Five makes Nine,\nFive combined with Five makes Ten.\nOne and Six are Water,\nTwo and Seven are Fire,\nThree and Eight are Wood,\nFour and Nine are Metal,\nFive and Ten are Earth—\nThis is the Five-Five.'*\n\nYang Xiong’s *Great Mystery* [《太玄》] says:\n*'One and Six share the same origin,\nTwo and Seven are companions,\nThree and Eight are friends,\nFour and Nine follow the same path,\nFive and Ten guard each other.'*\n\nChen Xiqí said:\nThe Great Unfolding’s numbers—forty-nine in use, while One is suspended and unused—its meaning.\nScholars merely know that One symbolizes the immovable *Tai Ji*, yet they fail to grasp its true significance.\nWhy? Because One is the fundamental root of all numbers.\nAll things’ principles: without a root, they are disordered; with a root, they must not be overused, for overuse brings chaos again.\nTake, for instance, the motion of a cart—when its axle is centered, it stops.\nOr a chariot’s wheels—when they are large, they move.\nLike a net’s central cord, which is drawn taut.\nLike a vessel’s handle, which is grasped.\nLike the sovereign’s authority, with hands and feet acting beneath.\nLike a general commanding from the center, with soldiers obeying.\nLike the Sage-Emperor’s non-action, while ministers act.\nLike the wise being honored, while the capable are employed—\nThus, all who grasp One are its root, its foundation, its master.\nAll possess the unchanging principle of unity; if moved, the rest fall into disorder.\n\nYichuan Chengzi said:\nThe Great Unfolding’s numbers total fifty.\nNumbers begin at One and complete at Five; the lesser Unfolding forms Ten, while the greater Unfolding makes fifty.\nWhen fifty is complete, it is immovable, hence One is subtracted for use.\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty, with five completing their transformations and animating the spirits.\n*Transformations* refer to function; *spirits* refer to application.\n*King Fang’s I Ching* states:\nFifty refers to the ten solar terms, twelve earthly branches, and twenty-eight lunar mansions.\nOf the fifty, the unused One is the Heavenly *qi*’s birth.\n\nZheng Xuan said:\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth are harmonized through the Five Phases’ *qi*.\nThe Five Phases each contain five; the Great Unfolding subtracts one, thus using forty-nine.\nThe Five Phases’ *qi* harmonized refers to the ten solar terms, twelve lunar tones, and twenty-eight lunar mansions—through which the Five Phases’ *qi* flows.\nFifty-five in total, subtracting five yields the Great Unfolding; again subtracting One gives forty-nine.\nThis doctrine originates from *The Buhrst Degrees*, aligning with King Fang’s view, though the Five Phases’ harmonized *qi* is even more refined.\n\n*Guanzi’s I Ching* states:\nZhang Yi asked: The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five; yet you say fifty, then subtract One—what does this mean?\nGuanzi replied: The *shu* divination stalks do not merely imitate Heaven and Earth; the Five Phases must operate within them.\n\nZhao Shuo said:\nIts use of forty-nine—\nThe Great Unfolding is inexhaustible.\nThe subtraction of One demonstrates its inexhaustibility.\n\n---\n**Five Phases Inversion Diagram**\nWhen the Five Phases are disordered, the tiger walks in water.\n**Five Phases Inversion Technique**\nThe dragon emerges from fire’s embrace.\n\nZhongyang Zhang Zhenren said:\nThe Five Phases inverted—\nThe elixir body ever refined.\nShi Chen Wang Zhenren said:\nLinked cycles, sequential transformations—\nThe Five Phases’ essence is inversion.\nMaster the intent of inversion within,\nAnd thunderbolts strike from azure dawn.\n\n*Inversion* refers to reversing the Five Phases,\nHarmonizing the Four Symbols,\nExtracting the undifferentiated *qi* of the Primordial Void,\nSeizing the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union,\nEntering the Yellow Chamber,\nAnd birthing the supreme treasure—\nThus, formless gives rise to form,\nThe body beyond the body.\nWhen virtue and merit are complete,\nAscension to the Celestial Immortal is attained.\n\n*Order* is humanity’s great principle:\nDividing *jing* and *qi* to form the body,\n*Qi* becomes matter, wandering spirits transform—\nWith a body comes suffering;\nTribulations arise from here.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\nIf one seeks inversion in daily life,\nEven the earth’s dust becomes treasure.\n\n---\n**Thunderbolt Transformation Diagram**\n**Thunder**\nYin and Yang clash, forming thunder by law.\n**Lightning**\nYin and Yang congeal, surging into lightning.\n**Wind**\nYin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.\n**Cloud**\nYin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.\n**Snow**\nYin excessive, Yang deficient—clouds gather.\n**Rain**\nYin and Yang ascending and descending—steamed into rain.\n**Frost**\nYin oppressive, Yang collapsing—frost flies.\n**Dew**\nYang flourishing, Yin dispersing—dew spreads faintly.\n**Fog**\nAscending and descending fail—fog forms.\n**Hail**\nYin and Yang stagnant—hail congeals.\n**Rainbow**\nExcess water becomes rainbow.\n**Drought**\nExcess fire becomes drought.\n\n**Thunderbolt Essence and Function Ode**\nHeaven and Earth’s void center ever open,\nOnly when dynamic stillness splits into Yin and Yang.\nLife and death, opening and closing—\nAll inverted, the Dipper’s pivot steadfast.\nThunder’s clash erupts from the earth,\nLightning’s glow flashes golden.\nWind drifts, weak or strong, rising with time,\nStrong or weak, clouds gather short or long.\nAscending and descending, steaming rain descends,\nSoft snow falls on the silver hall.\nFrost flies, oppressive Yin collapses—\nYang flourishing, dew scatters far.\nWhen ascending and descending fail, fog forms;\nStagnant Yin, hail—no Yang.\nExcess water becomes mirage, excess fire becomes drought.\nHarmonized and balanced, all things flourish.\nStillness, divine wind—Heaven’s *qi* bright,\nAscending yet unrising—eternal truth.\nRaging winds, sudden rains—Yin and Yang dance,\nWinter warmth like summer’s heat, summer’s chill like winter’s frost.\nProlonged rain, endless drought—floods surge,\nThunder crashes in the tenth month, summer frost flies.\nSelf-crafted transformation unites Heaven and Earth,\nYet those who fail to grasp the pivot merely measure.\n\n*The Soul Treasure’s Complete Methods* states:\nEarth’s *qi* ascends, becoming cloud, dispersing as rain.\nHeaven’s *qi* descends, dispersing as fog, congealing as dew.\nExcessive Yin turns dew to frost, rain to snow.\nExcessive Yang turns fog to mist, clouds to mist-haze.\nYin concealing Yang—Yang’s *qi* unchecked—\nClashing, it births thunderbolts.\nYang concealing Yin—Yang’s *qi* uncoalesced—\nFirmly solidifying, it forms hail and sleet.\nYin and Yang unaligned—\nLightning strikes.\nYin and Yang mismatched—\nThe dragon transforms into rainbow.\n\nKangjie Shaozi said:\nYang obtains Yin and becomes rain;\nYin obtains Yang and becomes wind;\nThe firm obtains the yielding and becomes cloud;\nThe yielding obtains the firm and becomes thunder.\n\nThere is no Yin without the ability to become rain,\nNor no Yang without the ability to produce thunder.\n\nRain is yielding, yet belongs to Yin;\nYin cannot stand alone,\nThus it awaits Yang before it rises.\nThunder is firm, belonging to Yang;\nYang cannot act by itself,\nAnd must await Yin before it erupts.\n\n*The Treatise on Heaven and Earth’s Divine Interaction* states:\nWhen Yin accumulates excessively, it turns dew to frost,\nAnd rain to snow.\nWhen Yang accumulates excessively, it turns fog to mist,\nAnd clouds to mist-haze.\nWhen Yin conceals Yang within,\nThunderbolts arise.\nWhen Yang conceals Yin within,\nIt solidifies and births hail and sleet.\nWhen Yin and Yang are unbalanced,\nTheir chaotic interaction produces the rainbow.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\nThe Great Block exhales *qi*—its name is Wind,\nWhich is the state of no action.\nWhen it acts, all openings roar with fury.\n\nXīyí [Kangjie Shaozi] says:\nWhen *Zhen* obtains the initial line of *Qián* [Heaven],\nThunder erupts from beneath Heaven.\nObserving the *Duì* [Lake] hexagram reveals\nRain emerges from the Earth.\nAgain, it says: Heaven’s *qi* descends as rain.\nAgain: *Kǎn* [Abyss] is Heaven, Water, and *qi*.\nThe *Kǎn* well is its manifestation.\n*Duì* [Lake] is Earth’s Water, its form,\nAnd now rain is its embodiment.\nOne Yang descending into two Yin forms *Kǎn*;\nThe *qi* of *Kǎn* subtly permeates all things,\nAs the foundation for receiving the Mandate.\nThus it is said: \"None moisten things like Water.\"\n*Yáng* [Yang] *qi* ascends upright,\nYet suddenly meets Yin *qi*—\nThey clash and descend as rain.\nFor Yang *qi* is light, Yin *qi* is heavy;\nThus Yang is pressed down by Yin *qi* and falls as rain.\n\nYin *qi* ascends upright,\nYet suddenly meets Yang *qi*—\nIt aids its flight and becomes cloud.\nWhen Yin *qi* congeals and Yang is trapped within,\nIt lashes out and becomes thunderbolts.\nWhen Yang *qi* is concealed within Yin’s depths,\nIt erupts violently as thunder.\nWhen Yang remains outside and cannot enter,\nIt circles endlessly and becomes Wind.\nWhen Yin *qi* congeals within,\nAnd Yang *qi* seeks to enter but cannot,\nIt swirls around externally without rest,\nAnd becomes the arrival of Wind,\nDispersing Yin *qi* until it ceases.\nWhen harmony and dispersion occur,\nIt becomes frost, snow, rain, and dew.\nWhen there is no harmony in dispersion,\nIt becomes *lì* [perverse] *qi* mingling with haze.\nHail, perverse *qi* in flight,\nAnd the yellow mists of *mái* [filth],\nAll are Yin and Yang’s twisted, unbalanced *qi*,\nThus hailstones are foul and turbid—\nOr green and black in hue.\n\nHuì’ān [Zhu Xi] says:\nThe snowflake’s six-pointed form arises\nWhen sleet is struck by fierce winds, forming prismatic petals.\nAgain: Six is the number of Yin,\nThe *Tài Yīn* [Great Yin] *Xuán Jīng* [Mysterious Essence] stone is also six-edged,\nThis is Nature’s inherent number.\nAgain: The dragon [rainbow] is a waterly phenomenon;\nWhen it emerges and mingles with Yang *qi*,\nIt condenses and forms rain.\nBut ordinary rain is simply\nThe result of Yin and Yang *qi* condensing and rising—\nNot necessarily requiring the dragon’s intervention.\nIt is merely the lower *qi* ascending,\nNot yet forming rain.\nOnly when the upper *qi* is overwhelming,\nWith no outlet for release,\nCan it truly become rain.\n\nHuánxī [Wu Zhi] says:\nWind follows the *Xùn* [Wind] trigram—this is fixed.\nYet how does Wind possess *qi*?\nThe lower four lines represent the *Kǎn* [Abyss] hexagram.\nThe fifth line above is *Lǐ* [Fire].\nWhen water enters fire, they agitate and produce *qi*.\nPushing this to the smallest of things,\nA ladle of water extinguishes fire,\nYet fire rages and *qi* ascends.\nHow much more so for the vast *qi* of *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*?\nFire’s joy is subtle in sound,\nYet fierce in *qi*.\nAt the side of cascading torrents and surging rapids,\nWhen the sound is **□** [missing character],\nThe *qi* becomes chilling and cold;\nThe accumulation of subtle forces\nCondenses into Wind—\nThus water and fire become Wind.\nIndeed.\n\nThe warm Wind arises in the months of *Bǐng* [3rd] and *Dīng* [4th],\nWhile the *Jì* [typhoon] Wind arises from the sea’s *lù* [dew].\nThis is not only thunder raging with sound,\nFor all openings roar in fury—\nWind does so as well.\nWhen *qi* is stored to its extreme and dormant,\nYet released after long suppression,\nIt becomes thunder.\nConstant release prevents extreme storage;\nWithout extreme storage,\nIt becomes Wind.\nAll things that rage eternally\nAre not solely water-driven.\n\n*The Daoist Law of Principles: Diagram and Extended Commentary* concludes below.",

      "translated_text": "**Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings**\n*Scripture Title: Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings (Zhou Yan Yi).*\n*Deng Ge (Iron Cliff Master) compiled the illustrations; Zhang Xi’an (Chapter of the Hopeful Sage) extended the meanings.*\n*Two volumes.*\n*Source of the base text: The *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon) in its primary section.*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings***\n\n*\"Nurturing the Way\"* unites the Three Families as one—though the Dao/Way cannot be depicted, if one seeks its essence, the Dao/Way is not distant from mortals; it is attainable through personal cultivation. It is not a matter of guessing the key or hearing the bell to mark the day. Let scholars strive earnestly.\n\nIn the second year of *Zhidà* (Great Virtue), the thirty-eighth Patriarch of the Celestial Masters, Guangwei Zi, inscribed this work.\n\nThe Dao/Way says: *\"I do not know its name; forcefully named, it is called Dao/Way.\"* Since the Dao/Way has no name, how can it be described? If one seeks its essence, even eight thousand volumes would not be excessive.\n\nIron Cliff Master Deng lamented the Dao/Way’s decline and pitied the common folk’s superficial understanding. He compiled all its symbols into *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated*.\n\nAh! How vast his heart was!\n\nWhen the *Longhu* (Dragon Tiger) edition was published, reading it was like gazing into the boundless expanse.\n\nThe Hopeful Sage (Zhang Xi’an) did not shame the common or the wise—he had long aspired to elucidate the subtle teachings of the Three Families. Later, through inquiry and reflection, as if awakened from a distant void, he fulfilled his original intent.\n\nMoreover, since the dawn of antiquity, the true essence has not been revealed, though its symbols exist. Yet its nature and alignment with the cosmic Dao/Way remain beyond mortal comprehension. As Master Su said: *\"The Dao/Way cannot be spoken of; all that can be spoken of are mere semblances.\"* This book is also such a semblance.\n\nThus, the enlightened discern the true essence through its semblances, while the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into deception. I hope those who share my aspiration will likewise recognize the true through the semblances.\n\nThose who seek to illuminate the Dao/Way need not examine this work. But to gaze at empty flowers or grasp at reflections in water—this is not my wish.\n\nOn the *Jǐhài* (Great Virtue) day of the second year of *Zhidà*, Zhang Xi’an of Linchuan inscribed this at the Nurturing the Way Hall.\n\nThe Dao/Way is vast and boundless; its subtleties are profound and replete with mystery. Hence, the Dao/Way is expounded through its laws, the laws are illustrated through images, the images are revealed through visions, the visions are rendered in the mysterious, and the mysterious is further refined—emptiness and marvelousness permeate the One.\n\nZhang Jun of Nurturing the Way, beyond the confines of secular governance, amidst the realms of misty peaks and flowing waters, renews himself through harmony with nature, ever-transforming without limit. Is this not the work of the creative Dao/Way itself, its merit and practice manifesting thus?\n\nNow, to compose this preface, I have taken from the Daoist Canon a single resolution, to verify and praise the sublime mysteries of the high Dao/Way.\n\nIn autumn of the year *Jiāchén* (Jia Chen), Xūngxuán Zi (Empty Mysteries) respectfully inscribed this.\n\n*Xūngxuán Zi* is of the Wang clan, given name *Wànqǐng*, courtesy name *Qīngbó*, a native of Linchuan. Born into a noble household, he took the Daoist path as a *Huángguān* (Yellow Crown), adopting the title *Yàoshān* (Herb Mountain). He consorted with Dao Mountain Master Xu Shùnsūn, traversing sacred peaks, and eventually retired into seclusion beneath the woods.\n\nSometimes he sat atop towering pines, sometimes in modest chambers, while others secretly observed him murmuring to himself—when they left, he ceased. Others sought his writings, and he would speak at length or concisely, yet compose a thousand words in an instant.\n\nDuring the era of *Zhidà*, Dao Mountain Master Xu passed away at the *Longxīng Xiāoshè* (Dragon’s Rest Hermitage) on the 14th day of the 11th month of the year *Dàwùshēn*. His disciples, when summoned by his portrait, composed an elegy and departed. He then revived, sat upright, and wrote: *\"Residing in Herb Mountain’s generosity, emulating the lofty spirit of Dao Mountain.\"* Such was his Dao/Way.\n\nAt the *Língyān* (Nebulous Chamber) records, this was not the true account—his Dao/Way was within himself, a single breath of wind and moon. He cast aside his brush and laughed heartily before departing again.\n\nIn autumn of the year *Zìshùn Gēngwǔ* (Cultivating Virtue Geng Wu), Zhang Línshū of Linchuan said: *\"A humble servant entered Fujian and saw him.\"* Cai Zhìfū of *Shàowǔ* (Shao Wu) also said: *\"A traveler in straw hat and gourd bag spoke of encountering him in Wuyi.\"*\n\nNiè Jìng’ān of *Jiāhé* (Jia He) said: *\"The Dragon Tiger saw the golden *Tuó* (Dharma) head and inquired of him, saying that he would soon appear in Wuyi.\"*\n\nHence, Mencius said: *\"Where he passes, transformation occurs; where he dwells, the divine manifests.\"* This is the very Dao/Way.\n\nAh! Who but a great man could attain this?\n\nZhang Xi’an, who studied in Linchuan, elaborated.\n\n---\n\n**Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings – Volume One**\n\n**Illustrations of the Primordial Dao/Way of the Original Ancestor**\n\nThe Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way (*Yuánshǐ Zǔjié*) gave birth to all the celestial realms. He illuminated the Three Landscapes (*Sǎnjǐng*), which became the celestial foundation (*Tiāngēn*). Extended Meanings:\n\nThe *Taishang Dùrén Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Sage on Deliverance) states: *\"The Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way gave birth to all the celestial realms, illuminated the Three Landscapes, which became the celestial foundation—above him, there was no further ancestor, only the Dao/Way as his form.\"*\n\nThe Daoist texts say: *\"One *qi* divided into three *qi*; the three *qi* each formed a palace.\"* At the dawn of the *Longhàn* (Dragon Han) era, the *Xuánqì* (Mysterious *qi*) coalesced into the *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Chīmíng* (Vermilion Brightness) era, the *Yuánqì* (Primordial *qi*) coalesced into the *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Shànghuáng* (Supreme Sovereign) era, the *Shǐqì* (Original *qi*) coalesced into the *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) Palace.\n\nThe *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Saints (*Jiǔshèng*) dwell. The *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Worthies (*Jiǔzhēn*) reside. The *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Immortals (*Jiǔxiān*) abide. The three heavens governed by the Three Purity realms, comprising thirty-six heavens, are called the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven). These thirty-six heavens are distributed across the Four Extremities (*Sìjí*), each extremity containing nine heavens.\n\nBelow the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) lies the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven). In total, there are four such heavens, and they are categorized into four kinds of celestial beings and heavens.\n\nAbove the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) is the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven), and above the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) are the Three Purity realms. These celestial realms are all from prior *jié* (kalpas/epochs) where beings cultivated the true essence (*xiūzhēn*). When they merged with the Dao/Way in truth, they gathered to form shape and dispersed to become *qi*—naturally merging and dispersing without fixed form or appearance, spanning countless *jié* (kalpas/epochs), never falling back or degenerating.\n\nBelow the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) lies the *Wúsè Jiè* (Formless Realm), beneath which is the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm), and beneath the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm) is the *Yù Jiè* (Desire Realm). The Desire Realm contains six heavens; the Form Realm contains eighteen heavens; the Formless Realm contains four heavens—totaling twenty-eight heavens in the Three Realms (*Sānjiè*).\n\nHumans who accumulate virtuous deeds may be reborn in the Desire Realm heavens, becoming either celestial sovereigns (*Tiānzhǔ*), celestial beings (*Tiānrén*), or celestial multitudes (*Tiānzhòng).*",

      "translated_text": "The beings of the Desire Realm still harbor desires and thoughts; without desires and thoughts, they ascend to the Form Realm. The beings of the Form Realm still cling to colored perceptions; without colored perceptions, they ascend to the Formless Realm. The beings of the Formless Realm still retain the thought of awareness; without the thought of awareness, they ascend to the Great Dharma Heaven, thus emerging beyond the Three Realms.\n\nThe twenty-eight heavens of the Three Realms dwell in the four directions, each direction containing seven heavens—known as the **Eight Circles** (*Bāyuán*), also called the **Four Great Brahmā Small Rāga Heavens** (*Sìfàn Xiǎoluó Tiān*).\n\nMere mortals with virtuous deeds and high merit may ascend to the Three Realms’ heavens but remain there. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they no longer cultivate virtue, they fall back and degenerate, hence the varying lifespans of each.\n\nWithin the **Six Paths** (*Liùdào*), the **Path of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*) refers to these Three Realms’ heavens. The beings of the Three Realms’ heavens—should even a single thought stray from truth—descend from higher immortals to lower ones, and if lower immortals fail to progress further, they return to the human path, known as **degeneration** (*Tuìduò*).\n\nBefore the **空洞** (*Kōngdòng*, Void of Emptiness), the *qi* mother was in chaotic unity—unforced, it is **truth** (*zhēn*); undual, it is **refinement** (*jīng*); unobscured, it is **awareness** (*jué*); unmeasurable, it is **divinity** (*shén*).\n\nWho is pure, who is turbid? Who is mundane, who is sage? Who is short-lived, who is long? Who is demonic, who is orthodox? The lightest *qi* gives rise to the heavy, and the heavy forms the light; thus, the high and low take shape. The lower ascends, the higher descends, as water and fire transmit essence—so there are sun and moon, and day and night govern the light.\n\nOne and two form the sovereign; three *qi* refine into subtle *qi* (*wéi*), three subtle *qi* coalesce into the **Three Augments** (*Sānhòu*), and three augments establish the **Three Festivals** (*Sānjié*). The Great Bright culminates in the beginning, and five and six cycle eternally. The sun moves from the left, while the stars align from the right, circulating through the **Six Void Points** (*Liùxū*). Thus, new phases arise, yielding and firmness alternate, and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*) are firmly set.\n\nIn the boundless void, the **Three Pure Ones** (*Sānqīng*) dwell. None know its origin, yet they name it **Primordial** (*yuán*). None know its beginning, yet they call it **First** (*shǐ*). None know its vastness, yet they term it **Great** (*tài*). None know its summit, yet they label it **Highest** (*shàng*). Lofty yet without end, it is called **Venerable** (*zūn*). Hosting yet without self, it is called **Lord** (*jūn*).\n\nIt can be empty or full, singular or myriad. It manifests all heavens, completes all worlds. Within it lies the **Mystic Mountain** (*Miàoshān*), called **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*). The four directions are established, the eight directions divided, and the **Thirty-Two Sovereigns** (*Sānshíèr Dì*) reside in the jeweled palaces.\n\nThe **Big Dipper** (*Dǒu*), **Net** (*Jī*), **Horn** (*Jié*), and **Weighing Scale** (*Gé*) align; the **Well** (*Jǐng*), **Parameter** (*Shēn*), **Pivot** (*Kuí*), and **Wall** (*Bì*) form constellations; the **Vanguard** (*Kuí*) upholds the **Pole** (*Gāng*), and the **Five Convergences** (*Wǔhé*) create celestial motion. The finest hairs and smallest particles flow with the Dao, boundless in their vastness. The **Effulgent Minor** (*Tàishǎo*) fills the void, and the **Great Void** (*Hún*) is sealed.\n\nWhen the **perverse *qi*** (*xiéqì*) loses its origin, it scatters into all living beings. Through their **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiào*), emotions and cognition arise. Emotions flow, cognition obscures, and beings twist and turn in confusion. From this flow, **attachment** (*ài*) arises; obscured by attachment, **aversion** (*zēng*) takes form. Aversion and attachment clash, one surges forward while the other lingers behind. Abandoning clarity for darkness, they accumulate darkness into **yin** (*yīn*). Yin congeals into **obscurity** (*yōu*), and entering obscurity, they become **ghosts** (*guǐ*). Extending into human form, branching into other paths—devouring, oppressing, and dominating one another in strength. Their nature cannot be stilled, and their lifespan cannot be prolonged.\n\nThe **Black *qi*** (*hēiqì*) darkens like a shroud, defiling the celestial heights. The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Three Heavenly Sovereigns** (*Sāntiān Dìjūn*), survey from below, and in a single moment of compassion, the **subtle *qi* of mercy** (*miàoshén*) naturally weaves into patterns. The **Spirit Wind** (*Língfēng*) stirs and plays, forming sounds of its own. With boundless compassion, they deliver from suffering; with boundless benevolence, they cherish life. With boundless orthodoxy, they crush evil; with boundless clarity, they break through darkness.\n\nAbove, they arrange the **palaces and offices** (*gōngcáo*); below, they establish the **mountains and altars** (*yuèdú*). The **multitude of immortals** (*Zhōngzhēn*) divide their duties, and the **ranked sages** (*Lièxiān*) manage their affairs. When the **true mechanism** (*zhēnjī*) leaks, the **Jade Scriptures** (*Yùzì*) emerge. Fire refines the **Sun Cavern** (*Dòngyáng*), and the pen records the **Void Blue** (*Kōngqīng*). The **Jade Registers** (*Yùjiǎn*) and **Golden Tablets** (*Jīnbǎn*) inscribe talismans and spells, teaching the **myriad immortals** (*Zhōngxiān*) while commanding the **demonic hosts** (*móqún*). They purify and refine **souls and spirits** (*húnpò*), and summon the **ten thousand spirits** (*wànlíng*).\n\nThe **Mixed Primordial Transformation** (*Húnyuán Huàshēn*)—Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty’s inscription reads:\n*\"Great is the Supreme Dao! Effortless, natural.\nFrom kalpa’s end to its beginning, it precedes earth and heaven.\nEncompassing light in silent stillness, it endures through endless kalpas.\nIn the East, it is taught by Confucius; in the West, it appears as the Golden Sage.\nAll hundred kings take its principles, and all successive sages transmit its mysteries.\nIt is the origin of all teachings, the deepest of the profound.\"*\n\nThe **Praise of Preceptor Yán Rúrú** (*Rúrú Yán Jūshì Yùlù*) says:\n*\"Life begins with no origin, and generations follow the Zhou kings.\nIts transformed body reappears, and Śākyamuni pays homage,\nstill hearing the Master’s voice—\nthe teacher of the eighty-one thousand heavens,\nthe guide of countless kalpas.\"*\n\nThe **Tàixuān Jīng** (*Tàixuān Jīng*) states:\n*\"The Supreme Old Lord possesses myriad transformed bodies,\nsetting teachings according to regions,\nestablishing names by divine opportunity,\nuniversally saving all beings—\neach day descending its traces,\neach age as the sovereign teacher.\"*\n\nThe **Wise Scholar** (*Xīxián*) cites the *Lotus Sutra* (*Fǎhuá Jīng*):\n*\"All Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,\nappear in the world solely for one great matter—\nthe cause and condition of dharma.\nThey share the same Dao.\"*\n\nThe *Family Sayings* (*Jiālǔ*) record:\n*\"Confucius told Nángōng Jìngshū:\n'I have heard that the Old Guest knows the ancient and the present,\ngrasps the origins of rites and music,\nand clarifies the return of virtue and Dao—\nthen he is my teacher. I will go to him now.'\nJìngshū accompanied him to the Zhou.\nAfter asking about rites from the Old Sage,\nthey returned to Lu,\nand the Dao became even more revered.\nEven from distant lands, the disciples who came\nnumbered in the thousands.'*\n\n**Ge Xianshū** (*Gě Xiānshū*)’s preface to the *Daodejing* (*Dàodé Jīng*) says:\n*\"The Old Master embodies the effortless naturalness of the Dao,\nborn before the Great Primordial,\narising from no cause,\npassing through the end and beginning of heaven and earth,\nineffable and beyond description,\nending without end,\nexhausting the boundless,\nreaching the limitless—\nthus, it is the **Limitless** (*Wújí*).'*\n\n**Master Shāng of the Song Mountain School** (*Shāng Shānxiānshì*) in *Zhēngjīn Jí* (*Zhēngjīn Jí*) writes:\n*\"What the Old Master speaks of is the Great Dao.\nThus, Confucius on rites says:\n'I have heard it from the Old Sage.'\nThe *Great Rites* (*Lǐyùn*) state:\n'The Great Dao’s practice aligns with the heroes of the Three Dynasties.\nThough I did not attain it, I aspired to it.'\nThe *Book of Changes* (*Yì*) says:\n'The movement of all under heaven is governed by the **Unchanging One** (*zhēnyī*).'\nYet the *Laozi* (*Lǎozǐ*) says:\n'Kings and lords who grasp the One\nuse it to govern all under heaven.'\nExamining the principle of **non-thought, non-action** (*wú sī wú wéi*)\nand the theory of **yin-yang transformation** (*yīnyáng biànhuà*),\nhow can these two texts not both be true?\nIf one insists the Old Sage is wrong,\nthen the *Yì* and the *Great Rites* must be burned!\"*",

      "translated_text": "The learned scholars of old who delighted in debate—who could surpass Mencius? In Mencius’ time, Laozi’s text had already been in circulation for over a hundred years. Yet Zhuangzi lived contemporaneously with Mencius, and if his ideas could be refuted, then Mencius had already done so. Why wait for later Confucian scholars to argue it?\n\nSima Qian remarked: \"The Dao of Laozi is concise and easy, requiring little effort yet yielding great results.\" Some Confucians, however, disagreed, criticizing the prioritization of Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings over the Six Classics—this was not his intent. When Sima Qian composed *Records of the Grand Historian*, he gave Confucius a *shìjiā* (biography of his descendants) and Laozi a *lièzhuàn* (separate account). Was this not to honor Laozi? Rather, it was because Laozi’s Dao was the root of Confucianism, and to honor its origin was to exalt its foundation.\n\nThe *Records* further states: \"The Daoist school makes the spirit unified, its movements harmonizing with the formless, its simplicity sufficient for all things.\" The *Book of Han* says: \"The Daoists grasp the essential and hold fast to the root, maintaining purity and emptiness to preserve themselves, adopting humility and weakness to govern—this is the art of the sovereign ruling from the south-facing seat.\"\n\nMaster Chen of Lingxi’s *Guan Shi Ping* notes: \"When Emperor Wu of Han abandoned Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings in favor of Confucianism, he established the Imperial University, conducted sacrifices, standardized calendars and measurements, harmonized music and poetry, and instituted mountain-altar rituals for the gods. The brilliance of his Confucian governance is evident. Yet with so many troubles in the realm, the ruler’s mind unsettled, his relentless reforms exhausted the people—taxation halved the population, wars burned without cease, and filial piety faltered. Though his edicts claimed to stem from *rén* and *yì*, their effects scarcely differed from those of Qin Shihuang. At such times, the land knew no peace, and the people longed for the return of Wen and Jing. Thus, the Yellow Emperor-Laozi principle of *qīngjìng* (tranquility) was hardly detrimental to the realm.\n\nOur Confucian scholars must insist on *this* being right and *that* wrong. Why not, instead of praising Wu and condemning Wen and Jing, take the best from both?\"\n\nHan Yu of Changli’s *Strategic Questions for the Imperial Examination* states: \"Confucius too had a teacher—he inquired about rites from Lao Dan. Today’s people fall far short of Confucius’ wisdom, and worse, they have no teacher. Yet if they do not study, how can their scholarship flourish or their virtue be complete?\" (From *Collected Works*, Volume 14.)\n\nMaster Xie of Die Mountain says: *\"The Dao De Jing* reveals the mind of Heaven above, and its teachings have never been without benefit to the world’s order.\n\nThe *Rei T’ung Tu* (Diagram of Mutual Thunder) depicts the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang—rising and descending, responding in harmony.\n\nThe *Golden Edicts* state: \"Heaven and Earth, pure and turbid, in essence like an egg—one thing within the Great Void. Yang ascends to Heaven, generating yin from the *Tàijí*, which embraces yang and descends in obscurity. Yin descends to Earth, generating yang from the *Tàijí*, which carries yin and ascends in hazy form. This rising and descending aligns with Heaven and Earth’s movement, giving rise to all things.\n\nMaster Zhou of Lúxī says: \"From *wújí* emerges *tàijí*; *tàijí* moves and generates yang. At its peak of motion, it stirs to stillness; at its peak of stillness, it generates yin, then stirs again. This dynamic and static interplay forms their mutual root.\"\n\nMaster Zhu of Huì’ān says: \"Yin takes yang as its substance, yang takes yin as its substance. Water is bright within yet dark without; fire is dark within yet bright without.\" Master Zhang of Hèngqú says: \"The essences of yin and yang interpenetrate their domains—this is the very meaning.\"\n\n*The True Origin* states: \"The rising and falling of yin and yang within Heaven and Earth mirror the interplay of heart and kidney in human physiology.\"\n\n*The Jade Book* says: \"Yang bears yin upward, yin embraces yang downward. This rising and falling circulates through the Dao, ensuring Heaven’s longevity and Earth’s endurance.\"\n\nThe *Rei T’ung Tu* serves as the pivot of Heaven—its nature is benevolent, its domain is life, its essence is yang, its form is yin. Thus, *jiǎ* (甲), *gēng* (庚), *rén* (壬) are yang-thunder. It acts as the mechanism of Earth—its nature is malevolent, its domain is destruction, its essence is yin, its form is yang. Thus, *yǐ* (乙), *xīn* (辛), *dīng* (丁), *guǐ* (癸) are yin-thunder.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"When yin and yang move askew, Heaven and Earth are shaken—thunder and lightning erupt, fire burns within the waters, and the Great Block is consumed.\"\n\n*The Huainanzi* states: \"When yin and yang clash, they generate thunder; when they clash violently, they produce lightning.\"\n\nThe *Golden Edicts* say: \"Within yin, yang is concealed; if yang-qi does not descend, it strikes and produces thunder and lightning.\"\n\nMaster Zhang of Hèngqú says: \"When yin-qi condenses, the enclosed yang cannot escape—it erupts as lightning. When yang-qi is trapped within yin-qi and cannot emerge, it explodes as thunder.\"\n\nMaster Hào of Huánxī’s *Jīnghéng Nèipiān* says: \"Sacrificial thunder is *zhèn* (shaking)—a fixed principle. Yet why does thunder have sound? It is the four lower trigrams of *lǐ* (fire) interacting, and when *lǐ* is superimposed, it becomes *kǎn* (water). Fire entering water creates a violent, resonant sound—considering smaller things first: when fire forges metal, making it transparent, and it is plunged into water, its clamor is still fierce. How much more so with the vast *qi* of *kǎn* and *lǐ*?\n\nThe *Huntian* symbol encompasses Earth, with the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Its light enters the earth, and when Heaven generates water, water is within the earth. The next host rises again in the east, its light emerging above ground. The sun rises from Fushang, truly ascending from the sea, hence the morning sun’s clarity. When it sets, its sound is thunderous and fierce. Thus, the *Yánzhí Tu* (Diagram of the Setting Sun) strikes drums and gongs to blend with it; otherwise, the young and old would be terrified. This is the proof of fire entering water and producing sound.\n\nThus, it is known that the angry *qi* of water and fire, when agitated, forms thunder—and how much more so when *kǎn* (water) generates rain and *lǐ* (fire) generates lightning, each reinforcing the other?\"",

In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it occupies the *hài-zǐ-chǒu* (Pig, Rat, Ox) positions, storing and preserving all things. When the Dipper’s handle circumnavigates Heaven, the year’s function is complete. Great is the transformation of the *Wu* (non-action)!\"\n\nThe scriptures say: \"Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism, while humans use the heart as theirs. Thus, the celestial mechanism operates through yin and yang, and the human mechanism is perfected through the Great *Dao*.

Where the Dipper’s handle points, the heavens move accordingly—when the *qiú* (handle) points to *Zǐ* (Rat), it marks the day; when the *sháo* (ladle) points to *Yín* (Tiger), it marks the night.\"\n\nYáng Zhī (Master Yang) said in the *Tàiyuán Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Origin): \"The Dipper’s handle moves southward, leftward in revolution but rightward in rotation.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Four Symbols Returning to the True states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: \"The scriptures teach: ‘The mouth’s relation to taste, the eyes’ to color, the ears’ to sound, the nose’s to odor—these exhaust human *yù* (desires), and extinguish Heaven’s *lǐ* (principle), all stirred by the heart.’ *Zhuāngzi* (Chuang Tzu) says: ‘Those whose desires run deep have shallow celestial *qi*—thus, the sage practices *wu* (non-action).’ Seal the tongue’s breath, contain the eyes’ light, concentrate the ears’ resonance, and regulate the nose’s inhalation. When the four senses harmonize, they return to the *Xūyuán* (Void Origin), still and motionless within the True Self.\"\n\nYán Zǐ (Master Yan), as a fool, attained *mò* (silent) insight through *biān* (wall) meditation, while the Master recognized the *yīguàn* (oneness). Lǎozi (Laozi) embraced the One and guarded the *pǔ* (uncarved block).\n\nMencius said: \"No better cultivation of the heart exists than in desiring little.\"\n\nThe *Dao* teaches: \"One must always dispel desire to achieve a tranquil heart.\"\n\nThe *Sìshíèr Zhāng Jīng* (Scripture of the Forty-Two Chapters) states that the Buddha said:\n\"To distance oneself from desires and keep the mind serene—\nThis is the same realm.\"\n\n*Zhuāngzi* says: \"When the celestial *qi* is not agitated, the five senses are complete.\"\n\n*The Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean) says:\n\"To see without seeing, to hear without hearing,\nTo eat without knowing its taste—\nThis is called rectifying the heart through self-cultivation.\"\n\n*Xúnzǐ* (Hsun Tzu) says:\n\"The eyes do not wish to indulge in vivid colors,\nThe ears do not wish to be startled by sounds,\nThe mouth does not wish to overindulge in flavors,\nThe nose does not wish to be overwhelmed by odors.\nMoreover, the heart dwells in the central void,\nUsing it to govern the five senses—\nThis is called the Heavenly Sovereign.\nThe annotation says: ‘The five senses are the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and body.’\"\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture for Guiding People) declares:\n\"The divine wind is still and silent,\nMountains and seas conceal the clouds.\nThe heavens are free of floating obstructions,\nThe four *qi* are clear and bright.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Mixed Unity of the Three Talents states, as the *Jīnbì Gǔwén Lónghǔ Shàng Jīng* (Ancient Prose of the Golden Pile: The Upper Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger) says:\n\"The chicken’s egg is a metaphor,\nCombining to respond to the Three Talents.\nAgain, the one-inch pearl,\nMerges the Three Talents.\"\n\n*Wén Zhōngzǐ* (Master Wen) says:\n\"'To cease the ceaselessly surging' is its meaning—\nHeaven is not merely the ceaselessly surging.\nEarth is not merely mountains, rivers, hills, and valleys.\nHumans are not merely the head, body, and feet.\nHeaven encompasses the root of the *yuán* (primordial),\nEarth encompasses the form of the *yuán*,\nHumans encompass the cognition of the *yuán*.\"\n\n*Lièzǐ* (Lieh Tzu) says:\n\"The *yuán* *qi* (primordial *qi*) that is light and clear becomes Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid becomes Earth,\nThe balanced and harmonious *qi* becomes humans.\"\n\nThe Diagram of the Five Thunders Gathering the Clustering states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said:\n\"The Five *qi* (元) ascend to the primordial,\nUnstained by dust, able to purify and tranquilize—\nThis is called *wú lòu* (leakage-free).\nThe liver is the east spirit’s wood,\nThe lungs are the west soul’s gold,\nThe heart is the south deity’s fire,\nThe kidneys are the north essence’s water,\nThe spleen governs the central earthly palace.\"",

a single mind.\nNature and life cannot be parted,\nEven for a moment.'\n\nThe True Person of Jade Creek says:\n*'The ancients said: If you only clarify the True Nature but do not refine the elixir,\nEven ten thousand kalpas you must know transformation is difficult.\nIf you only exhaust the life-force but fail to grasp the True Nature,\nThis is the first illness of cultivation.\nYet once you reach this point,\nDo not hesitate to advance further.\nLike Master Zhang Ziyang’s desire to visit Dao Guang Chan,\nHe instead encountered Shi Xinglin,\nAnd thus attained the One Family of the

Prajñā?*\nZhimen replied:\n*'A clam embracing the autumn moon.'\n\n*'How is the function of Prajñā?*\nZhimen replied:\n*'A hare bearing its young.'\n\nLater, Master Xuedou composed a verse:\n*'A single void, congealed yet free of all clinging,\nFrom which all humans and gods perceive birth from emptiness.\nThe clam holds the hare of mystery deep within,\nOnce warring with the Chan school over this truth.'\n\nHan Shan’s verse says:\n*'The heart’s moon shines ever bright,\nWhat can all phenomena compare to?\nTo know the art of the Daoist elixir,\nThe original spirit within the body is the key.'\n\nHan Shan’s verse says:\n*'To benefit, preserve the essence—\nThis is called \"having benefit.\"\nTo transform, alter the form—\nThis is called \"having transformation.\"\nIf one can both benefit and transform,\nThen surely the register of the High Immortals is attained.\nIf neither benefit nor transformation is achieved,\nThen death’s calamity is inevitable.*\n\nMaster Pi Ling’s *Restoration of Life-Force* says:\n*'In my youth, I studied the Dao,\nAnd all my teachers were men of nature’s essence.\nThe Chan school’s highest attainment—\nA single insight directly transcends the Buddha’s realm.\nIf their practice is still incomplete,\nThey remain bound to birth and death.\nAs for seated transcendence or standing death,\nOr seizing the fetus to snatch the shell,\nI have never seen one achieve this in an instant.\nI often pondered how Zhongni [仲尼, Confucius]\nExhausted principles and perfected nature to attain the life-force,\nAnd how the Śākyamuni [释迦] taught\nNeither birth nor annihilation,\nWhile Laozi [老子] spoke of\nAscending and soaring with effortless might.\nThus, the Sage’s intent\nCannot be taken by a single path alone.\n\nThe secret I received from the Perfect Man was:\n*\"The progenitor of the Great Dao\nIs none other than the One *Qi* [一炁],\nFrom which all transformations arise.\"*\nUpon hearing this, I doubted not,\nFollowed the method, and indeed ascended to the Sage’s rank.*\n\nMaster Su of Yingbin says:\n*'The life-force is the marvel of nature.\nNature can still be spoken of,\nBut the life-force cannot be spoken of at all.*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Exhaust the principles and perfect the nature,\nThen one attains the life-force.\"*\nThe Sage’s study of the Dao\nMust begin with exhausting the principles,\nProgress through perfecting the nature,\nAnd culminate in restoring the life-force.\n\nMaster Huai’an Zhuzi [晦庵朱子] read the Daoist texts and composed:\n*\"In the rocky valley, I uphold steadfast virtue,\nAspiring only to the Mysterious and Void.\nOn clear nights, I rest in the hallowed chamber,\nAll day long, I study the Daoist teachings.\nThe body forgets itself, and the *qi* ascends naturally;\nThe nature is realized, and the principles leave no trace.\nThough I have not yet mastered the Dao,\nI escape the shackles of fame and reputation,\nFinding joy in the depths of my mind—\nMountains and waters cannot entertain me.\nI speak to the maddened seeker:\nYour ceaseless striving is in vain.\"*\n\nAgain, in reciting the scriptures, he composed:\n*\"Weary of the dust’s encumbrances,\nI cast them off, embracing the profound Mysterious.\nSilently unfolding the unadorned texts,\nI chant the verses of the Eastern Marvels.\nMorning and evening, a single bow—\nYears pass like a rushing stream.\nThough the world’s chaos remains,\nI rely on this to sever all ties.\"*\n\nAnd during long rains, in secluded meditation while reciting scriptures, he composed:\n*\"Residing alone, I have no affairs,\nCasually unfolding the Śākyamuni’s texts.\nTemporarily releasing the dust’s entanglements,\nI transcend with the Dao as my companion.\nThe gate is shut in the bamboo grove’s seclusion,\nBirds call in the lingering mountain rain.\nHaving grasped the Law of Non-Action,\nBody and mind rest in perfect harmony.\"*\n\n*The three poems above appear in Master Huai’an’s *Complete Works of Zhu Wen Gong* [《朱文公大全文集》].\nThe Master often upheld the orthodoxy,\nAnd benefited the world’s teachings—\nYet when he exhausted the principles and perfected the nature,\nHe was no longer constrained by such norms.\nThe three Sages’ Dao\nDiffers in function yet shares the same essence.\nConfucius taught without intention, necessity, rigidity, or ego,\nThe Śākyamuni taught without duality or exhaustion,\nLaozi taught without thought or action—\nAll three spoke of the same principle.\n\nThe Master’s poems\nDiverge in path yet converge in meaning,\nThus under heaven there is but

      "translated_text": "Chen Xiqí said:\nThe Great Unfolding’s numbers—forty-nine in use, while One is suspended and unused—its meaning.\nScholars merely know that One symbolizes the immovable *Tai Ji*, yet they fail to grasp its true significance.\nWhy? Because One is the fundamental root of all numbers.\nAll things’ principles: without a root, they are disordered; with a root, they must not be overused, for overuse brings chaos again.\nTake, for instance, the motion of a cart—when its axle is centered, it stops.\nOr a chariot’s wheels—when they are large, they move.\nLike a net’s central cord, which is drawn taut.\nLike a vessel’s handle, which is grasped.\nLike the sovereign’s authority, with hands and feet acting beneath.\nLike a general commanding from the center, with soldiers obeying.\nLike the Sage-Emperor’s non-action, while ministers act.\nLike the wise being honored, while the capable are employed—\nThus, all who grasp One are its root, its foundation, its master.\nAll possess the unchanging principle of unity; if moved, the rest fall into disorder.\n\nYichuan Chengzi said:\nThe Great Unfolding’s numbers total fifty.\nNumbers begin at One and complete at Five; the lesser Unfolding forms Ten, while the greater Unfolding makes fifty.\nWhen fifty is complete, it is immovable, hence One is subtracted for use.\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty, with five completing their transformations and animating the spirits.\n*Transformations* refer to function; *spirits* refer to application.\n*King Fang’s I Ching* states:\nFifty refers to the ten solar terms, twelve earthly branches, and twenty-eight lunar mansions.\nOf the fifty, the unused One is the Heavenly *qi*’s birth.\n\nZheng Xuan said:\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth are harmonized through the Five Phases’ *qi*.\nThe Five Phases each contain five; the Great Unfolding subtracts one, thus using forty-nine.\nThe Five Phases’ *qi* harmonized refers to the ten solar terms, twelve lunar tones, and twenty-eight lunar mansions—through which the Five Phases’ *qi* flows.\nFifty-five in total, subtracting five yields the Great Unfolding; again subtracting One gives forty-nine.\nThis doctrine originates from *The Buhrst Degrees*, aligning with King Fang’s view, though the Five Phases’ harmonized *qi* is even more refined.\n\n*Guanzi’s I Ching* states:\nZhang Yi asked: The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five; yet you say fifty, then subtract One—what does this mean?\nGuanzi replied: The *shu* divination stalks do not merely imitate Heaven and Earth; the Five Phases must operate within them.\n\nZhao Shuo said:\nIts use of forty-nine—\nThe Great Unfolding is inexhaustible.\nThe subtraction of One demonstrates its inexhaustibility.\n\n---\n**Five Phases Inversion Diagram**\nWhen the Five Phases are disordered, the tiger walks in water.\n**Five Phases Inversion Technique**\nThe dragon emerges from fire’s embrace.\n\nZhongyang Zhang Zhenren said:\nThe Five Phases inverted—\nThe elixir body ever refined.\nShi Chen Wang Zhenren said:\nLinked cycles, sequential transformations—\nThe Five Phases’ essence is inversion.\nMaster the intent of inversion within,\nAnd thunderbolts strike from azure dawn.\n\n*Inversion* refers to reversing the Five Phases,\nHarmonizing the Four Symbols,\nExtracting the undifferentiated *qi* of the Primordial Void,\nSeizing the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union,\nEntering the Yellow Chamber,\nAnd birthing the supreme treasure—\nThus, formless gives rise to form,\nThe body beyond the body.\nWhen virtue and merit are complete,\nAscension to the Celestial Immortal is attained.\n\n*Order* is humanity’s great principle:\nDividing *jing* and *qi* to form the body,\n*Qi* becomes matter, wandering spirits transform—\nWith a body comes suffering;\nTribulations arise from here.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* states:\nIf one seeks inversion in daily life,\nEven the earth’s dust becomes treasure.\n\n---\n**Thunderbolt Transformation Diagram**\n**Thunder**\nYin and Yang clash, forming thunder by law.\n**Lightning**\nYin and Yang congeal, surging into lightning.\n**Wind**\nYin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.\n**Cloud**\nYin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.\n**Snow**\nYin excessive, Yang deficient—clouds gather.\n**Rain**\nYin and Yang ascending and descending—steamed into rain.\n**Frost**\nYin oppressive, Yang collapsing—frost flies.\n**Dew**\nYang flourishing, Yin dispersing—dew spreads faintly.\n**Fog**\nAscending and descending fail—fog forms.\n**Hail**\nYin and Yang stagnant—hail congeals.\n**Rainbow**\nExcess water becomes rainbow.\n**Drought**\nExcess fire becomes drought.\n\n**Thunderbolt Essence and Function Ode**\nHeaven and Earth’s void center ever open,\nOnly when dynamic stillness splits into Yin and Yang.\nLife and death, opening and closing—\nAll inverted, the Dipper’s pivot steadfast.\nThunder’s clash erupts from the earth,\nLightning’s glow flashes golden.\nWind drifts, weak or strong, rising with time,\nStrong or weak, clouds gather short or long.\nAscending and descending, steaming rain descends,\nSoft snow falls on the silver hall.\nFrost flies, oppressive Yin collapses—\nYang flourishing, dew scatters far.\nWhen ascending and descending fail, fog forms;\nStagnant Yin, hail—no Yang.\nExcess water becomes mirage, excess fire becomes drought.\nHarmonized and balanced, all things flourish.\nStillness, divine wind—Heaven’s *qi* bright,\nAscending yet unrising—eternal truth.\nRaging winds, sudden rains—Yin and Yang dance,\nWinter warmth like summer’s heat, summer’s chill like winter’s frost.\nProlonged rain, endless drought—floods surge,\nThunder crashes in the tenth month, summer frost flies.\nSelf-crafted transformation unites Heaven and Earth,\nYet those who fail to grasp the pivot merely measure.\n\n*The Soul Treasure’s Complete Methods* states:\nEarth’s *qi* ascends, becoming cloud, dispersing as rain.\nHeaven’s *qi* descends, dispersing as fog, congealing as dew.\nExcessive Yin turns dew to frost, rain to snow.\nExcessive Yang turns fog to mist, clouds to mist-haze.\nYin concealing Yang—Yang’s *qi* unchecked—\nClashing, it births thunderbolts.\nYang concealing Yin—Yang’s *qi* uncoalesced—\nFirmly solidifying, it forms hail and sleet.\nYin and Yang unaligned—\nLightning strikes.\nYin and Yang mismatched—\nThe dragon transforms into rainbow.\n\nKangjie Shaozi said:\nYang obtains Yin and becomes rain;\nYin obtains Yang and becomes wind;\nThe firm obtains the yielding and becomes cloud;\nThe yielding obtains the firm and becomes thunder.",
