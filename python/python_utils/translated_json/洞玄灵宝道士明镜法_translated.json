  "full_translation": "**The Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Daoist Luminous Mirror Method**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Daoist Luminous Mirror Method*. Author unknown. Likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Teaches the practice of the Luminous Mirror method, roughly akin to *The Supreme Clarity Essential Scripture of the Luminous Mirror* and *The Supreme Clarity Authentic Scripture of the Luminous Mirror*. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n### **The Luminous Mirror Method for Perceiving One’s Form**\n\nWhen gazing into a mirror to see one’s form, slightly open a window facing the light, then gradually close the eyes and visualize the face. At first, all appears dim and indistinct. After a night’s practice, vision gradually extends into the distance, and one’s countenance becomes visible. With focused contemplation, clarity dawns brightly.\n\nThe best times are dawn and dusk before sunset. At midday, when the sun blazes fiercest, even with the window slightly closed, gazing into the mirror amid the glare yields nothing. Never look into a mirror by firelight—keep the flame at a distance, lest its glow be too near.\n\nIf one wishes to open the eyes and observe the body directly, do so in bright light without strain. To close the eyes and visualize the face, sit in darkness facing the light, and the form will appear.\n\nThe essential method for mirror-gazing: lie calmly upon a bed, concentrate the mind with utmost sincerity, and in the liminal state between sitting and reclining, let the body relax. After a brief moment, a red or yellow radiance will emerge from the forehead, illuminating the entire chamber. In this hazy, dreamlike state—half-awake, half-asleep—one’s face appears within the light, gazing back as if in mutual regard, then vanishing in an instant.\n\nUpon awakening, gaze into the mirror again while lying down, visualizing as before. With nightly practice, one will see oneself. Sometimes, upon waking, two faces appear opposite each other; at other times, one’s form is seen seated alongside another. In the stillness of slumber, lovely spirit youths and jade maidens, aged five or six, clad in fine garments with upright brows, may appear—bow to them when they do. At times, voices whisper in the ear, foretelling all matters of fortune and misfortune under heaven. One may see through walls, dream of gazing into mirrors, or turn the light inward to perceive the five viscera.\n\nBegin mirror-gazing at the *shen* hour (3–5 p.m.).\n\n### **The Standing Mirror-Viewing Method**\nUse a nine-inch mirror, flawless and unblemished. Keep it pristine and clear, placing it one foot to either side—this grants longevity equal to heaven and earth.\n\nBefore the ritual, purify oneself and fill a basin with well-water drawn at dawn. At night, use a lamp fueled by hemp oil for clarity. When one’s form appears distinctly, kneel and bow deeply, saying: *\"I share the same body with you. Today, I part from you in form. I beseech you for ten thousand years of transformation, to ever accompany me, that my body may never decay, and we may remain together for eternity.\"*\n\nFirst, gaze into the mirror to perceive forms, hear voices, and listen to others’ speech. In advanced practice, three youths and nine maidens attend the mirror. The youths stand six feet tall, the maidens five. They wear azure robes with multicolored inner garments: the Purple Maiden in black, the Plain Maiden in white, the August Maiden in red, the Jade Maiden in crimson, and the Canopy Maidens in twenty layers of pale yellow. The Luminous Mirror Lord commands a retinue of one hundred twenty officials, governing the Palace of Opening Yang. The pupils of one’s eyes become youths of radiant essence, their reflections revealing fortune and misfortune.\n\nLong ago, a Daoist who polished mirrors for common folk charged six or seven coins per mirror. His method was simple: applying a medicinal paste to polish them until they shone. A man named Yuan Zhongyang inquired of him, and the Daoist revealed the Way of the Luminous Mirror—how to divide one’s form, transform it, and attain omniscience, foreknowledge of all things, and communion with the gods of heaven and earth. Those who master its practice will draw the attendance of all immortals and transcendents. The Daoist himself had attained the Dao.\n\nA Daoist should always hang a nine-inch mirror behind them in their stone chamber to repel all evil. Even if a hundred ghosts or ancient spirits alter their forms, they cannot change their reflections in the mirror. Their shapes dissolve within it, rendering them harmless.\n\n### **The Daoist Mirror-Polishing Formula**\nFrom *The Scripture of Master Bai Zigao*.\n\nA mirror-polisher once disclosed the formula: Use rusted iron ingots, preferably those with reddish edges. Blacksmiths produce these when forging iron—strike the rusted ingot, and it emerges. This is called *red ancestor* and is found in iron mortars. Pound it finely, sift through silk, and combine with serpent’s yellow (also finely ground and sifted), mixing both with raw oil to form the paste.\n\n**Here ends *The Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Daoist Luminous Mirror Method*.**",
