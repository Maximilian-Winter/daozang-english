  "full_translation": "*The Continued Biographies of Immortals*\n**Title:** *Continued Biographies of Immortals*. Three fascicles. Composed by Shen Fen of the Five Dynasties. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Jizhuan* (Records and Biographies) category.\n\n**Preface to the Continued Biographies of Immortals**\nComposed by Shen Fen, Gentleman for Court Summons and Former Magistrate of Shenshui County\n\nImmortals of past and present are known throughout the world,\nYet their soaring ascents and hidden transformations are rarely witnessed by the common folk.\nThe sages of old declared: \"Of those who inquire after those who attained immortality, scarcely one in a thousand may hear of even one such case.\"\nMoreover, historical records do not dwell upon the affairs of immortals, and thus many do not endure in the world.\nExamining the intent of these histories, they seek to inspire through the Dao of lord and minister, father and son, order and chaos, loyalty and filial piety for all ages.\nIf one were to esteem only the realm of emptiness and natural spontaneity, then people would have no restraints.\n\n*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The Three Divine Mountains lie in the sea, where immortals dwell in palaces of gold and silver. The herbs of deathlessness grow upon them. Should any man seek to approach these mountains, the winds would carry his ship away, and none could ever reach them.\"\nThis, too, is meant to inspire.\n\nHow vast are the affairs of immortals—mysterious and beyond measure!\n\nAt the outset of cultivation, one guards the One and refines qi, adhering strictly to rules and disciplines, laboring diligently and meticulously, fearful of even the slightest lapse. Yet upon attainment, one undergoes myriad transformations, blending into the mortal world—some concealing themselves in mountain forests, others wandering through city markets. Those who ascend in flight often journey to the islands of the sea; once their merit is sufficiently accumulated, they become immortal officials. The lesser among them remain as immortal folk. Across the Ten Isles, there are no fewer than hundreds of thousands of immortal households, tilling fields of magic mushrooms, measuring their plots in acres, much as one sows rice. There are indeed immortal officials who govern both the immortal folk and the boundary between immortals and mortals. Those who undergo transformation leave behind their forms like cicadas shedding their shells, preserving their qi and stabilizing their bodies within grottoes before ascending to become perfected immortals—truly no empty claim.\n\nI, Shen Fen, have long admired the Dao, yet shamefully remain mired in ingrained habits. From youth to adulthood, all that I have heard from the lofty and virtuous, along with the accumulated knowledge of years, has been etched into my heart. Moreover, as national histories do not record such matters, these affairs scatter among the common folk. Following the warfare of the Zhonghe era, ancestral records remained scarce, and though there were those who took up the brush to chronicle them, the passage of time has rendered their accounts increasingly rare. Alas, were this to continue, their voices might vanish without a trace. Thus, I have compiled these records into three volumes, hoping to provide material for gentlemen of refined interest and seekers of the Dao, that they may have tales to share and that the true immortals may be revealed.\n\n*Continuation of the Immortals’ Biographies*, Volume One\nCompiled by Shen Fen, Gentleman for Court Audience and Former Magistrate of Lishui County\nSixteen Ascended Immortals, including Three Female Perfected Ones\nThe Master of Mystic Truth\n\nThe Master of Mystic Truth, surnamed Zhang, given name Zhihe, was a native of Shanyin in Guiji. A man of vast learning and literary talent, he passed the imperial examinations. Skilled in painting, he could drink three *dou* of wine without becoming intoxicated. He preserved his true nature and cultivated his *qi*, such that external snow did not chill him, nor did entering water soak him. He traveled through all the mountains and rivers under heaven. The Duke of Lu, Yan Zhenqing, was a close friend.\n\nWhen Zhenqing served as prefect of Huzhou, he often gathered his retainers for feasts, where they composed and exchanged *yufu* verses. The first of these was by Zhihe, which read:\n*By West Bank Mountain, white gulls take flight,*\n*Peach blossoms drift where mandarin fish grow plump.*\n*Green bamboo hat, green straw cloak—*\n*In slanting wind and fine rain, no need to return.*\n\nZhenqing, along with Lu Hongjian, Xu Shiheng, and Li Chengju, composed over twenty verses in response, each praising the others in turn. Zhihe then took up cinnabar and ink, cutting silk to paint scenes alongside the poems. In an instant, five scrolls emerged, depicting flowers, trees, birds, fish, and landscapes—traces of marvels unmatched in ancient or modern times. Zhenqing and his guests passed them around, sighing in admiration without end.\n\nLater, when Zhenqing traveled east to Pingwang Station, Zhihe, flushed with wine, performed a water trick. He spread a mat upon the water and sat alone, drinking, chanting, and singing. The mat moved swiftly to and fro, like the sound of a swift boat. Clouds and cranes followed above him. Zhenqing’s attendants and guests watched in astonishment. Zhihe waved his hand in farewell to Zhenqing from the water’s surface, then ascended and departed. To this day, his paintings are still treasured among the people.\n\n**Lan Caihe**\nLan Caihe—of unknown origin.\n\nLan Caihe often wore a tattered indigo robe with six patches, a black wooden waistband over three inches wide, one foot shod in a boot and the other bare. In summer, he stuffed his robe with padding, while in winter, he walked through snow, his breath steaming as if from a furnace. He would sing through the streets, begging for alms, holding a large clapper over three feet long. Often drunk, he danced and sang, drawing crowds of old and young alike. Quick-witted and full of jest, he answered whatever was asked, his laughter leaving all in stitches. He seemed mad, yet not mad.\n\nAs he walked, he would shake his boot and chant:\n*\"Dance and sing, Lan Caihe,\nHow long can this world last?\nFair faces are but saplings,\nYears fly like a shuttle’s cast.\nThe ancients vanished, never to return,\nWhile multitudes press on in turn.\nAt dawn, ride simurghs to the azure sky,\nBy dusk, see mulberry fields turn to waves high.\nBright radiance lingers in the void’s expanse,\nWhere golden and silver palaces tower in grandeur’s dance.\"*\n\nHis songs were many, all steeped in the Dao, yet none could fathom their meaning. When given coins, he strung them on a long rope and dragged them along the ground. If they scattered, he never looked back. Sometimes he gave them to the poor, or to taverns.\n\nHe wandered the world, and those who had known him as children would see him again in their old age, his appearance unchanged. Later, as he sang and danced between the moats of Liang and the bridges of Hao, he grew drunk in a tavern. Suddenly, the sound of cranes, pipes, and flutes arose, and he ascended lightly into the clouds, casting down his boots, robe, sash, and clappers before vanishing into the distance.\n\nZhu Ruzi was a native of Yongjia’s Angu. As a child, he became the disciple of the Daoist Wang Yuanzheng, residing in the Great Ruo Crag, where Tao Hongjing had once compiled the *Zhen’gao*—hence its other name, Zhen’gao Crag. To the west of the crag stood Mount Tao. Zhu served Yuanzheng with diligence and hardship, deeply admiring the Dao of immortality. He often climbed the mountains to gather yellow essence, which he consumed, persisting for over a decade. One day, as he washed vegetables by a stream, he suddenly saw two flower-like dogs playing on the bank. Perplexed, he followed them into a thicket of wolfberry bushes. Upon returning, he told Yuanzheng, who was astonished and accompanied him to observe. The two dogs reappeared, frolicking, but when approached, they vanished again into the wolfberry bushes. Yuanzheng and Zhu dug together and unearthed two wolfberry roots shaped like dogs, hard as stone. They washed them, took them home, and boiled them. Zhu tended the fire for three days and nights without leaving the cauldron. He tasted the broth—its flavor was sweet and delicious, and he drank without cease. When the roots softened, he told Yuanzheng, who came to share the meal. Moments later, Zhu suddenly ascended into the air above the peak. Yuanzheng was stunned. After a long while, Zhu bid him farewell and rose into the clouds. To this day, the locals call the peak Tongzi Peak. Yuanzheng later consumed the remaining roots and lived an unknown number of years, dwelling in seclusion west of the crag. Woodcutters on Mount Tao sometimes saw him.\n\nWang Lao of Yijun was a native of Yijun County in Fangzhou. He lived in a village, deeply devoted to the Dao, and diligently practiced hidden virtues and good deeds. His wife shared his resolve without wearying. One day, an old Daoist with tattered robes arrived at their door. Wang Lao and his wife welcomed and honored him. After staying for over a month, the Daoist conversed and drank with Wang Lao daily, their rapport deepening. Suddenly, the Daoist developed festering sores all over his body. Wang Lao sought medicine and tended to him with increasing care, yet the sores worsened day by day, persisting for nearly a year. The Daoist said to Wang Lao, \"These sores need no ordinary medicine—only several *hu* of wine to soak in, and they will heal on their own.\" Wang Lao thus brewed wine with meticulous care. When it was ready, the Daoist instructed him to fill a large jar with the wine, saying, \"I will add medicine and bathe in it myself.\" He entered the jar and emerged three days later, his hair and beard turned black, his complexion youthful, his skin smooth as congealed fat. Wang Lao and his family were astonished. The Daoist said, \"This wine can be drunk—it enables one to fly to heaven.\" Wang Lao believed him. Initially, the jar held over five *hu* of wine, but upon inspection, only two or three *sheng* remained. The wine was clear, fragrant, and exquisite, unlike ordinary brew. At the time, Wang Lao was threshing wheat. He, his wife, and the laborers all drank and became thoroughly drunk. The Daoist also drank and asked, \"Can we ascend to heaven now?\" Wang Lao replied, \"I will follow wherever you lead.\" Suddenly, an auspicious wind arose, and green clouds billowed like steam. The house, grass, trees, the entire family, and even the chickens and dogs all flew away. The sound of threshing wheat could still be heard in the air, and villagers who witnessed it were amazed. Only the cats and rats were left behind. When the wind subsided, the hired laborers found themselves beneath trees in a distant village. Later, they no longer needed to eat and all attained longevity. Thirty *li* west of Yijun County lies the village of Shengxian.\n\nHou Daohua claimed to have come from Mount Emei and resided at the Yongle Abbey in Hezhong. He behaved wildly, and the other Daoists all belittled him. Yet Daohua was skilled with an axe; whenever the abbey’s buildings were damaged, he repaired them himself. He climbed perilous heights and traversed treacherous paths, reaching places others could not. He also performed menial tasks: when guests arrived, regardless of their status, he would draw water, wash their feet, and launder their clothes. He tilled the soil, tended the garden, and endured hardship to provide for the community. The others despised him, treating him like a hired servant, but Daohua remained ever cheerful. He was also fond of histories and philosophical texts, never letting a book leave his hands, reciting whatever he read. When asked why, he replied, \"There are no ignorant immortals in heaven.\" The others laughed heartily.\n\nAfter more than ten years, a strange light suddenly appeared upon the abbey’s roof beam, which people often saw. Rumors spread that during the Kaiyuan era, Master Liu the Daoist had once refined an elixir, testing it on a dog that died; fearing to consume it themselves, they had hidden it within the beam. Most dismissed this as wild talk. Then, one day, a violent storm damaged the hall slightly. Daohua climbed onto the beam and again saw the light glowing from a hollow within it. He chiseled out the wood and found a box, triple-layered, and inside the innermost golden casket lay the elixir. He swallowed it at once and cast the empty box down. After ingesting the elixir, he showed no immediate change, and the others scoffed, calling him a fraud.\n\nOne day, returning drunk from the market, he came upon the abbey’s ancient pine—a magnificent tree with a canopy like an upturned parasol. He strapped on wooden clogs, climbed the tree, and began hacking off its branches. The other Daoists repeatedly tried to stop him, but he would not relent, declaring as he chopped, “These will only hinder my ascent one day.” The others, long convinced of his madness, grew even more furious. Just then, the magistrate of Yongle County entered the abbey and, seeing the mutilated pine, was astonished. The Daoists explained the situation to him, and the magistrate berated and humiliated Daohua, who remained cheerful as ever.\n\nSeven days later, Daohua rose at dawn, bathed, dressed in fine robes, and lit incense, saying, “The immortals’ envoys will come for me today.” He gazed into the sky and bowed without cease. The others still did not believe him. Soon after, word spread that above the pine before the abbey, clouds and cranes swirled while celestial pipes and flutes resounded. Suddenly, Daohua flew up and sat upon the treetop. The crowd below grew frantic with astonishment. The magistrate of Yongle, his officials, and the local people rushed to the scene, prostrating themselves in reverence—even the magistrate who had once humiliated Daohua now kowtowed until his forehead bled.\n\nDaohua waved his hand in farewell to the assembled Daoists and laypeople: “I have received the Jade Emperor’s decree, appointing me Immortal Attendant of the Terrace of Shao, and Keeper of the Hall of Good Faith in the Upper Clarity Palace. Now I depart.” In an instant, immortal musicians played within the clouds, banners and canopies shimmered faintly, and he ascended into the heavens.\n\nMa Ziran—Ma Xiang, styled Ziran—was a native of Yanguan County in Hangzhou.\n\nMa’s family had long served as minor clerks in the county, yet Xiang alone delighted in the classics, history, and literature. He traveled the realm with Daoists before returning to the Jiangnan region.\n\nOnce, while drunk in Huzhou, he fell into the Book Brook. After a full day, he emerged—his robes dry—and came floating upon the water. He declared, “Just now, I was summoned by Xiang Yu for a drinking bout and nearly became intoxicated. As I returned to the brookside, the onlookers stood shoulder to shoulder.” The reek of wine assailed them, and he seemed crazed by the wind. Many followed to watch. At times, he thrust his fist into his nose, and when he withdrew it, his nose remained unchanged. Pointing at the brook, he made its waters flow backward for a long while. Pointing at a willow, he made it drift with the current, back and forth. Pointing at a bridge, he caused it to break and then rejoin.\n\nLater, while traveling in Changzhou, he happened upon Ma Zhi, who had just been appointed prefect of the region. Having long heard of Xiang’s reputation, Zhi invited him for an audience and marveled at him. Zhi asked, “Reverend Brother, by fortunate coincidence we share the same surname. Might I offer you a residence, hoping you would grace my administration with your Way’s protection?” Xiang replied, “Why does Your Excellency frown?” Zhi answered, “I am of Fufeng.” Xiang jested, “Your Excellency is a *Fufeng* horse, while I am a *mafeng* ox—we merely know each other, with no claim to kinship.” His words implied that their natures were as distant as wind and cattle. Nevertheless, Zhi detained him in the prefectural lodge, growing ever more astonished.\n\nDuring a drinking gathering, Zhi requested a small display of his powers. At the feast, Xiang took a porcelain vessel, filled it with earth, and planted melon seeds. In moments, vines sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. He plucked and shared them; all the guests praised their fragrance and flavor, unlike ordinary melons. Then, from his sash and socks, he drew forth coins—countless, all true copper cash. He tossed them into a well and called out; each coin flew back into the hands of those who had caught them, only to vanish again in an instant.\n\nZhi remarked, “This city suffers from a terrible rat infestation.” Xiang inscribed a talisman and had it affixed to the southern wall. Striking a plate with a chopstick, he let out a long whistle. Rats swarmed forth in a drought-like torrent, rushing to the talisman and prostrating themselves. Xiang summoned the largest rat, which approached and bowed. He said, “You are but a humble creature, granted grain by Heaven. Why do you gnaw through walls and dwellings, disturbing His Excellency day and night? Though I pity you, I cannot kill you all. You should lead your kin far from here.” The great rat turned, and all the rats kowtowed in apology. Then, in a great drought-like exodus, they departed through the city gate—numberless. From that day forward, rats vanished from the city.\n\nLater, Xiang journeyed south to Yuezhou, passing through the Dongyan Monastery, where three hundred monks were holding a vegetarian feast. Accompanying him were Wang Zhiwei, a Daoist from the Muyan Grotto in Yongkang County of Zizhou, and his disciple Wang Yansou. Upon seeing Xiang and Zhiwei arrive, the monks sat and ate without so much as a bow, offering them only rice.\n\nXiang refused to eat and urged Zhiwei and Yansou to finish quickly and leave. Before the monks had finished their meal, they departed, hastening their steps as they exited the monastery gates. By the time they reached an inn south of Zhuji County—some seventy *li* from the monastery—it was deep into the night. Suddenly, they heard voices calling for the Daoists. The innkeeper promptly replied, “There are three here.” The voices outside rejoiced and asked the innkeeper for permission to see the Daoists. When they entered, they were two monks, who prostrated themselves and wailed, “The monks failed to recognize the Daoist masters yesterday and neglected to welcome you properly, incurring your wrath. Two hundred of us have been bedridden ever since. We two, as the monastery’s stewards, bear the greatest fault, so we have come especially to beg your forgiveness.”\n\nXiang merely slept on, ignoring them, while Zhiwei and Yansou laughed. The monks pleaded even more desperately, until Xiang finally said, “Hereafter, do not treat others with such disdain.” He added, “Return now, and by the time you enter the monastery gates, you will all be able to rise from your beds.” The monks returned, and it was just as he had said.\n\nThe next day, Xiang continued southward. It was spring, and he saw a household with fine *song* greens. When he asked for some but was refused, he was met with harsh words. He instructed Yansou to fetch paper and brush. Zhiwei then said, “To be denied greens is no great matter, and there is no cause for dispute. Besides, as Daoists, should we not endure such things?” Xiang smiled and replied, “I am no litigant—I merely wish to play a small trick.” Yansou presented the paper and brush, and Xiang drew a white egret. He sprayed it with water, and the bird flew into the vegetable patch, pecking at the greens. The owner chased after it, but the egret merely flew down again, repeating this several times. Xiang then drew a hunting dog, which ran after the egret, trampling the greens to pieces. Seeing the Daoist’s mischief—and recalling his earlier request for greens—the owner grew anxious, fearing further retaliation, and begged for mercy.\n\nXiang said, “I did not seek the greens—I only wished to amuse myself.” With that, he called the egret and the dog, which flew and ran into his arms. Upon inspection, the greens were entirely unharmed.\n\nContinuing south to the borders of Huotong Mountain in Changxi County, they sought lodging at an inn for the night. The rooms were few, and many travelers had already arrived. The innkeeper jested, “There is no space left—unless the Daoist can sleep on the wall, in which case I will accommodate you.” As dusk approached, Zhiwei and Yansou were anxious for shelter. Xiang said, “You may sleep among the common travelers. I will sit until dawn.” Once everyone was asleep, Xiang leapt onto a beam and hung upside down by one foot. The innkeeper, rising in the night, saw this by candlelight and was astonished. Xiang said, “If I can sleep on a beam, what difficulty is there in sleeping on a wall?” He then entered the wall and did not emerge for some time. The innkeeper, filled with reverence, moved Zhiwei and Yansou into a clean room within his home before Xiang finally reappeared. At dawn, the innkeeper sought to detain him, but Xiang had vanished. Zhiwei and Yansou searched for him along the road ahead and found him waiting by the wayside.\n\nFrom Huotong, they returned to Tianbao Abbey in eastern Yongkang County. The abbey had a great withered pine, which Xiang pointed to and said, “This pine is over three thousand years old—it will soon turn to stone.” Later, the pine indeed transformed into stone. Suddenly, a great wind and thunder split the stone into several sections. Yang Fa, who had been demoted from his post as military commissioner of Guangzhou to prefect of Weizhou, was a man who admired the extraordinary. He had two sections of the stone moved to his official residence and two others sent to the Nine Pines Courtyard of Longxing Temple. Each section stood six or seven *chi* tall and over three *chi* in diameter. The stone bore the bark and scales of the original pine, and it remains there to this day.\n\nWhen people came to Xiang seeking treatment for illness, he had no medicine but would strike the afflicted area with his bamboo staff, drawing out all manner of ailments from within. Pointing the staff at the patient, he would blow on its tip, and a sound like thunder would issue forth, curing the illness. Those who came to him with crooked limbs, leaning on staffs for support, he would strike with his bamboo staff, and they would immediately straighten and stand unaided.\n\nWhen offered money or silk, Xiang would refuse repeatedly, but if pressed, he would accept it only to distribute it among the poor. Wherever he traveled—whether to abbeys, grottoes, or mountains—he often left behind poems. His poem *Ascending Qinwang Mountain* reads:\n\n*Where to seek the primal division of the Great One?*\n*Only the shifting reckonings remain to sway the human heart.*\n*Sun and moon across the nine heavens mark the passing days,*\n*While rivers and mountains a thousand miles away transform through the ages.*\n*The wind stirs the waters, swallowing distant shores,*\n*Rain swells the mist, drowning the towering forests.*\n*Qin’s emperor vainly schemed to drive the mountains—*\n*The boundless sea rolls ever deeper.*\n\nLater, he returned to his hometown to visit his elder brother, who happened to be away. His sister-in-law and nephew rejoiced at his return. Xiang said, “My brother and I share this house. Now that I have returned, I wish to divide the land—I desire only the eastern garden.” His sister-in-law and nephew were perplexed: “You have been away from home for so long, and your brother has not yet seen you. Why speak of dividing the land? Surely, no one of flesh and blood would be so heartless.” He stayed for three days, and they were astonished that he ate nothing, drinking only wine. When his brother still did not return, Xiang suddenly passed away in the night.\n\nThe next day, his brother returned and asked his wife and son what had happened. They told him the truth. His brother, grief-stricken, said, “My younger brother studied the Dao for many years. He did not return to claim a share of the house—he came to entrust his transformation to me, so that all worldly attachments would be severed.” They prepared his coffin. That evening, a sudden sound came from within it, startling the household. They buried him in the garden.\n\nThis occurred in the tenth year of the Dazhong era.\n\nThe following year, Shuchuan memorialized that the Daoist Ma Ziran of Zitong County in Jianzhou had ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Xiang of Shuchuan told others: “I have newly achieved feathered transformation in the west of Zhe. Now, I have been summoned by the Jade Emperor and shall ascend on this very day.” He reported the matter, and the Emperor, moved with admiration, dispatched an envoy to Hangzhou in the west to verify it. They opened the tomb and examined the coffin, finding only a bamboo staff within.\n\nWu Tongwei\nWu Tongwei, of unknown origin, was a Daoist whose spirit and qi were pure and bright. He sat in silent meditation, sometimes chanting, sometimes drunk, and often wandered among the famous mountains of Hongzhou. Though people had seen him for many years, he would suddenly vanish for a decade or more, only to reappear with a countenance even younger than before. Those who knew him could not fathom this. He refined elixirs and pills, roaming without fixed abode. Later, while drunk in a wineshop, he ascended in flight and departed.\n\nXu Qi\nXu Cuo claimed to be from Gaoyang. In his youth, he sat for the imperial examinations but repeatedly failed. In later years, he studied the Dao on Wangwu Mountain, traveling among the Five Sacred Peaks and the famous grotto-heavens of the mountains. Later, he journeyed from Mount Emei through the two capitals, then from Jing and Xiang to Bian and Song, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. He visited Maoshan, Tiantai, Siming, Xiandu, Weiyu, Wuyi, Huotong, and Luofu, leaving no place unvisited. Wherever he went, he inscribed upon cliffs and cave walls in secluded spots: “Xu Cuo, seeking Master Crescent Moon, has come here from Mount Emei.” Those who saw his brushstrokes marveled at his divine strangeness, though none could identify Master Crescent Moon. Later, he often wandered near Lujiang. Once, drunk, he chanted:\n*“Before the garden’s blooms, this is my land of drunkenness,\nI drain the Queen Mother’s nine rosy goblets.\nThe immortals clap hands, deeming me frivolous—\nBanished to the mortal world to play the wine-mad sage.”*\nWhen well-meaning admirers invited him, he would say: “I am a celestial immortal, now feasting on Kunlun. My misconduct has led to this banishment.” People laughed, thinking him mad. Later, on a spring day, he wove flowers into his hair, danced with blossoms in hand, and climbed a wineshop tower to drink and sing. Then he rose upon the clouds and flew away.\n\nJin Keji\nJin Keji was a man of Silla.\n\nJin Keji\nA *Bin’gong* presented scholar. His nature was serene and fond of the Dao. He disdained extravagance. At times he practiced qi-cultivation and bodily refinement, regarding them as medicine. Broad in learning and retentive of memory, his compositions were pure and elegant. His bearing was handsome, and in movement and speech, he bore the refined air of the Central Plains. Soon after passing the examinations, he retreated to live in seclusion in the Ziwu Valley of Mount Zhongnan, embracing the life of a recluse. He planted many rare flowers and exotic fruits with his own hands. Often he would burn incense and sit in stillness, as if lost in thought. He also recited the *Daodejing* and various immortals’ scriptures without cease.\n\nAfter three years, he longed to return to his homeland and departed by sea. Later, he returned, clad in Daoist robes, and re-entered Mount Zhongnan, where he devoted himself to performing hidden virtues. Whatever people sought from him, he never refused. He pursued his practices with diligence, yet none could fathom his ways.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the eleventh year of the *Dazhong* era, he suddenly submitted a memorial, stating: *“Your servant has received a decree from the Jade Emperor, appointing me as Attendant Gentleman of the English Terrace. On the twenty-fifth day of the second month next year, I shall ascend to Heaven.”* Emperor Xuanzong found this extraordinary and dispatched an imperial messenger to summon him to the palace, but he firmly declined. When asked to present the Jade Emperor’s decree, he replied that it was held by another immortal and not left in the mortal realm. The emperor then bestowed upon him four palace ladies, fragrant medicines, gold, and silks, along with two imperial messengers to attend him. Yet Keji dwelled alone in a quiet chamber, and the palace ladies and messengers rarely approached him.\n\nEach night, voices of conversation and laughter were heard from within his room. The messengers, peering secretly, saw only immortal officials and maidens seated upon dragons and phoenixes, facing one another with solemn dignity. Their attendants and guards were numerous, yet the palace ladies and messengers dared not disturb them.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month, as spring’s beauty blossomed in full splendor, five-colored clouds, crying cranes, white doves, flutes and chimes, jade wheels, feathered canopies, and banners filled the sky. A vast celestial procession ascended, and he departed for Heaven. The court officials and commoners who gathered to witness the spectacle filled the valleys, all gazing in awe and wonder.\n\nSong Xuanbai\nSong Xuanbai’s origins are unknown. He was a Daoist priest. Over seven feet tall, his brows and eyes were as if painted, his features handsome and fair, his speech refined and graceful—all who saw him cherished him. Skilled in Daoist arts, he wore cotton in summer and a single layer in winter, walking through snow. Apace of over a *zhang* around him, steam-like qi emanated, and the snow never settled. He could extinguish lamps with a point of his finger, and when he pointed at a person, it was as if a draft had blown past, rustling. When he pointed at the grasses and trees in a courtyard, they would sway and rustle.\n\nHe wandered among famous mountains, emerging from Mao Shan to the Xixuan Abbey in Runzhou, then traveling to the Xiandu Grotto of Kuocang. He practiced *bigu* fasting and qi-nourishment, yet was fond of wine. When eating meat, he would consume five *jin*, accompanied by a basin of *su* sauce. He would scoop the meat with his hands, then drink two *dou* of wine, using a single white plum. Those who received even a morsel of his *su* sauce said it did not taste of ordinary herbs but carried an extraordinary fragrance that lingered on the tongue all day without fading. Many who ate it lived long, healthy lives of eighty or ninety years.\n\nWherever Xuanbai stayed, he would use gold and silk to acquire two or three beautiful concubines, only to abandon them when he departed. People believed he had mastered the art of replenishing the brain and restoring primordial essence.\n\nLater, he traveled to Yuezhou, where a severe drought had persisted. The local authorities were exposing the dragon’s music in the courtyard to pray for rain, but after ten days, the heat only worsened. Xuanbai, observing this, remarked that rain could only descend by Heaven’s decree and that without an appeal to the celestial court, it could not be summoned. He then stayed at the Xuanzhen Abbey, burning incense and offering prayers. By the next evening, a great rain fell, more than sufficient, and the people of Yue marveled at his divine power.\n\nContinuing south to Xinzhou, he encountered another drought. A Daoist priest, knowing of Xuanbai’s ability to summon rain, recommended him to the prefecture. He immediately performed his arts, driving a nail into the eyes of the city god. The prefect, Wei Delin, was outraged by his hoarding of women and drove a nail into the city god as well, declaring him a mad sorcerer and intending to punish him. When the guards approached, their limbs stiffened, and they collapsed, their staffs shattering of their own accord. Xuanbai laughed and said to Delin: *“Does the governor not recall how Liu Gen was nearly executed for punishing Zu Mi?”* Delin, now fearful, begged for rain. In an instant, the rain came, and he sent Xuanbai off with reverence.\n\nHis miraculous arts were displayed many times, too numerous to record in full.\n\nLater, he traveled to Nancheng County in Fuzhou, where he ascended to heaven in broad daylight and departed.\n\n**He Zizhen**\nHe Zizhen—his origins remain unknown. A Daoist priest, he dwelled on Mount Song. Well-versed in literature, he conducted himself with lofty antiquity, ever diligent in his austerities and cultivation. Though young in appearance, none knew his true age; yet among both Daoists and layfolk, it was said he had been seen for many years, though none thought it particularly strange. One day, clouds and cranes filled the sky, their music clear and resonant, as Zizhen suddenly ascended in flight. At the time, the scholar Chen Tao was in the eastern capital; seeing the people of Luoyang gazing in awe and reverence, he was struck with wonder and composed a poem:\n\n*Zi Jin’s simurgh soars o’er ancient Luo’s stream,*\n*Golden peaches ripen once more for Lord He’s flight.*\n*Music of the Three Clarities plays beneath Song’s peaks,*\n*Five-colored clouds gather before the imperial gardens’ sight.*\n*Crimson-crested dancers bow low to crimson banners’ sway,*\n*Green-robed singers pause as incense cakes hold sway.*\n*Who would weep in broad daylight for this parting scene?*\n*Ten thousand years of Tai Ji’s light—yet time slips away.*\n\n**The Medicine-Selling Elder**\nThe medicine-selling elder—no one knew his name, though when asked, he would say, *\"This alone is my true name.\"* Some had seen him since their youth, and even in old age, his appearance remained unchanged. He always carried a large gourd, selling medicine; whether one paid or not, he gave it freely to those who sought relief from illness. His remedies were always miraculously effective. Yet if one without ailment playfully asked for medicine, what they received would invariably be lost. Thus, people dared not frivolously seek his remedies, revering him as a divine being. Often drunk in the marketplace, he would give any money he earned to the poor. Once, someone teased him: *\"Do you sell the Great Return Elixir?\"* He replied, *\"I have one pill—one thousand strings of cash.\"* All laughed, thinking him mad. He would often shout in the streets, cursing people: *\"With money, you don’t buy medicine—you’ll all turn to dirt dumplings!\"* No one understood his meaning, and they only laughed harder. Later, in Chang’an, he shook his gourd—now empty—save for a single pill, vast and radiant, which he placed in his palm. He said to the crowd: *\"For a hundred years, I’ve sold medicine among you, passing by countless millions, yet not one would spend money to buy it. How pitiful! Now I must take it myself.\"* The pill vanished into his mouth; beneath his feet, five-colored clouds arose, and a wind carried him aloft as he soared away.\n\n**Deng Qushe**\nDeng Qushe was a native of Longqiu in Quzhou, his home at the foot of Mount Jiufeng. In his youth, he entered the Dao, traveling to study its arts with tireless devotion. At over thirty, he took residence at Anhe Abbey in Songyang County, Chuzhou—the very place where Ye Jingneng had once studied the Dao. Five *li* north of the abbey stood Mount Maoshan, rising over fifty *zhang* high, where, by tradition, Celestial Master Zhang and Ye Jingneng had both cultivated the Dao. Qushe, inspired by their legacy, climbed the mountain and built a hut to dwell in. Later, the abbey’s Daoists followed him down the mountain, and the people constructed houses and halls for them, installing an image of Lord Lao, along with portraits of Celestial Master Zhang and Ye Jingneng, before which they performed morning and evening rites.\n\nTo the southeast of the mountain lay a square stone, over two *zhang* wide, flat as a whetstone—formed by heaven itself. Qushe often sat upon it, hands clasped in silent meditation. One day, a divine being spoke to him: *\"Celestial Master Zhang’s two demon-slaying swords and a jar of elixir lie beneath this stone—you may retrieve them.\"* Qushe bowed to the spirit and replied: *\"This stone was set by heaven; no human effort can alter it.\"*\n\nReflecting on his own inadequacy, Qushe resolved only to guard his true nature, finding refuge in the mountain’s seclusion where he had long enjoyed divine protection. How could he dare take the swords and elixir for himself? The spirit replied: *\"Simply cultivate diligently without slackening, and the swords and elixir will come to you of their own accord.\"* Three years later, the spirit presented them to Qushe. The swords were Celestial Master Zhang’s Seven-Star Swords, and the elixir was stored in a stone casket, sealed in a single jar. When poured out, it filled over a *dou*, resembling sesame seeds in shape, crimson and radiant. Qushe consumed some himself and distributed the rest to the ailing, all of whom recovered.\n\nAt that time, Hua Zao of Lishui County, in the aftermath of the Zhonghe era’s famine and chaos, had rallied local forces and fortified himself in the mountains. The military governor of Zhedong reported this to the imperial court, which, seeking to end hostilities, appointed Hua as prefect. But Hua was treacherous. Hearing of Qushe’s elixir and swords, he imprisoned Qushe in an empty hut. It was the height of summer, and for a month, Hua gave him neither food nor drink, assuming he had perished. When the hut was opened, however, Qushe sat there with solemn composure, his complexion luminous and fairer than before. Hua was astounded and sent him back to the mountain, keeping the swords and elixir for himself. That night, a storm of wind and thunder roared, and all vanished without a trace.\n\nQushe, having received a divine message, returned to the stone. For the next fifteen years, he dwelled on the mountain, often speaking of dragons, tigers, and strange birds moving through his courtyard. Daoists from Anhe Abbey, who frequently ascended the peak to burn memorials, witnessed the tracks of dragons, tigers, and birds and marveled. Qushe had abstained from food for many years. If outsiders polluted the mountain, fierce beasts would appear in spring and winter to startle them, while venomous snakes would strike in summer and autumn.\n\nQushe also recounted: *\"I often see thunderstorms halfway up the mountain—dragons riding the rain, along with the Thunder Duke, Lightning Mother, and a host of spirits and gods. When they visit this mountain, they show great reverence.\"* Daoists who lodged there at night would hear Qushe in his quiet chamber conversing with others by dawn. Peering in, they detected a fragrant aroma filling the mountain and the sound of jade pendants. Qushe sat solemnly, attended by four figures in scarlet robes and distant-travel caps, their hair coiled in snail-shell buns, clad in azure silk. Jade boys and girls stood beside them, their radiance illuminating the room, while spirits roamed nearby. The Daoists dared not disturb them. When Qushe returned to the abbey by day, they spread word of the marvel.\n\nFifteen years later, Qushe told the Daoists: *\"I fear I must soon leave this mountain and may not see you for long.\"* One day, a procession of colored clouds, simurghs, and celestial music filled the sky, hovering above the peak. A palanquin, banners, and canopies appeared, with spirit officials riding dragons and deer, all five-hued, some mounted on simurghs and phoenixes, come to escort Qushe upward. A great crowd of Daoists and laypeople below watched in awe. Later, a wildfire consumed his hut, yet his divine traces remained. To this day, Daoists offer rituals in his honor.\n\n---\n\nXie Ziran\nXie Ziran was a female perfected one from Huayang in Shu. From childhood, she entered the Dao. Her master showed her the *Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*, which she read once as if recalling old lessons, and twice with perfect retention. As she grew, her spirit was clear and her bearing lofty. She loved the *qin* and *ruan*, excelled in calligraphy, and composed poetry. She disdained the conduct of Zhuo Wenjun, and in her devotions, she revered the Queen Mother of the West and Ma Gu, admiring the integrity of Lady Wei of South Mountain.\n\nAt forty, she set out on distant travels, visiting Qingcheng, Damei, Emei, the Thirty-Six Grottoes, and the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, then left Shu to journey through the capital and Luoyang, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. Wherever there were famous mountains, grotto-heavens, or sacred traces, she spared no effort to visit them. Later, hearing that Sima Chengzhen, a Daoist of Tiantai Mountain, dwelled on Yuxiao Peak and was solitary and lofty in virtue, she sought him out. She served as his disciple for three years, then lived apart in the wilderness, gathering firewood daily for Chengzhen’s stove and returning with fragrant fruits, ever eager to inquire about the Dao.\n\nChengzhen, struck by her perseverance, said: *\"I lack virtue—how can I bear this? But what do you truly seek?\"* Ziran replied: *\"From a thousand miles away, I came to your door seeking the Way of transcendence. I wish only to receive the highest teachings to attain liberation—nothing more.\"* Chengzhen, knowing that the highest methods were rarely transmitted to female perfected ones, feared profaning the great Dao and merely assented. After more than a year, Ziran sighed: *\"If an enlightened master does not accept me, it must be fate.\"* Whenever she climbed Yuxiao Peak, she saw Penglai across the sea, seemingly not far off, though she feared no master could be found there. Thus, she bid Chengzhen farewell, declaring her intent to journey to Penglai.\n\nShe sold her belongings, donned plain robes, and ceased eating grain. Taking only a mat, she cast herself into the sea, drifting upon the waves. A Silla ship spotted her and took her aboard. After several days at sea, the water turned deep blue. At sunset, distant waves surged, and phosphorescent fires stretched to the horizon, the ship sailing through flames. A year later, the wind carried the ship into waters black as ink, then white as powder, then crimson like cinnabar, and finally yellow as sulfur fumes.\n\nSuddenly, the wind shifted, and the ship entered a sheltered bay where a mountain gleamed golden in the sunlight. Fragrant mists rose from its grass and trees, and the beasts and birds were all yellow. The crew disembarked and found every stone, large or small, to be sulfur. The merchants hastily discarded their other goods and loaded the ship with the stones. Each time they passed through one of the four colored waters, they performed three acts of reverence, the crossing lasting five days and nights. The wind carried them they knew not how far.\n\nAfter another month at sea, a crosswind struck, alarming the sailors. In the distance, a great mountain emerged from the water, its summit lined with over a thousand red banners. The navigator said it was a whale raising its fins.\n\nAgain, on a clear day, a column of qi suddenly rose straight into the sky, towering over a hundred li high, its flanks like a violent storm. This was the well within the whale’s brain—when it exhaled, the qi erupted thus.\n\nOnce more, they beheld strange sea creatures, monstrous beasts, and ghostly spirits in a thousand forms and ten thousand shapes. Then, naturally, they burned incense and visualized Penglai, offering prayers in earnest. In an instant, they arrived at a mountain where forests, blossoms, and birds thrived, mist and haze like spring itself. The navigator ascended the mountain and saw many houses and households in the distance.\n\nZiran said, \"Could this be an immortal mountain?\" But the navigator replied, \"The crew may disembark to rest and wait for a favorable wind.\" Soon, all climbed the mountain and scattered to explore, while Ziran wandered alone to a place where several Daoists stood, their attendants all clad in blue. There were trees whose leaves, stirred by the wind, chimed like metal and stone. The fragrance of flowers and grasses permeated to the bone. Azure phoenixes, frost-white cranes, jade-green pheasants, and five-colored hounds roamed the courtyard.\n\nAmong them stood one figure, crowned with blossoms and draped in rosy clouds, his bearing noble and fair. The blue-clad attendants led Ziran inside, where he bowed in reverence. The Daoist asked, \"Where do you seek to go?\"\n\nZiran replied, \"To Penglai, to find a master and seek deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Daoist smiled and said, \"Penglai lies beyond the Weak Waters, three hundred thousand li from here. No ship or oar can reach it—only flying immortals may arrive. On Mount Tiantai, Sima Chengzhen’s name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace, and he dwells in the Red City. He is a true master—you should return to him.\"\n\nMoments later, the wind rose, and the navigator urged the crew to board the ship, saying the wind was favorable. As they set sail, they were once again swept by a crosswind for three days before reaching the shores of Taizhou. Overjoyed, Ziran returned to Mount Tiantai and recounted all that had transpired to Chengzhen, apologizing for his earlier transgression.\n\nChengzhen said, \"Wait until an auspicious day, and I shall ascend the altar to initiate you.\" Thereupon, he transmitted the Shangqing method. Later, Ziran returned to Shu, and in the first year of the *Zhenyuan* era, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The military commissioner Wei Gao memorialized the event. Pei Xuanjing.\n\nThe Pei clan’s Daoist name was Xuanjing. She was the daughter of Magistrate Sheng of Weishi County and the wife of Li Yan, the constable of E County. From childhood, she was bright and quick-witted; when her mother showed her poetry and books, she read them once and never forgot. Upon reaching marriageable age, she adorned herself with the virtues and appearance befitting a wife, yet her heart remained set on the Dao. She begged her parents to let her dwell in a quiet chamber, where she donned Daoist robes. Her parents, who also revered the Dao, deeply considered her request and granted it, daily offering incense and paying homage to the Daoist images. Though they assigned maidservants to accompany her, they were always sent away. Alone, she seemed to converse with unseen female companions. Her parents spied on her but saw no one. When questioned, she steadfastly refused to speak.\n\nHer thoughts were pure and serene; though her kin often visited, she treated them with ritual propriety, never showing disrespect. At the age of twenty, her parents wished to marry her to Li Yan. Upon hearing this, she firmly objected, wishing only to enter the Dao and cultivate truth in pursuit of transcendence. Her parents admonished her, saying, \"A daughter’s destiny is to marry—this is the proper way for a woman. The time must not be lost, nor the rites neglected. If you enter the Dao, you will have no home in this world for the rest of your life.\" They cited the example of Lady Wei of South Mountain, who had abandoned her heirs to become an immortal. Thus compelled, she married Li Yan, and the wedding rites were fully observed.\n\nWithin a month, she told Li Yan, \"I have long cultivated the Dao, and the immortals forbid me to be your wife. I must sever ties with the world.\" Li Yan, who had long admired the Dao, found her words extraordinary. He then secluded himself in a quiet chamber to meditate, where one night he heard voices and laughter. Suspicious but hesitant to disturb her, he peered through a crack in the wall and saw the room filled with radiant light and a fragrant, otherworldly scent. Two maidens, about seventeen or eighteen, with phoenix-like hair and rainbow-hued robes, stood gracefully beside her, attended by several handmaidens in cloud-like coiffures and elegant attire. Xuanjing conversed with the two maidens. Astonished, Li Yan withdrew.\n\nAt dawn, he asked Xuanjing about it, and she replied, \"Yes, they were celestial maidens from Kunlun who came to visit. The immortals already knew you were spying and sent guards to stop you, though you did not notice. If they come again, do not spy, lest you be punished by the divine officials. Yet my karmic bond with you is shallow, and I shall not remain in the mortal world much longer. The Lord of the Dao, considering your lack of heirs, will speak to the immortals on your behalf when they next visit.\" One night a year later, a celestial maiden descended into Li Yan’s chamber. Later, she returned and presented him with a boy, saying, \"This is your son. Xuanjing will soon depart.\" Three days later, five-colored clouds swirled, immortal maidens played music, and a white phoenix bore Xuanjing into the heavens, vanishing toward the northwest.\n\n---\n\nThe Qi clan’s Daoist name was Xiaoyao. She was from Nangong in Jizhou. Her father taught students to support the family. At over ten years old, Xiaoyao was already of a pure and serene disposition, eschewing childish games and harboring a love for the Dao. Her parents, aware of this, often performed hidden acts of kindness for others. Her father entrusted her with moral teachings, but she would say, \"These are but the concerns of ordinary people.\" Instead, she took up the *Daodejing* and Daoist scriptures, reciting them without cease.\n\nWhen matchmakers came to her home, her family deemed it inauspicious. By twenty, her parents married her to Ji Xun of the same village, a farming and weaving household. Her in-laws were harsh, reproaching her for laziness in silkworm rearing and farming. Yet Xiaoyao devoted herself to purity, fasting, and meditation from dawn to dusk, paying no heed to worldly affairs. Her husband and in-laws repeatedly scolded her, so she pleaded with them to let her return to her parents’ home. Once there, they forced her back.\n\nDeclaring her inability to attend to worldly matters, she wished to dwell alone in a quiet chamber to cultivate the Dao and thus support her in-laws. Ji Xun and her parents, suspicious, confined her to a room. There, Xiaoyao subsisted only on fragrant water, fasting and meditating in stillness. She sang:\n\n*\"Laughing to see the sea turn to dust,\nParting from the immortals before the Queen Mother’s flowers.\nAfter a thousand years, I return to heaven,\nWith a heart that cherishes the people of this world.\"*\n\nHer husband’s family and neighbors all deemed her mad and possessed.\n\nThat night, voices were heard conversing within the chamber, yet at dawn, she was seen sitting alone, undisturbed. Three days later, at daybreak, the household heard a thunderous crack as if the house were splitting. They saw only her discarded garments and shoes left in the room. Looking up to the mid-heavens, they beheld clouds and mist ablaze with radiance, phoenixes and cranes soaring and calling, accompanied by celestial music. Fragrant incense, colored banners, and ranks of attendants filled the air. Xiaoyao and a host of immortals appeared amidst the clouds, speaking farewell words that could be clearly heard.\n\nJi Xun rushed to inform Xiaoyao’s parents, who arrived just in time to witness the spectacle. The townspeople and villagers all hurried to watch, none failing to marvel in astonishment. *The Upper Scroll of Continued Biographies of Immortals concludes.*\n\nTwelve Hidden Transcendents\n\n**Sun Sixuan**\n\nSun Simiao, a native of Huayuan in Jingzhao, began his studies at the age of seven, reciting a thousand words each day. As he grew, he delved deeply into the teachings of Zhuangzi, Laozi, and the Hundred Schools. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Zhou, amid the turmoil of the royal house, he withdrew to Mount Taibai to study the Dao, refining his qi and nurturing his form, seeking the means to transcend the world. Proficient in astronomy and calendrical calculations, he mastered medicine and pharmacology, scrutinizing voices and complexions with profound compassion. In all his actions, he practiced hidden virtue, strengthening his resolve and aiding others as his foremost duty.\n\nOnce, while traveling, he saw a man about to kill a small green snake, already wounded and bleeding. Simiao pleaded with the man, offering his own clothes in exchange to save it. He applied medicine to the wound and released the snake into the grass. Over a month later, while traveling again, he encountered a young man in white, accompanied by a grand retinue of servants and horses. The youth dismounted, bowed deeply, and thanked Simiao, saying, \"My younger brother was saved by the Daoist master. My parents wish to meet you.\" Simiao, who had saved countless lives with his medicines, paid little heed. The youth persisted, bowing repeatedly, and offered a spare horse to carry Simiao, traveling swiftly as if flying.\n\nThey arrived at a city with blossoming trees and spring scenery, its gates resplendent and streets bustling, resembling a royal residence. The youth led Simiao inside, where a dignified man in a white cap and crimson robe, surrounded by attendants, greeted him warmly. \"We have long thought of the Daoist master,\" he said. \"My son was recently injured by a foolish man, but thanks to your act of ransoming him with your clothes, his life was spared. The debt of gratitude for his rebirth is immense.\" Soon after, Simiao was led into an inner chamber, where a middle-aged woman and a young servant boy emerged, bowing repeatedly to thank him. \"This foolish child was harmed, but you saved him from danger.\" Simiao recalled saving the green snake and marveled at the coincidence. Around him, palace maidens and attendants addressed the capped man as \"Your Majesty\" and the woman as \"Consort.\" Perplexed, Simiao discreetly inquired and was told, \"This is the Water Palace of Jingyang.\" The capped man ordered his officials to prepare a feast with music and entertainment for Simiao, who declined, explaining that he practiced breath refinement and abstained from grains, drinking only wine.\n\nAfter three days of hospitality, they asked what Simiao desired. He replied, \"I dwell in the mountains, delighting in the Dao, cultivating truth and refining my spirit. Though my eyes may wander, my heart harbors no desires.\" They presented him with fine silk, pearls, and gold, but he firmly declined. \"Does the Daoist master not value these?\" they asked. \"How then can we repay you?\" They then ordered their son to bring thirty medical formulas from the Dragon Palace, saying, \"These are fitting for a true Daoist, capable of saving lives and aiding the world.\" Soon after, they arranged for servants and horses to escort Simiao back to the mountain, leaving him deeply astonished. Testing the formulas, he found them miraculously effective.\n\nLater, he compiled the *Essential Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces* in thirty volumes, incorporating the Dragon Palace’s formulas. He also authored the *Pulse Classic*, using voice and complexion to diagnose illnesses, both of which gained widespread circulation. When Emperor Wen of Sui served as regent, he summoned Simiao to serve as Erudite of the National University, but Simiao declined. He once told others, \"In fifty years, a sage will emerge, and I shall assist him to aid the people.\"\n\nEmperor Taizong of Tang summoned him to the capital, astonished by his youthful appearance. \"Truly,\" he sighed, \"those who possess the Dao are worthy of reverence. The tales of immortals like Xianmen are no empty words.\" He offered Simiao a noble rank, but Simiao firmly refused. In the early reign of Emperor Gaozong, he was appointed Remonstrance Grandee, but again declined. At over ninety years of age, his hearing and vision remained sharp.\n\nLu Zhaolin of Fanyang, renowned yet afflicted by a severe illness, lamented the disparities in fate and the mysteries of longevity. He asked Simiao, \"What is the Way of a great physician in curing illness?\" Simiao replied, \"I have heard that one who speaks well of Heaven must ground it in humanity, and one who speaks well of humanity must root it in Heaven. Heaven has its four seasons and five phases, alternating between cold and heat. Its movements bring harmony as rain, fury as wind, condensation as frost and snow, and expansion as rainbows—these are the constant patterns of Heaven and Earth. Humans have their four limbs and five viscera, waking and sleeping, breathing in and out. Their circulation manifests as constructive and defensive qi, their vitality as complexion, and their spirit as voice—these are the constant patterns of humanity. The Yang employs its essence, the Yin its form; this is what Heaven and humanity share. When these patterns falter, steaming generates heat, stagnation generates cold, binding forms tumors, collapse forms abscesses, rushing causes panting, and exhaustion leads to withering. Diagnoses appear on the face, transformations manifest in the body. Extending this to Heaven and Earth, the same holds true. Thus, the five planets wax and wane, stars lose their courses, the sun and moon err in their paths, comets streak across the sky—these are Heaven’s critical illnesses. Untimely cold and heat are Heaven and Earth’s steaming and stagnation. Rocks standing and trees leaping are their tumors. Mountains collapsing and lands sinking are their abscesses. Violent winds and torrential rains are their panting. Untimely rainfall and dried-up rivers are their withering. Skilled physicians guide with medicines and stones, rescue with needles and decoctions. Sages harmonize with virtue and power, assist with human affairs. Thus, the body has curable illnesses, and Heaven and Earth have avertable disasters.\"\n\nHe also said, \"The gallbladder should be bold, the heart cautious; wisdom should be all-encompassing, conduct square and upright.\" As the *Book of Songs* says:\n*\"As if treading on thin ice,\nAs if standing at the edge of a deep abyss.\"*\n\nHe called this \"caution.\" As the *Book of Songs* says:\n*\"Vigorous and martial warriors,\nThe shield and fortress of lords and marquises.\"*\nHe called this \"boldness.\" Not swayed by profit, not burdened by righteousness—this is the square path of benevolence. Seizing the moment to act, not waiting till day’s end—this is the all-encompassing nature of wisdom. His literary talents were outstanding, and his principles and methods were too numerous to record.\n\nEmperor Gaozong later granted him the title *Chengwulang* and appointed him to the Imperial Pharmacy Bureau, but he declined. On the fifteenth day of the second month in the third year of *Yonghui* (652 CE), he rose at dawn, bathed, and donned his robes and cap with solemn dignity. Seated upright, he addressed his descendants: *\"I have been pressed by the world’s demands and have retreated to a mountain grotto to cultivate and refine myself. Soon I shall ascend to the realm of Nothingness, serving in the Golden Towers, and can no longer answer the world’s summons.\"* Moments later, his *qi* departed.\n\nHe left instructions for a simple burial, forbidding funerary vessels, sacrificial animals, or ritual offerings. Over a month passed, yet his complexion remained unchanged. When his body was lifted into the coffin, it was as light as an empty robe—he had already achieved *shijie* (liberation through apparent death).\n\n**Zhang Guo**\n\nZhang Guo secluded himself on Mount Tiao in Changzhou, traveling between the Fen and Jin regions. Contemporaries spread rumors of his secret longevity arts. Elders recalled seeing him as a child, though he claimed to be several hundred years old. Emperor Taizong of Tang and Emperor Gaozong repeatedly summoned him, but he refused. Empress Wu Zetian later called him out of the mountains, yet he feigned death before the shrine of Tuo Nu. It was midsummer, and soon his body began to rot and teem with maggots. When word reached the empress, she believed he had truly died. Later, however, he was seen again in the mountains of Changzhou.\n\nIn the twenty-third year of *Kaiyuan* (735 CE), Emperor Xuanzong dispatched the *Tongshi Sheren* Pei Wu to Changzhou by imperial post to fetch Zhang Guo. Upon meeting Pei, Zhang Guo’s *qi* suddenly ceased, and he appeared dead. Pei burned incense and entreated him, conveying the emperor’s earnest desire to seek the Dao. After a moment, Zhang Guo gradually revived. Pei dared not press him and hastened back to report. The emperor then sent the *Zhongshu Sheren* Xu Jiao and *Tongshi Sheren* Lu Chongxuan with an imperial edict to welcome him. Zhang Guo accompanied Xu Jiao to the eastern capital, where he was lodged in the Jixian Institute. He was carried into the palace by sedan chair, and the emperor treated him with utmost reverence. Ministers and nobles all came to pay their respects. When questioned about matters beyond the mundane, he answered with deliberate ambiguity.\n\nEach time he spoke, he would say, “I was born in the *bingzi* year of Emperor Yao’s reign.” None could fathom his age. He also claimed to have served as *Shizhong* in Yao’s court. Skilled in embryonic breathing, he could go days without eating, though he would occasionally partake of fine wine and *Sanhuang Yuan*. Emperor Xuanzong detained him in the inner palace and offered him wine, but Zhang declined, saying, “Your humble servant’s capacity does not exceed two *sheng*. However, I have a disciple who can drink one *dou*.” Delighted, the emperor ordered the disciple summoned. Presently, a young Daoist descended from the palace eaves as if flying, aged sixteen or seventeen, with a handsome countenance, refined demeanor, and articulate speech, his manners impeccable. Emperor Minghuang bade him sit, but Zhang Guo said, “My disciple has always stood by my side; it would not be proper to grant him a seat.” The emperor gazed at him with even greater delight and offered him wine. After drinking a *dou*, he showed no signs of intoxication. Zhang Guo cautioned, “Do not press him further, for exceeding his limit may lead to mishap and fail to amuse Your Majesty.” The emperor insisted, and suddenly wine gushed from the disciple’s crown, his hat bursting open and transforming into a comb. The emperor and his consorts all laughed. When they looked again, only a golden comb lay on the ground. Turning it over, it held exactly one *dou*. Upon examination, it proved to be a comb from the Jixian Institute. Zhang Guo’s immortal arts were tested repeatedly, yet his wonders knew no end.\n\nThereupon, the emperor issued an edict: “Master Zhang Guo of Changzhou is one who roams beyond the mundane. His immortal traces are lofty, his heart enters the profound, and he blends with the dust yet answers the summons to the palace. None know the count of his years, and he is said to be a man of the age of the *Xi Huang*. Well-versed in the pivot of the Dao, he fully embodies the mysteries of the ultimate. Now, in accordance with the rites of the crane-borne edict, we honor one of the transcendent lineage. Let him be appointed *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu* and granted the title *Master of Penetrating the Mysteries*.”\n\nZhang Guo pleaded old age and illness, begging to return to Changzhou. The emperor bestowed upon him three hundred bolts of silk, along with two attendant disciples, and provided post horses for their journey. Upon reaching Changzhou, one disciple accompanied him into the mountains. At the beginning of the *Tianbao* era, Emperor Minghuang dispatched another special edict, but upon hearing of it, Zhang Guo suddenly passed away. His disciples buried him, yet when the coffin was later opened, it was found empty.\n\nXu Xuanping\nXu Xuanping was a native of She in Xin’an.\n\nDuring the *Jingyun* era of Emperor Ruizong, Xu Xuanping secluded himself in the southern valley of Chengyang Mountain, where he built a hut to dwell in. None knew of his diet or elixirs—only that he ate nothing. His complexion remained that of a man of forty, and his stride outpaced galloping horses. At times, he carried firewood to sell. He always hung a gourd and a crooked bamboo staff, and when drunk, he would stagger homeward, chanting alone:\n\n*With firewood at dawn I set out to sell,*\n*With wine at dusk I return west.*\n*Passersby, ask not where I go—*\n*Through white clouds I tread,*\n*Into emerald peaks I wend.*\n\nFor over thirty years, he aided those in peril or distress. Many in the city sought him, but he was never seen—only poems left upon his hut’s walls, such as:\n\n*Thirty years in reclusion spent,*\n*A hut on southern peaks I’ve built.*\n*At quiet night, the bright moon I dine,*\n*At idle morn, the jade spring I sip.*\n*Woodcutters sing on the ridge,*\n*Valley birds play ‘fore the crags.*\n*Joyful, I forget age,*\n*And all reckoning of years.*\n\nThose fond of such verses spread them widely. Travelers to Chang’an inscribed them at post stations along the roads of Luoyang, Tong, and Hua. During the *Tianbao* era, Li Bai, leaving the Hanlin Academy, journeyed through these stations. Upon reading the poems, he sighed in admiration: *\"This is the verse of an immortal.\"* He inquired among the locals and learned of Xuanping’s story. Thereupon, Li Bai traveled to Xin’an, fording streams and climbing mountains in search of him, but to no avail. He then inscribed upon the hut’s wall:\n\n*I heard the poem at the post station,*\n*And came to seek the true man’s abode.*\n*Misty peaks obscure his lofty traces,*\n*Clouded cliffs bar the great void.*\n*Peering in, the courtyard lies desolate,*\n*Leaning on my staff, I stand in vain.*\n\nThe transcendent crane soars beyond the distant heavens,\nIts return awaits a thousand years and more.\nThat winter, wildfire consumed his hut,\nAnd none knew where Xuanping’s traces had gone.\n\nOver a hundred years later, in the seventh year of *Xiantong*, an old woman from the household of Xu Mingnu, a prefectural resident, often followed companions into the mountains to gather firewood. One day, alone in the southern mountains, she saw a man seated upon a rock, eating a peach of remarkable size. He asked her, *\"Are you from Xu Mingnu’s household?\"* *\"I am Xuanping, ancestor of Mingnu.\"* The old woman said, *\"I have long heard you attained immortality years ago.\"* He replied, *\"Return and tell Mingnu I dwell in these mountains. Take this peach to eat, but do not carry it out—the mountains teem with tigers and wolves, and the mountain spirit cherishes this fruit.\"* The old woman ate the peach, finding it surpassingly sweet, and soon finished it. Xuanping sent her home with the woodcutters. When she recounted this to Mingnu’s clan, all marveled, and the tale spread throughout the prefecture. Thereafter, the old woman’s complexion grew ever more youthful, her step lighter and swifter than before. From the *Zhonghe* era onward, war and famine followed in succession, and the people lived in unrest. Mingnu’s family relocated to escape calamity, and the old woman entered the mountains, never to return. To this day, woodcutters sometimes glimpse her—clad in vines, moving swift as flight—pursuing her, she ascends the trees and vanishes.\n\nLiu Shang\nLiu Shang was a native of Pengcheng, whose family resided in Chang’an. From youth, he loved learning, possessed a prodigious memory, and devoted himself to literary composition. His *Eighteen Stanzas of the Barbarian Flute* gained wide renown, recited even by children and women. Passing the imperial examinations, he served in the central bureaucracy as a gentleman. Fond of Daoist arts, he treated any Daoist he met as a master, diligently practicing alchemy and qi-cultivation. Often he lamented the fleeting passage of time, the gradual decline of his body, the futility of rushing about from dawn to dusk, the weariness of worldly toil, and the emptiness of official rank. The sages of old sought the Dao while holding office, many attaining transcendence. Now, having fulfilled his marital duties and freed himself from worldly desires, how could he be inferior to those who wandered afar? Thereupon, citing illness, he resigned his post and set out on a Daoist journey.\n\nArriving in Guangling, he encountered a Daoist selling medicine in the city streets, drawing large crowds. The remedies were said to be highly efficacious. Among the throng, the Daoist fixed his gaze on Shang with peculiar intensity, then ceased selling, took his hand, and ascended a tower, where they drank together. The Daoist spoke of events from the Qin and Han dynasties as if he had witnessed them firsthand. Astonished, Shang revered him as a teacher. The Daoist then said, *\"The Way of immortals is not easily attained.\"* As dusk fell, Shang returned to his lodging, while the Daoist descended the tower and vanished without a trace. Shang was all the more astonished.\n\nThe next day, he sought the Daoist in the streets again. The Daoist was still selling medicine and, seeing Shang, rejoiced even more. Once more, he led Shang to the wine tower, where they drank deeply and conversed merrily. Producing a small medicine pouch, the Daoist playfully recited:\n*\"Should you come to Yangzhou with naught to do,*\n*We’ll embrace and mount the wine tower anew.*\n*This pouch I bestow as a parting gift—*\n*What more could you seek in a thousand years?\"*\nShang memorized the verse, and as evening fell, they parted. Thereafter, he searched for the Daoist repeatedly but never saw him again. Opening the pouch, he found a gourd wrapped in layer upon layer of paper, containing nine pills the size of sesame seeds. Following the Daoist’s oral instructions, he swallowed them and instantly felt his spirit invigorated, his hunger dispelled, his body light and buoyant. Crossing the river, he traveled to Mount Mao, then later to Zhanggong Cave in Yixing. In springtime, enamored of the scenery at Huafu Creek, he built a hut at Hufu Shoal and secluded himself in the mountains. Woodcutters still sometimes glimpse him—*\"That is Gentleman Liu of the Secretariat!\"*—yet none know where he now abides. He has become an earthbound immortal.\n\nLiu Pu\nLiu Pu, styled Gang and nicknamed Yige, was the younger brother of Zhan. Though his family was poor, he was fond of the Dao. A Daoist once passed his home and, seeing Pu, regarded him with interest. He asked, *\"Do you know the Dao?\"* *\"I do.\"*\n\nLiu possessed a nature steeped in worldly qi, his destined vocation yet unfulfilled—how could he so hastily claim mastery of profound learning? The Daoist asked, *\"Can you take me as your teacher?\"* Pu replied, *\"How dare I presume?\"* Thereupon he became his disciple.\n\nThe Daoist instructed him to dwell in the mountains in pursuit of the Dao, with no need for formal attire. Pu then bound his hair in a topknot and donned rough cloth, following the Daoist into Mount Luofu. Though both Pu and Zhan studied books and composed essays, Pu’s nature inclined toward lofty ideals, while Zhan’s heart yearned for glory and advancement. Pu once told Zhan, *\"I will surely fail the examinations, then wander free in the mountains and wilds. If you succeed, you will toil in the dust of the world—your aspirations will never match mine. Yet be cautious in wealth and rank; forty years hence, this shall be proven.\"* Zhan replied, *\"Immortals are distant and difficult to seek. Even Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi spared no effort, yet the halls of power lie close at hand, easily attained. Men like Ma Zhou and Zhang Jiading may yet follow in their footsteps.\"*\n\nThereafter, Pu devoted himself ever more intently to the Dao, eventually secluding himself on Mount Luofu. Zhan passed the imperial examinations, placing in the seventh year of Huichang, and repeatedly held eminent offices. Upon ascending to the rank of chief minister, he earned renown for his harmonizing governance. Soon after, he was demoted and sent southward. Stopping at Chaotai in Guangzhou, he moored his boat by the riverside. Suddenly, a youth in a topknot and rough cloth strode through the pouring rain, his clothes and shoes untouched by moisture, seeking to see Zhan. The attendants were astonished, and when asked, the youth simply said, *\"Yige has come.\"* They reported this to Zhan, who inquired about his appearance. When told, Zhan gasped in amazement and welcomed him in.\n\nPu’s countenance appeared no older than twenty, while Zhan had already withered with age. Now a disgraced official, Zhan was overwhelmed by grief and joy. Afterward, Pu admonished him: *\"We are brothers, as close as flesh and bone. The words I spoke long ago have now come to pass—forty years have passed.\"* Zhan sighed deeply and asked Pu, *\"Can I still cultivate the Dao?\"* Pu replied, *\"You have pursued honor and favor, tasked with harmonizing yin and yang. In your thoughts and actions, how could you avoid harm?\"*\n\nHad it not been your elder brother from my own family who had already ascended as a celestial immortal, how could I have saved you? Today, I have come only to bid you farewell, not to rescue you.\" They then boarded a boat together, reminiscing about the long years of separation. One evening, Pu suddenly vanished without a trace. To this day, he is occasionally seen in the mountains of Luofu.\n\nZhan then journeyed south and died in exile.\n\n**Luo Wanxiang**\nLuo Wanxiang, whose origins are unknown, was a man of letters well-versed in astronomy and profoundly skilled in the *Book of Changes*. His conduct was noble and unconventional, and he wandered the world as a commoner. He dwelled for many years on Wangwu Mountain before traveling south to Luofu Mountain, where he sighed, *\"This is the Crimson Clarity Grotto-Heaven, where Ge Zhichuan once refined his elixirs. Though no Deng Yue remains to detain me, I shall linger here for a time.\"* Enamored of the scenery at Stone Tower, he built a hut at the mountain’s base and took up residence.\n\nFor decades, he consumed yellow essence and practiced qi absorption. Sometimes he ventured to Zengcheng or Quanshan to gather herbs by the waterside, or entered the cities of Fu and Guang to sell medicine and drink wine, his comings and goings unpredictable. A single meal of his could surpass what ten men might eat, yet at other times, he would go without food for months, oblivious to the passage of time. His body was light and agile, capable of traveling three or four hundred li in a day. When he walked slowly, even galloping horses could not overtake him. Later, he returned to his hut by Stone Tower and never emerged again, vanishing into the mountains. His ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n**Li Jue**\nLi Jue was a native of Jiangyang in Guangling. His family lived in the city, making their living as grain merchants. Though Li Jue was by nature upright and meticulous—unlike his peers—at fifteen, he began assisting his father in the trade. When his father traveled elsewhere, Li Jue managed the business alone. If someone came to buy grain, he would hand them a measure and let them serve themselves, never adjusting the price based on market fluctuations. He sought only two coins of profit per *dou*, using the earnings to support his parents. Over time, their household grew prosperous. His father, puzzled, questioned him, and Li Jue explained truthfully. His father said, *\"In our line of work, most merchants manipulate their measures—giving less when selling, taking more when buying—to seek greater profits. Though officials inspect weights and measures in spring and autumn, they can never fully eradicate the practice. I have long despised such tricks, using the same measure for both buying and selling, believing it fair. Yet even I cannot match your honesty—letting customers measure the grain themselves. Our abundance must surely be the aid of divine spirits.\"*\n\nAfter his parents passed, Li Jue, now over eighty, never abandoned the trade. Later, when another Li Jue became chancellor and was appointed military commissioner of Huainan, the grain merchant, sharing the same name, was alarmed and changed his own to *Kuan*. After the chancellor took office, he devoted himself to Daoist cultivation. One night during a fast, he dreamed of entering a grotto palace, where spring scenery unfolded in vibrant splendor—flourishing flowers, soaring phoenixes and cranes, iridescent clouds, and radiant mists—with pavilions stretching endlessly. Wandering beneath them, he saw a gleaming stone wall inscribed with golden characters listing names, including his own, each over two *chi* in length. Overjoyed, he thought, *\"Born in an enlightened age, I have held high office and risen to the rank of chancellor—surely my virtue has benefited the world? Now my name appears in this grotto-heaven; I must be an immortal!\"* As he exulted, two immortal youths emerged from either side of the stone wall. Li Jue asked, *\"What place is this?\"* They replied, *\"The Grotto-Heaven of Huayang.\"* *\"This name is not yours,\"* they added. Startled, he pressed, *\"If not mine, then whose?\"* The youths answered, *\"This is the name of a commoner from Jiangyang District.\"*\n\nUpon waking, Li Jue recalled the dream in detail, astonished. He consulted Daoist masters, but none could explain it. He then considered summoning officials from Jiangyang to inquire, but none recognized the name. Finally, he ordered a search throughout the prefectural city and its outskirts for anyone with the same name. After days of effort, the people of the streets and alleys directed him to Li Kuan, formerly known as Jue. When the chancellor heard this, he sent a carriage to welcome him into the prefectural residence, providing him with fine quarters. After fasting and bathing, the chancellor bowed to Li Kuan as his Daoist elder brother, and his entire household revered him, paying homage morning and night.\n\nLi Kuan was by nature serene and indifferent, his Daoist bearing refined and striking. His beard, over a *chi* long, was pure white and lovely. At sixty, a Daoist had taught him embryonic breathing, and he had gone without food for many years. The chancellor’s respect for him only deepened. After a month, he asked, *\"Elder brother, what Daoist arts have you mastered? What elixirs have you refined?\"* He explained his dream of the grotto-heaven and the stone wall’s inscription, adding that the immortal youths had pointed to Li Kuan’s name. Thus, he had invited him to become his teacher, hoping to receive instruction. Li Kuan demurred, claiming no knowledge of Daoist arts or elixir refinement. The chancellor pressed further, asking what practices he had undertaken. Li Kuan, a simple man unaware of cultivation, truthfully described his grain-trading life. After repeated questioning, the chancellor sighed in admiration: *\"This is a feat few ordinary men could achieve—your hidden merit is beyond compare.\"* He added, *\"Now I understand: even in wealth and honor, one’s actions may bring harm. Yet in poverty and lowliness, a sincere heart earns divine favor. Your name inscribed in the immortal registry serves as a warning to the worldly.\"* He then asked about Li Kuan’s embryonic breathing and fasting, to which Li Kuan answered honestly. The chancellor began practicing embryonic breathing under his guidance.\n\nLater, Li Kuan lived to over a hundred, his body extraordinarily light and agile. One day, he told his descendants, *\"I have lingered in this world for many years. Though I have nurtured my qi, it brings no benefit to you.\"* That night, he passed away. Three days later, his coffin split open. When they opened it, his clothes and belt remained untied, like the molted shell of a cicada—he had achieved liberation in death.\n\nWang Kejiao was a native of Kunshan in Suzhou. He made his living by farming and fishing, dwelling in Zhaotun Village south of the Song River. At over thirty years of age, none knew of his Daoist inclinations. He often took great delight in catching large fish, which he would bludgeon to death, boil, and eat with pounded garlic and chives, declaring there was no greater joy.\n\nOne day, as he poled his fishing boat into the river, singing loudly with his oar raised, he had rowed several *li* when he suddenly saw a painted pleasure barge adorned with colorful flowers drifting in the current. Aboard were seven Daoists, all youths, their jade crowns draped in rosy clouds, each clad in robes of different hues. More than ten attendants with cloud-like topknots stood by, along with four others in yellow caps steering the vessel. One called out Wang Kejiao’s name. Startled, he did not notice his fishing boat had already drawn near the barge. A Daoist ordered the attendants to bring Kejiao aboard. Before the seven, each had a green jade tray, their wine vessels and fruits all luminous and translucent—none of which Kejiao recognized. Over a dozen female musicians held instruments at the ready.\n\nKejiao stood at a distance at the end of the feast, bowing humbly to the seven. They regarded him, and one said, *\"A fine bone structure—you are fit for immortality. Yet born into lowly commonness, your destiny has already been scorched.\"* They offered him wine. The attendant poured it into the goblet, but though he poured again and again, no wine emerged. The attendant reported this in full. The Daoist said, *\"Wine is a numinous thing. If it had entered your mouth, it would have transformed your bones. That it does not pour is also a matter of fate.\"* Another said, *\"Give him chestnuts to eat.\"*\n\nSuddenly, one among the seven took two chestnuts from the tray, and the attendant brought them to Kejiao, bidding him eat. He examined them: their husks were green and red, gleaming like dates, each about two inches long. When he bit into one, he found a pit inside—unlike any chestnut of the mortal world—its flesh crisp and sweet. After a long while, he had finished them both.\n\nOne of the seven said, *\"Wang Kejiao has beheld what he was meant to see. Let him depart.\"* They ordered a yellow-robed attendant to escort him ashore. There, by the side of the boat, he searched for his fishing vessel but found it gone. The yellow-robed one said, *\"No need for your boat. Simply close your eyes, and you will arrive.\"* He did as told, and as he shut his eyes, he heard the rushing of wind, water, and rustling trees. When bidden to open them again, he had already reached his destination.\n\nUpon opening his eyes, the yellow-robed attendant had vanished. Before him stretched layered peaks and ridges, towering pines and parasol trees. He sat upon a stone by the roadside and soon saw a gatehouse, with people coming and going. Presently, a group of woodcutters and over a dozen monks approached, asking who he was. Kejiao recounted all that had passed. They asked, *\"When did you leave home?\"* He replied, *\"This very morning.\"* They pressed, *\"What is today’s date?\"* *\"The third day of the third month,\"* he answered. The woodcutters and monks exclaimed in shock, *\"Today is the ninth day of the ninth month—more than half a year has passed since the third day of the third month!\"*\n\nKejiao asked, *\"Where is this place?\"* The monks said, *\"This is before the Waterfall Temple on Mount Tiantai.\"* He inquired further, *\"How far is it from here to Huating?\"* They replied, *\"Over a thousand li by land and water.\"* Kejiao marveled in disbelief. The monks invited him back to the temple and offered him food, but he only claimed to be full, showing no desire for the smell of food—drinking only water. The monks questioned him closely, astonished by his account, and reported the matter to Tangxing County, which forwarded it to Taizhou, where it reached the ears of Prefect Wang Feng.\n\nWang Feng, a devout follower of the Dao, summoned Kejiao and found the tale extraordinary, declaring, *\"The transformations of immortals and gods are unfathomable.\"* Kejiao stood over seven feet tall, his bearing and appearance uncommon, his speech clear and spirited. Feng sighed, *\"This is truly a perfected one.\"* Sharing the same surname, he held Kejiao in even higher regard, presenting him with Daoist robes and sending envoys to Suzhou to inquire after his household.\n\nThey returned with the full account: on the third day of the third month, Kejiao had taken his fishing boat onto the river and never returned. His family had found the boat and, fearing he had drowned, held a funeral for him, his wife and children having already performed the rites of summoning his soul. Wang Feng memorialized the matter to the throne, and an imperial edict praised its marvel. Later, Kejiao returned to his hometown and recounted all that had happened in vivid detail. When he went with villagers to the river, he pointed to the very spot where he had encountered the flower-adorned boat—it remained unchanged.\n\nAfter eating the chestnuts, Kejiao had ceased to eat grain. His movements seemed aided by unseen forces, and he no longer tilled the land or fished. Instead, he took his wife and children to the Four Bright Mountains. Over twenty years later, he reappeared in Mingzhou, selling medicine and sending others to buy wine. The money he earned he gave away to others. He claimed his medicine had been taught by Master Hu, and his wine passed down by the Alchemical Mother of Yuhang. His remedies cured illnesses swiftly, and his wine intoxicated deeply. The people of Mingzhou’s streets and alleys spoke of Immortal Wang’s medicine and wine, saying nothing in the world compared to them. Daoists and laypeople alike painted his likeness, and those afflicted by ailments or malevolent spirits found relief when his image was placed beside them.\n\nOver thirty years later, he returned to the Four Bright Mountains and was never seen again, though some still claim to catch glimpses of him.\n\nLi Sheng, styled Yunju, claimed to be a native of Jiangxia and was born in the jiawu year of Emperor Dezong’s reign during the Tang Dynasty. From childhood, he was keen and perceptive. As he grew, he mastered a wide range of texts, was skilled in composition, quick-witted, and could compose verses extemporaneously. By nature aloof and refined, he studied under a Daoist on Shaoshi Mountain, learning the arts of refining qi and nurturing form. He often wandered the world in plain cloth.\n\nAt the time, Yuan Ji served as the surveillance commissioner of Zhexi, and Bai Juyi governed Qiantang. Both, being old friends of Sheng, admired his literary talent and Daoist arts, and invited him to their company. During a banquet, they asked him, “Born in an age of great peace, why do you not seek honor and emolument but remain in common cloth for so long?” He replied, “I do not serve the world’s summons, and even if summoned, I would not accept.” Then he slowly recited:\n\n*Born into a Confucian family in times of peace,\nThe profound and mysterious weighs heavy, while common cloth feels light.\nWho would chase worldly paths for fame and gain?\nI serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nYuan and Bai marveled at his words, entertaining him with poetry and wine for over a year before he departed to wander elsewhere, his whereabouts unknown.\n\nIn the gengzi year of Emperor Xizong’s reign, after Huang Chao’s rebellion breached the capital, the realm was thrown into turmoil, though the lands south of the Yangtze remained somewhat stable. The military governor of Wanling, Tian Tou, was devoted to the Dao and its guardians. Fifty years earlier, elders in Wanling who had known Sheng as children recalled him, noting that his appearance had not changed from that time—people found this most extraordinary. Tian thus invited him, treating him with even greater reverence as a teacher. His complexion was radiant, his movements nimble, as if he were only a little over forty.\n\nHis hair and beard were jet-black, his pupils square, his teeth sharp and even, like rows of jujube pits. He favored eating stone lotuses, crunching through a *sheng* in moments, snapping each into two halves—something no one could imitate. He could drink two *dou* of wine without getting drunk. Abstaining from grain to cultivate his *qi*, he wore only a single layer of clothing in snow yet his complexion grew ever more ruddy. At times, he would point his middle finger at a lamp, and from over a *zhang* away, the flame would flicker as if blown by the wind. No one knew what elixirs he consumed. When asked about the arts of the Dao and the secrets of longevity, he would deflect with evasive words. Suddenly, he told others: *\"I weary of this world’s endless wars and strife—better to depart.\"* At the time, Emperor Zhaozong had been usurped by Zhu Quanzhong, and Sheng, hearing this, was indignant. The next day, he abruptly ceased breathing, his complexion unchanged. When they lifted him into the coffin, only his empty robes remained. He had lived for one hundred forty-one or forty-seven years. Less than a month later, Tian Tou’s forces were defeated, and disaster befell Sheng—yet he had already sensed it and gone. He had once spoken of this to others, and all who heard it marveled, calling him a sage. Later, many claimed to have seen him in Shu.\n\n---\n\nYe Qianzhao, styled Luzhong, was a native of Jianchang in Hongzhou. In his youth, he studied under the Daoist masters Xu Hao and Er Zhenjun of West Mountain, practicing grain abstention and *qi* cultivation. Once, while dwelling alone in the mountains, a sudden storm arose with thunder and lightning. A man in white robes bowed to Qianzhao, saying: *\"Your virtue and power are perfected, and the immortal registers have honored you with promotion. You shall command ghosts and spirits among men, achieving even greater merits. Now, divine beings are about to descend—you may meet them without fear.\"* Thereupon, Qianzhao burned incense, clasped his hands in silence, and sat. Soon, a crimson-robed immortal descended from the clouds, accompanied by over ten divine generals, all bearing swords and tiger-tally tokens, leading a vast host of ghosts and spirits. Two officials in yellow and green robes each held a scroll. The generals arrayed themselves and bowed to Qianzhao. The immortal said: *\"Heaven commands that you receive these scrolls. The generals, officials, and soldiers are at your service to aid the world.\"* Qianzhao bowed and accepted the celestial writ. As he unrolled the scroll, it resembled a mortal military register. The officials managed the records, and whenever he summoned them, they obeyed instantly.\n\nThereafter, a long whistle from him would stir winds through the valleys; a sigh over water would summon rain across the plains; stamping his foot would rumble thunder through the earth; and tracing his hand through the air would flash lightning before men’s eyes. He wandered the world like a madman, often drunk and reeling through the streets. Yet when he suddenly roared with authority, those who asked why were told: *\"I see a fire here, a drought there—I summon rain to save them.\"* People verified his claims, and indeed, his powers held true. Passing through prefectures and counties, he was often begged to relieve droughts. Qianzhao would prepare an incense table, pray, and rain would fall in moments. If someone requested thunder, he would stamp his foot, and a deep rumble would rise from the earth like the roar of a dragon. When excessive rain refused to cease, he was asked to stop it—he would perform a ritual, and the skies would clear. In winter droughts, when snow was begged for, Qianzhao would stand barefoot in the sun, clad only in a single robe, and whistle. Soon, winds and clouds would gather, and snow would fall through the night.\n\nHe also used talismans to heal suffering, not waiting for pleas—wherever he saw illness, he pitied and cured it. Those afflicted by malevolent spirits would recover merely upon hearing his name. Those who received his talismans never suffered relapse. In the eleventh year of the *Xiantong* era, he traveled to Haozhou, where he heard that the prefect, Liu Fang, had suddenly suffered a stroke and lay near death, beyond the skill of physicians. Qianzhao entered the prefecture with his staff, declaring: *\"By my coming, the governor shall live again.\"* He inscribed three talismans, affixing them to Fang’s shoulder, face, and leg, saying: *\"Drive the wind out through the feet—he will recover in three days.\"* Indeed, a rushing wind exited through Fang’s soles, and after three days, he was restored to health.\n\nFang was a learned man, long devoted to the Dao. Having governed with benevolence, he told his guests and officials: *\"I have followed the Dao all my life, yet suddenly struck by this violent wind, I was swiftly saved by a sage. Dong Feng restored Shi Xie’s soul—perhaps I may be his companion. Truly, this is the reward of the Dao’s power.\"* The people of the prefecture revered Qianzhao. Fang welcomed him to his residence, wishing to take him as a teacher and offering gold and silk in gratitude. Qianzhao abruptly left, and when they searched for him, no trace remained. Later, people in Jing and Xiang saw him, laughing as he recounted the events in Haozhou. Over a decade later, he returned to seclusion on West Mountain, though some still claim to see him.\n\n---\n\nThe Angler Xu, whose name is unknown, called himself a native of Penglai in the Eastern Sea. His speech was refined, often citing histories and classics. Quick-witted and eloquent, he would recite:\n*\"I saw the First Emperor build his stone bridge,\nThe sea god rushed, swelling the tides in fright.\nThough Penglai across the waves may be hard to reach,\nAscending the Three Clarities is not so far.\"*\n\nHe always carried a gourd at his waist, poling a small boat along the shores of Ezhu, upstream to the Three Xiang Rivers, and downstream through the Five Lakes. Often, he would trade fish at riverside markets for wine, drinking and conversing before departing. White-haired enthusiasts who had known him for decades said his appearance never changed. If someone playfully detained him, specifying the type, size, and weight of fish desired, he would catch them precisely as requested—all marveled at this. When he saw someone ill, he would take medicine from his gourd to cure them. The pills were the size of sesame seeds; he forbade ingestion, only allowing them to be ground in wine and applied to the chest and abdomen, whereupon the illness would vanish—his remedies were unfailingly effective.\n\nIf asked whether the medicine could be taken orally, he would say: *\"It can, but once swallowed, you’ll loathe rice.\"* A Daoist devotee who took one pill went without food for a decade, though he still drank wine and water freely. His complexion grew ever more radiant, his teeth and hair unaging.\n\nMany who obtained his medicine lived to eighty or ninety. Lu Shan’s Qian Lang repeatedly took his remedies and attained exceptional longevity. Even now, fishermen on rivers and lakes sometimes glimpse him—when pursued, his boat speeds away like the wind, impossible to approach, for he is a water immortal.\n\nQian Lang, styled Neiguang, was a native of Hongzhou’s Nanchang. In his youth, he studied on West Mountain, becoming a refined scholar. Through diligent discipline and steadfast integrity, he passed the Five Classics examination and held successive official posts, earning renown for his purity and uprightness. Wherever he served, he left behind fond memories, and his contemporaries praised him. During Emperor Wenzong’s reign, he served as Vice Commissioner of Nan’an, later as Minister of the Imperial Household, before retiring to Mount Lu. Deeply devoted to the Dao, he became a disciple of a Daoist from the Eastern Peak, mastering the arts of replenishing the brain, restoring primordial qi, and refining elixirs for longevity.\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, Qian Liu, Prince of Pengcheng of Qiantang, admired Lang’s attainment of the Dao and long life. He welcomed him to Qiantang, treating him with reverence and earnest devotion. By then, Lang was already over one hundred and fifty years old, yet his complexion remained youthful, his step light and vigorous. His great-grandsons, several in number, had all advanced through the classics examinations to become high-ranking officials, their hair already white, while Lang still appeared as a child in swaddling clothes. Qian Liu closely guarded and transmitted his secret arts.\n\nLang remained in Qiantang for over twenty years. One day, he suddenly announced his departure, saying: *\"I have lived in this world for many years, but now the Upper Clarity has summoned me—I must go.\"* Soon after, his breath ceased. For days, his countenance remained as serene as in life, and an extraordinary fragrance filled the room.\n\nWhen they lifted him into the coffin, he had already undergone *shi jie* (corpse liberation). His great-grandson said to others: *\"My great-grandfather was one hundred and seventy years old.\"*\n\n*The Middle Scroll of Continued Immortals’ Biographies* concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**Continued Immortals’ Biographies, Scroll Three**\n\nCompiled by Shen Fen, Former Expectant Official and Magistrate of Shenshui County\n\n**Eight Recluses Who Attained Transformation**\n\n**Sima Chengzhen**\nSima Chengzhen, styled Zǐwēi, was broadly learned and skilled in composition. He mastered the art of seal script, developing a distinctive style known as *\"Golden Scissors Calligraphy.\"* He secluded himself on Yuxiao Peak of Mount Tiantai, styling himself the *\"Master of White Clouds.\"* Practicing the arts of *fu er* (ingesting elixirs), he remained unmoved by repeated summons from Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang. Emperor Ruizong, who deeply revered Daoism, repeatedly honored him with exceptional regard, and Chengzhen finally answered the call.\n\nRuizong inquired about the arts of yin-yang and divination. Chengzhen replied: *\"The *Laozi* states: ‘Reduce and reduce again, until you reach non-action.’ Even what the mind and eyes perceive must be diminished—how could one then pursue heterodox arts to increase cunning and calculation?\"*\n\nRuizong said: *\"To govern the self through non-action is to attain purity and loftiness. But how does one govern a state through non-action?\"*\n\nChengzhen replied: *\"A state is like the self. The *Laozi* says: ‘Focus the mind on the One, let qi harmonize with the Void, follow the natural course of things, and thus remain without partiality—then the world will be well-ordered.’ The *Book of Changes* states: ‘The sage aligns his virtue with Heaven and Earth.’ Thus, the world is spoken of with trust and accomplished without effort. The principle of non-action is the essence of governing a state.\"*\n\nRuizong deeply admired his words and sought to retain him, offering honors and rank, but Chengzhen firmly declined. Soon after, he requested to return to his mountain.\n\nThe emperor bestowed upon him a brocade robe adorned with pearl-embroidered flowers and sent him on his way. Many officials composed poems to see him off. The imperial attendant Xu Yanbo selected over twenty of the finest verses and composed a preface, titling the collection *Records of White Clouds*, which circulated widely in the world.\n\nLu Zangyong had early secluded himself on Mount Zhongnan but later ascended to high office. Seeing Chengzhen about to return to Mount Tiantai, Zangyong pointed to Zhongnan and said, *\"This mountain holds many fine places—why must you go to Tiantai?\"* Chengzhen slowly replied, *\"From what I observe, this is but a shortcut to officialdom.\"* Zangyong flushed with shame.\n\nEmperor Minghuang decreed that an altar chamber be built on Mount Wangwu to house him. Chengzhen excelled in seal and clerical scripts, and his *\"golden scissors\"* calligraphy formed a style of its own. The emperor commanded him to transcribe the *Laozi* in three scripts and to collate its text. He once forged a *\"Containing-Image Mirror\"* and a *\"Quaking-Light Sword\"* as offerings. The emperor dispatched the Minister of Rites, Wei Tao, to his residence to establish a shrine with golden locks, bestowing generous gifts.\n\nUpon returning from his Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, the emperor asked Chengzhen, *\"Which deities preside over the Five Peaks?\"* Chengzhen replied, *\"The peaks are the great mountains of the realm, capable of summoning clouds and sending down rain, serving as the nation’s beacons. Yet immortals dwell there, and separate immortal officials govern them.\"* Thereupon, the emperor decreed that separate temples for immortal officials be established at the Five Peaks.\n\nAt that time, the female immortal Jiao Jingzhen crossed the sea to Penglai in search of a master. Arriving at a mountain, she encountered a Daoist who pointed and said, *\"On Mount Tiantai, Sima Chengzhen’s name is inscribed on the cinnabar terrace, and he resides in the Red City—he is a true master.\"* Jingzhen returned and sought ordination from Chengzhen. Soon after, she ascended to heaven.\n\nChengzhen once descended to address Xue Jichang, saying, *\"Your attainment of the Dao surpasses that of Ren of Taodu Waters. You shall become the Eastern Flower Upper Clarity Perfected.\"*\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, the Worshipful Celestial Master and Chengzhen attended the *Thousand Autumns Feast* at the Longevity Palace. After midnight rituals, they retired behind clouded screens to their couches. Suddenly, the sound of a child reciting scripture arose—clear and resonant as jade and gold. The Celestial Master lifted his robe and tiptoed to peer in, seeing a small sun, the size of a coin, glowing upon Chengzhen’s forehead, illuminating the entire chamber. Drawing closer to listen, he realized the voice emanated from within Chengzhen’s skull. The Celestial Master withdrew and told his disciples, *\"The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: ‘The Nine Perfected of the Mud-Pill Palace each have their chambers, a square inch where this resides.’ It also says: ‘The Divine Lord of the Left, the Master’s Son, speaks the divine language.’ This describes the master before us.\"*\n\nHe had over seventy disciples.\n\nSuddenly, Chengzhen declared, *\"From Jade Cloud Peak, I gaze east toward Penglai—where a transcendent spirit now descends. The Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea and the Lord of Eastern Florescence have summoned me; I must depart.\"* In an instant, he dissolved like a cicada shedding its husk. His disciples buried his robes and cap. At the time, he was eighty-nine years old. The emperor posthumously bestowed upon him the title of Grand Master for Closing Rectification, Silver and Azure Radiance, and Grand Master of the Orthodox Unity. The emperor personally inscribed his stele, while Wei Qumou composed his biography. Chengzhen’s works—*Arcane Essentials of Cultivating Perfection*, *Chart of Heaven and Earth’s Offices*, *On Sitting in Forgetfulness*, and *Lineage of Ascending Transcendence*—circulated in the world.\n\nCao Dexiu\nCao Dexiu claimed to have journeyed from Green Islet Mountain in the Eastern Sea to wander Jiangxi. For over thirty years, those who saw him found his appearance unchanged. He often walked among the people, healing the sick with talismans and remedies—none failed to recover. A man had a daughter, over twenty years of age, betrothed to be married, when suddenly a malevolent entity possessed her. Every treatment worsened her condition. Her father sought out Dexiu and described her illness in full. Dexiu asked, *\"Does your home lie near a mountain stream? Is there a deep pool or cave nearby?\"* The father replied there was. Dexiu continued, *\"In spring, your daughter strolled by the stream and was spied by a flood dragon, which has seized her essence and spirit, confining them in its lair. Take this talisman and cast it into the pool—soon you will see proof.\"* After the talisman was thrown, the pool’s waters churned violently, erupting with thunderous roars. Moments later, a creature surfaced—over twenty feet long, shaped like a black serpent, its head as large as a great ladle, its skull split open, blood streaming as it perished. The father returned home to find his daughter’s spirit clear and bright, her illness entirely vanished. He then brought silk and wealth to express his gratitude.\n\nDexiu said, *\"I acted only to cure illness—why offer this?\"* He steadfastly refused to accept anything. Dexiu often told others: *\"If your household suffers from illness or hardship, there is no need for silk or wealth—simply come to me for talismans and medicine. Offer me a platter of river fish and a flagon of fine wine, and inform me of your plight; the illness will heal of itself.\"* The villagers followed his words, and none failed to find relief. All revered him as a divine figure.\n\nLater, he suddenly announced to the people: *\"I shall now leave this place and enter the Heavenly Treasure Grotto in the western mountains. Yet next spring, a severe cattle plague will strike. I leave behind a name for you to copy. When the plague comes, make an offering to me and inscribe this name upon the horns of your cattle—they shall suffer no harm.\"* Thereafter, a great cattle plague indeed swept through the land. Within the entire region, those who affixed the name to their cattle’s horns were spared, while those who did not perished. The people longed for him, but he was seen no more.\n\nWang Yuanzhi’s *Traditions* states: *\"Cao Dexiu served as Grand Historian in the Western Jin and later as Minister of Works under the Liang. He attained the Dao of immortality.\"*\n\n**Lüqiu Fangyuan**\nLüqiu Fangyuan, styled Zidafang, was a native of Susong in Shuzhou. From childhood, he was quick-witted and discerning. By the age of sixteen, he had mastered the classics and histories.\n\nLüqiu Fangyuan studied the *Book of Changes* under Chen Yuanwu of Mount Lu. At twenty-nine, he sought the Great Elixir from Zuo Yuanze of Fragrant Grove. Yuanze marveled at him and said to Fangyuan: *\"Have you not heard Laozi’s words: ‘My greatest affliction is that I have a body’? The body arises from non-action and becomes entangled in action; now, returning to the root is called non-action. Non-action means that to speak of ‘non-being’ is to cling to emptiness, while to speak of ‘being’ is to create obstruction. Clinging to either being or non-being results in stagnation. Only when being and non-being are unified, and the mind is utterly serene, can one approach the Dao. Moreover, the Buddhists take this as the essence of Chan, and Yanzi practiced it as ‘sitting in forgetfulness.’ The *Book of Changes* says: ‘No thought, no action; still and unmoving, yet responding and penetrating all things under heaven.’ Their principles converge as one. The *Classic* also states: ‘When you seek to meet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear.’ What is this thing? If you silently comprehend and spiritually realize it, what more could you seek? What a pity—your talent and capacity are lofty; you could truly become a beacon for the gate of the Real.\"*\n\nFangyuan bowed deeply in gratitude and departed. He then journeyed to Hidden Truth Cliff in Mount Xiandu, where he served Liu Chujing and studied the arts of cultivating the Real and transcending the world. At thirty-four, he received the dharma register and esoteric instructions from Ye Cangzhi at Jade Cloud Palace on Mount Tiantai, who transmitted to him all the secret methods of the true scriptures. In his spare time from guarding the One and practicing qi-circulation, Fangyuan devoted himself to the study of masters and histories, as well as ancient texts. Whenever he opened a scroll, he read it through once, committing it all to memory. He often remarked: *\"Ge Zhichuan and Tao Zhenbai are my teachers and friends.\"*\n\nHe abridged the *Scripture of Great Peace* into thirty chapters, distilling its essentials, and his reputation spread ever wider throughout the Jiang-Huai region. In the second year of Jingfu during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Qian Liu, the Prince of Pengcheng from Qiantang, deeply admired Fangyuan’s virtue and Dao. He sought him out at Great Cleansing Grotto in Yuhang and built him a residence to dwell in. Emperor Zhaozong repeatedly summoned him, but Fangyuan, having divined through celestial patterns that the land of Qin would soon become overgrown with brambles and the Tang mandate was destined to change, followed the example of Boyi and Shuqi, refusing to leave the mountains and forests and declining the imperial call. The emperor then issued an edict of praise, bestowing upon him official robes and the titles *Master of Wondrous Being* and *Master of Mystic Unity*, charging him to propagate the Daoist teachings and enlighten the benighted. His numinous deeds became widely known in Wu and Chu.\n\nFrom then on, disciples came to study under him from near and far. He had over two hundred followers, among whom Xia Yinyan of Kuaiji, Dai Yinyu of Qiao, Zheng Yinyao of Rongyang, Ling Yinzhou of Wu, Sheng Yinlin of Guangling, and Zhang Yinzhi of Wudu all mastered the essentials of the Dao and ascended to its inner sanctum. Guangping’s Cheng Zixiao answered a summons to the Qin court, while Xin’an’s Nie Shidao taught in the state of Wu. Anding’s Hu Qianguang and Lu’s Kong Zonglu, along with ten others, all received the subtle principles of refining the spirit through contemplation of the Real. Others drew close to the sagely teachings or concealed themselves in famous mountains, their names no longer recorded.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the second month in the second year of Tianfu, he bathed, burned incense, and sat upright in meditation. He awaited the hour of noon and departed. His complexion remained joyful and at ease, his limbs supple and natural. An extraordinary fragrance lingered for three days without dissipating. His disciples, following custom, prepared him for burial and placed him in a coffin—only to find his clothes empty, his body having achieved liberation. He was interred beside White Deer Mountain near Great Cleansing Grotto. Later, both Daoists and laypeople repeatedly saw him on Mount Xiandu and Mount Lu, where he declared: *\"I have left Great Cleansing Grotto to return to seclusion at Heavenly Pillar Source in Mount Lan.\"*\n\n**Nie Shidao**\nNie Shidao, styled Tongwei, was a native of She in Xin’an.\n\nNie Shidao was by nature intelligent, pure, and forthright, his words and deeds marked by humility and prudence. He cared for his parents with such filial devotion that he became renowned for it, earning deep respect from his village. In his youth, he served as a disciple to the elder cousin of Fangwai Lang Dehui. When Dehui, having left his post as a provincial administrator, assumed governorship of Xin’an, he selected a scenic spot on the eastern mountain of the prefecture to build a retreat, naming it the *Wenzheng Mountain Lodge*. Shidao attended to him with diligent devotion.\n\nAt thirteen, he donned the cap and robes of a Daoist adept. At fifteen, he received the transmission of the dharma register and the essentials of cultivating the True. Later, he traveled to the mountains of Jixi. He once remarked that after reading the *Inner Transmission*, he had learned the method of consuming pine resin. Together with his fellow Daoists, he ascended Mount Baizhang to gather it. The cliffs there soared a hundred *zhang* high, hence the mountain’s name. From its summit, the four directions stretched upward for over a thousand *ren*. One night, they lodged beneath a pine atop the cliff. The sky was clear, the moon bright, when suddenly celestial music arose from the southeast, borne upon purple clouds. Slowly it approached, lingering longer than the music heard at Shijin Mountain. Though Shijin and Baizhang were of equal height, and though thirty *li* of flatland separated them, their peaks stood so close that one could almost converse across the distance—yet the music seemed to drift toward Shijin first. After a while, three rolls of a small drum sounded, followed by the harmonious resonance of metal, stone, pipes, and strings, their melodies intertwining with the rhythmic beat of drums. The tune was unrecognizable, its notes soaring and pure, unlike any mortal music. The music continued from the third watch until the cock’s crow before fading.\n\nLater, when he asked those at the mountain’s base, they too had heard it that night. His companions sighed in wonder: *\"Just as we gathered the numinous medicine, we suddenly heard celestial music—could this not be a response to our sincerity? This is surely an auspicious omen of your attainment of the Dao.\"*\n\nThereafter, he journeyed to Mount Nanyue, where he paid homage at the Jade Clarity Altar and the altars of Radiant Heaven and Azure Jade. Later, at the *Langzhao Immortal’s Abode*, he entered the *Cave of Numinous Source*. It was spring, and he heard that the former dwelling of the Perfected One Cai was not far off, where extraordinary flowers and trees grew. Woodcutters occasionally glimpsed the Perfected One Cai in the vicinity. Delighted, Shidao abstained from grain for seven days. At dawn, he set out alone into the mountains. As he walked slowly, he caught the scent of rare blossoms and, lost in thought, did not notice the approach of dusk. Suddenly, he found himself beside a great stream, where a woodcutter sat by the water’s edge on the sand.\n\nEager to draw near, Shidao saw the woodcutter shoulder his load of firewood and prepare to descend to the stream. Turning back, the woodcutter paused, leaning on his staff, and asked: *\"Where are you going alone?\"* Shidao replied: *\"I seek the Dao and search for immortals, my heart set earnestly upon it. I have heard that the Perfected One Cai dwells in these mountains and wish to pay my respects.\"* The woodcutter said: *\"The abode of Master Cai lies deep within—no one can reach it.\"* Shidao replied: *\"I have climbed vines and scaled cliffs to come this far. If there is a path through the mountains, why should I fear the distance?\"* The woodcutter said again: *\"Night is falling. Go on your way. Beyond this mountain to the east, there are households where you may lodge.\"*\n\nShidao wished to follow the woodcutter, but the man suddenly stepped into the stream, where the water was shallow. When Shidao entered, however, the current ran deep and swift, and he dared not cross. The woodcutter said: *\"You will not be able to cross this stream for another fifty years.\"* He watched as the woodcutter waded across the water and vanished from sight.\n\nShidao turned back toward the east and walked over ten *li* before spotting in the distance three thatched huts surrounded by a fence, with chickens and dogs nearby. As he drew closer, he saw a man of thirty, his complexion pale, who appeared to be a farmer living alone. The man was startled to see Shidao traveling alone in the deep mountains. He asked: *\"Where have you come from?\"* Shidao replied: *\"I seek the dwelling of the Perfected One Cai.\"* The man asked: *\"Did you meet a woodcutter on the way?\"* Shidao said: *\"Yes.\"* The man said: *\"That was Master Cai Daozhe passing by just now.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this, Shidao bowed in reverence and lamented: *\"A fool like me failed to recognize a sage—such is my fate.\"* Night had fallen, and the mountain forest was pitch black, with no place to seek shelter. The man asked again: *\"Where have you come from?\"* Shidao recounted in full his journey from Xin’an in search of the True. The man then permitted him to enter his hut. He gestured for Shidao to sit by the hearth near the bed, saying: *\"I have run out of food in the mountains and have gone to fetch some, but have not yet returned.\"* Shidao said: *\"I have abstained from grain for some time and no longer think of food.\"* Beside the fire, he saw a pot of boiling water and several yellow porcelain jars. The man said: *\"The contents of the jars are edible—help yourself.\"* Shidao lifted the lid of one jar to find tea inside. The man said: *\"Pour the hot water and drink.\"* When he did, the flavor was unlike any ordinary tea.\n\nAfter some time, he wished for more tea. He tried to open another jar, but it would not budge. He attempted the others, but none would open. Shidao marveled inwardly that this did not seem like the home of a villager, though he dared not speak of it. The man retired to another room to sleep and did not rise even as the sun climbed high. With no lamp or candle, he called out from his bed: *\"This is a lonely place. If I suddenly fall ill, I will have nothing to offer you. There are many households in the village ahead—you should go there.\"*\n\nShidao walked several *li* but saw no sign of human habitation, only perilous cliffs. He turned back, only to find he had lost the way to his previous lodging. After walking another thirty *li* or so, he suddenly encountered an old man, who greeted him with delight and invited him to sit upon a rock. The old man asked his purpose in entering the mountains, and Shidao recounted all that had transpired. The old man said: *\"Master Cai and his son both dwell in these mountains. The place where you lodged last night was the home of his son.\"* He added: *\"Your Dao-qi is strong, but your immortal bones are not yet fully formed. How can one endure hunger and thirst and remain here long?\"*\n\nSuddenly, the old man plucked a blade of grass and handed it to Shidao—its form resembled ginger sprouts, yet it stretched over a *chi* in length. Its taste was sweet and fragrant when chewed. The old man then bade him fetch spring water. As Shidao drank, he looked up to find the old man had vanished without a trace. Overcome with grief, he sighed ceaselessly, yet after consuming the herb, he felt his *qi* and strength grow light and vigorous, surpassing even his condition upon arrival. Turning back to follow the mountain path in search of his previous lodging, he found the way blocked by brambles and vines, impassable ahead. Thus, he returned to Zhaoxian Abbey. The assembled Daoist priests greeted him with astonishment, saying: *\"Though this abbey lies near sacred peaks, the surrounding wilderness teems with beasts, and few dare travel alone. Why have you been gone for over a month? We have long feared for you.\"* Shidao replied: *\"I left only yesterday and have but spent a single night away.\"* He recounted his encounter with the woodcutter, his lodging, and the old man. The priests all sighed in wonder: *\"Though we dwell here together in study of the Dao, we have only heard of Master Cai the Perfected—never once have we been granted a glimpse. Yet you, by virtue of your destined affinity with immortality, have already met Cai and his son. As for the old man, we have heard that Master Peng the Perfected also dwells hidden in these mountains—could he not have been Master Peng? In a single day and night, you have encountered three immortals, while a month has passed in the world of men. Truly, this is the fruition of your accumulated practice.\"* Shidao marveled deeply at this.\n\nAfter residing at Zhaoxian Abbey for several more years of cultivation, his longing for his aging parents drew him home to Wen Zheng Mountain. Whenever he ventured into the mountains to gather firewood or harvest herbs, he would sometimes encounter tigers and leopards, which, upon seeing him, would lower their ears, wag their tails, and prostrate themselves upon the ground. Shidao would stroke them with his hand and call to them, whereupon they would rise and follow him. At times, he would place firewood or herbs upon their backs, and they would carry them home for him before departing. Long ago, Guo Wenju of Dadi Cave had tamed tigers in the same manner. Though the mountains near She Prefecture abounded with fierce beasts, none harmed the people—this was the influence of Shidao’s virtue. When his parents inquired about the fruits of his travels and studies, he recounted all that had transpired. Upon hearing his tale, they rejoiced, saying: *\"You have fulfilled your filial duty, and we, through the Dao, have provided for you—how fortunate we are to have such a mother!\"* This, too, was the blessing of their accumulated good fortune.\n\nLater, Shidao set out once more, this time intending to journey to Mount Nanyue and the Nine Doubts Mountains. He had long heard that Master Mei and Attendant Secretary Xiao both dwelled in seclusion on Jade Bamboo Mountain, where many had glimpsed them. Mei was none other than Mei Fu, the former magistrate of Nanchang, while Xiao was Xiao Ziyun, the son of a Liang dynasty noble who, as governor of Shuyang, had fled the chaos of Hou Jing’s rebellion with his entire family and taken refuge in the mountains. Both had attained the Dao in that place. Shidao lingered at the Pure Emptiness Abbey on Jade Bamboo Mountain, his heart filled with longing for Mei and Xiao. Three times he ventured into Yu Mu Hollow, hoping for even a single encounter, before departing with unwavering resolve.\n\nDeep in the mountains, he suddenly came upon a man clad in plain cloth and a black gauze cap, his face bearing the appearance of one around fifty. Shidao bowed in reverence and inquired of him. The man first identified himself as a wandering ascetic, then asked Shidao where he was bound. When Shidao replied that he sought Master Mei and Attendant Secretary Xiao, the ascetic said: *\"I have heard of your diligent pursuit of the Dao and your tireless pilgrimage to renowned mountains—this is no easy feat. If you wish to meet the two masters, I can guide you. Your past karma is most pure, and your name is already inscribed in the Jade Register. Though you may not yet ascend in flight, you shall surely transcend this world.\"* The ascetic continued: *\"I am Xie Tongxiu. I feared you might not recognize me, so I have revealed myself. I once dwelled on Mount Nanyue alongside Peng and Cai, having concealed myself there for three hundred years. I know you have traveled to Donglingyuan, and it was at the behest of the Lord of the Eastern Flower that I was appointed as the earth immortal overseeing the forests of Jade Bamboo Mountain, as well as the land spirit governing the territory of Pure Emptiness Abbey. Our past affinity in the Dao has allowed this meeting. However, Mei and Xiao are presently summoned by the King of the Lesser Caverns at midday and may not return soon—you cannot wait for them.\"*\n\nShidao then bowed devoutly and said: *\"A mortal of the mundane world, I have presumptuously sought the Great Dao, fixing my spirit and intent from dawn to dusk, yet I know not its essential mysteries. I drift upon the sea, unaware of its shores. Never did I dare hope to meet a Daoist master today—this is the good fortune of eons.\"* Tongxiu replied: *\"Your sincerity and devotion are deeply moving. Yet your worldly affairs remain unfinished. Let me first escort you out of the mountains to the place where I dwell.\"* After walking several *li*, they suddenly came upon two thatched huts, newly built and immaculate. Inside were a bed, a mat, a small cauldron, and a fire boiling water—all arranged as if the dwelling of a scholar, though no one was present. Tongxiu bade Shidao sit upon a wooden horse, while he himself sat upon a white stone deer. Presently, a youth with coiled horns brought a tray of tea to Shidao. After sipping it, his spirit felt refreshed and clear. Tongxiu then pointed to a shelf and instructed him to take a scroll. *\"This is the* Book of Plainness*,\"* he said. *\"Study it without ceasing, and you shall grasp its true essence.\"*\n\nShidao wished to remain and study under him, but before he could speak, Tongxiu already knew his thoughts. *\"Your parents are aged,\"* he said, *\"and though you have an elder brother who can care for them, if you wish to travel further south, this is not the time to stay. I have a disciple named Zizhi on the Nine Doubts Mountains. If you go to him, convey my message and show him the* Book of Plainness*—he will teach you its full meaning. If you do not find him, simply cast the scroll into the cave above Mao Ru Stream and inscribe my words upon the stone wall. Zizhi will then impart to you the essential Dao.\"* With that, he sent Shidao on his way. In an instant, Tongxiu vanished, and Shidao found himself outside Yu Mu Hollow, having returned to Pure Emptiness Abbey. The Daoist priests were all astonished, asking: *\"How is it that you have returned after only seven days?\"* Shidao recounted all that had occurred.\n\nTwo of the priests, overjoyed, accompanied Shidao back into Yu Mu Hollow. Upon reaching the familiar place, the rocks, trees, and grasses appeared just as before, yet the thatched huts were gone. They spent the entire day in wistful longing before returning. Shidao had obtained the *Book of Plainness*, its characters legible, all expounding the secret essentials of the Queen Mother of Mount Gui’s governance and transformation of the host of immortals.\n\nEarthbound immortals who cultivate this Way shall ascend to heaven. Mortals who receive it shall leave traces among the grotto-heavens. Yet its profound mysteries defy full comprehension.\n\nLater, Shidao journeyed south to Mount Jiu Ning’s Xiangzhen Abbey. For over a month, he inquired after Purple Ganoderma’s whereabouts, and all spoke of a reclusive scholar by a stream called Mao Ru, though none knew his name. Some claimed to have seen him. Shidao entered the mountains repeatedly in search, but finding no one, he followed Tongxiu’s instruction and left a letter inscribed upon stone.\n\nThereafter, he often dreamed of immortals calling themselves Purple Ganoderma, who resolved his doubts. Upon waking, he remained in retreat for over a year before returning to govern, dwelling there for more than thirty years. Whenever he performed incense offerings, he venerated the true forms of the Two Cais, Peng, and Xie, while compiling his own scrolls of marvels to share with Daoist and layfolk alike.\n\nLater, when Emperor Gaozu of Wu conquered the Jiang-Huai region, he heard of Shidao’s reputation and hoped his virtue might benefit the military and common folk. Summoned to Guangling, Shidao was installed in the newly built Palace of Primordial Mystery. Whenever he ascended the altar to pray for blessings—whether for rain or clear skies—he never failed to move heaven and earth, manifesting auspicious clouds and mist. Thus, the people embraced the Daoist transformation, the land became like the Realm of Huaxu, and customs were worthy of enfeoffment. Though times had changed, he was truly the Emperor’s great minister.\n\nThe court bestowed upon him the honorific titles *Master of Carefree Wandering* and *Master of Governance*, recognizing him as the nation’s preceptor. His disciples—Zou Dekuang, Wang Chunü, Yang Kuangyi, Wang Yongzhen, Cheng Shoupu, Zeng Jingxiao, Wang Keru, Cui Chanran, Du Chongzhen, Deng Qixia, and Wu Zhigu—all grasped the subtle principles, transmitted the Shangqing scriptures, and disseminated the true teachings across prefectures and commanderies. The court honored them with purple robes, illuminating the gates of the Mysterious.\n\nAmong his followers were scholars from Qin, Wu, Qi, Jing, Yan, Liang, Min, and Shu, who came in droves, enduring hardship for years in devoted service. Shidao often said to them: *\"I possess no arcane arts—why have you come from such distances?\"* His disciples replied in unison: *\"In ancient times, Master Zhang dwelled in Shu, and people from all under heaven flocked to serve him. Each was taught the Dao according to their cultivation. Even those who performed menial tasks for years eventually attained immortality. Now, we are but withered bones’ descendants, our days hastening toward decay. We seek to escape the fleeting shadow and aspire to eternal life—how could we not plead with utmost sincerity?\"*\n\nShidao received all with benevolence, never rebuffing their words. He guided each according to their nature, imparting the essentials of the Dao like dew soaking into clothing or the lingering fragrance of orchids and sandalwood clinging to the body. Thus, he resided in Guangling for thirty years, with over five hundred disciples.\n\nHaving long mastered embryonic breathing and perfected his elixir, one day Shidao announced to his disciples: *\"Just now, a black-robed, vermilion-sashed messenger informed me that the celestial officials have summoned me—I must depart.\"* Moments later, an extraordinary fragrance filled the chamber, and cranes alighted near the courtyard, as if divine spirits had gathered. Serenely, he bid farewell and transformed.\n\nWhen his disciples prepared his remains, the coffin suddenly emitted a sound. Upon inspection, they found only an empty husk—his body had dissolved like a cicada’s molted shell. They buried only his robes and cap.\n\nLater, dozens arrived from Yuzhang, claiming to have seen him traveling with a young attendant. Many Daoists and layfolk recognized him and asked: *\"Why have you journeyed so far?\"* He replied: *\"I have been away from Mount Heng for many years—this is but a brief visit.\"* He stayed at old temples and abbeys along his route before departing.\n\nHalf a year later, someone from Changsha reported a similar sighting. He was seen again on the road to Hengyang, returning to the grotto’s numinous source. Woodcutters said he had passed by the stream fifty years earlier—just as foretold.\n\nIn truth, he was a companion of the Two Cais, Peng, and Xie. Concealing his transformations and departing, he left the world longing—such is the way of immortals.\n\nNearly twenty years later, cranes and auspicious clouds frequently appeared above Mount Wen Zheng, circling as far as his hometown in She. His kin and clan believed Shidao had returned, like the verification of Master Lingwei’s crane. His disciples, including Fan Kebao and dozens more, unearthed his buried robes and cap, relocating them to the southern slope of Mount Wen Zheng. They recorded the circumstances in detail and reported them to the throne.\n\nAn imperial edict was issued, stating: *\"Upon review of posthumous honors, let this be established as eternal precedent.\"*\n\nThe origins of this matter are clear—how could they not be recognized? For the Daoist Ritual Master of Huai, Zhe, Xuan, and She Prefectures, the Master of Free Roaming, the Venerable Master of Wen Zheng, the Great Virtue of State Offerings, the Purple-Robed Master Nie Shidao: from youth, he grasped profound principles and early aligned with the true wind. Like a wild crane unbound, like a lone cloud at ease, he wandered beyond worldly ties.\n\nWhen the Grand Progenitor laid the dynasty’s foundations, he was already commissioned for offerings. When the meritorious ministers stabilized the realm, he had long been revered. His Dao and conduct were cherished, crowning the mysteries of the Way. Though he ascended beyond time and again traversed the ages, his legacy flourished ever more across the land. Moreover, upon the Daoist community’s petition and the chief ministers’ memorial, he was to open the sacred precincts and return to his native place. Thus, he was elevated in rank, bestowed with lofty titles, his excellence proclaimed to honor his past deeds.\n\nHe was posthumously granted the title of Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.\n\nAfter Master Wen Zheng departed the royal capital for She, journeying over a thousand *li* of rivers and mountains, morning travels and evening rests were all marked by clouds illuminating the fields and cranes echoing through the sky, as if guiding, following, and sheltering him. Upon reaching Mount Wen Zheng, the signs dispersed after three days.\n\nYin Wenxiang, also known as Yin Qiqi, bore the name Wenxiang and was also called Daoquan. He often called himself \"Seven-Seven,\" and the common folk addressed him as such, though his origins were unknown. He wandered the world, seen by many over long years, yet his age remained unfathomable. His face glowed with a pale radiance, resembling a man of forty or so. Wherever he went, he might change his name, never settling.\n\nIn Jingzhou, he once sold medicines. At the time, both the Tibetan and Han populations of Lingtai suffered severely from epidemics, and those who took his remedies were cured upon ingestion, all calling him a divine sage. The money he earned, however, he gave away to others. He once became drunk in the marketplace, where Zhou Bao, who had known him long before in Chang’an, recognized him. Soon after, the Jingyuan military governor invited him with great courtesy, admiring his arts of the Dao and his methods of returning to the origin. When Bao was later transferred to govern Zhexi, several years passed before Seven-Seven suddenly reappeared, again selling medicines. Hearing this, Bao was overjoyed and summoned him, showing him even greater reverence. Seven-Seven would often sing drunkenly:\n\n*\"The zither plays the tune of 'Green Jade,'\nThe elixir refines white cinnabar sand.\nI brew wine to share in rounds,\nAnd make flowers bloom in an instant.\"*\n\nBao frequently tested these claims, and all proved true. Seven-Seven also sought to plant melons and angle for fish, much like the immortal Ge Xianweng.\n\nAt Helin Temple, a azalea tree stood over a *zhang* tall. Each late spring, its blossoms blazed in radiant splendor. The temple monks passed down this tale: during the Zhenyuan era, a foreign monk from Tiantai had nurtured its roots with medicine from his alms bowl before planting it. Thereafter, the temple’s flower courtyard was sealed off. Some claimed to glimpse women in red robes, dazzling in beauty, wandering beneath the tree. Those who plucked the flowers or broke its branches invariably suffered misfortune.\n\nThe common folk say she is the Flower Spirit. Thus, all cherish and protect the tree, and its blossoms flourish with unmatched splendor. When the flowers are about to bloom, scouts announce their progress in stages, and officials and guests gather daily for feasts of admiration. Later, the entire city—scholars, commoners, and travelers from afar—would revel in celebration, from spring into summer, from dawn till dusk, until the streets nearly abandoned all work.\n\nOne day, Bao said to Seven-Seven, \"The flowers of Helin Temple are the world’s most wondrous. I’ve heard you can make flowers bloom in an instant—could you do the same for these?\" Seven-Seven replied, \"I can.\" Bao said, \"The Double Ninth Festival is near. Can you make them bloom by then?\" Two days prior, Seven-Seven went to Helin Temple and spent the night.\n\nAt midnight, a woman appeared and asked Seven-Seven, \"Does the Daoist wish to make these flowers bloom?\" Seven-Seven asked, \"Who are you, coming here so late at night?\" The woman said, \"I was sent by the Supreme Mystery to oversee these flowers. Yet they have lingered among mortals for over a century—soon, they will be summoned to the Celestial Gardens. Today, I shall bloom them with you. Without you, I could not have been moved.\"\n\nThen, in an instant, the woman vanished. The next morning, the monks were astonished to see the buds slowly unfurling. By the ninth day, the blossoms blazed as brilliantly as in spring, and word reached Bao. The entire city—scholars and commoners alike—marveled, and the revelry resumed as in spring and summer. After several days, the flowers suddenly vanished, with no petals left upon the ground.\n\nSeven-Seven happened to visit the home of an official, arriving just as a banquet was underway. The host and guests rose to greet and honor him. Among them were entertainers and jesters who mocked and belittled him. Seven-Seven addressed the host: \"May I propose a game with two chestnuts?\" They all agreed, expecting some amusing diversion. As the chestnuts were passed around, each recipient detected a strange fragrance and gasped in wonder. Only the two who had laughed at Seven-Seven were transformed into stone, which clung to their noses, stubbornly refusing to fall. They complained of an unbearable stench. The two began to dance wildly, their hairpins scattering, tears streaming down their faces as powder and rouge mingled. The performers, too, broke into chaotic dance, while the drums and music played of their own accord, perfectly in rhythm. When the music stopped, the dancing continued, and the entire gathering collapsed in laughter.\n\nAfter some time, they begged Seven-Seven for mercy. Soon, the stone fell from their noses, reverting to chestnuts. When passed around again, the same fragrance lingered. The hairpins, powder, and rouge were restored to their original state, untouched. From then on, all treated Seven-Seven with reverence.\n\nSeven-Seven poured water and turned it into wine, carved wood into dried meat, and made people walk backward. With a point of her finger, boats would halt; at her call, crows would descend; with a spit, fish would revive. She pinched soil to sketch the land, outlining the contours of mountains and rivers, or gathered reeds to summon ants, transforming them into bustling cities and figures. Those who had traveled the places she depicted said they matched perfectly, though smaller in scale. The wonders she performed were too numerous to record.\n\nTwo years later, Xue Lang and Liu Hao rebelled, and Bao Nan fled to Hangzhou. Bao, the military governor, ruled with harsh justice, punishing even the innocent. The former prefect of Shangrao, Chen Quanyu, passed through his territory and was falsely accused of treason, leading to the exile of his entire clan. Bao, at eighty-three, remained vigorous in body, with over a hundred female entertainers—all thanks to Seven-Seven’s protection.\n\nLater, for his crimes against the innocent and Chen Quanyu, he was suddenly struck down. During Liu Hao’s mutiny, Seven-Seven was at Ganlu Temple, where the monks pushed her off the northern cliff, and she fell into the river and drowned. Some later claimed to have seen her in Jiangxi. Over a decade afterward, she was spotted selling medicine in Shu, but her whereabouts thereafter remained unknown.\n\nThe flowers of Helin Temple were lost when war and fire burned the monastery, their roots severed—truly, they had returned to the board gardens.\n\nTan Qiao, styled Jingsheng, was the son of Tan Mei, Director of the National University. From childhood, he was bright and quick-witted; as he grew, he delved deeply into the classics and histories, his memory sharp, answering all questions without fail. His compositions were elegant and refined. His father instructed him in the pursuit of the imperial examinations, but Qiao had no interest in such a path. Instead, he was drawn to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the various masters, and the *Inner Biographies* of King Mu of Zhou, Emperor Wu of Han, Lord Mao, and the immortals—studying each with meticulous care.\n\nOne day, he informed his father of his intent to travel to Mount Zhongnan. His father, considering the mountain’s proximity to the capital, granted permission. From Zhongnan, he journeyed to Mounts Taibai, Taihang, Wangwu, Song, Hua, and Tai, wandering through renowned mountains without returning home. His father sent letters reproaching him in detail, to which Qiao replied: \"Lord Mao, too, was once a son who left his father to study the Dao. Now I follow his example, hoping it may bring some benefit.\" His father, recognizing his unwavering devotion to the Way, thought it futile to restrain him with worldly affairs and so allowed him to follow his own path.\n\nQiao studied under a Daoist on Mount Song for over a decade, mastering the arts of fasting and cultivating qi. He took joy only in wine, often wandering in a drunken haze, going wherever the wind carried him. In summer, he wore a black fur robe; in winter, a green cloth shirt. Sometimes he spent entire days exposed to wind, frost, or snow. People assumed he had perished, but when they looked closely, his breath flowed gently. His father, ever mindful of him, frequently sent servants to seek him out, always sending clothes and money in spring and winter. Qiao would receive them with delight, then promptly send the servants back with generous gifts. No sooner had they departed than he would take the clothes his father had sent into the streets, giving them to the poor and needy, or leaving them at taverns—keeping nothing for himself.\n\nWhen asked why he acted thus, he replied: \"How could I bear to keep them?\"\n\nThieves steal only what burdens others. Clad in nothing, eating nothing, one is truly free from care—ever joyful as can be. Some called him mad. He would chant as he walked:\n\n*A thread spun to the Yangtze, a fan spread to the sky,\nStraw sandals cast beyond the eastern sea.\nPenglai’s truth lies not in distant land—\nJust there, before Master Tan’s staff, it be.*\n\nLater, he dwelt on Mount Nanyue, where he refined the elixir and consumed it. Thereafter, he entered water yet remained dry, walked through fire yet felt no burn, and could conceal his form or shift his shape. He then entered Mount Qingcheng and was seen no more.\n\n**Du Sheng**\nDu Sheng, styled Keyun, claimed to be a native of Duling in Jingzhao. No one could fathom his age. He ate nothing, yet could drink three *dou* of wine without growing drunk. His complexion was radiant, as if a man of thirty. He wore a square kerchief and a tattered cloth cap, and in winter, a green cloth shirt. His speech was lofty, his learning profound. If someone offered him a new cloth shirt, he would accept it, yet refuse to remove his old one. The new shirt he would give away upon leaving the door, meeting whomever he encountered in the streets. He wandered the markets, drunk and roaming, asking questions as he went.\n\nSkilled in \"sand writing,\" he would trace the character for \"dragon\" in bowls or basins of water, the strokes floating and swirling. At his command, the dragon would rise into the air, over a *zhang* high, vanishing into mist like a wisp of cloud before resuming its small form. When called, it would descend back into the water. In an instant, he could earn much coin, which he would then scatter among the poor or leave at taverns. Day after day, he did this wherever he went, and though people grew weary of giving, none ever tired of him. Some suspected him of bewitching the crowd.\n\nIn winter, he would remain in the snow for two or three days, and people would assume him frozen stiff. Yet when they brushed him off, he would rise slowly, shake off the snow, and walk away as if waking from a drunken slumber—his breath warm as summer, his demeanor that of one roused from a deep sleep.\n\nDu Nuru, son of Duke Zong of Deng, was serving as governor of Suzhou when he heard that Keyun was in the city. Overjoyed, he invited him into the prefectural hall and bowed to him, addressing him as \"Daoist Master.\" The officials and guests were all astonished. Nuru explained: \"When my late father governed Xichuan, he was deeply acquainted with this Daoist elder, who often visited his study. At the time, I was only ten years old, and now I am over fifty. Forty years have passed since we parted, yet his appearance and bearing remain unchanged.\" He then kept Keyun in the prefectural residence, seeking his counsel on the Daoist arts.\n\nKeyun said: \"Simply govern with virtue and care for the people. Be compassionate in your rule. Given the turmoil of these times, one must first preserve oneself before casting off the dust of the world and retiring to the wilds. How can one avoid the scourge of war? The Way of the Dao is vast—who can fathom it?\"\n\nWhenever Keyun entered the prefectural hall, Nuru would offer him money and silk, which Keyun would refuse. Yet once outside the city gates, he would distribute it all to others. Nuru’s reverence for him only deepened. Sometimes Keyun would drink with Nuru’s guests and officials, composing verses in response to their songs. His words flowed effortlessly, profound and rich with immortal themes, leaving others unable to match him.\n\nLater, when war broke out, Nuru was indeed killed by soldiers. Keyun was also seen wounded, his old cloth shirt torn in three or four places, the tatters lying on the ground. Yet days later, many reported seeing him crossing the Song and Zhe Rivers, passing through Hangzhou, Yue, and Qu, then appearing in the markets of Jiangxi, drunk as ever, writing dragons in the sand. A year later, someone saw him in Hunan and asked about Suzhou. He recounted events in vivid detail, as if he had witnessed them himself. Then, laughing, he said: \"I once dwelt on Mount Nanyue. I have lingered in the world long enough—soon I shall return.\" After that, he was never seen again. From all this, it is clear he had mastered the arts of concealment and transformation, though none in the world could comprehend it.\n\n**Yang Yin**\nYang Yin was a native of Mount Tai.\n\nYang Yin held office due to worldly ties and settled his family in Jinyun. Having passed the classics examination, he was appointed as the assistant magistrate of Jiajiang in Jiazhou, but later resigned and returned to Jinyun. His elder brother, Yang Chen, served as the magistrate of Le’an in Taizhou.\n\nYet Yang Yin cherished seclusion in the Kuocang Mountains. By nature serene and withdrawn, he held worldly honors in low regard, favoring instead a life of carefree wandering and a deep admiration for Daoist arts. One day, his wife suddenly died. He remarked, \"Zhuangzi played the lute after his wife’s passing—a true understanding of life’s transformations. Now that she is at peace, is it not fitting to bury her? Our sons have their callings, our daughters their marriages; she is no longer burdened.\" Later, while visiting Ruanlang Pavilion atop a cliff over ten *zhang* high, he found an inscription in seal script carved into the stone, the characters enormous. The world claimed it was a poem left by Ruan Zhao of the Han. Upon closer inspection of the weathered stone, he saw it was in fact inscribed by Li Yangbing, who had once served as magistrate of Jinyun. The poem read:\n\n*Where now does the wanderer Ruan dwell?*\n*At the mouth of the immortal’s cave, clouds drift.*\n*A place untouched by mortal tread—*\n*Today, I walk within its bounds.*\n\nYang Yin lingered by the pavilion, drinking with several Daoist priests from Jinyun Temple amid blossoming flowers. At midday, he suddenly collapsed as if dead, though his breath remained warm. Carried home, he revived after seven days. Villagers and the Daoist priests gathered to question him. He recounted: \"At first, a figure in green robes and crimson garments, who called herself Lingying, invited me into a grotto palace. There, I saw towering pavilions and soaring simurghs and cranes, the sky clear and the air balmy—unlike the mortal realm. Suddenly, from a stone crevice, an object flew out, shaped like a green parasol with a long stem. Lingying pointed and said, ‘This is the Azure Cloud Mushroom. Eat it, and you will attain immortality.’ I was ravenous and, sitting upon a rock, consumed it entirely. The taste was sweet and rich. Lingying said, ‘You were destined for immortality; today, you have met the celestial officials.’ She then led me before three figures: one in a *Yuanyou* cap, another draped in cloud and mist, and the third in formal attire, each attended by a vast retinue. Lingying named them: the Lesser Heavenly King, the Great Master of Huayang, and the Hidden Mystery Celestial Aide. I bowed to each in turn, and they all said, ‘You possess the bones of an immortal but have not yet ascended. You must cultivate further upon the earth.’ Moments later, Lingying escorted me out—through the western gate of the Kuocang Grotto. Only then did I realize where I had been.\"\n\nThereafter, Yang Yin lost his taste for grain, drinking only three *sheng* of water daily and eating a single cup of lilies. His body grew light, his joints supple, rustling like bamboo clappers when he moved. He spoke incessantly, reciting verses day and night as if conversing with unseen companions. Sometimes, he would take two or three hundred sheets of paper and fill them in an instant with dense, unrecognizable script. Yet when he read it aloud, the words formed coherent essays. Daoists and lay admirers transcribed his utterances, finding them elegant and refined, filled with allusions to immortals, Penglai, and the Isles of the Blessed. This continued for a year, his body becoming ever more lithe and vigorous. Skeptics dismissed him as bewitched by some demonic entity.\n\nTwo years later, he no longer ate lilies, subsisting on water and wine alone. After three years, his hair turned black as lacquer, his face smooth as a child’s. He moved as swiftly as if flying and could drink three *dou* of wine without intoxication. He began wearing coarse hempen robes. When asked, \"You have had no master for three years—how have you learned all this?\" he replied, \"None of this is of my own doing; it has all been taught to me by divine beings.\"\n\nLater, he visited his brother in Le’an, departing after a single day. He then traveled to Tiantai, arriving in a day’s time—covering three to four hundred *li* in a day. Returning to Xiandu, he consumed elixirs and cultivated *qi* for over twenty years. Finally, he journeyed south to Weiyu Mountain and vanished. *Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals, Volume the Lower, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "At the outset of cultivation, one guards the One and refines qi, adhering strictly to rules and disciplines, laboring diligently and meticulously, fearful of even the slightest lapse. Yet upon attainment, one undergoes myriad transformations, blending into the mortal world—some concealing themselves in mountain forests, others wandering through city markets. Those who ascend in flight often journey to the islands of the sea; once their merit is sufficiently accumulated, they become immortal officials. The lesser among them remain as immortal folk. Across the Ten Isles, there are no fewer than hundreds of thousands of immortal households, tilling fields of magic mushrooms, measuring their plots in acres, much as one sows rice. There are indeed immortal officials who govern both the immortal folk and the boundary between immortals and mortals. Those who undergo transformation leave behind their forms like cicadas shedding their shells, preserving their qi and stabilizing their bodies within grottoes before ascending to become perfected immortals—truly no empty claim.\n\nI, Shen Fen, have long admired the Dao, yet shamefully remain mired in ingrained habits. From youth to adulthood, all that I have heard from the lofty and virtuous, along with the accumulated knowledge of years, has been etched into my heart. Moreover, as national histories do not record such matters, these affairs scatter among the common folk. Following the warfare of the Zhonghe era, ancestral records remained scarce, and though there were those who took up the brush to chronicle them, the passage of time has rendered their accounts increasingly rare. Alas, were this to continue, their voices might vanish without a trace. Thus, I have compiled these records into three volumes, hoping to provide material for gentlemen of refined interest and seekers of the Dao, that they may have tales to share and that the true immortals may be revealed.\n\n*Continuation of the Immortals’ Biographies*, Volume One\nCompiled by Shen Fen, Gentleman for Court Audience and Former Magistrate of Lishui County\nSixteen Ascended Immortals, including Three Female Perfected Ones\nThe Master of Mystic Truth",

A man of vast learning and literary talent, he passed the imperial examinations. Skilled in painting, he could drink three *dou* of wine without becoming intoxicated. He preserved his true nature and cultivated his *qi*, such that external snow did not chill him, nor did entering water soak him. He traveled through all the mountains and rivers under heaven. The Duke of Lu, Yan Zhenqing, was a close friend.\n\nWhen Zhenqing served as prefect of Huzhou, he often gathered his retainers for feasts, where they composed and exchanged *yufu* verses.

In an instant, five scrolls emerged, depicting flowers, trees, birds, fish, and landscapes—traces of marvels unmatched in ancient or modern times. Zhenqing and his guests passed them around, sighing in admiration without end.\n\nLater, when Zhenqing traveled east to Pingwang Station, Zhihe, flushed with wine, performed a water trick. He spread a mat upon the water and sat alone, drinking, chanting, and singing. The mat moved swiftly to and fro, like the sound of a swift boat. Clouds and cranes followed above him.

      "translated_text": "He wandered the world, and those who had known him as children would see him again in their old age, his appearance unchanged. Later, as he sang and danced between the moats of Liang and the bridges of Hao, he grew drunk in a tavern. Suddenly, the sound of cranes, pipes, and flutes arose, and he ascended lightly into the clouds, casting down his boots, robe, sash, and clappers before vanishing into the distance.\n\nZhu Ruzi was a native of Yongjia’s Angu. As a child, he became the disciple of the Daoist Wang Yuanzheng, residing in the Great Ruo Crag, where Tao Hongjing had once compiled the *Zhen’gao*—hence its other name, Zhen’gao Crag. To the west of the crag stood Mount Tao. Zhu served Yuanzheng with diligence and hardship, deeply admiring the Dao of immortality. He often climbed the mountains to gather yellow essence, which he consumed, persisting for over a decade. One day, as he washed vegetables by a stream, he suddenly saw two flower-like dogs playing on the bank. Perplexed, he followed them into a thicket of wolfberry bushes. Upon returning, he told Yuanzheng, who was astonished and accompanied him to observe. The two dogs reappeared, frolicking, but when approached, they vanished again into the wolfberry bushes. Yuanzheng and Zhu dug together and unearthed two wolfberry roots shaped like dogs, hard as stone. They washed them, took them home, and boiled them. Zhu tended the fire for three days and nights without leaving the cauldron. He tasted the broth—its flavor was sweet and delicious, and he drank without cease. When the roots softened, he told Yuanzheng, who came to share the meal. Moments later, Zhu suddenly ascended into the air above the peak. Yuanzheng was stunned. After a long while, Zhu bid him farewell and rose into the clouds. To this day, the locals call the peak Tongzi Peak. Yuanzheng later consumed the remaining roots and lived an unknown number of years, dwelling in seclusion west of the crag. Woodcutters on Mount Tao sometimes saw him.\n\nWang Lao of Yijun was a native of Yijun County in Fangzhou. He lived in a village, deeply devoted to the Dao, and diligently practiced hidden virtues and good deeds. His wife shared his resolve without wearying. One day, an old Daoist with tattered robes arrived at their door. Wang Lao and his wife welcomed and honored him. After staying for over a month, the Daoist conversed and drank with Wang Lao daily, their rapport deepening. Suddenly, the Daoist developed festering sores all over his body. Wang Lao sought medicine and tended to him with increasing care, yet the sores worsened day by day, persisting for nearly a year. The Daoist said to Wang Lao, \"These sores need no ordinary medicine—only several *hu* of wine to soak in, and they will heal on their own.\" Wang Lao thus brewed wine with meticulous care. When it was ready, the Daoist instructed him to fill a large jar with the wine, saying, \"I will add medicine and bathe in it myself.\" He entered the jar and emerged three days later, his hair and beard turned black, his complexion youthful, his skin smooth as congealed fat. Wang Lao and his family were astonished. The Daoist said, \"This wine can be drunk—it enables one to fly to heaven.\" Wang Lao believed him. Initially, the jar held over five *hu* of wine, but upon inspection, only two or three *sheng* remained. The wine was clear, fragrant, and exquisite, unlike ordinary brew. At the time, Wang Lao was threshing wheat. He, his wife, and the laborers all drank and became thoroughly drunk. The Daoist also drank and asked, \"Can we ascend to heaven now?\" Wang Lao replied, \"I will follow wherever you lead.\" Suddenly, an auspicious wind arose, and green clouds billowed like steam. The house, grass, trees, the entire family, and even the chickens and dogs all flew away. The sound of threshing wheat could still be heard in the air, and villagers who witnessed it were amazed. Only the cats and rats were left behind. When the wind subsided, the hired laborers found themselves beneath trees in a distant village. Later, they no longer needed to eat and all attained longevity. Thirty *li* west of Yijun County lies the village of Shengxian.\n\nHou Daohua claimed to have come from Mount Emei and resided at the Yongle Abbey in Hezhong. He behaved wildly, and the other Daoists all belittled him. Yet Daohua was skilled with an axe; whenever the abbey’s buildings were damaged, he repaired them himself. He climbed perilous heights and traversed treacherous paths, reaching places others could not. He also performed menial tasks: when guests arrived, regardless of their status, he would draw water, wash their feet, and launder their clothes. He tilled the soil, tended the garden, and endured hardship to provide for the community. The others despised him, treating him like a hired servant, but Daohua remained ever cheerful. He was also fond of histories and philosophical texts, never letting a book leave his hands, reciting whatever he read. When asked why, he replied, \"There are no ignorant immortals in heaven.\" The others laughed heartily.",

When given coins, he strung them on a long rope and dragged them along the ground. If they scattered, he never looked back. Sometimes he gave them to the poor, or to taverns.",

      "translated_text": "After more than ten years, a strange light suddenly appeared upon the abbey’s roof beam, which people often saw. Rumors spread that during the Kaiyuan era, Master Liu the Daoist had once refined an elixir, testing it on a dog that died; fearing to consume it themselves, they had hidden it within the beam. Most dismissed this as wild talk. Then, one day, a violent storm damaged the hall slightly. Daohua climbed onto the beam and again saw the light glowing from a hollow within it. He chiseled out the wood and found a box, triple-layered, and inside the innermost golden casket lay the elixir. He swallowed it at once and cast the empty box down. After ingesting the elixir, he showed no immediate change, and the others scoffed, calling him a fraud.\n\nOne day, returning drunk from the market, he came upon the abbey’s ancient pine—a magnificent tree with a canopy like an upturned parasol. He strapped on wooden clogs, climbed the tree, and began hacking off its branches. The other Daoists repeatedly tried to stop him, but he would not relent, declaring as he chopped, “These will only hinder my ascent one day.” The others, long convinced of his madness, grew even more furious. Just then, the magistrate of Yongle County entered the abbey and, seeing the mutilated pine, was astonished. The Daoists explained the situation to him, and the magistrate berated and humiliated Daohua, who remained cheerful as ever.\n\nSeven days later, Daohua rose at dawn, bathed, dressed in fine robes, and lit incense, saying, “The immortals’ envoys will come for me today.” He gazed into the sky and bowed without cease. The others still did not believe him. Soon after, word spread that above the pine before the abbey, clouds and cranes swirled while celestial pipes and flutes resounded. Suddenly, Daohua flew up and sat upon the treetop. The crowd below grew frantic with astonishment. The magistrate of Yongle, his officials, and the local people rushed to the scene, prostrating themselves in reverence—even the magistrate who had once humiliated Daohua now kowtowed until his forehead bled.\n\nDaohua waved his hand in farewell to the assembled Daoists and laypeople: “I have received the Jade Emperor’s decree, appointing me Immortal Attendant of the Terrace of Shao, and Keeper of the Hall of Good Faith in the Upper Clarity Palace. Now I depart.” In an instant, immortal musicians played within the clouds, banners and canopies shimmered faintly, and he ascended into the heavens.\n\nMa Ziran—Ma Xiang, styled Ziran—was a native of Yanguan County in Hangzhou.",

      "translated_text": "Ma’s family had long served as minor clerks in the county, yet Xiang alone delighted in the classics, history, and literature. He traveled the realm with Daoists before returning to the Jiangnan region.\n\nOnce, while drunk in Huzhou, he fell into the Book Brook. After a full day, he emerged—his robes dry—and came floating upon the water. He declared, “Just now, I was summoned by Xiang Yu for a drinking bout and nearly became intoxicated. As I returned to the brookside, the onlookers stood shoulder to shoulder.” The reek of wine assailed them, and he seemed crazed by the wind. Many followed to watch. At times, he thrust his fist into his nose, and when he withdrew it, his nose remained unchanged. Pointing at the brook, he made its waters flow backward for a long while. Pointing at a willow, he made it drift with the current, back and forth. Pointing at a bridge, he caused it to break and then rejoin.\n\nLater, while traveling in Changzhou, he happened upon Ma Zhi, who had just been appointed prefect of the region. Having long heard of Xiang’s reputation, Zhi invited him for an audience and marveled at him. Zhi asked, “Reverend Brother, by fortunate coincidence we share the same surname. Might I offer you a residence, hoping you would grace my administration with your Way’s protection?” Xiang replied, “Why does Your Excellency frown?” Zhi answered, “I am of Fufeng.” Xiang jested, “Your Excellency is a *Fufeng* horse, while I am a *mafeng* ox—we merely know each other, with no claim to kinship.” His words implied that their natures were as distant as wind and cattle. Nevertheless, Zhi detained him in the prefectural lodge, growing ever more astonished.\n\nDuring a drinking gathering, Zhi requested a small display of his powers. At the feast, Xiang took a porcelain vessel, filled it with earth, and planted melon seeds. In moments, vines sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. He plucked and shared them; all the guests praised their fragrance and flavor, unlike ordinary melons. Then, from his sash and socks, he drew forth coins—countless, all true copper cash. He tossed them into a well and called out; each coin flew back into the hands of those who had caught them, only to vanish again in an instant.\n\nZhi remarked, “This city suffers from a terrible rat infestation.” Xiang inscribed a talisman and had it affixed to the southern wall. Striking a plate with a chopstick, he let out a long whistle. Rats swarmed forth in a drought-like torrent, rushing to the talisman and prostrating themselves. Xiang summoned the largest rat, which approached and bowed. He said, “You are but a humble creature, granted grain by Heaven. Why do you gnaw through walls and dwellings, disturbing His Excellency day and night? Though I pity you, I cannot kill you all. You should lead your kin far from here.” The great rat turned, and all the rats kowtowed in apology. Then, in a great drought-like exodus, they departed through the city gate—numberless. From that day forward, rats vanished from the city.",

      "translated_text": "Later, Xiang journeyed south to Yuezhou, passing through the Dongyan Monastery, where three hundred monks were holding a vegetarian feast. Accompanying him were Wang Zhiwei, a Daoist from the Muyan Grotto in Yongkang County of Zizhou, and his disciple Wang Yansou. Upon seeing Xiang and Zhiwei arrive, the monks sat and ate without so much as a bow, offering them only rice.\n\nXiang refused to eat and urged Zhiwei and Yansou to finish quickly and leave. Before the monks had finished their meal, they departed, hastening their steps as they exited the monastery gates. By the time they reached an inn south of Zhuji County—some seventy *li* from the monastery—it was deep into the night. Suddenly, they heard voices calling for the Daoists. The innkeeper promptly replied, “There are three here.” The voices outside rejoiced and asked the innkeeper for permission to see the Daoists. When they entered, they were two monks, who prostrated themselves and wailed, “The monks failed to recognize the Daoist masters yesterday and neglected to welcome you properly, incurring your wrath. Two hundred of us have been bedridden ever since. We two, as the monastery’s stewards, bear the greatest fault, so we have come especially to beg your forgiveness.”\n\nXiang merely slept on, ignoring them, while Zhiwei and Yansou laughed. The monks pleaded even more desperately, until Xiang finally said, “Hereafter, do not treat others with such disdain.” He added, “Return now, and by the time you enter the monastery gates, you will all be able to rise from your beds.” The monks returned, and it was just as he had said.\n\nThe next day, Xiang continued southward. It was spring, and he saw a household with fine *song* greens. When he asked for some but was refused, he was met with harsh words. He instructed Yansou to fetch paper and brush. Zhiwei then said, “To be denied greens is no great matter, and there is no cause for dispute. Besides, as Daoists, should we not endure such things?” Xiang smiled and replied, “I am no litigant—I merely wish to play a small trick.” Yansou presented the paper and brush, and Xiang drew a white egret. He sprayed it with water, and the bird flew into the vegetable patch, pecking at the greens. The owner chased after it, but the egret merely flew down again, repeating this several times. Xiang then drew a hunting dog, which ran after the egret, trampling the greens to pieces. Seeing the Daoist’s mischief—and recalling his earlier request for greens—the owner grew anxious, fearing further retaliation, and begged for mercy.\n\nXiang said, “I did not seek the greens—I only wished to amuse myself.” With that, he called the egret and the dog, which flew and ran into his arms. Upon inspection, the greens were entirely unharmed.\n\nContinuing south to the borders of Huotong Mountain in Changxi County, they sought lodging at an inn for the night. The rooms were few, and many travelers had already arrived. The innkeeper jested, “There is no space left—unless the Daoist can sleep on the wall, in which case I will accommodate you.” As dusk approached, Zhiwei and Yansou were anxious for shelter. Xiang said, “You may sleep among the common travelers. I will sit until dawn.” Once everyone was asleep, Xiang leapt onto a beam and hung upside down by one foot. The innkeeper, rising in the night, saw this by candlelight and was astonished. Xiang said, “If I can sleep on a beam, what difficulty is there in sleeping on a wall?” He then entered the wall and did not emerge for some time. The innkeeper, filled with reverence, moved Zhiwei and Yansou into a clean room within his home before Xiang finally reappeared. At dawn, the innkeeper sought to detain him, but Xiang had vanished. Zhiwei and Yansou searched for him along the road ahead and found him waiting by the wayside.\n\nFrom Huotong, they returned to Tianbao Abbey in eastern Yongkang County. The abbey had a great withered pine, which Xiang pointed to and said, “This pine is over three thousand years old—it will soon turn to stone.” Later, the pine indeed transformed into stone. Suddenly, a great wind and thunder split the stone into several sections. Yang Fa, who had been demoted from his post as military commissioner of Guangzhou to prefect of Weizhou, was a man who admired the extraordinary. He had two sections of the stone moved to his official residence and two others sent to the Nine Pines Courtyard of Longxing Temple. Each section stood six or seven *chi* tall and over three *chi* in diameter. The stone bore the bark and scales of the original pine, and it remains there to this day.\n\nWhen people came to Xiang seeking treatment for illness, he had no medicine but would strike the afflicted area with his bamboo staff, drawing out all manner of ailments from within. Pointing the staff at the patient, he would blow on its tip, and a sound like thunder would issue forth, curing the illness. Those who came to him with crooked limbs, leaning on staffs for support, he would strike with his bamboo staff, and they would immediately straighten and stand unaided.\n\nWhen offered money or silk, Xiang would refuse repeatedly, but if pressed, he would accept it only to distribute it among the poor. Wherever he traveled—whether to abbeys, grottoes, or mountains—he often left behind poems. His poem *Ascending Qinwang Mountain* reads:\n\n*Where to seek the primal division of the Great One?*\n*Only the shifting reckonings remain to sway the human heart.*\n*Sun and moon across the nine heavens mark the passing days,*\n*While rivers and mountains a thousand miles away transform through the ages.*\n*The wind stirs the waters, swallowing distant shores,*\n*Rain swells the mist, drowning the towering forests.*\n*Qin’s emperor vainly schemed to drive the mountains—*\n*The boundless sea rolls ever deeper.*\n\nLater, he returned to his hometown to visit his elder brother, who happened to be away. His sister-in-law and nephew rejoiced at his return. Xiang said, “My brother and I share this house. Now that I have returned, I wish to divide the land—I desire only the eastern garden.” His sister-in-law and nephew were perplexed: “You have been away from home for so long, and your brother has not yet seen you.

Xiang of Shuchuan told others: “I have newly achieved feathered transformation in the west of Zhe. Now, I have been summoned by the Jade Emperor and shall ascend on this very day.” He reported the matter, and the Emperor, moved with admiration, dispatched an envoy to Hangzhou in the west to verify it. They opened the tomb and examined the coffin, finding only a bamboo staff within.\n\nWu Tongwei\nWu Tongwei, of unknown origin, was a Daoist whose spirit and qi were pure and bright. He sat in silent meditation, sometimes chanting, sometimes drunk, and often wandered among the famous mountains of Hongzhou. Though people had seen him for many years, he would suddenly vanish for a decade or more, only to reappear with a countenance even younger than before. Those who knew him could not fathom this. He refined elixirs and pills, roaming without fixed abode. Later, while drunk in a wineshop, he ascended in flight and departed.\n\nXu Qi\nXu Cuo claimed to be from Gaoyang. In his youth, he sat for the imperial examinations but repeatedly failed. In later years, he studied the Dao on Wangwu Mountain, traveling among the Five Sacred Peaks and the famous grotto-heavens of the mountains. Later, he journeyed from Mount Emei through the two capitals, then from Jing and Xiang to Bian and Song, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. He visited Maoshan, Tiantai, Siming, Xiandu, Weiyu, Wuyi, Huotong, and Luofu, leaving no place unvisited. Wherever he went, he inscribed upon cliffs and cave walls in secluded spots: “Xu Cuo, seeking Master Crescent Moon, has come here from Mount Emei.” Those who saw his brushstrokes marveled at his divine strangeness, though none could identify Master Crescent Moon. Later, he often wandered near Lujiang. Once, drunk, he chanted:\n*“Before the garden’s blooms, this is my land of drunkenness,\nI drain the Queen Mother’s nine rosy goblets.\nThe immortals clap hands, deeming me frivolous—\nBanished to the mortal world to play the wine-mad sage.”*\nWhen well-meaning admirers invited him, he would say: “I am a celestial immortal, now feasting on Kunlun.

      "translated_text": "Jin Keji\nA *Bin’gong* presented scholar. His nature was serene and fond of the Dao. He disdained extravagance. At times he practiced qi-cultivation and bodily refinement, regarding them as medicine. Broad in learning and retentive of memory, his compositions were pure and elegant. His bearing was handsome, and in movement and speech, he bore the refined air of the Central Plains. Soon after passing the examinations, he retreated to live in seclusion in the Ziwu Valley of Mount Zhongnan, embracing the life of a recluse. He planted many rare flowers and exotic fruits with his own hands. Often he would burn incense and sit in stillness, as if lost in thought. He also recited the *Daodejing* and various immortals’ scriptures without cease.\n\nAfter three years, he longed to return to his homeland and departed by sea. Later, he returned, clad in Daoist robes, and re-entered Mount Zhongnan, where he devoted himself to performing hidden virtues. Whatever people sought from him, he never refused. He pursued his practices with diligence, yet none could fathom his ways.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the eleventh year of the *Dazhong* era, he suddenly submitted a memorial, stating: *“Your servant has received a decree from the Jade Emperor, appointing me as Attendant Gentleman of the English Terrace. On the twenty-fifth day of the second month next year, I shall ascend to Heaven.”* Emperor Xuanzong found this extraordinary and dispatched an imperial messenger to summon him to the palace, but he firmly declined. When asked to present the Jade Emperor’s decree, he replied that it was held by another immortal and not left in the mortal realm. The emperor then bestowed upon him four palace ladies, fragrant medicines, gold, and silks, along with two imperial messengers to attend him. Yet Keji dwelled alone in a quiet chamber, and the palace ladies and messengers rarely approached him.\n\nEach night, voices of conversation and laughter were heard from within his room. The messengers, peering secretly, saw only immortal officials and maidens seated upon dragons and phoenixes, facing one another with solemn dignity. Their attendants and guards were numerous, yet the palace ladies and messengers dared not disturb them.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month, as spring’s beauty blossomed in full splendor, five-colored clouds, crying cranes, white doves, flutes and chimes, jade wheels, feathered canopies, and banners filled the sky. A vast celestial procession ascended, and he departed for Heaven. The court officials and commoners who gathered to witness the spectacle filled the valleys, all gazing in awe and wonder.\n\nSong Xuanbai\nSong Xuanbai’s origins are unknown. He was a Daoist priest. Over seven feet tall, his brows and eyes were as if painted, his features handsome and fair, his speech refined and graceful—all who saw him cherished him. Skilled in Daoist arts, he wore cotton in summer and a single layer in winter, walking through snow. Apace of over a *zhang* around him, steam-like qi emanated, and the snow never settled. He could extinguish lamps with a point of his finger, and when he pointed at a person, it was as if a draft had blown past, rustling. When he pointed at the grasses and trees in a courtyard, they would sway and rustle.\n\nHe wandered among famous mountains, emerging from Mao Shan to the Xixuan Abbey in Runzhou, then traveling to the Xiandu Grotto of Kuocang. He practiced *bigu* fasting and qi-nourishment, yet was fond of wine. When eating meat, he would consume five *jin*, accompanied by a basin of *su* sauce. He would scoop the meat with his hands, then drink two *dou* of wine, using a single white plum. Those who received even a morsel of his *su* sauce said it did not taste of ordinary herbs but carried an extraordinary fragrance that lingered on the tongue all day without fading. Many who ate it lived long, healthy lives of eighty or ninety years.\n\nWherever Xuanbai stayed, he would use gold and silk to acquire two or three beautiful concubines, only to abandon them when he departed. People believed he had mastered the art of replenishing the brain and restoring primordial essence.\n\nLater, he traveled to Yuezhou, where a severe drought had persisted. The local authorities were exposing the dragon’s music in the courtyard to pray for rain, but after ten days, the heat only worsened. Xuanbai, observing this, remarked that rain could only descend by Heaven’s decree and that without an appeal to the celestial court, it could not be summoned. He then stayed at the Xuanzhen Abbey, burning incense and offering prayers. By the next evening, a great rain fell, more than sufficient, and the people of Yue marveled at his divine power.\n\nContinuing south to Xinzhou, he encountered another drought. A Daoist priest, knowing of Xuanbai’s ability to summon rain, recommended him to the prefecture. He immediately performed his arts, driving a nail into the eyes of the city god. The prefect, Wei Delin, was outraged by his hoarding of women and drove a nail into the city god as well, declaring him a mad sorcerer and intending to punish him. When the guards approached, their limbs stiffened, and they collapsed, their staffs shattering of their own accord. Xuanbai laughed and said to Delin: *“Does the governor not recall how Liu Gen was nearly executed for punishing Zu Mi?”* Delin, now fearful, begged for rain. In an instant, the rain came, and he sent Xuanbai off with reverence.\n\nHis miraculous arts were displayed many times, too numerous to record in full.",

A Daoist priest, he dwelled on Mount Song. Well-versed in literature, he conducted himself with lofty antiquity, ever diligent in his austerities and cultivation. Though young in appearance, none knew his true age; yet among both Daoists and layfolk, it was said he had been seen for many years, though none thought it particularly strange. One day, clouds and cranes filled the sky, their music clear and resonant, as Zizhen suddenly ascended in flight. At the time, the scholar Chen Tao was in the eastern capital; seeing the people of Luoyang gazing in awe and reverence, he was struck with wonder and composed a poem:\n\n*Zi Jin’s simurgh soars o’er ancient Luo’s stream,*\n*Golden peaches ripen once more for Lord He’s flight.*\n*Music of the Three Clarities plays beneath Song’s peaks,*\n*Five-colored clouds gather before the imperial gardens’ sight.*\n*Crimson-crested dancers bow low to crimson banners’ sway,*\n*Green-robed singers pause as incense cakes hold sway.*\n*Who would weep in broad daylight for this parting scene?*\n*Ten thousand years of Tai Ji’s light—yet time slips away.*\n\n**The Medicine-Selling Elder**\nThe medicine-selling elder—no one knew his name, though when asked, he would say, *\"This alone is my true name.\"* Some had seen him since their youth, and even in old age, his appearance remained unchanged. He always carried a large gourd, selling medicine; whether one paid or not, he gave it freely to those who sought relief from illness. His remedies were always miraculously effective. Yet if one without ailment playfully asked for medicine, what they received would invariably be lost. Thus, people dared not frivolously seek his remedies, revering him as a divine being. Often drunk in the marketplace, he would give any money he earned to the poor. Once, someone teased him: *\"Do you sell the Great Return Elixir?\"* He replied, *\"I have one pill—one thousand strings of cash.\"* All laughed, thinking him mad. He would often shout in the streets, cursing people: *\"With money, you don’t buy medicine—you’ll all turn to dirt dumplings!\"* No one understood his meaning, and they only laughed harder. Later, in Chang’an, he shook his gourd—now empty—save for a single pill, vast and radiant, which he placed in his palm. He said to the crowd: *\"For a hundred years, I’ve sold medicine among you, passing by countless millions, yet not one would spend money to buy it. How pitiful! Now I must take it myself.\"* The pill vanished into his mouth; beneath his feet, five-colored clouds arose, and a wind carried him aloft as he soared away.\n\n**Deng Qushe**\nDeng Qushe was a native of Longqiu in Quzhou, his home at the foot of Mount Jiufeng. In his youth, he entered the Dao, traveling to study its arts with tireless devotion. At over thirty, he took residence at Anhe Abbey in Songyang County, Chuzhou—the very place where Ye Jingneng had once studied the Dao. Five *li* north of the abbey stood Mount Maoshan, rising over fifty *zhang* high, where, by tradition, Celestial Master Zhang and Ye Jingneng had both cultivated the Dao. Qushe, inspired by their legacy, climbed the mountain and built a hut to dwell in. Later, the abbey’s Daoists followed him down the mountain, and the people constructed houses and halls for them, installing an image of Lord Lao, along with portraits of Celestial Master Zhang and Ye Jingneng, before which they performed morning and evening rites.\n\nTo the southeast of the mountain lay a square stone, over two *zhang* wide, flat as a whetstone—formed by heaven itself. Qushe often sat upon it, hands clasped in silent meditation. One day, a divine being spoke to him: *\"Celestial Master Zhang’s two demon-slaying swords and a jar of elixir lie beneath this stone—you may retrieve them.\"* Qushe bowed to the spirit and replied: *\"This stone was set by heaven; no human effort can alter it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Reflecting on his own inadequacy, Qushe resolved only to guard his true nature, finding refuge in the mountain’s seclusion where he had long enjoyed divine protection. How could he dare take the swords and elixir for himself? The spirit replied: *\"Simply cultivate diligently without slackening, and the swords and elixir will come to you of their own accord.\"* Three years later, the spirit presented them to Qushe. The swords were Celestial Master Zhang’s Seven-Star Swords, and the elixir was stored in a stone casket, sealed in a single jar. When poured out, it filled over a *dou*, resembling sesame seeds in shape, crimson and radiant. Qushe consumed some himself and distributed the rest to the ailing, all of whom recovered.\n\nAt that time, Hua Zao of Lishui County, in the aftermath of the Zhonghe era’s famine and chaos, had rallied local forces and fortified himself in the mountains. The military governor of Zhedong reported this to the imperial court, which, seeking to end hostilities, appointed Hua as prefect. But Hua was treacherous. Hearing of Qushe’s elixir and swords, he imprisoned Qushe in an empty hut. It was the height of summer, and for a month, Hua gave him neither food nor drink, assuming he had perished. When the hut was opened, however, Qushe sat there with solemn composure, his complexion luminous and fairer than before. Hua was astounded and sent him back to the mountain, keeping the swords and elixir for himself. That night, a storm of wind and thunder roared, and all vanished without a trace.\n\nQushe, having received a divine message, returned to the stone. For the next fifteen years, he dwelled on the mountain, often speaking of dragons, tigers, and strange birds moving through his courtyard. Daoists from Anhe Abbey, who frequently ascended the peak to burn memorials, witnessed the tracks of dragons, tigers, and birds and marveled. Qushe had abstained from food for many years. If outsiders polluted the mountain, fierce beasts would appear in spring and winter to startle them, while venomous snakes would strike in summer and autumn.\n\nQushe also recounted: *\"I often see thunderstorms halfway up the mountain—dragons riding the rain, along with the Thunder Duke, Lightning Mother, and a host of spirits and gods. When they visit this mountain, they show great reverence.\"* Daoists who lodged there at night would hear Qushe in his quiet chamber conversing with others by dawn. Peering in, they detected a fragrant aroma filling the mountain and the sound of jade pendants. Qushe sat solemnly, attended by four figures in scarlet robes and distant-travel caps, their hair coiled in snail-shell buns, clad in azure silk. Jade boys and girls stood beside them, their radiance illuminating the room, while spirits roamed nearby. The Daoists dared not disturb them. When Qushe returned to the abbey by day, they spread word of the marvel.\n\nFifteen years later, Qushe told the Daoists: *\"I fear I must soon leave this mountain and may not see you for long.\"* One day, a procession of colored clouds, simurghs, and celestial music filled the sky, hovering above the peak. A palanquin, banners, and canopies appeared, with spirit officials riding dragons and deer, all five-hued, some mounted on simurghs and phoenixes, come to escort Qushe upward. A great crowd of Daoists and laypeople below watched in awe. Later, a wildfire consumed his hut, yet his divine traces remained. To this day, Daoists offer rituals in his honor.\n\n---\n\nXie Ziran\nXie Ziran was a female perfected one from Huayang in Shu. From childhood, she entered the Dao. Her master showed her the *Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*, which she read once as if recalling old lessons, and twice with perfect retention. As she grew, her spirit was clear and her bearing lofty. She loved the *qin* and *ruan*, excelled in calligraphy, and composed poetry. She disdained the conduct of Zhuo Wenjun, and in her devotions, she revered the Queen Mother of the West and Ma Gu, admiring the integrity of Lady Wei of South Mountain.\n\nAt forty, she set out on distant travels, visiting Qingcheng, Damei, Emei, the Thirty-Six Grottoes, and the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, then left Shu to journey through the capital and Luoyang, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. Wherever there were famous mountains, grotto-heavens, or sacred traces, she spared no effort to visit them. Later, hearing that Sima Chengzhen, a Daoist of Tiantai Mountain, dwelled on Yuxiao Peak and was solitary and lofty in virtue, she sought him out. She served as his disciple for three years, then lived apart in the wilderness, gathering firewood daily for Chengzhen’s stove and returning with fragrant fruits, ever eager to inquire about the Dao.\n\nChengzhen, struck by her perseverance, said: *\"I lack virtue—how can I bear this? But what do you truly seek?\"* Ziran replied: *\"From a thousand miles away, I came to your door seeking the Way of transcendence. I wish only to receive the highest teachings to attain liberation—nothing more.\"* Chengzhen, knowing that the highest methods were rarely transmitted to female perfected ones, feared profaning the great Dao and merely assented. After more than a year, Ziran sighed: *\"If an enlightened master does not accept me, it must be fate.\"* Whenever she climbed Yuxiao Peak, she saw Penglai across the sea, seemingly not far off, though she feared no master could be found there. Thus, she bid Chengzhen farewell, declaring her intent to journey to Penglai.\n\nShe sold her belongings, donned plain robes, and ceased eating grain. Taking only a mat, she cast herself into the sea, drifting upon the waves. A Silla ship spotted her and took her aboard. After several days at sea, the water turned deep blue. At sunset, distant waves surged, and phosphorescent fires stretched to the horizon, the ship sailing through flames. A year later, the wind carried the ship into waters black as ink, then white as powder, then crimson like cinnabar, and finally yellow as sulfur fumes.\n\nSuddenly, the wind shifted, and the ship entered a sheltered bay where a mountain gleamed golden in the sunlight. Fragrant mists rose from its grass and trees, and the beasts and birds were all yellow. The crew disembarked and found every stone, large or small, to be sulfur. The merchants hastily discarded their other goods and loaded the ship with the stones. Each time they passed through one of the four colored waters, they performed three acts of reverence, the crossing lasting five days and nights. The wind carried them they knew not how far.\n\nAfter another month at sea, a crosswind struck, alarming the sailors. In the distance, a great mountain emerged from the water, its summit lined with over a thousand red banners. The navigator said it was a whale raising its fins.",
      "overlap_context": ", before which they performed morning and evening rites.\n\nTo the southeast of the mountain lay a square stone, over two *zhang* wide, flat as a whetstone—formed by heaven itself. Qushe often sat upon it, hands clasped in silent meditation. One day, a divine being spoke to him: *\"Celestial Master Zhang’s two demon-slaying swords and a jar of elixir lie beneath this stone—you may retrieve them.\"* Qushe bowed to the spirit and replied: *\"This stone was set by heaven; no human effort can alter it.\"*",

There were trees whose leaves, stirred by the wind, chimed like metal and stone. The fragrance of flowers and grasses permeated to the bone. Azure phoenixes, frost-white cranes, jade-green pheasants, and five-colored hounds roamed the courtyard.\n\nAmong them stood one figure, crowned with blossoms and draped in rosy clouds, his bearing noble and fair. The blue-clad attendants led Ziran inside, where he bowed in reverence. The Daoist asked, \"Where do you seek to go?\"\n\nZiran replied, \"To Penglai, to find a master and seek deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Daoist smiled and said, \"Penglai lies beyond the Weak Waters, three hundred thousand li from here.

      "translated_text": "The Pei clan’s Daoist name was Xuanjing. She was the daughter of Magistrate Sheng of Weishi County and the wife of Li Yan, the constable of E County. From childhood, she was bright and quick-witted; when her mother showed her poetry and books, she read them once and never forgot. Upon reaching marriageable age, she adorned herself with the virtues and appearance befitting a wife, yet her heart remained set on the Dao. She begged her parents to let her dwell in a quiet chamber, where she donned Daoist robes. Her parents, who also revered the Dao, deeply considered her request and granted it, daily offering incense and paying homage to the Daoist images. Though they assigned maidservants to accompany her, they were always sent away. Alone, she seemed to converse with unseen female companions. Her parents spied on her but saw no one. When questioned, she steadfastly refused to speak.\n\nHer thoughts were pure and serene; though her kin often visited, she treated them with ritual propriety, never showing disrespect. At the age of twenty, her parents wished to marry her to Li Yan. Upon hearing this, she firmly objected, wishing only to enter the Dao and cultivate truth in pursuit of transcendence. Her parents admonished her, saying, \"A daughter’s destiny is to marry—this is the proper way for a woman. The time must not be lost, nor the rites neglected. If you enter the Dao, you will have no home in this world for the rest of your life.\" They cited the example of Lady Wei of South Mountain, who had abandoned her heirs to become an immortal. Thus compelled, she married Li Yan, and the wedding rites were fully observed.\n\nWithin a month, she told Li Yan, \"I have long cultivated the Dao, and the immortals forbid me to be your wife. I must sever ties with the world.\" Li Yan, who had long admired the Dao, found her words extraordinary. He then secluded himself in a quiet chamber to meditate, where one night he heard voices and laughter. Suspicious but hesitant to disturb her, he peered through a crack in the wall and saw the room filled with radiant light and a fragrant, otherworldly scent. Two maidens, about seventeen or eighteen, with phoenix-like hair and rainbow-hued robes, stood gracefully beside her, attended by several handmaidens in cloud-like coiffures and elegant attire. Xuanjing conversed with the two maidens. Astonished, Li Yan withdrew.\n\nAt dawn, he asked Xuanjing about it, and she replied, \"Yes, they were celestial maidens from Kunlun who came to visit. The immortals already knew you were spying and sent guards to stop you, though you did not notice. If they come again, do not spy, lest you be punished by the divine officials. Yet my karmic bond with you is shallow, and I shall not remain in the mortal world much longer. The Lord of the Dao, considering your lack of heirs, will speak to the immortals on your behalf when they next visit.\" One night a year later, a celestial maiden descended into Li Yan’s chamber. Later, she returned and presented him with a boy, saying, \"This is your son. Xuanjing will soon depart.\" Three days later, five-colored clouds swirled, immortal maidens played music, and a white phoenix bore Xuanjing into the heavens, vanishing toward the northwest.\n\n---\n\nThe Qi clan’s Daoist name was Xiaoyao. She was from Nangong in Jizhou. Her father taught students to support the family. At over ten years old, Xiaoyao was already of a pure and serene disposition, eschewing childish games and harboring a love for the Dao. Her parents, aware of this, often performed hidden acts of kindness for others. Her father entrusted her with moral teachings, but she would say, \"These are but the concerns of ordinary people.\" Instead, she took up the *Daodejing* and Daoist scriptures, reciting them without cease.\n\nWhen matchmakers came to her home, her family deemed it inauspicious. By twenty, her parents married her to Ji Xun of the same village, a farming and weaving household. Her in-laws were harsh, reproaching her for laziness in silkworm rearing and farming. Yet Xiaoyao devoted herself to purity, fasting, and meditation from dawn to dusk, paying no heed to worldly affairs. Her husband and in-laws repeatedly scolded her, so she pleaded with them to let her return to her parents’ home. Once there, they forced her back.\n\nDeclaring her inability to attend to worldly matters, she wished to dwell alone in a quiet chamber to cultivate the Dao and thus support her in-laws. Ji Xun and her parents, suspicious, confined her to a room. There, Xiaoyao subsisted only on fragrant water, fasting and meditating in stillness. She sang:\n\n*\"Laughing to see the sea turn to dust,\nParting from the immortals before the Queen Mother’s flowers.\nAfter a thousand years, I return to heaven,\nWith a heart that cherishes the people of this world.\"*\n\nHer husband’s family and neighbors all deemed her mad and possessed.",

      "translated_text": "Twelve Hidden Transcendents\n\n**Sun Sixuan**\n\nSun Simiao, a native of Huayuan in Jingzhao, began his studies at the age of seven, reciting a thousand words each day. As he grew, he delved deeply into the teachings of Zhuangzi, Laozi, and the Hundred Schools. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Zhou, amid the turmoil of the royal house, he withdrew to Mount Taibai to study the Dao, refining his qi and nurturing his form, seeking the means to transcend the world. Proficient in astronomy and calendrical calculations, he mastered medicine and pharmacology, scrutinizing voices and complexions with profound compassion. In all his actions, he practiced hidden virtue, strengthening his resolve and aiding others as his foremost duty.\n\nOnce, while traveling, he saw a man about to kill a small green snake, already wounded and bleeding. Simiao pleaded with the man, offering his own clothes in exchange to save it. He applied medicine to the wound and released the snake into the grass. Over a month later, while traveling again, he encountered a young man in white, accompanied by a grand retinue of servants and horses. The youth dismounted, bowed deeply, and thanked Simiao, saying, \"My younger brother was saved by the Daoist master. My parents wish to meet you.\" Simiao, who had saved countless lives with his medicines, paid little heed. The youth persisted, bowing repeatedly, and offered a spare horse to carry Simiao, traveling swiftly as if flying.\n\nThey arrived at a city with blossoming trees and spring scenery, its gates resplendent and streets bustling, resembling a royal residence. The youth led Simiao inside, where a dignified man in a white cap and crimson robe, surrounded by attendants, greeted him warmly. \"We have long thought of the Daoist master,\" he said. \"My son was recently injured by a foolish man, but thanks to your act of ransoming him with your clothes, his life was spared. The debt of gratitude for his rebirth is immense.\" Soon after, Simiao was led into an inner chamber, where a middle-aged woman and a young servant boy emerged, bowing repeatedly to thank him. \"This foolish child was harmed, but you saved him from danger.\" Simiao recalled saving the green snake and marveled at the coincidence. Around him, palace maidens and attendants addressed the capped man as \"Your Majesty\" and the woman as \"Consort.\" Perplexed, Simiao discreetly inquired and was told, \"This is the Water Palace of Jingyang.\" The capped man ordered his officials to prepare a feast with music and entertainment for Simiao, who declined, explaining that he practiced breath refinement and abstained from grains, drinking only wine.\n\nAfter three days of hospitality, they asked what Simiao desired. He replied, \"I dwell in the mountains, delighting in the Dao, cultivating truth and refining my spirit. Though my eyes may wander, my heart harbors no desires.\" They presented him with fine silk, pearls, and gold, but he firmly declined. \"Does the Daoist master not value these?\" they asked. \"How then can we repay you?\" They then ordered their son to bring thirty medical formulas from the Dragon Palace, saying, \"These are fitting for a true Daoist, capable of saving lives and aiding the world.\" Soon after, they arranged for servants and horses to escort Simiao back to the mountain, leaving him deeply astonished. Testing the formulas, he found them miraculously effective.\n\nLater, he compiled the *Essential Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces* in thirty volumes, incorporating the Dragon Palace’s formulas. He also authored the *Pulse Classic*, using voice and complexion to diagnose illnesses, both of which gained widespread circulation. When Emperor Wen of Sui served as regent, he summoned Simiao to serve as Erudite of the National University, but Simiao declined. He once told others, \"In fifty years, a sage will emerge, and I shall assist him to aid the people.\"\n\nEmperor Taizong of Tang summoned him to the capital, astonished by his youthful appearance. \"Truly,\" he sighed, \"those who possess the Dao are worthy of reverence. The tales of immortals like Xianmen are no empty words.\" He offered Simiao a noble rank, but Simiao firmly refused. In the early reign of Emperor Gaozong, he was appointed Remonstrance Grandee, but again declined. At over ninety years of age, his hearing and vision remained sharp.\n\nLu Zhaolin of Fanyang, renowned yet afflicted by a severe illness, lamented the disparities in fate and the mysteries of longevity. He asked Simiao, \"What is the Way of a great physician in curing illness?\" Simiao replied, \"I have heard that one who speaks well of Heaven must ground it in humanity, and one who speaks well of humanity must root it in Heaven. Heaven has its four seasons and five phases, alternating between cold and heat. Its movements bring harmony as rain, fury as wind, condensation as frost and snow, and expansion as rainbows—these are the constant patterns of Heaven and Earth. Humans have their four limbs and five viscera, waking and sleeping, breathing in and out. Their circulation manifests as constructive and defensive qi, their vitality as complexion, and their spirit as voice—these are the constant patterns of humanity. The Yang employs its essence, the Yin its form; this is what Heaven and humanity share. When these patterns falter, steaming generates heat, stagnation generates cold, binding forms tumors, collapse forms abscesses, rushing causes panting, and exhaustion leads to withering. Diagnoses appear on the face, transformations manifest in the body. Extending this to Heaven and Earth, the same holds true. Thus, the five planets wax and wane, stars lose their courses, the sun and moon err in their paths, comets streak across the sky—these are Heaven’s critical illnesses. Untimely cold and heat are Heaven and Earth’s steaming and stagnation. Rocks standing and trees leaping are their tumors. Mountains collapsing and lands sinking are their abscesses. Violent winds and torrential rains are their panting. Untimely rainfall and dried-up rivers are their withering. Skilled physicians guide with medicines and stones, rescue with needles and decoctions. Sages harmonize with virtue and power, assist with human affairs. Thus, the body has curable illnesses, and Heaven and Earth have avertable disasters.\"\n\nHe also said, \"The gallbladder should be bold, the heart cautious; wisdom should be all-encompassing, conduct square and upright.\" As the *Book of Songs* says:\n*\"As if treading on thin ice,\nAs if standing at the edge of a deep abyss.\"*",

Contemporaries spread rumors of his secret longevity arts. Elders recalled seeing him as a child, though he claimed to be several hundred years old.

It was midsummer, and soon his body began to rot and teem with maggots. When word reached the empress, she believed he had truly died. Later, however, he was seen again in the mountains of Changzhou.\n\nIn the twenty-third year of *Kaiyuan* (735 CE), Emperor Xuanzong dispatched the *Tongshi Sheren* Pei Wu to Changzhou by imperial post to fetch Zhang Guo. Upon meeting Pei, Zhang Guo’s *qi* suddenly ceased, and he appeared dead. Pei burned incense and entreated him, conveying the emperor’s earnest desire to seek the Dao. After a moment, Zhang Guo gradually revived. Pei dared not press him and hastened back to report.

He also claimed to have served as *Shizhong* in Yao’s court. Skilled in embryonic breathing, he could go days without eating, though he would occasionally partake of fine wine and *Sanhuang Yuan*. Emperor Xuanzong detained him in the inner palace and offered him wine, but Zhang declined, saying, “Your humble servant’s capacity does not exceed two *sheng*. However, I have a disciple who can drink one *dou*.” Delighted, the emperor ordered the disciple summoned. Presently, a young Daoist descended from the palace eaves as if flying, aged sixteen or seventeen, with a handsome countenance, refined demeanor, and articulate speech, his manners impeccable. Emperor Minghuang bade him sit, but Zhang Guo said, “My disciple has always stood by my side; it would not be proper to grant him a seat.” The emperor gazed at him with even greater delight and offered him wine. After drinking a *dou*, he showed no signs of intoxication. Zhang Guo cautioned, “Do not press him further, for exceeding his limit may lead to mishap and fail to amuse Your Majesty.” The emperor insisted, and suddenly wine gushed from the disciple’s crown, his hat bursting open and transforming into a comb. The emperor and his consorts all laughed. When they looked again, only a golden comb lay on the ground. Turning it over, it held exactly one *dou*. Upon examination, it proved to be a comb from the Jixian Institute. Zhang Guo’s immortal arts were tested repeatedly, yet his wonders knew no end.\n\nThereupon, the emperor issued an edict: “Master Zhang Guo of Changzhou is one who roams beyond the mundane. His immortal traces are lofty, his heart enters the profound, and he blends with the dust yet answers the summons to the palace. None know the count of his years, and he is said to be a man of the age of the *Xi Huang*. Well-versed in the pivot of the Dao, he fully embodies the mysteries of the ultimate. Now, in accordance with the rites of the crane-borne edict, we honor one of the transcendent lineage. Let him be appointed *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu* and granted the title *Master of Penetrating the Mysteries*.”\n\nZhang Guo pleaded old age and illness, begging to return to Changzhou. The emperor bestowed upon him three hundred bolts of silk, along with two attendant disciples, and provided post horses for their journey. Upon reaching Changzhou, one disciple accompanied him into the mountains.

None knew of his diet or elixirs—only that he ate nothing. His complexion remained that of a man of forty, and his stride outpaced galloping horses. At times, he carried firewood to sell. He always hung a gourd and a crooked bamboo staff, and when drunk, he would stagger homeward, chanting alone:\n\n*With firewood at dawn I set out to sell,*\n*With wine at dusk I return west.*\n*Passersby, ask not where I go—*\n*Through white clouds I tread,*\n*Into emerald peaks I wend.*\n\nFor over thirty years, he aided those in peril or distress. Many in the city sought him, but he was never seen—only poems left upon his hut’s walls, such as:\n\n*Thirty years in reclusion spent,*\n*A hut on southern peaks I’ve built.*\n*At quiet night, the bright moon I dine,*\n*At idle morn, the jade spring I sip.*\n*Woodcutters sing on the ridge,*\n*Valley birds play ‘fore the crags.*\n*Joyful, I forget age,*\n*And all reckoning of years.*\n\nThose fond of such verses spread them widely.

      "translated_text": "The transcendent crane soars beyond the distant heavens,\nIts return awaits a thousand years and more.\nThat winter, wildfire consumed his hut,\nAnd none knew where Xuanping’s traces had gone.\n\nOver a hundred years later, in the seventh year of *Xiantong*, an old woman from the household of Xu Mingnu, a prefectural resident, often followed companions into the mountains to gather firewood. One day, alone in the southern mountains, she saw a man seated upon a rock, eating a peach of remarkable size. He asked her, *\"Are you from Xu Mingnu’s household?\"* *\"I am Xuanping, ancestor of Mingnu.\"* The old woman said, *\"I have long heard you attained immortality years ago.\"* He replied, *\"Return and tell Mingnu I dwell in these mountains. Take this peach to eat, but do not carry it out—the mountains teem with tigers and wolves, and the mountain spirit cherishes this fruit.\"* The old woman ate the peach, finding it surpassingly sweet, and soon finished it. Xuanping sent her home with the woodcutters. When she recounted this to Mingnu’s clan, all marveled, and the tale spread throughout the prefecture. Thereafter, the old woman’s complexion grew ever more youthful, her step lighter and swifter than before. From the *Zhonghe* era onward, war and famine followed in succession, and the people lived in unrest. Mingnu’s family relocated to escape calamity, and the old woman entered the mountains, never to return. To this day, woodcutters sometimes glimpse her—clad in vines, moving swift as flight—pursuing her, she ascends the trees and vanishes.\n\nLiu Shang\nLiu Shang was a native of Pengcheng, whose family resided in Chang’an. From youth, he loved learning, possessed a prodigious memory, and devoted himself to literary composition. His *Eighteen Stanzas of the Barbarian Flute* gained wide renown, recited even by children and women. Passing the imperial examinations, he served in the central bureaucracy as a gentleman. Fond of Daoist arts, he treated any Daoist he met as a master, diligently practicing alchemy and qi-cultivation. Often he lamented the fleeting passage of time, the gradual decline of his body, the futility of rushing about from dawn to dusk, the weariness of worldly toil, and the emptiness of official rank. The sages of old sought the Dao while holding office, many attaining transcendence. Now, having fulfilled his marital duties and freed himself from worldly desires, how could he be inferior to those who wandered afar? Thereupon, citing illness, he resigned his post and set out on a Daoist journey.\n\nArriving in Guangling, he encountered a Daoist selling medicine in the city streets, drawing large crowds. The remedies were said to be highly efficacious. Among the throng, the Daoist fixed his gaze on Shang with peculiar intensity, then ceased selling, took his hand, and ascended a tower, where they drank together. The Daoist spoke of events from the Qin and Han dynasties as if he had witnessed them firsthand. Astonished, Shang revered him as a teacher. The Daoist then said, *\"The Way of immortals is not easily attained.\"* As dusk fell, Shang returned to his lodging, while the Daoist descended the tower and vanished without a trace. Shang was all the more astonished.\n\nThe next day, he sought the Daoist in the streets again. The Daoist was still selling medicine and, seeing Shang, rejoiced even more. Once more, he led Shang to the wine tower, where they drank deeply and conversed merrily. Producing a small medicine pouch, the Daoist playfully recited:\n*\"Should you come to Yangzhou with naught to do,*\n*We’ll embrace and mount the wine tower anew.*\n*This pouch I bestow as a parting gift—*\n*What more could you seek in a thousand years?\"*\nShang memorized the verse, and as evening fell, they parted. Thereafter, he searched for the Daoist repeatedly but never saw him again. Opening the pouch, he found a gourd wrapped in layer upon layer of paper, containing nine pills the size of sesame seeds. Following the Daoist’s oral instructions, he swallowed them and instantly felt his spirit invigorated, his hunger dispelled, his body light and buoyant. Crossing the river, he traveled to Mount Mao, then later to Zhanggong Cave in Yixing. In springtime, enamored of the scenery at Huafu Creek, he built a hut at Hufu Shoal and secluded himself in the mountains. Woodcutters still sometimes glimpse him—*\"That is Gentleman Liu of the Secretariat!\"*—yet none know where he now abides. He has become an earthbound immortal.\n\nLiu Pu\nLiu Pu, styled Gang and nicknamed Yige, was the younger brother of Zhan. Though his family was poor, he was fond of the Dao. A Daoist once passed his home and, seeing Pu, regarded him with interest. He asked, *\"Do you know the Dao?\"* *\"I do.\"*",

The Daoist asked, *\"Can you take me as your teacher?\"* Pu replied, *\"How dare I presume?\"* Thereupon he became his disciple.\n\nThe Daoist instructed him to dwell in the mountains in pursuit of the Dao, with no need for formal attire. Pu then bound his hair in a topknot and donned rough cloth, following the Daoist into Mount Luofu. Though both Pu and Zhan studied books and composed essays, Pu’s nature inclined toward lofty ideals, while Zhan’s heart yearned for glory and advancement. Pu once told Zhan, *\"I will surely fail the examinations, then wander free in the mountains and wilds. If you succeed, you will toil in the dust of the world—your aspirations will never match mine. Yet be cautious in wealth and rank; forty years hence, this shall be proven.\"* Zhan replied, *\"Immortals are distant and difficult to seek. Even Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi spared no effort, yet the halls of power lie close at hand, easily attained. Men like Ma Zhou and Zhang Jiading may yet follow in their footsteps.\"*\n\nThereafter, Pu devoted himself ever more intently to the Dao, eventually secluding himself on Mount Luofu. Zhan passed the imperial examinations, placing in the seventh year of Huichang, and repeatedly held eminent offices. Upon ascending to the rank of chief minister, he earned renown for his harmonizing governance. Soon after, he was demoted and sent southward. Stopping at Chaotai in Guangzhou, he moored his boat by the riverside. Suddenly, a youth in a topknot and rough cloth strode through the pouring rain, his clothes and shoes untouched by moisture, seeking to see Zhan. The attendants were astonished, and when asked, the youth simply said, *\"Yige has come.\"* They reported this to Zhan, who inquired about his appearance. When told, Zhan gasped in amazement and welcomed him in.\n\nPu’s countenance appeared no older than twenty, while Zhan had already withered with age. Now a disgraced official, Zhan was overwhelmed by grief and joy. Afterward, Pu admonished him: *\"We are brothers, as close as flesh and bone. The words I spoke long ago have now come to pass—forty years have passed.\"* Zhan sighed deeply and asked Pu, *\"Can I still cultivate the Dao?\"* Pu replied, *\"You have pursued honor and favor, tasked with harmonizing yin and yang. In your thoughts and actions, how could you avoid harm?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Had it not been your elder brother from my own family who had already ascended as a celestial immortal, how could I have saved you? Today, I have come only to bid you farewell, not to rescue you.\" They then boarded a boat together, reminiscing about the long years of separation. One evening, Pu suddenly vanished without a trace. To this day, he is occasionally seen in the mountains of Luofu.\n\nZhan then journeyed south and died in exile.\n\n**Luo Wanxiang**\nLuo Wanxiang, whose origins are unknown, was a man of letters well-versed in astronomy and profoundly skilled in the *Book of Changes*. His conduct was noble and unconventional, and he wandered the world as a commoner. He dwelled for many years on Wangwu Mountain before traveling south to Luofu Mountain, where he sighed, *\"This is the Crimson Clarity Grotto-Heaven, where Ge Zhichuan once refined his elixirs. Though no Deng Yue remains to detain me, I shall linger here for a time.\"* Enamored of the scenery at Stone Tower, he built a hut at the mountain’s base and took up residence.\n\nFor decades, he consumed yellow essence and practiced qi absorption. Sometimes he ventured to Zengcheng or Quanshan to gather herbs by the waterside, or entered the cities of Fu and Guang to sell medicine and drink wine, his comings and goings unpredictable. A single meal of his could surpass what ten men might eat, yet at other times, he would go without food for months, oblivious to the passage of time. His body was light and agile, capable of traveling three or four hundred li in a day. When he walked slowly, even galloping horses could not overtake him. Later, he returned to his hut by Stone Tower and never emerged again, vanishing into the mountains. His ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n**Li Jue**\nLi Jue was a native of Jiangyang in Guangling. His family lived in the city, making their living as grain merchants. Though Li Jue was by nature upright and meticulous—unlike his peers—at fifteen, he began assisting his father in the trade. When his father traveled elsewhere, Li Jue managed the business alone. If someone came to buy grain, he would hand them a measure and let them serve themselves, never adjusting the price based on market fluctuations. He sought only two coins of profit per *dou*, using the earnings to support his parents. Over time, their household grew prosperous. His father, puzzled, questioned him, and Li Jue explained truthfully. His father said, *\"In our line of work, most merchants manipulate their measures—giving less when selling, taking more when buying—to seek greater profits. Though officials inspect weights and measures in spring and autumn, they can never fully eradicate the practice. I have long despised such tricks, using the same measure for both buying and selling, believing it fair. Yet even I cannot match your honesty—letting customers measure the grain themselves. Our abundance must surely be the aid of divine spirits.\"*\n\nAfter his parents passed, Li Jue, now over eighty, never abandoned the trade. Later, when another Li Jue became chancellor and was appointed military commissioner of Huainan, the grain merchant, sharing the same name, was alarmed and changed his own to *Kuan*. After the chancellor took office, he devoted himself to Daoist cultivation. One night during a fast, he dreamed of entering a grotto palace, where spring scenery unfolded in vibrant splendor—flourishing flowers, soaring phoenixes and cranes, iridescent clouds, and radiant mists—with pavilions stretching endlessly. Wandering beneath them, he saw a gleaming stone wall inscribed with golden characters listing names, including his own, each over two *chi* in length. Overjoyed, he thought, *\"Born in an enlightened age, I have held high office and risen to the rank of chancellor—surely my virtue has benefited the world? Now my name appears in this grotto-heaven; I must be an immortal!\"* As he exulted, two immortal youths emerged from either side of the stone wall. Li Jue asked, *\"What place is this?\"* They replied, *\"The Grotto-Heaven of Huayang.\"* *\"This name is not yours,\"* they added. Startled, he pressed, *\"If not mine, then whose?\"* The youths answered, *\"This is the name of a commoner from Jiangyang District.\"*\n\nUpon waking, Li Jue recalled the dream in detail, astonished. He consulted Daoist masters, but none could explain it. He then considered summoning officials from Jiangyang to inquire, but none recognized the name. Finally, he ordered a search throughout the prefectural city and its outskirts for anyone with the same name. After days of effort, the people of the streets and alleys directed him to Li Kuan, formerly known as Jue. When the chancellor heard this, he sent a carriage to welcome him into the prefectural residence, providing him with fine quarters. After fasting and bathing, the chancellor bowed to Li Kuan as his Daoist elder brother, and his entire household revered him, paying homage morning and night.\n\nLi Kuan was by nature serene and indifferent, his Daoist bearing refined and striking. His beard, over a *chi* long, was pure white and lovely. At sixty, a Daoist had taught him embryonic breathing, and he had gone without food for many years. The chancellor’s respect for him only deepened. After a month, he asked, *\"Elder brother, what Daoist arts have you mastered? What elixirs have you refined?\"* He explained his dream of the grotto-heaven and the stone wall’s inscription, adding that the immortal youths had pointed to Li Kuan’s name. Thus, he had invited him to become his teacher, hoping to receive instruction. Li Kuan demurred, claiming no knowledge of Daoist arts or elixir refinement. The chancellor pressed further, asking what practices he had undertaken. Li Kuan, a simple man unaware of cultivation, truthfully described his grain-trading life. After repeated questioning, the chancellor sighed in admiration: *\"This is a feat few ordinary men could achieve—your hidden merit is beyond compare.\"* He added, *\"Now I understand: even in wealth and honor, one’s actions may bring harm. Yet in poverty and lowliness, a sincere heart earns divine favor. Your name inscribed in the immortal registry serves as a warning to the worldly.\"* He then asked about Li Kuan’s embryonic breathing and fasting, to which Li Kuan answered honestly. The chancellor began practicing embryonic breathing under his guidance.\n\nLater, Li Kuan lived to over a hundred, his body extraordinarily light and agile. One day, he told his descendants, *\"I have lingered in this world for many years. Though I have nurtured my qi, it brings no benefit to you.\"* That night, he passed away. Three days later, his coffin split open. When they opened it, his clothes and belt remained untied, like the molted shell of a cicada—he had achieved liberation in death.",

At over thirty years of age, none knew of his Daoist inclinations. He often took great delight in catching large fish, which he would bludgeon to death, boil, and eat with pounded garlic and chives, declaring there was no greater joy.\n\nOne day, as he poled his fishing boat into the river, singing loudly with his oar raised, he had rowed several *li* when he suddenly saw a painted pleasure barge adorned with colorful flowers drifting in the current. Aboard were seven Daoists, all youths, their jade crowns draped in rosy clouds, each clad in robes of different hues. More than ten attendants with cloud-like topknots stood by, along with four others in yellow caps steering the vessel. One called out Wang Kejiao’s name. Startled, he did not notice his fishing boat had already drawn near the barge. A Daoist ordered the attendants to bring Kejiao aboard. Before the seven, each had a green jade tray, their wine vessels and fruits all luminous and translucent—none of which Kejiao recognized. Over a dozen female musicians held instruments at the ready.\n\nKejiao stood at a distance at the end of the feast, bowing humbly to the seven.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, one among the seven took two chestnuts from the tray, and the attendant brought them to Kejiao, bidding him eat. He examined them: their husks were green and red, gleaming like dates, each about two inches long. When he bit into one, he found a pit inside—unlike any chestnut of the mortal world—its flesh crisp and sweet. After a long while, he had finished them both.\n\nOne of the seven said, *\"Wang Kejiao has beheld what he was meant to see. Let him depart.\"* They ordered a yellow-robed attendant to escort him ashore. There, by the side of the boat, he searched for his fishing vessel but found it gone. The yellow-robed one said, *\"No need for your boat. Simply close your eyes, and you will arrive.\"* He did as told, and as he shut his eyes, he heard the rushing of wind, water, and rustling trees. When bidden to open them again, he had already reached his destination.\n\nUpon opening his eyes, the yellow-robed attendant had vanished. Before him stretched layered peaks and ridges, towering pines and parasol trees. He sat upon a stone by the roadside and soon saw a gatehouse, with people coming and going. Presently, a group of woodcutters and over a dozen monks approached, asking who he was. Kejiao recounted all that had passed. They asked, *\"When did you leave home?\"* He replied, *\"This very morning.\"* They pressed, *\"What is today’s date?\"* *\"The third day of the third month,\"* he answered. The woodcutters and monks exclaimed in shock, *\"Today is the ninth day of the ninth month—more than half a year has passed since the third day of the third month!\"*\n\nKejiao asked, *\"Where is this place?\"* The monks said, *\"This is before the Waterfall Temple on Mount Tiantai.\"* He inquired further, *\"How far is it from here to Huating?\"* They replied, *\"Over a thousand li by land and water.\"* Kejiao marveled in disbelief. The monks invited him back to the temple and offered him food, but he only claimed to be full, showing no desire for the smell of food—drinking only water. The monks questioned him closely, astonished by his account, and reported the matter to Tangxing County, which forwarded it to Taizhou, where it reached the ears of Prefect Wang Feng.\n\nWang Feng, a devout follower of the Dao, summoned Kejiao and found the tale extraordinary, declaring, *\"The transformations of immortals and gods are unfathomable.\"* Kejiao stood over seven feet tall, his bearing and appearance uncommon, his speech clear and spirited. Feng sighed, *\"This is truly a perfected one.\"* Sharing the same surname, he held Kejiao in even higher regard, presenting him with Daoist robes and sending envoys to Suzhou to inquire after his household.\n\nThey returned with the full account: on the third day of the third month, Kejiao had taken his fishing boat onto the river and never returned. His family had found the boat and, fearing he had drowned, held a funeral for him, his wife and children having already performed the rites of summoning his soul. Wang Feng memorialized the matter to the throne, and an imperial edict praised its marvel. Later, Kejiao returned to his hometown and recounted all that had happened in vivid detail. When he went with villagers to the river, he pointed to the very spot where he had encountered the flower-adorned boat—it remained unchanged.\n\nAfter eating the chestnuts, Kejiao had ceased to eat grain. His movements seemed aided by unseen forces, and he no longer tilled the land or fished. Instead, he took his wife and children to the Four Bright Mountains. Over twenty years later, he reappeared in Mingzhou, selling medicine and sending others to buy wine. The money he earned he gave away to others. He claimed his medicine had been taught by Master Hu, and his wine passed down by the Alchemical Mother of Yuhang. His remedies cured illnesses swiftly, and his wine intoxicated deeply. The people of Mingzhou’s streets and alleys spoke of Immortal Wang’s medicine and wine, saying nothing in the world compared to them. Daoists and laypeople alike painted his likeness, and those afflicted by ailments or malevolent spirits found relief when his image was placed beside them.\n\nOver thirty years later, he returned to the Four Bright Mountains and was never seen again, though some still claim to catch glimpses of him.",

During a banquet, they asked him, “Born in an age of great peace, why do you not seek honor and emolument but remain in common cloth for so long?” He replied, “I do not serve the world’s summons, and even if summoned, I would not accept.” Then he slowly recited:\n\n*Born into a Confucian family in times of peace,\nThe profound and mysterious weighs heavy, while common cloth feels light.\nWho would chase worldly paths for fame and gain?\nI serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nYuan and Bai marveled at his words, entertaining him with poetry and wine for over a year before he departed to wander elsewhere, his whereabouts unknown.\n\nIn the gengzi year of Emperor Xizong’s reign, after Huang Chao’s rebellion breached the capital, the realm was thrown into turmoil, though the lands south of the Yangtze remained somewhat stable. The military governor of Wanling, Tian Tou, was devoted to the Dao and its guardians. Fifty years earlier, elders in Wanling who had known Sheng as children recalled him, noting that his appearance had not changed from that time—people found this most extraordinary. Tian thus invited him, treating him with even greater reverence as a teacher. His complexion was radiant, his movements nimble, as if he were only a little over forty.",

      "translated_text": "His hair and beard were jet-black, his pupils square, his teeth sharp and even, like rows of jujube pits. He favored eating stone lotuses, crunching through a *sheng* in moments, snapping each into two halves—something no one could imitate. He could drink two *dou* of wine without getting drunk. Abstaining from grain to cultivate his *qi*, he wore only a single layer of clothing in snow yet his complexion grew ever more ruddy. At times, he would point his middle finger at a lamp, and from over a *zhang* away, the flame would flicker as if blown by the wind. No one knew what elixirs he consumed. When asked about the arts of the Dao and the secrets of longevity, he would deflect with evasive words. Suddenly, he told others: *\"I weary of this world’s endless wars and strife—better to depart.\"* At the time, Emperor Zhaozong had been usurped by Zhu Quanzhong, and Sheng, hearing this, was indignant. The next day, he abruptly ceased breathing, his complexion unchanged. When they lifted him into the coffin, only his empty robes remained. He had lived for one hundred forty-one or forty-seven years. Less than a month later, Tian Tou’s forces were defeated, and disaster befell Sheng—yet he had already sensed it and gone. He had once spoken of this to others, and all who heard it marveled, calling him a sage. Later, many claimed to have seen him in Shu.\n\n---\n\nYe Qianzhao, styled Luzhong, was a native of Jianchang in Hongzhou. In his youth, he studied under the Daoist masters Xu Hao and Er Zhenjun of West Mountain, practicing grain abstention and *qi* cultivation. Once, while dwelling alone in the mountains, a sudden storm arose with thunder and lightning. A man in white robes bowed to Qianzhao, saying: *\"Your virtue and power are perfected, and the immortal registers have honored you with promotion. You shall command ghosts and spirits among men, achieving even greater merits. Now, divine beings are about to descend—you may meet them without fear.\"* Thereupon, Qianzhao burned incense, clasped his hands in silence, and sat. Soon, a crimson-robed immortal descended from the clouds, accompanied by over ten divine generals, all bearing swords and tiger-tally tokens, leading a vast host of ghosts and spirits. Two officials in yellow and green robes each held a scroll. The generals arrayed themselves and bowed to Qianzhao. The immortal said: *\"Heaven commands that you receive these scrolls. The generals, officials, and soldiers are at your service to aid the world.\"* Qianzhao bowed and accepted the celestial writ. As he unrolled the scroll, it resembled a mortal military register. The officials managed the records, and whenever he summoned them, they obeyed instantly.\n\nThereafter, a long whistle from him would stir winds through the valleys; a sigh over water would summon rain across the plains; stamping his foot would rumble thunder through the earth; and tracing his hand through the air would flash lightning before men’s eyes. He wandered the world like a madman, often drunk and reeling through the streets. Yet when he suddenly roared with authority, those who asked why were told: *\"I see a fire here, a drought there—I summon rain to save them.\"* People verified his claims, and indeed, his powers held true. Passing through prefectures and counties, he was often begged to relieve droughts. Qianzhao would prepare an incense table, pray, and rain would fall in moments. If someone requested thunder, he would stamp his foot, and a deep rumble would rise from the earth like the roar of a dragon. When excessive rain refused to cease, he was asked to stop it—he would perform a ritual, and the skies would clear. In winter droughts, when snow was begged for, Qianzhao would stand barefoot in the sun, clad only in a single robe, and whistle. Soon, winds and clouds would gather, and snow would fall through the night.\n\nHe also used talismans to heal suffering, not waiting for pleas—wherever he saw illness, he pitied and cured it. Those afflicted by malevolent spirits would recover merely upon hearing his name. Those who received his talismans never suffered relapse. In the eleventh year of the *Xiantong* era, he traveled to Haozhou, where he heard that the prefect, Liu Fang, had suddenly suffered a stroke and lay near death, beyond the skill of physicians. Qianzhao entered the prefecture with his staff, declaring: *\"By my coming, the governor shall live again.\"* He inscribed three talismans, affixing them to Fang’s shoulder, face, and leg, saying: *\"Drive the wind out through the feet—he will recover in three days.\"* Indeed, a rushing wind exited through Fang’s soles, and after three days, he was restored to health.\n\nFang was a learned man, long devoted to the Dao. Having governed with benevolence, he told his guests and officials: *\"I have followed the Dao all my life, yet suddenly struck by this violent wind, I was swiftly saved by a sage. Dong Feng restored Shi Xie’s soul—perhaps I may be his companion. Truly, this is the reward of the Dao’s power.\"* The people of the prefecture revered Qianzhao. Fang welcomed him to his residence, wishing to take him as a teacher and offering gold and silk in gratitude. Qianzhao abruptly left, and when they searched for him, no trace remained. Later, people in Jing and Xiang saw him, laughing as he recounted the events in Haozhou. Over a decade later, he returned to seclusion on West Mountain, though some still claim to see him.\n\n---\n\nThe Angler Xu, whose name is unknown, called himself a native of Penglai in the Eastern Sea. His speech was refined, often citing histories and classics. Quick-witted and eloquent, he would recite:\n*\"I saw the First Emperor build his stone bridge,\nThe sea god rushed, swelling the tides in fright.\nThough Penglai across the waves may be hard to reach,\nAscending the Three Clarities is not so far.\"*\n\nHe always carried a gourd at his waist, poling a small boat along the shores of Ezhu, upstream to the Three Xiang Rivers, and downstream through the Five Lakes. Often, he would trade fish at riverside markets for wine, drinking and conversing before departing. White-haired enthusiasts who had known him for decades said his appearance never changed. If someone playfully detained him, specifying the type, size, and weight of fish desired, he would catch them precisely as requested—all marveled at this. When he saw someone ill, he would take medicine from his gourd to cure them. The pills were the size of sesame seeds; he forbade ingestion, only allowing them to be ground in wine and applied to the chest and abdomen, whereupon the illness would vanish—his remedies were unfailingly effective.\n\nIf asked whether the medicine could be taken orally, he would say: *\"It can, but once swallowed, you’ll loathe rice.\"* A Daoist devotee who took one pill went without food for a decade, though he still drank wine and water freely. His complexion grew ever more radiant, his teeth and hair unaging.",

Even now, fishermen on rivers and lakes sometimes glimpse him—when pursued, his boat speeds away like the wind, impossible to approach, for he is a water immortal.\n\nQian Lang, styled Neiguang, was a native of Hongzhou’s Nanchang. In his youth, he studied on West Mountain, becoming a refined scholar. Through diligent discipline and steadfast integrity, he passed the Five Classics examination and held successive official posts, earning renown for his purity and uprightness. Wherever he served, he left behind fond memories, and his contemporaries praised him. During Emperor Wenzong’s reign, he served as Vice Commissioner of Nan’an, later as Minister of the Imperial Household, before retiring to Mount Lu. Deeply devoted to the Dao, he became a disciple of a Daoist from the Eastern Peak, mastering the arts of replenishing the brain, restoring primordial qi, and refining elixirs for longevity.\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, Qian Liu, Prince of Pengcheng of Qiantang, admired Lang’s attainment of the Dao and long life. He welcomed him to Qiantang, treating him with reverence and earnest devotion. By then, Lang was already over one hundred and fifty years old, yet his complexion remained youthful, his step light and vigorous.

Seeing Chengzhen about to return to Mount Tiantai, Zangyong pointed to Zhongnan and said, *\"This mountain holds many fine places—why must you go to Tiantai?\"* Chengzhen slowly replied, *\"From what I observe, this is but a shortcut to officialdom.\"* Zangyong flushed with shame.\n\nEmperor Minghuang decreed that an altar chamber be built on Mount Wangwu to house him. Chengzhen excelled in seal and clerical scripts, and his *\"golden scissors\"* calligraphy formed a style of its own. The emperor commanded him to transcribe the *Laozi* in three scripts and to collate its text. He once forged a *\"Containing-Image Mirror\"* and a *\"Quaking-Light Sword\"* as offerings. The emperor dispatched the Minister of Rites, Wei Tao, to his residence to establish a shrine with golden locks, bestowing generous gifts.\n\nUpon returning from his Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, the emperor asked Chengzhen, *\"Which deities preside over the Five Peaks?\"* Chengzhen replied, *\"The peaks are the great mountains of the realm, capable of summoning clouds and sending down rain, serving as the nation’s beacons. Yet immortals dwell there, and separate immortal officials govern them.\"* Thereupon, the emperor decreed that separate temples for immortal officials be established at the Five Peaks.\n\nAt that time, the female immortal Jiao Jingzhen crossed the sea to Penglai in search of a master. Arriving at a mountain, she encountered a Daoist who pointed and said, *\"On Mount Tiantai, Sima Chengzhen’s name is inscribed on the cinnabar terrace, and he resides in the Red City—he is a true master.\"* Jingzhen returned and sought ordination from Chengzhen.

The emperor posthumously bestowed upon him the title of Grand Master for Closing Rectification, Silver and Azure Radiance, and Grand Master of the Orthodox Unity. The emperor personally inscribed his stele, while Wei Qumou composed his biography.

A man had a daughter, over twenty years of age, betrothed to be married, when suddenly a malevolent entity possessed her. Every treatment worsened her condition. Her father sought out Dexiu and described her illness in full. Dexiu asked, *\"Does your home lie near a mountain stream? Is there a deep pool or cave nearby?\"* The father replied there was. Dexiu continued, *\"In spring, your daughter strolled by the stream and was spied by a flood dragon, which has seized her essence and spirit, confining them in its lair. Take this talisman and cast it into the pool—soon you will see proof.\"* After the talisman was thrown, the pool’s waters churned violently, erupting with thunderous roars. Moments later, a creature surfaced—over twenty feet long, shaped like a black serpent, its head as large as a great ladle, its skull split open, blood streaming as it perished.

      "translated_text": "Lüqiu Fangyuan studied the *Book of Changes* under Chen Yuanwu of Mount Lu. At twenty-nine, he sought the Great Elixir from Zuo Yuanze of Fragrant Grove. Yuanze marveled at him and said to Fangyuan: *\"Have you not heard Laozi’s words: ‘My greatest affliction is that I have a body’? The body arises from non-action and becomes entangled in action; now, returning to the root is called non-action. Non-action means that to speak of ‘non-being’ is to cling to emptiness, while to speak of ‘being’ is to create obstruction. Clinging to either being or non-being results in stagnation. Only when being and non-being are unified, and the mind is utterly serene, can one approach the Dao. Moreover, the Buddhists take this as the essence of Chan, and Yanzi practiced it as ‘sitting in forgetfulness.’ The *Book of Changes* says: ‘No thought, no action; still and unmoving, yet responding and penetrating all things under heaven.’ Their principles converge as one. The *Classic* also states: ‘When you seek to meet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear.’ What is this thing? If you silently comprehend and spiritually realize it, what more could you seek? What a pity—your talent and capacity are lofty; you could truly become a beacon for the gate of the Real.\"*\n\nFangyuan bowed deeply in gratitude and departed. He then journeyed to Hidden Truth Cliff in Mount Xiandu, where he served Liu Chujing and studied the arts of cultivating the Real and transcending the world. At thirty-four, he received the dharma register and esoteric instructions from Ye Cangzhi at Jade Cloud Palace on Mount Tiantai, who transmitted to him all the secret methods of the true scriptures. In his spare time from guarding the One and practicing qi-circulation, Fangyuan devoted himself to the study of masters and histories, as well as ancient texts. Whenever he opened a scroll, he read it through once, committing it all to memory. He often remarked: *\"Ge Zhichuan and Tao Zhenbai are my teachers and friends.\"*\n\nHe abridged the *Scripture of Great Peace* into thirty chapters, distilling its essentials, and his reputation spread ever wider throughout the Jiang-Huai region. In the second year of Jingfu during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Qian Liu, the Prince of Pengcheng from Qiantang, deeply admired Fangyuan’s virtue and Dao. He sought him out at Great Cleansing Grotto in Yuhang and built him a residence to dwell in. Emperor Zhaozong repeatedly summoned him, but Fangyuan, having divined through celestial patterns that the land of Qin would soon become overgrown with brambles and the Tang mandate was destined to change, followed the example of Boyi and Shuqi, refusing to leave the mountains and forests and declining the imperial call. The emperor then issued an edict of praise, bestowing upon him official robes and the titles *Master of Wondrous Being* and *Master of Mystic Unity*, charging him to propagate the Daoist teachings and enlighten the benighted. His numinous deeds became widely known in Wu and Chu.\n\nFrom then on, disciples came to study under him from near and far. He had over two hundred followers, among whom Xia Yinyan of Kuaiji, Dai Yinyu of Qiao, Zheng Yinyao of Rongyang, Ling Yinzhou of Wu, Sheng Yinlin of Guangling, and Zhang Yinzhi of Wudu all mastered the essentials of the Dao and ascended to its inner sanctum. Guangping’s Cheng Zixiao answered a summons to the Qin court, while Xin’an’s Nie Shidao taught in the state of Wu. Anding’s Hu Qianguang and Lu’s Kong Zonglu, along with ten others, all received the subtle principles of refining the spirit through contemplation of the Real. Others drew close to the sagely teachings or concealed themselves in famous mountains, their names no longer recorded.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the second month in the second year of Tianfu, he bathed, burned incense, and sat upright in meditation. He awaited the hour of noon and departed. His complexion remained joyful and at ease, his limbs supple and natural. An extraordinary fragrance lingered for three days without dissipating. His disciples, following custom, prepared him for burial and placed him in a coffin—only to find his clothes empty, his body having achieved liberation. He was interred beside White Deer Mountain near Great Cleansing Grotto. Later, both Daoists and laypeople repeatedly saw him on Mount Xiandu and Mount Lu, where he declared: *\"I have left Great Cleansing Grotto to return to seclusion at Heavenly Pillar Source in Mount Lan.\"*\n\n**Nie Shidao**\nNie Shidao, styled Tongwei, was a native of She in Xin’an.",

      "translated_text": "Nie Shidao was by nature intelligent, pure, and forthright, his words and deeds marked by humility and prudence. He cared for his parents with such filial devotion that he became renowned for it, earning deep respect from his village. In his youth, he served as a disciple to the elder cousin of Fangwai Lang Dehui. When Dehui, having left his post as a provincial administrator, assumed governorship of Xin’an, he selected a scenic spot on the eastern mountain of the prefecture to build a retreat, naming it the *Wenzheng Mountain Lodge*. Shidao attended to him with diligent devotion.\n\nAt thirteen, he donned the cap and robes of a Daoist adept. At fifteen, he received the transmission of the dharma register and the essentials of cultivating the True. Later, he traveled to the mountains of Jixi. He once remarked that after reading the *Inner Transmission*, he had learned the method of consuming pine resin. Together with his fellow Daoists, he ascended Mount Baizhang to gather it. The cliffs there soared a hundred *zhang* high, hence the mountain’s name. From its summit, the four directions stretched upward for over a thousand *ren*. One night, they lodged beneath a pine atop the cliff. The sky was clear, the moon bright, when suddenly celestial music arose from the southeast, borne upon purple clouds. Slowly it approached, lingering longer than the music heard at Shijin Mountain. Though Shijin and Baizhang were of equal height, and though thirty *li* of flatland separated them, their peaks stood so close that one could almost converse across the distance—yet the music seemed to drift toward Shijin first. After a while, three rolls of a small drum sounded, followed by the harmonious resonance of metal, stone, pipes, and strings, their melodies intertwining with the rhythmic beat of drums. The tune was unrecognizable, its notes soaring and pure, unlike any mortal music. The music continued from the third watch until the cock’s crow before fading.\n\nLater, when he asked those at the mountain’s base, they too had heard it that night. His companions sighed in wonder: *\"Just as we gathered the numinous medicine, we suddenly heard celestial music—could this not be a response to our sincerity? This is surely an auspicious omen of your attainment of the Dao.\"*\n\nThereafter, he journeyed to Mount Nanyue, where he paid homage at the Jade Clarity Altar and the altars of Radiant Heaven and Azure Jade. Later, at the *Langzhao Immortal’s Abode*, he entered the *Cave of Numinous Source*. It was spring, and he heard that the former dwelling of the Perfected One Cai was not far off, where extraordinary flowers and trees grew. Woodcutters occasionally glimpsed the Perfected One Cai in the vicinity. Delighted, Shidao abstained from grain for seven days. At dawn, he set out alone into the mountains. As he walked slowly, he caught the scent of rare blossoms and, lost in thought, did not notice the approach of dusk. Suddenly, he found himself beside a great stream, where a woodcutter sat by the water’s edge on the sand.\n\nEager to draw near, Shidao saw the woodcutter shoulder his load of firewood and prepare to descend to the stream. Turning back, the woodcutter paused, leaning on his staff, and asked: *\"Where are you going alone?\"* Shidao replied: *\"I seek the Dao and search for immortals, my heart set earnestly upon it. I have heard that the Perfected One Cai dwells in these mountains and wish to pay my respects.\"* The woodcutter said: *\"The abode of Master Cai lies deep within—no one can reach it.\"* Shidao replied: *\"I have climbed vines and scaled cliffs to come this far. If there is a path through the mountains, why should I fear the distance?\"* The woodcutter said again: *\"Night is falling. Go on your way. Beyond this mountain to the east, there are households where you may lodge.\"*\n\nShidao wished to follow the woodcutter, but the man suddenly stepped into the stream, where the water was shallow. When Shidao entered, however, the current ran deep and swift, and he dared not cross. The woodcutter said: *\"You will not be able to cross this stream for another fifty years.\"* He watched as the woodcutter waded across the water and vanished from sight.\n\nShidao turned back toward the east and walked over ten *li* before spotting in the distance three thatched huts surrounded by a fence, with chickens and dogs nearby. As he drew closer, he saw a man of thirty, his complexion pale, who appeared to be a farmer living alone. The man was startled to see Shidao traveling alone in the deep mountains. He asked: *\"Where have you come from?\"* Shidao replied: *\"I seek the dwelling of the Perfected One Cai.\"* The man asked: *\"Did you meet a woodcutter on the way?\"* Shidao said: *\"Yes.\"* The man said: *\"That was Master Cai Daozhe passing by just now.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this, Shidao bowed in reverence and lamented: *\"A fool like me failed to recognize a sage—such is my fate.\"* Night had fallen, and the mountain forest was pitch black, with no place to seek shelter. The man asked again: *\"Where have you come from?\"* Shidao recounted in full his journey from Xin’an in search of the True. The man then permitted him to enter his hut. He gestured for Shidao to sit by the hearth near the bed, saying: *\"I have run out of food in the mountains and have gone to fetch some, but have not yet returned.\"* Shidao said: *\"I have abstained from grain for some time and no longer think of food.\"* Beside the fire, he saw a pot of boiling water and several yellow porcelain jars. The man said: *\"The contents of the jars are edible—help yourself.\"* Shidao lifted the lid of one jar to find tea inside. The man said: *\"Pour the hot water and drink.\"* When he did, the flavor was unlike any ordinary tea.\n\nAfter some time, he wished for more tea. He tried to open another jar, but it would not budge. He attempted the others, but none would open. Shidao marveled inwardly that this did not seem like the home of a villager, though he dared not speak of it. The man retired to another room to sleep and did not rise even as the sun climbed high. With no lamp or candle, he called out from his bed: *\"This is a lonely place. If I suddenly fall ill, I will have nothing to offer you. There are many households in the village ahead—you should go there.\"*\n\nShidao walked several *li* but saw no sign of human habitation, only perilous cliffs. He turned back, only to find he had lost the way to his previous lodging. After walking another thirty *li* or so, he suddenly encountered an old man, who greeted him with delight and invited him to sit upon a rock. The old man asked his purpose in entering the mountains, and Shidao recounted all that had transpired. The old man said: *\"Master Cai and his son both dwell in these mountains. The place where you lodged last night was the home of his son.\"* He added: *\"Your Dao-qi is strong, but your immortal bones are not yet fully formed. How can one endure hunger and thirst and remain here long?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, the old man plucked a blade of grass and handed it to Shidao—its form resembled ginger sprouts, yet it stretched over a *chi* in length. Its taste was sweet and fragrant when chewed. The old man then bade him fetch spring water. As Shidao drank, he looked up to find the old man had vanished without a trace. Overcome with grief, he sighed ceaselessly, yet after consuming the herb, he felt his *qi* and strength grow light and vigorous, surpassing even his condition upon arrival. Turning back to follow the mountain path in search of his previous lodging, he found the way blocked by brambles and vines, impassable ahead. Thus, he returned to Zhaoxian Abbey. The assembled Daoist priests greeted him with astonishment, saying: *\"Though this abbey lies near sacred peaks, the surrounding wilderness teems with beasts, and few dare travel alone. Why have you been gone for over a month? We have long feared for you.\"* Shidao replied: *\"I left only yesterday and have but spent a single night away.\"* He recounted his encounter with the woodcutter, his lodging, and the old man. The priests all sighed in wonder: *\"Though we dwell here together in study of the Dao, we have only heard of Master Cai the Perfected—never once have we been granted a glimpse. Yet you, by virtue of your destined affinity with immortality, have already met Cai and his son. As for the old man, we have heard that Master Peng the Perfected also dwells hidden in these mountains—could he not have been Master Peng? In a single day and night, you have encountered three immortals, while a month has passed in the world of men. Truly, this is the fruition of your accumulated practice.\"* Shidao marveled deeply at this.\n\nAfter residing at Zhaoxian Abbey for several more years of cultivation, his longing for his aging parents drew him home to Wen Zheng Mountain. Whenever he ventured into the mountains to gather firewood or harvest herbs, he would sometimes encounter tigers and leopards, which, upon seeing him, would lower their ears, wag their tails, and prostrate themselves upon the ground. Shidao would stroke them with his hand and call to them, whereupon they would rise and follow him. At times, he would place firewood or herbs upon their backs, and they would carry them home for him before departing. Long ago, Guo Wenju of Dadi Cave had tamed tigers in the same manner. Though the mountains near She Prefecture abounded with fierce beasts, none harmed the people—this was the influence of Shidao’s virtue. When his parents inquired about the fruits of his travels and studies, he recounted all that had transpired. Upon hearing his tale, they rejoiced, saying: *\"You have fulfilled your filial duty, and we, through the Dao, have provided for you—how fortunate we are to have such a mother!\"* This, too, was the blessing of their accumulated good fortune.\n\nLater, Shidao set out once more, this time intending to journey to Mount Nanyue and the Nine Doubts Mountains. He had long heard that Master Mei and Attendant Secretary Xiao both dwelled in seclusion on Jade Bamboo Mountain, where many had glimpsed them. Mei was none other than Mei Fu, the former magistrate of Nanchang, while Xiao was Xiao Ziyun, the son of a Liang dynasty noble who, as governor of Shuyang, had fled the chaos of Hou Jing’s rebellion with his entire family and taken refuge in the mountains. Both had attained the Dao in that place. Shidao lingered at the Pure Emptiness Abbey on Jade Bamboo Mountain, his heart filled with longing for Mei and Xiao. Three times he ventured into Yu Mu Hollow, hoping for even a single encounter, before departing with unwavering resolve.\n\nDeep in the mountains, he suddenly came upon a man clad in plain cloth and a black gauze cap, his face bearing the appearance of one around fifty. Shidao bowed in reverence and inquired of him. The man first identified himself as a wandering ascetic, then asked Shidao where he was bound. When Shidao replied that he sought Master Mei and Attendant Secretary Xiao, the ascetic said: *\"I have heard of your diligent pursuit of the Dao and your tireless pilgrimage to renowned mountains—this is no easy feat. If you wish to meet the two masters, I can guide you. Your past karma is most pure, and your name is already inscribed in the Jade Register. Though you may not yet ascend in flight, you shall surely transcend this world.\"* The ascetic continued: *\"I am Xie Tongxiu. I feared you might not recognize me, so I have revealed myself. I once dwelled on Mount Nanyue alongside Peng and Cai, having concealed myself there for three hundred years. I know you have traveled to Donglingyuan, and it was at the behest of the Lord of the Eastern Flower that I was appointed as the earth immortal overseeing the forests of Jade Bamboo Mountain, as well as the land spirit governing the territory of Pure Emptiness Abbey. Our past affinity in the Dao has allowed this meeting. However, Mei and Xiao are presently summoned by the King of the Lesser Caverns at midday and may not return soon—you cannot wait for them.\"*\n\nShidao then bowed devoutly and said: *\"A mortal of the mundane world, I have presumptuously sought the Great Dao, fixing my spirit and intent from dawn to dusk, yet I know not its essential mysteries. I drift upon the sea, unaware of its shores. Never did I dare hope to meet a Daoist master today—this is the good fortune of eons.\"* Tongxiu replied: *\"Your sincerity and devotion are deeply moving. Yet your worldly affairs remain unfinished. Let me first escort you out of the mountains to the place where I dwell.\"* After walking several *li*, they suddenly came upon two thatched huts, newly built and immaculate. Inside were a bed, a mat, a small cauldron, and a fire boiling water—all arranged as if the dwelling of a scholar, though no one was present. Tongxiu bade Shidao sit upon a wooden horse, while he himself sat upon a white stone deer. Presently, a youth with coiled horns brought a tray of tea to Shidao. After sipping it, his spirit felt refreshed and clear. Tongxiu then pointed to a shelf and instructed him to take a scroll. *\"This is the* Book of Plainness*,\"* he said. *\"Study it without ceasing, and you shall grasp its true essence.\"*\n\nShidao wished to remain and study under him, but before he could speak, Tongxiu already knew his thoughts. *\"Your parents are aged,\"* he said, *\"and though you have an elder brother who can care for them, if you wish to travel further south, this is not the time to stay. I have a disciple named Zizhi on the Nine Doubts Mountains. If you go to him, convey my message and show him the* Book of Plainness*—he will teach you its full meaning. If you do not find him, simply cast the scroll into the cave above Mao Ru Stream and inscribe my words upon the stone wall. Zizhi will then impart to you the essential Dao.\"* With that, he sent Shidao on his way. In an instant, Tongxiu vanished, and Shidao found himself outside Yu Mu Hollow, having returned to Pure Emptiness Abbey. The Daoist priests were all astonished, asking: *\"How is it that you have returned after only seven days?\"* Shidao recounted all that had occurred.\n\nTwo of the priests, overjoyed, accompanied Shidao back into Yu Mu Hollow. Upon reaching the familiar place, the rocks, trees, and grasses appeared just as before, yet the thatched huts were gone. They spent the entire day in wistful longing before returning. Shidao had obtained the *Book of Plainness*, its characters legible, all expounding the secret essentials of the Queen Mother of Mount Gui’s governance and transformation of the host of immortals.",
      "overlap_context": "*li* or so, he suddenly encountered an old man, who greeted him with delight and invited him to sit upon a rock. The old man asked his purpose in entering the mountains, and Shidao recounted all that had transpired. The old man said: *\"Master Cai and his son both dwell in these mountains. The place where you lodged last night was the home of his son.\"* He added: *\"Your Dao-qi is strong, but your immortal bones are not yet fully formed. How can one endure hunger and thirst and remain here long?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Earthbound immortals who cultivate this Way shall ascend to heaven. Mortals who receive it shall leave traces among the grotto-heavens. Yet its profound mysteries defy full comprehension.\n\nLater, Shidao journeyed south to Mount Jiu Ning’s Xiangzhen Abbey. For over a month, he inquired after Purple Ganoderma’s whereabouts, and all spoke of a reclusive scholar by a stream called Mao Ru, though none knew his name. Some claimed to have seen him. Shidao entered the mountains repeatedly in search, but finding no one, he followed Tongxiu’s instruction and left a letter inscribed upon stone.\n\nThereafter, he often dreamed of immortals calling themselves Purple Ganoderma, who resolved his doubts. Upon waking, he remained in retreat for over a year before returning to govern, dwelling there for more than thirty years. Whenever he performed incense offerings, he venerated the true forms of the Two Cais, Peng, and Xie, while compiling his own scrolls of marvels to share with Daoist and layfolk alike.\n\nLater, when Emperor Gaozu of Wu conquered the Jiang-Huai region, he heard of Shidao’s reputation and hoped his virtue might benefit the military and common folk. Summoned to Guangling, Shidao was installed in the newly built Palace of Primordial Mystery. Whenever he ascended the altar to pray for blessings—whether for rain or clear skies—he never failed to move heaven and earth, manifesting auspicious clouds and mist. Thus, the people embraced the Daoist transformation, the land became like the Realm of Huaxu, and customs were worthy of enfeoffment. Though times had changed, he was truly the Emperor’s great minister.\n\nThe court bestowed upon him the honorific titles *Master of Carefree Wandering* and *Master of Governance*, recognizing him as the nation’s preceptor. His disciples—Zou Dekuang, Wang Chunü, Yang Kuangyi, Wang Yongzhen, Cheng Shoupu, Zeng Jingxiao, Wang Keru, Cui Chanran, Du Chongzhen, Deng Qixia, and Wu Zhigu—all grasped the subtle principles, transmitted the Shangqing scriptures, and disseminated the true teachings across prefectures and commanderies. The court honored them with purple robes, illuminating the gates of the Mysterious.\n\nAmong his followers were scholars from Qin, Wu, Qi, Jing, Yan, Liang, Min, and Shu, who came in droves, enduring hardship for years in devoted service. Shidao often said to them: *\"I possess no arcane arts—why have you come from such distances?\"* His disciples replied in unison: *\"In ancient times, Master Zhang dwelled in Shu, and people from all under heaven flocked to serve him. Each was taught the Dao according to their cultivation. Even those who performed menial tasks for years eventually attained immortality. Now, we are but withered bones’ descendants, our days hastening toward decay. We seek to escape the fleeting shadow and aspire to eternal life—how could we not plead with utmost sincerity?\"*\n\nShidao received all with benevolence, never rebuffing their words. He guided each according to their nature, imparting the essentials of the Dao like dew soaking into clothing or the lingering fragrance of orchids and sandalwood clinging to the body. Thus, he resided in Guangling for thirty years, with over five hundred disciples.\n\nHaving long mastered embryonic breathing and perfected his elixir, one day Shidao announced to his disciples: *\"Just now, a black-robed, vermilion-sashed messenger informed me that the celestial officials have summoned me—I must depart.\"* Moments later, an extraordinary fragrance filled the chamber, and cranes alighted near the courtyard, as if divine spirits had gathered. Serenely, he bid farewell and transformed.\n\nWhen his disciples prepared his remains, the coffin suddenly emitted a sound. Upon inspection, they found only an empty husk—his body had dissolved like a cicada’s molted shell. They buried only his robes and cap.\n\nLater, dozens arrived from Yuzhang, claiming to have seen him traveling with a young attendant. Many Daoists and layfolk recognized him and asked: *\"Why have you journeyed so far?\"* He replied: *\"I have been away from Mount Heng for many years—this is but a brief visit.\"* He stayed at old temples and abbeys along his route before departing.\n\nHalf a year later, someone from Changsha reported a similar sighting. He was seen again on the road to Hengyang, returning to the grotto’s numinous source. Woodcutters said he had passed by the stream fifty years earlier—just as foretold.\n\nIn truth, he was a companion of the Two Cais, Peng, and Xie. Concealing his transformations and departing, he left the world longing—such is the way of immortals.\n\nNearly twenty years later, cranes and auspicious clouds frequently appeared above Mount Wen Zheng, circling as far as his hometown in She. His kin and clan believed Shidao had returned, like the verification of Master Lingwei’s crane. His disciples, including Fan Kebao and dozens more, unearthed his buried robes and cap, relocating them to the southern slope of Mount Wen Zheng. They recorded the circumstances in detail and reported them to the throne.\n\nAn imperial edict was issued, stating: *\"Upon review of posthumous honors, let this be established as eternal precedent.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The common folk say she is the Flower Spirit. Thus, all cherish and protect the tree, and its blossoms flourish with unmatched splendor. When the flowers are about to bloom, scouts announce their progress in stages, and officials and guests gather daily for feasts of admiration. Later, the entire city—scholars, commoners, and travelers from afar—would revel in celebration, from spring into summer, from dawn till dusk, until the streets nearly abandoned all work.\n\nOne day, Bao said to Seven-Seven, \"The flowers of Helin Temple are the world’s most wondrous. I’ve heard you can make flowers bloom in an instant—could you do the same for these?\" Seven-Seven replied, \"I can.\" Bao said, \"The Double Ninth Festival is near. Can you make them bloom by then?\" Two days prior, Seven-Seven went to Helin Temple and spent the night.\n\nAt midnight, a woman appeared and asked Seven-Seven, \"Does the Daoist wish to make these flowers bloom?\" Seven-Seven asked, \"Who are you, coming here so late at night?\" The woman said, \"I was sent by the Supreme Mystery to oversee these flowers. Yet they have lingered among mortals for over a century—soon, they will be summoned to the Celestial Gardens. Today, I shall bloom them with you. Without you, I could not have been moved.\"\n\nThen, in an instant, the woman vanished. The next morning, the monks were astonished to see the buds slowly unfurling. By the ninth day, the blossoms blazed as brilliantly as in spring, and word reached Bao. The entire city—scholars and commoners alike—marveled, and the revelry resumed as in spring and summer. After several days, the flowers suddenly vanished, with no petals left upon the ground.\n\nSeven-Seven happened to visit the home of an official, arriving just as a banquet was underway. The host and guests rose to greet and honor him. Among them were entertainers and jesters who mocked and belittled him. Seven-Seven addressed the host: \"May I propose a game with two chestnuts?\" They all agreed, expecting some amusing diversion. As the chestnuts were passed around, each recipient detected a strange fragrance and gasped in wonder. Only the two who had laughed at Seven-Seven were transformed into stone, which clung to their noses, stubbornly refusing to fall. They complained of an unbearable stench. The two began to dance wildly, their hairpins scattering, tears streaming down their faces as powder and rouge mingled. The performers, too, broke into chaotic dance, while the drums and music played of their own accord, perfectly in rhythm. When the music stopped, the dancing continued, and the entire gathering collapsed in laughter.\n\nAfter some time, they begged Seven-Seven for mercy. Soon, the stone fell from their noses, reverting to chestnuts. When passed around again, the same fragrance lingered. The hairpins, powder, and rouge were restored to their original state, untouched. From then on, all treated Seven-Seven with reverence.",

From childhood, he was bright and quick-witted; as he grew, he delved deeply into the classics and histories, his memory sharp, answering all questions without fail. His compositions were elegant and refined. His father instructed him in the pursuit of the imperial examinations, but Qiao had no interest in such a path. Instead, he was drawn to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the various masters, and the *Inner Biographies* of King Mu of Zhou, Emperor Wu of Han, Lord Mao, and the immortals—studying each with meticulous care.\n\nOne day, he informed his father of his intent to travel to Mount Zhongnan. His father, considering the mountain’s proximity to the capital, granted permission. From Zhongnan, he journeyed to Mounts Taibai, Taihang, Wangwu, Song, Hua, and Tai, wandering through renowned mountains without returning home. His father sent letters reproaching him in detail, to which Qiao replied: \"Lord Mao, too, was once a son who left his father to study the Dao. Now I follow his example, hoping it may bring some benefit.\" His father, recognizing his unwavering devotion to the Way, thought it futile to restrain him with worldly affairs and so allowed him to follow his own path.\n\nQiao studied under a Daoist on Mount Song for over a decade, mastering the arts of fasting and cultivating qi. He took joy only in wine, often wandering in a drunken haze, going wherever the wind carried him. In summer, he wore a black fur robe; in winter, a green cloth shirt. Sometimes he spent entire days exposed to wind, frost, or snow. People assumed he had perished, but when they looked closely, his breath flowed gently. His father, ever mindful of him, frequently sent servants to seek him out, always sending clothes and money in spring and winter. Qiao would receive them with delight, then promptly send the servants back with generous gifts. No sooner had they departed than he would take the clothes his father had sent into the streets, giving them to the poor and needy, or leaving them at taverns—keeping nothing for himself.\n\nWhen asked why he acted thus, he replied: \"How could I bear to keep them?\"",

Thereafter, he entered water yet remained dry, walked through fire yet felt no burn, and could conceal his form or shift his shape. He then entered Mount Qingcheng and was seen no more.\n\n**Du Sheng**\nDu Sheng, styled Keyun, claimed to be a native of Duling in Jingzhao. No one could fathom his age. He ate nothing, yet could drink three *dou* of wine without growing drunk. His complexion was radiant, as if a man of thirty. He wore a square kerchief and a tattered cloth cap, and in winter, a green cloth shirt. His speech was lofty, his learning profound. If someone offered him a new cloth shirt, he would accept it, yet refuse to remove his old one. The new shirt he would give away upon leaving the door, meeting whomever he encountered in the streets. He wandered the markets, drunk and roaming, asking questions as he went.\n\nSkilled in \"sand writing,\" he would trace the character for \"dragon\" in bowls or basins of water, the strokes floating and swirling. At his command, the dragon would rise into the air, over a *zhang* high, vanishing into mist like a wisp of cloud before resuming its small form. When called, it would descend back into the water. In an instant, he could earn much coin, which he would then scatter among the poor or leave at taverns. Day after day, he did this wherever he went, and though people grew weary of giving, none ever tired of him. Some suspected him of bewitching the crowd.\n\nIn winter, he would remain in the snow for two or three days, and people would assume him frozen stiff. Yet when they brushed him off, he would rise slowly, shake off the snow, and walk away as if waking from a drunken slumber—his breath warm as summer, his demeanor that of one roused from a deep sleep.\n\nDu Nuru, son of Duke Zong of Deng, was serving as governor of Suzhou when he heard that Keyun was in the city. Overjoyed, he invited him into the prefectural hall and bowed to him, addressing him as \"Daoist Master.\" The officials and guests were all astonished. Nuru explained: \"When my late father governed Xichuan, he was deeply acquainted with this Daoist elder, who often visited his study. At the time, I was only ten years old, and now I am over fifty. Forty years have passed since we parted, yet his appearance and bearing remain unchanged.\" He then kept Keyun in the prefectural residence, seeking his counsel on the Daoist arts.\n\nKeyun said: \"Simply govern with virtue and care for the people. Be compassionate in your rule. Given the turmoil of these times, one must first preserve oneself before casting off the dust of the world and retiring to the wilds. How can one avoid the scourge of war? The Way of the Dao is vast—who can fathom it?\"\n\nWhenever Keyun entered the prefectural hall, Nuru would offer him money and silk, which Keyun would refuse. Yet once outside the city gates, he would distribute it all to others. Nuru’s reverence for him only deepened. Sometimes Keyun would drink with Nuru’s guests and officials, composing verses in response to their songs. His words flowed effortlessly, profound and rich with immortal themes, leaving others unable to match him.\n\nLater, when war broke out, Nuru was indeed killed by soldiers. Keyun was also seen wounded, his old cloth shirt torn in three or four places, the tatters lying on the ground. Yet days later, many reported seeing him crossing the Song and Zhe Rivers, passing through Hangzhou, Yue, and Qu, then appearing in the markets of Jiangxi, drunk as ever, writing dragons in the sand. A year later, someone saw him in Hunan and asked about Suzhou. He recounted events in vivid detail, as if he had witnessed them himself. Then, laughing, he said: \"I once dwelt on Mount Nanyue. I have lingered in the world long enough—soon I shall return.\" After that, he was never seen again.

      "translated_text": "Yang Yin held office due to worldly ties and settled his family in Jinyun. Having passed the classics examination, he was appointed as the assistant magistrate of Jiajiang in Jiazhou, but later resigned and returned to Jinyun. His elder brother, Yang Chen, served as the magistrate of Le’an in Taizhou.\n\nYet Yang Yin cherished seclusion in the Kuocang Mountains. By nature serene and withdrawn, he held worldly honors in low regard, favoring instead a life of carefree wandering and a deep admiration for Daoist arts. One day, his wife suddenly died. He remarked, \"Zhuangzi played the lute after his wife’s passing—a true understanding of life’s transformations. Now that she is at peace, is it not fitting to bury her? Our sons have their callings, our daughters their marriages; she is no longer burdened.\" Later, while visiting Ruanlang Pavilion atop a cliff over ten *zhang* high, he found an inscription in seal script carved into the stone, the characters enormous. The world claimed it was a poem left by Ruan Zhao of the Han. Upon closer inspection of the weathered stone, he saw it was in fact inscribed by Li Yangbing, who had once served as magistrate of Jinyun. The poem read:\n\n*Where now does the wanderer Ruan dwell?*\n*At the mouth of the immortal’s cave, clouds drift.*\n*A place untouched by mortal tread—*\n*Today, I walk within its bounds.*\n\nYang Yin lingered by the pavilion, drinking with several Daoist priests from Jinyun Temple amid blossoming flowers. At midday, he suddenly collapsed as if dead, though his breath remained warm. Carried home, he revived after seven days. Villagers and the Daoist priests gathered to question him. He recounted: \"At first, a figure in green robes and crimson garments, who called herself Lingying, invited me into a grotto palace. There, I saw towering pavilions and soaring simurghs and cranes, the sky clear and the air balmy—unlike the mortal realm. Suddenly, from a stone crevice, an object flew out, shaped like a green parasol with a long stem. Lingying pointed and said, ‘This is the Azure Cloud Mushroom. Eat it, and you will attain immortality.’ I was ravenous and, sitting upon a rock, consumed it entirely. The taste was sweet and rich. Lingying said, ‘You were destined for immortality; today, you have met the celestial officials.’ She then led me before three figures: one in a *Yuanyou* cap, another draped in cloud and mist, and the third in formal attire, each attended by a vast retinue. Lingying named them: the Lesser Heavenly King, the Great Master of Huayang, and the Hidden Mystery Celestial Aide. I bowed to each in turn, and they all said, ‘You possess the bones of an immortal but have not yet ascended. You must cultivate further upon the earth.’ Moments later, Lingying escorted me out—through the western gate of the Kuocang Grotto. Only then did I realize where I had been.\"\n\nThereafter, Yang Yin lost his taste for grain, drinking only three *sheng* of water daily and eating a single cup of lilies. His body grew light, his joints supple, rustling like bamboo clappers when he moved. He spoke incessantly, reciting verses day and night as if conversing with unseen companions. Sometimes, he would take two or three hundred sheets of paper and fill them in an instant with dense, unrecognizable script. Yet when he read it aloud, the words formed coherent essays. Daoists and lay admirers transcribed his utterances, finding them elegant and refined, filled with allusions to immortals, Penglai, and the Isles of the Blessed. This continued for a year, his body becoming ever more lithe and vigorous. Skeptics dismissed him as bewitched by some demonic entity.\n\nTwo years later, he no longer ate lilies, subsisting on water and wine alone. After three years, his hair turned black as lacquer, his face smooth as a child’s. He moved as swiftly as if flying and could drink three *dou* of wine without intoxication. He began wearing coarse hempen robes. When asked, \"You have had no master for three years—how have you learned all this?\" he replied, \"None of this is of my own doing; it has all been taught to me by divine beings.\"\n\nLater, he visited his brother in Le’an, departing after a single day. He then traveled to Tiantai, arriving in a day’s time—covering three to four hundred *li* in a day. Returning to Xiandu, he consumed elixirs and cultivated *qi* for over twenty years. Finally, he journeyed south to Weiyu Mountain and vanished. *Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals, Volume the Lower, concludes.*",
